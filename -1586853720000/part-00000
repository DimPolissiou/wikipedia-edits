His early schooling was hampered by what he has called \"pretty severe [[dyslexia]].\" As a result, he did not learn to read until the second or third grade in [[primary school]].<ref name=\"Interview\" />\n\nPoe graduated from [[Wichita Southeast High School]] in 1980 and earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1984 at [[Grinnell College]] where he was named outstanding student in history. He earned his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1986 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in history at Berkeley in 1992.<ref name=\"CV\" />\n\nHe taught at Harvard University from 1989 to 1996 and again from 1999 to 2002, during which time he was appointed [[Allston Burr Senior Tutor]] at Harvard's [[Lowell House]] where he managed a college of 600 undergraduate students and 50 tutors and staff. He also taught at [[New York University]] (1999), [[American University]] (2005), the University of Iowa (2007-2013) and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (2013-2014).<ref name=\"CV\" />\n\nHe has held fellowships at the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard; the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; and the [[Harriman Institute]] for Russian Studies at [[Columbia University]].<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\nAt the Institute for Advanced Study, Poe played guitar and sang in a loud [[rock and roll]] band called \"Do Not Erase,\" consisting entirely of fellows at the Institute. The name of the band is taken from what mathematicians write under their long theorems and proofs on chalk boards, so that janitors won't erase them, especially if their equations have discovered something new.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~ptrapa/finalreport/CD.html|title=DNE's Final Report|publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Utah|accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nMarshall Poe's writing ranges from academic articles and books to magazine and Internet pieces intended for wider audiences. He has written extensively on Russian history as well on communications, the Internet and Wikipedia.\n\n===Russian history===\nPoe is the co-founder and a former editor of the academic journal ''[[Kritika (journal)|Kritika]]: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History.'' He is the author or editor of several books on Russia including ''A People Born to Slavery: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnography'' (2000) and ''The Russian Elite in the Seventeenth Century'' (2004).<ref name=\"Book\" /> ''The Russian Moment in World History'' (2006) is a brief, 116 page book that was written for the general public. It provides an overview of more than 1,400 years of Russian history beginning in the 6th to 9th centuries with the migration of [[Slavs]] from [[central Europe]] to the northeast. It ends with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Moment\">Poe, Marshall. (2006) ''The Russian Moment in World History''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\nPoe argues the Soviet Union did not collapse because of the failure of [[Communism]] as many pundits assert. Rather, he contends that the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] lost faith in the traditional path that had not only preserved Russian independence for almost five centuries, but had also enabled the country to build a huge [[empire]]. That path included a reliance on [[autocracy|autocratic leadership]], a [[planned economy|command economy]], tight controls on debate in the [[public sphere]] and a state-engineered military. \"Using these means,\" Poe writes, \"the Russian elite was able to take a primitive, premodern state and transform it in the course of two centuries into one of the most powerful enterprises on earth. It is difficult to see how such a thing could be seen as a failure.\"<ref name=\"Moment\" />\n\nPoe's work on Russian history has brought back from obscurity the writings of the 16th-century Austrian diplomat [[Sigismund von Herberstein]], who was one of the first European ethnographers of Russia.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/common-knowledge/305151/|title=Common Knowledge|author=Rothenberg Gritz, Jennie|magazine=The Atlantic|accessdate=2014-07-14}}</ref>\n\n===''The Atlantic''===\nFrom 2003 to 2005, Poe conducted research for ''The Atlantic'' magazine and co-wrote the regular feature \"Primary Sources.\".<ref name=\"CV\" /> A typical one, in the magazine's July/August 2005 edition, provided information on a variety of studies and reports supported by online links.

He concludes that Wikipedia's \"communal regime\" permitted rapid growth as well as organization and improvement. \"The result of this difference is there for all to see,\" he writes, \"much of the Internet is a chaotic mess and therefore useless, whereas Wikipedia is well ordered and hence very useful.\"<ref name=PoeHive />\n\nPoe's position on Wikipedia is that it's not an encyclopedia that imparts expert knowledge, but a repository of [[common knowledge]]. During an interview with [[Andrew Keen]], he argued that through a collaborative group, great things can be accomplished. \"Wikipedia is in a sense kind of [[public utility]] now. It's much more like the electric company or the water company or the public library than it is anything else and there's no reason it shouldn't exist and continue to expand alongside all kinds of other commercial ventures because it is basically built for free. I mean it's just \u2014 it's a utility that is provided to the public at almost no public cost.\" <ref>Keen, Andrew.

Retrieved from the [[Wayback Machine]] on 19 January 2013</ref>\n\n===Communications: Pull and Push===\nIn 2011, Poe published ''A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet'', a 337-page book that analyzes how media networks originate, how they function and how they shape social practices and values.<ref name=\"Book\">Poe, Marshall T. (2011) ''A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Poe explains in the book's introduction that he is seeking to expand and refine the communications theories of the late Canadian scholar [[Harold Innis]]. In his 1950 book [[Empire and Communications]], Innis conducted a sweeping historical survey of how various media influenced the rise and fall of empires from ancient to modern times.<ref>Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press.</ref>\n\nPoe advances the idea that new media are developed by inventors and tinkerers, but are not \"pulled\" into broad use until \"organized interests\" recognize their need for these new communications tools. He argues, for example, that [[audiovisual]] media such as radio, telephone, television and film were developed well before they were taken up by industrial [[capitalism|capitalists]] who needed more effective ways to market the goods they produced. Audiovisual media also served the interests of bureaucrats and politicians who gained popularity by giving citizens access to modern conveniences. \"Modern states are [[welfare state]]s,\" Poe writes, \"and welfare states make sure their citizens have things to listen to and watch.\"\n\nIn turn, audiovisual media shaped social practices and values. They \"pushed\" societies into a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] pursuit of private entertainment justified by people's need for relaxation in an otherwise stressful society. And, since [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that human beings find it easier to listen and watch than to read and write, audiovisual media caught on rapidly. \"When faced with reading a good book,\" Poe writes, \"or watching an awful TV show, most people will watch the awful TV show.\"<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\nPoe writes about five periods in media history: the age of [[speech]], the age of [[manuscript culture|manuscripts]], the age of [[printing|print]], the age of audiovisual media and the age of the [[Internet]]. He provides a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: ''accessibility'', ''privacy'', ''fidelity'', ''volume'', ''velocity'', ''range'', ''persistence'' and ''searchability''. Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because nearly everyone could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such face-to-face communication and so too was fidelity because speech can convey only sounds, not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups.<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\n===New publishing model===\nIn his 2002 essay \"Note to Self: Print Monograph Dead; Invent New Publishing Model,\" published in the ''Journal of Electronic Publishing'', Poe questioned the viability of the old [[academic publishing]] model, arguing in favor of self-publishing and [[print on demand]]. He explained how he did this with one of the two volumes of his [[prosopography|prosopographical]] study of the Russian elite in the [[early modern]] period. \"Shortly after I sent the book for review\", he writes, \"a very worried journal editor contacted me. He was upset that I hadn't included a copyright page on the e-book I sent him. Without a copyright page, he explained, any reader could copy my book, send it all over the world, or use it in the classroom &mdash; all without my permission. That, I responded, was the point.

He has written extensively on Russian history as well on communications, the Internet and Wikipedia.\n\n===Russian history===\nPoe is the co-founder and a former editor of the academic journal ''[[Kritika (journal)|Kritika]]: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History.'' He is the author or editor of several books on Russia including ''A People Born to Slavery: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnography'' (2000) and ''The Russian Elite in the Seventeenth Century'' (2004).<ref name=\"Book\" /> ''The Russian Moment in World History'' (2006) is a brief, 116 page book that was written for the general public. It provides an overview of more than 1,400 years of Russian history beginning in the 6th to 9th centuries with the migration of [[Slavs]] from [[central Europe]] to the northeast. It ends with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Moment\">Poe, Marshall. (2006) ''The Russian Moment in World History''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\nPoe argues the Soviet Union did not collapse because of the failure of [[Communism]] as many pundits assert. Rather, he contends that the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] lost faith in the traditional path that had not only preserved Russian independence for almost five centuries, but had also enabled the country to build a huge [[empire]]. That path included a reliance on [[autocracy|autocratic leadership]], a [[planned economy|command economy]], tight controls on debate in the [[public sphere]] and a state-engineered military. \"Using these means,\" Poe writes, \"the Russian elite was able to take a primitive, premodern state and transform it in the course of two centuries into one of the most powerful enterprises on earth. It is difficult to see how such a thing could be seen as a failure.\"<ref name=\"Moment\" />\n\nPoe's work on Russian history has brought back from obscurity the writings of the 16th-century Austrian diplomat [[Sigismund von Herberstein]], who was one of the first European ethnographers of Russia.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/common-knowledge/305151/|title=Common Knowledge|author=Rothenberg Gritz, Jennie|magazine=The Atlantic|accessdate=2014-07-14}}</ref>\n\n===''The Atlantic''===\nFrom 2003 to 2005, Poe conducted research for ''The Atlantic'' magazine and co-wrote the regular feature \"Primary Sources.\".<ref name=\"CV\" /> A typical one, in the magazine's July/August 2005 edition, provided information on a variety of studies and reports supported by online links.

During an interview with [[Andrew Keen]], he argued that through a collaborative group, great things can be accomplished. \"Wikipedia is in a sense kind of [[public utility]] now. It's much more like the electric company or the water company or the public library than it is anything else and there's no reason it shouldn't exist and continue to expand alongside all kinds of other commercial ventures because it is basically built for free. I mean it's just \u2014 it's a utility that is provided to the public at almost no public cost.\" <ref>Keen, Andrew.

Retrieved from the [[Wayback Machine]] on 19 January 2013</ref>\n\n===Communications: Pull and Push===\nIn 2011, Poe published ''A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet'', a 337-page book that analyzes how media networks originate, how they function and how they shape social practices and values.<ref name=\"Book\">Poe, Marshall T. (2011) ''A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Poe explains in the book's introduction that he is seeking to expand and refine the communications theories of the late Canadian scholar [[Harold Innis]]. In his 1950 book [[Empire and Communications]], Innis conducted a sweeping historical survey of how various media influenced the rise and fall of empires from ancient to modern times.<ref>Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press.</ref>\n\nPoe advances the idea that new media are developed by inventors and tinkerers, but are not \"pulled\" into broad use until \"organized interests\" recognize their need for these new communications tools. He argues, for example, that [[audiovisual]] media such as radio, telephone, television and film were developed well before they were taken up by industrial [[capitalism|capitalists]] who needed more effective ways to market the goods they produced. Audiovisual media also served the interests of bureaucrats and politicians who gained popularity by giving citizens access to modern conveniences. \"Modern states are [[welfare state]]s,\" Poe writes, \"and welfare states make sure their citizens have things to listen to and watch.\"\n\nIn turn, audiovisual media shaped social practices and values. They \"pushed\" societies into a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] pursuit of private entertainment justified by people's need for relaxation in an otherwise stressful society. And, since [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that human beings find it easier to listen and watch than to read and write, audiovisual media caught on rapidly. \"When faced with reading a good book,\" Poe writes, \"or watching an awful TV show, most people will watch the awful TV show.\"<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\nPoe writes about five periods in media history: the age of [[speech]], the age of [[manuscript culture|manuscripts]], the age of [[printing|print]], the age of audiovisual media and the age of the [[Internet]]. He provides a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: ''accessibility'', ''privacy'', ''fidelity'', ''volume'', ''velocity'', ''range'', ''persistence'' and ''searchability''. Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because nearly everyone could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such face-to-face communication and so too was fidelity because speech can convey only sounds, not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups.<ref name=\"Book\" />\n\n===New publishing model===\nIn his 2002 essay \"Note to Self: Print Monograph Dead; Invent New Publishing Model,\" published in the ''Journal of Electronic Publishing'', Poe questioned the viability of the old [[academic publishing]] model, arguing in favor of self-publishing and [[print on demand]]. He explained how he did this with one of the two volumes of his [[prosopography|prosopographical]] study of the Russian elite in the [[early modern]] period. \"Shortly after I sent the book for review\", he writes, \"a very worried journal editor contacted me. He was upset that I hadn't included a copyright page on the e-book I sent him. Without a copyright page, he explained, any reader could copy my book, send it all over the world, or use it in the classroom &mdash; all without my permission. That, I responded, was the point.

They are allowed to continue to refrain from eating the king's food, and to Daniel God gives insight into visions and dreams.

When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some important message, so he consults his wise men. Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation, the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth. Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God's kingdom, which would endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's god, raises Daniel over all his wise men, and places Daniel and his companions over the province of Babylon.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=31\u201333}}\n\n=== The fiery furnace (chapter 3) ===\n{{Main|Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego}}\nDaniel's companions Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to bow to King Nebuchadnezzar's golden statue and are thrown into a fiery furnace.

The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked\u2014or more accurately, paid\u2014to be allowed to make Jerusalem a ''[[polis]]'', or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would be in the hands of the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nAntiochus invaded Egypt twice, in 169 BC with success, but on the second incursion, in late 168 BC, he was forced to withdraw by the Romans.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Jason, hearing a rumour that Antiochus was dead, attacked Menelaus to take back the High Priesthood.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Antiochus drove Jason out of Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and introduced measures to pacify his Egyptian border by imposing complete Hellenisation: the Jewish Book of the Law was prohibited and on 15 December 167 BC an \"abomination of desolation\", probably a Greek altar, was introduced into the Temple.{{sfn|Sacchi|2004|pp=225\u2013226}} With the Jewish religion now clearly under threat a resistance movement sprang up, led by the Maccabee brothers, and over the next three years it won sufficient victories over Antiochus to take back and purify the Temple.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nThe crisis which the author of Daniel addresses is the defilement of the altar in Jerusalem in 167 BC (first introduced in chapter 8:11): the daily offering which used to take place twice a day, at morning and evening, stopped, and the phrase \"evenings and mornings\" recurs through the following chapters as a reminder of the missed sacrifices.{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=407}} But whereas the events leading up to the sacking of the Temple in 167 BC and the immediate aftermath are remarkably accurate, the predicted war between the Syrians and the Egyptians (11:40\u201343) never took place, and the prophecy that Antiochus would die in Palestine (11:44\u201345) was inaccurate (he died in Persia).{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=6\u20137}} The obvious conclusion is that the account must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164 BC, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem, and the consensus of modern scholarship is accordingly that the book dates to the period 167\u2013163 BCE.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=7}}{{sfn|Ryken|Longman|2010|p=325}}\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Songe Nabuchodonosor arbre.jpg|thumb|upright|Nebuchadnezzar's dream: the felled tree (France, 15th century).]]\n\n=== Development ===\nIt is generally accepted that Daniel originated as a collection of Aramaic court tales later expanded by the Hebrew revelations.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=42}} The court tales may have originally circulated independently, but the edited collection was probably composed in the third or early second century BC.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=34}} Chapter 1 was composed (in Aramaic) at this time as a brief introduction of  to provide historical context, introduce the characters of the tales, and explain how Daniel and his friends came to Babylon.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}} The visions of chapters 7\u201312 were added and chapter 1 translated into Hebrew at the third stage when the final book was being drawn together.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\n=== Authorship ===\nDaniel is one of a large number of Jewish apocalypses, all of them [[pseudonym]]ous.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|p=2}} The stories of the first half are considered legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] period (2nd century BC).{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}}\n\nAlthough the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, chapters 1\u20136 are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar; only the second half (chapters 7\u201312) is presented by Daniel himself, introduced by the anonymous narrator in chapters 7 and 10.{{sfn|Wesselius|2002|p=295}} The real author/editor of Daniel was probably an educated Jew, knowledgeable in Greek learning, and of high standing in his own community. The book is a product of \"Wisdom\" circles, but the type of wisdom is [[Wiktionary:mantic|mantic]] (the discovery of heavenly secrets from earthly signs) rather than the wisdom of learning\u2014the main source of wisdom in Daniel is God's revelation.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002b|pp=229\u2013230, 243}}{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=340}}\n\nIt is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|p=180}} [[Ezekiel]], who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with [[Noah]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan'el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Collins|2003|p=69}} \"The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character&nbsp;... serves as the principal human 'hero' in the biblical book that now bears his name\"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=4}}\n\n=== Dating ===\n\nThe prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus' two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BC), the desecration of the Temple (the \"abomination of desolation\"), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus' death in late 164 BC. Chapters 10\u201312 must therefore have been written between 167 and 164 BC. There is no evidence of a significant time lapse between those chapters and chapters 8 and 9, and chapter 7 may have been written just a few months earlier again.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=101}}\n\nFurther evidence of the book's date is in the fact that Daniel is excluded from the Hebrew Bible's [[Nevi'im|canon of the prophets]], which was closed around 200 BC, and the Wisdom of [[Sirach]], a work dating from around 180 BC, draws on almost every book of the Old Testament except Daniel, leading scholars to suppose that its author was unaware of it. Daniel is, however, quoted in a section of the [[Sibylline Oracles]] commonly dated to the middle of the 2nd century BC, and was popular at Qumran at much the same time, suggesting that it was known from the middle of that century.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter [[Masoretic Text]] and in two longer Greek versions, the original [[Septuagint]] version, c. 100&nbsp;BC, and the later [[Theodotion]] version from c. 2nd century AD. Both Greek texts contain three [[additions to Daniel]]: [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]; the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susannah and the Elders]]; and the story of [[Bel and the Dragon]]. Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself.{{sfn|Harrington|1999|pp=119\u2013120}}{{sfn|Spencer|2002|p=89}}{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=3}}\n\nEight copies of the Book of Daniel, all incomplete, have been found at [[Qumran]], two in [[Qumran Caves|Cave 1]], five in Cave 4, and one in Cave 6.

All eight manuscripts were copied between 125&nbsp;BC (4QDan<sup>c</sup>) and about 50 AD (4QDan<sup>b</sup>), showing that Daniel was being read at Qumran only about 40 years after its composition. All appear to preserve the 12-chapter Masoretic version rather than the longer Greek text. None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>b</sup>, and 4QDan<sup>d</sup>) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], switches to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1.{{sfn|VanderKam|Flint|2013|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\n== Genre, meaning, symbolism and chronology ==\n[[File:Daniel dans la fosse aux lions.jpg|thumb|upright|Daniel in the lions' den saved by [[Habakkuk]] (France, 15th century).]]\n\n''(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)''\n\n=== Genre ===\nThe Book of Daniel is an [[apocalypse]], a [[literary genre]] in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an other-worldly mediator, an emphasis on cosmic events, angels and demons, and [[pseudonymity]] (false authorship).{{sfn|Crawford|2000|p= 73}} The production of apocalypses occurred commonly from 300 BC to 100 AD, not only among Jews and Christians, but also among Greeks, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Persians and [[Egyptians]], and Daniel is a representative apocalyptic seer, the recipient of divine revelation: he has learned the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge; he is one of the [[maskil (honorific)|''maskilim'']] (\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd), the wise ones, who have the task of teaching righteousness and whose number may be considered to include the authors of the book itself.{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp= 397\u2013406}} The book is also an [[eschatology]], as the divine revelation concerns the end of the present age, a predicted moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom.{{sfn|Carroll|2000|pp= 420\u2013421}} It gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and those Jews who have cooperated with them.{{sfn|Redditt|2009|p= 187}}\n\n=== Meaning, symbolism and chronology ===\nThe message of the Book of Daniel is that, just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression.{{sfn|Brettler|2005|p=218}} The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn from a wide range of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd-century Jewish culture, and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as predicting events in the New Testament\u2014\"the Son of God\", \"the Son of Man\", Christ and the Antichrist\u2014the book's intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=1\u20132}} The following explains a few of these predictions, as understood by modern biblical scholars.\n\n* The ''four kingdoms'' and the ''little horn'' (Daniel 2 and 7): The concept of four successive world empires stems from Greek theories of mythological history.{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} Most modern interpreters agree that the four represent [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], the [[Medes]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and the [[Macedonian Empire|Greeks]], ending with Hellenistic [[Seleucid Syria]] and with Hellenistic [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=34\u201336}} The traditional interpretation of the dream identifies the four empires as the Babylonian (the head), Medo-Persian (arms and shoulders), Greek (thighs and legs), and Roman (the feet) empires.{{sfn|Miller|1994|p=96}} The symbolism of four metals in the statue in chapter 2 comes from Persian writings,{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} while the four \"beasts from the sea\" in chapter 7 reflect Hosea 13:7\u20138, in which God threatens that he will be to Israel like a lion, a leopard, a bear or a wild beast.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=80}} The consensus among scholars is that the four beasts of chapter 7 symbolise the same four world empires.{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260,269}} The modern interpretation views [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] (reigned 175\u2013164 BC) as the \"small horn\" that uproots three others (Antiochus usurped the rights of several other claimants to become king of the Seleucid Empire).{{sfn|Matthews|Moyes|2012|pp=260, 269}}\n* The ''Ancient of Days'' and the ''one like a son of man'' (Daniel 7): The portrayal of God in Daniel [http://biblehub.com/text/daniel/7-13.htm 7:13] resembles the portrayal of the [[Canaan]]ite god [[El (deity)|El]] as an ancient divine king presiding over the divine court.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=3\u20134}} The \"Ancient of Days\" gives dominion over the earth to \"one like a [[son of man]]\", and then in [http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm Daniel 7:27] to \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\", whom scholars consider the son of man to represent. These people can be understood as the ''maskilim'' (sages), or as the Jewish people broadly.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002a|pp=60\u201361, 282}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Son of Man\">\"Son of man\" (''bar 'ena\u0161'' in Hebrew) simply means \"a human being\", but in the context of Daniel 7 it may be a heavenly figure, possibly the archangel Michael functioning as a representative of the Jewish people (Collins 1977:144\u201346; opposed by Davies 1985:105\u2013106). Scholars almost universally agree that this human figure represents \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\" of Daniel 7:27, originally the ''maskilim'' community or group responsible for the composition of Daniel, but in later interpretation it is taken to mean the Jewish people as a whole. See Grabbe 2002a.</ref>\n*''The ram and he-goat'' (Daniel 8) as conventional astrological symbols represent Persia and Syria, as the text explains. The \"mighty horn\" stands for [[Alexander the Great]]  (reigned 336\u2013323 BC) and the \"four lesser horns\" represent the four principal generals ([[Diadochi]]) who fought over the Greek empire following Alexander's death. The \"little horn\" again represents Antiochus IV. The key to the symbols lies in the description of the little horn's actions: he ends the continual burnt offering and overthrows the Sanctuary, a clear reference to Antiochus' desecration of the Temple.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=87}}\n* The ''anointed ones'' and the ''seventy years'' (Chapter 9): Daniel reinterprets [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]'s \"seventy years\" prophecy regarding the period Israel would spend in bondage to Babylon. From the point of view of the Maccabean era, Jeremiah's promise was obviously not true\u2014the gentiles still oppressed the Jews, and the \"desolation of Jerusalem\" had not ended. Daniel therefore reinterprets the seventy years as seventy \"weeks\" of years, making up 490 years. The 70 weeks/490 years are subdivided, with seven \"weeks\" from the \"going forth of the word to rebuild and restore Jerusalem\" to the coming of an \"anointed one\", while the final \"week\" is marked by the violent death of another \"anointed one\", probably the High Priest [[Onias III]] (ousted to make way for [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and murdered in 171 BC), and the profanation of the Temple. The point of this for Daniel is that the period of gentile power is predetermined, and is coming to an end.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260}}\n* ''Kings of north and south'': Chapters 10 to 12 concern the war between these kings, the events leading up to it, and its heavenly meaning.

The angel is counting the two daily sacrifices, so the period is 1150 days from the desecration in December 167. In chapter 12 the angel gives three more dates: the desolation will last \"for a time, times and half a time\", or a year, two years, and a half a year (Daniel 12:8); then that the \"desolation\" will last for 1290 days (12:11); and finally, 1335 days (12:12). Verse 12:11 was presumably added after the lapse of the 1150 days of chapter 8, and 12:12 after the lapse of the number in 12:11.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=99}}\n\n== Influence ==\n[[File:Merian's Daniel 7 engraving.jpg|thumb|320px|Engraving of Daniel's vision of the four beasts in chapter 7 by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]], 1630.]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe concepts of [[immortality]] and [[resurrection]], with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2002|pp=86\u201387}} Without this belief, [[Christianity]], in which the [[resurrection of Jesus]] plays a central role, would have disappeared, like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=2}}\n\nDaniel was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians in the 1st century AD as predicting the imminent end-time.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=244}} Moments of national and cultural crisis continually reawakened the apocalyptic spirit, through the [[Montanism|Montanists]] of the 2nd/3rd centuries, persecuted for their [[millennialism]], to the more extreme elements of the 16th-century Reformation such as the [[Zwickau prophets]] and the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=2\u20133}} During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchy Men]] took their name and political program from Daniel 7, demanding that [[Oliver Cromwell]] allow them to form a \"government of saints\" in preparation for the coming of the Messiah; when Cromwell refused, they identified him instead as the Beast usurping the rightful place of King Jesus.{{sfn|Weber|2007|p=374}} Daniel remains one of the most influential apocalypses in modern America, foretelling the history of Jesus and the [[Second Coming]].{{sfn|Boyer|1992|pp=24, 30\u201331}}\n\nThe influence of Daniel has not been confined to Judaism and Christianity: In the Middle Ages Muslims created horoscopes whose authority was attributed to Daniel. More recently the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] movement, which originated in Persian Shi'ite Islam, justified its existence on the 1260-day prophecy of Daniel, holding that it foretold the coming of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] and an age of peace and justice in the year 1844, which is the year 1260 of the [[Hijri year|Muslim era]].{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n=== Western culture ===\nDaniel belongs not only to the religious tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage. It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophecy but as a historical book, \"a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man\".{{sfn|Godden|2013|p=231}} In the early modern period the physicist [[Isaac Newton]] paid special attention to it, and [[Francis Bacon]] borrowed a [[motto]] from it for his work ''[[Novum Organum]]''. Philosophers, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] drew on it. In the 20th century its apocalyptic second half attracted the attention of [[Carl Jung]]. The book has also inspired musicians, from medieval liturgical drama to the 20th century compositions of [[Darius Milhaud]].  Artists including [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] have all drawn on its imagery.{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Biblical numerology]]\n* [[Christian eschatology]]\n* [[Daniel (Old English poem)]]\n* [[Greek Apocalypse of Daniel]]\n* [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Daniel]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist |group=\"Notes\"}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Bandstra\n  | first     = Barry L.\n  | title     = Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n  | year      = 2008\n  | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing Company\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 978-0495391050\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Bar\n  | first     = Shaul\n  | title     = A Letter That Has Not Been Read: Dreams in the Hebrew Bible\n  | year      = 2001\n  | publisher = Hebrew Union College Press\n  | location  = Cincinnati\n  | isbn      = 978-0-87820-424-3\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=zs3gup4iFu4C\n  | ref       = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Boyer\n  | first     = Paul S.\n  | title     = When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern American Culture\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=FyTeW7vQ8K4C\n  | year      = 1992\n  | publisher = Harvard University Press\n  | isbn      = 978-0-674-95129-7\n  | ref       = harv\n}}\n*  {{cite book\n  | last      = Brettler\n  | first     = Mark Zvi\n  | title     = How To Read the Bible\n  | year      = 2005\n  | publisher = Jewish Publication Society\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=39nQafdJ_ssC\n  | \n| isbn     = 9780827610019\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Carroll\n  | first     = John T.\n  | chapter   = Eschatology\n  | editor1-last                   = Freedman \n  | editor1-first                  = David Noel  \n  | editor2-last                   = Myers\n  | editor2-first                  = Allen C.\n  | title     = Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible\n  | year      = 2000\n  | publisher = Eerdmans\n  | chapter-url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=qRtUqxkB7wkC&pg=PA422\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 9789053565032\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Cohn\n  | first     = Shaye J.D.\n  | title     = From the Maccabees to the Mishnah\n  | year      = 2006\n  | publisher = Westminster John Knox Press\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=H5hLLIrh6n8C\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 9780664227432\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last       = Collins\n  | first      = John J.\n  | authorlink = John J.

Among them are Daniel and his three companions, who refuse to touch the royal food and wine. Their overseer fears for his life in case the health of his charges deteriorates, but Daniel suggests a trial and the four emerge healthier than their counterparts from ten days of nothing but vegetables and water. They are allowed to continue to refrain from eating the king's food, and to Daniel God gives insight into visions and dreams. When their training is done Nebuchadnezzar finds them 'ten times better' than all the wise men in his service and therefore keeps them at his court, where Daniel continues until the first year of King [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=19\u201320}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Cyrus\">Cyrus: Persian conqueror of Babylon, 539 BC.</ref>\n\n=== Nebuchadnezzar's dream of four kingdoms (chapter 2) ===\n{{Main|Daniel 2}}\nIn the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar has a dream. When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some important message, so he consults his wise men. Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation, the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth.

The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked\u2014or more accurately, paid\u2014to be allowed to make Jerusalem a ''[[polis]]'', or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would be in the hands of the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nAntiochus invaded Egypt twice, in 169 BC with success, but on the second incursion, in late 168 BC, he was forced to withdraw by the Romans.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Jason, hearing a rumour that Antiochus was dead, attacked Menelaus to take back the High Priesthood.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Antiochus drove Jason out of Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and introduced measures to pacify his Egyptian border by imposing complete Hellenisation: the Jewish Book of the Law was prohibited and on 15 December 167 BC an \"abomination of desolation\", probably a Greek altar, was introduced into the Temple.{{sfn|Sacchi|2004|pp=225\u2013226}} With the Jewish religion now clearly under threat a resistance movement sprang up, led by the Maccabee brothers, and over the next three years it won sufficient victories over Antiochus to take back and purify the Temple.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nThe crisis which the author of Daniel addresses is the defilement of the altar in Jerusalem in 167 BC (first introduced in chapter 8:11): the daily offering which used to take place twice a day, at morning and evening, stopped, and the phrase \"evenings and mornings\" recurs through the following chapters as a reminder of the missed sacrifices.{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=407}} But whereas the events leading up to the sacking of the Temple in 167 BC and the immediate aftermath are remarkably accurate, the predicted war between the Syrians and the Egyptians (11:40\u201343) never took place, and the prophecy that Antiochus would die in Palestine (11:44\u201345) was inaccurate (he died in Persia).{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=6\u20137}} The obvious conclusion is that the account must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164 BC, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem, and the consensus of modern scholarship is accordingly that the book dates to the period 167\u2013163 BCE.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=7}}{{sfn|Ryken|Longman|2010|p=325}}\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Songe Nabuchodonosor arbre.jpg|thumb|upright|Nebuchadnezzar's dream: the felled tree (France, 15th century).]]\n\n=== Development ===\nIt is generally accepted that Daniel originated as a collection of Aramaic court tales later expanded by the Hebrew revelations.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=42}} The court tales may have originally circulated independently, but the edited collection was probably composed in the third or early second century BC.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=34}} Chapter 1 was composed (in Aramaic) at this time as a brief introduction of  to provide historical context, introduce the characters of the tales, and explain how Daniel and his friends came to Babylon.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}} The visions of chapters 7\u201312 were added and chapter 1 translated into Hebrew at the third stage when the final book was being drawn together.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\n=== Authorship ===\nDaniel is one of a large number of Jewish apocalypses, all of them [[pseudonym]]ous.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|p=2}} The stories of the first half are considered legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] period (2nd century BC).{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}}\n\nAlthough the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, chapters 1\u20136 are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar; only the second half (chapters 7\u201312) is presented by Daniel himself, introduced by the anonymous narrator in chapters 7 and 10.{{sfn|Wesselius|2002|p=295}} The real author/editor of Daniel was probably an educated Jew, knowledgeable in Greek learning, and of high standing in his own community. The book is a product of \"Wisdom\" circles, but the type of wisdom is [[Wiktionary:mantic|mantic]] (the discovery of heavenly secrets from earthly signs) rather than the wisdom of learning\u2014the main source of wisdom in Daniel is God's revelation.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002b|pp=229\u2013230, 243}}{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=340}}\n\nIt is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|p=180}} [[Ezekiel]], who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with [[Noah]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan'el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Collins|2003|p=69}} \"The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character&nbsp;... serves as the principal human 'hero' in the biblical book that now bears his name\"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=4}}\n\n=== Dating ===\n\nThe prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus' two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BC), the desecration of the Temple (the \"abomination of desolation\"), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus' death in late 164 BC. Chapters 10\u201312 must therefore have been written between 167 and 164 BC. There is no evidence of a significant time lapse between those chapters and chapters 8 and 9, and chapter 7 may have been written just a few months earlier again.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=101}}\n\nFurther evidence of the book's date is in the fact that Daniel is excluded from the Hebrew Bible's [[Nevi'im|canon of the prophets]], which was closed around 200 BC, and the Wisdom of [[Sirach]], a work dating from around 180 BC, draws on almost every book of the Old Testament except Daniel, leading scholars to suppose that its author was unaware of it. Daniel is, however, quoted in a section of the [[Sibylline Oracles]] commonly dated to the middle of the 2nd century BC, and was popular at Qumran at much the same time, suggesting that it was known from the middle of that century.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter [[Masoretic Text]] and in two longer Greek versions, the original [[Septuagint]] version, c. 100&nbsp;BC, and the later [[Theodotion]] version from c. 2nd century AD. Both Greek texts contain three [[additions to Daniel]]: [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]; the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susannah and the Elders]]; and the story of [[Bel and the Dragon]]. Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself.{{sfn|Harrington|1999|pp=119\u2013120}}{{sfn|Spencer|2002|p=89}}{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=3}}\n\nEight copies of the Book of Daniel, all incomplete, have been found at [[Qumran]], two in [[Qumran Caves|Cave 1]], five in Cave 4, and one in Cave 6.

All eight manuscripts were copied between 125&nbsp;BC (4QDan<sup>c</sup>) and about 50 AD (4QDan<sup>b</sup>), showing that Daniel was being read at Qumran only about 40 years after its composition. All appear to preserve the 12-chapter Masoretic version rather than the longer Greek text. None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>b</sup>, and 4QDan<sup>d</sup>) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], switches to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1.{{sfn|VanderKam|Flint|2013|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\n== Genre, meaning, symbolism and chronology ==\n[[File:Daniel dans la fosse aux lions.jpg|thumb|upright|Daniel in the lions' den saved by [[Habakkuk]] (France, 15th century).]]\n\n''(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)''\n\n=== Genre ===\nThe Book of Daniel is an [[apocalypse]], a [[literary genre]] in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient;

he is one of the [[maskil (honorific)|''maskilim'']] (\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd), the wise ones, who have the task of teaching righteousness and whose number may be considered to include the authors of the book itself.{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp= 397\u2013406}} The book is also an [[eschatology]], as the divine revelation concerns the end of the present age, a predicted moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom.{{sfn|Carroll|2000|pp= 420\u2013421}} It gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and those Jews who have cooperated with them.{{sfn|Redditt|2009|p= 187}}\n\n=== Meaning, symbolism and chronology ===\nThe message of the Book of Daniel is that, just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression.{{sfn|Brettler|2005|p=218}} The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn from a wide range of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd-century Jewish culture, and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as predicting events in the New Testament\u2014\"the Son of God\", \"the Son of Man\", Christ and the Antichrist\u2014the book's intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=1\u20132}} The following explains a few of these predictions, as understood by modern biblical scholars.\n\n* The ''four kingdoms'' and the ''little horn'' (Daniel 2 and 7): The concept of four successive world empires stems from Greek theories of mythological history.{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} Most modern interpreters agree that the four represent [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], the [[Medes]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and the [[Macedonian Empire|Greeks]], ending with Hellenistic [[Seleucid Syria]] and with Hellenistic [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=34\u201336}} The traditional interpretation of the dream identifies the four empires as the Babylonian (the head), Medo-Persian (arms and shoulders), Greek (thighs and legs), and Roman (the feet) empires.{{sfn|Miller|1994|p=96}} The symbolism of four metals in the statue in chapter 2 comes from Persian writings,{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} while the four \"beasts from the sea\" in chapter 7 reflect Hosea 13:7\u20138, in which God threatens that he will be to Israel like a lion, a leopard, a bear or a wild beast.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=80}} The consensus among scholars is that the four beasts of chapter 7 symbolise the same four world empires.{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260,269}} The modern interpretation views [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] (reigned 175\u2013164 BC) as the \"small horn\" that uproots three others (Antiochus usurped the rights of several other claimants to become king of the Seleucid Empire).{{sfn|Matthews|Moyes|2012|pp=260, 269}}\n* The ''Ancient of Days'' and the ''one like a son of man'' (Daniel 7): The portrayal of God in Daniel [http://biblehub.com/text/daniel/7-13.htm 7:13] resembles the portrayal of the [[Canaan]]ite god [[El (deity)|El]] as an ancient divine king presiding over the divine court.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=3\u20134}} The \"Ancient of Days\" gives dominion over the earth to \"one like a [[son of man]]\", and then in [http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm Daniel 7:27] to \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\", whom scholars consider the son of man to represent. These people can be understood as the ''maskilim'' (sages), or as the Jewish people broadly.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002a|pp=60\u201361, 282}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Son of Man\">\"Son of man\" (''bar 'ena\u0161'' in Hebrew) simply means \"a human being\", but in the context of Daniel 7 it may be a heavenly figure, possibly the archangel Michael functioning as a representative of the Jewish people (Collins 1977:144\u201346; opposed by Davies 1985:105\u2013106). Scholars almost universally agree that this human figure represents \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\" of Daniel 7:27, originally the ''maskilim'' community or group responsible for the composition of Daniel, but in later interpretation it is taken to mean the Jewish people as a whole. See Grabbe 2002a.</ref>\n*''The ram and he-goat'' (Daniel 8) as conventional astrological symbols represent Persia and Syria, as the text explains. The \"mighty horn\" stands for [[Alexander the Great]]  (reigned 336\u2013323 BC) and the \"four lesser horns\" represent the four principal generals ([[Diadochi]]) who fought over the Greek empire following Alexander's death. The \"little horn\" again represents Antiochus IV. The key to the symbols lies in the description of the little horn's actions: he ends the continual burnt offering and overthrows the Sanctuary, a clear reference to Antiochus' desecration of the Temple.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=87}}\n* The ''anointed ones'' and the ''seventy years'' (Chapter 9): Daniel reinterprets [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]'s \"seventy years\" prophecy regarding the period Israel would spend in bondage to Babylon. From the point of view of the Maccabean era, Jeremiah's promise was obviously not true\u2014the gentiles still oppressed the Jews, and the \"desolation of Jerusalem\" had not ended. Daniel therefore reinterprets the seventy years as seventy \"weeks\" of years, making up 490 years. The 70 weeks/490 years are subdivided, with seven \"weeks\" from the \"going forth of the word to rebuild and restore Jerusalem\" to the coming of an \"anointed one\", while the final \"week\" is marked by the violent death of another \"anointed one\", probably the High Priest [[Onias III]] (ousted to make way for [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and murdered in 171 BC), and the profanation of the Temple. The point of this for Daniel is that the period of gentile power is predetermined, and is coming to an end.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260}}\n* ''Kings of north and south'': Chapters 10 to 12 concern the war between these kings, the events leading up to it, and its heavenly meaning.

The angel is counting the two daily sacrifices, so the period is 1150 days from the desecration in December 167. In chapter 12 the angel gives three more dates: the desolation will last \"for a time, times and half a time\", or a year, two years, and a half a year (Daniel 12:8); then that the \"desolation\" will last for 1290 days (12:11); and finally, 1335 days (12:12). Verse 12:11 was presumably added after the lapse of the 1150 days of chapter 8, and 12:12 after the lapse of the number in 12:11.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=99}}\n\n== Influence ==\n[[File:Merian's Daniel 7 engraving.jpg|thumb|320px|Engraving of Daniel's vision of the four beasts in chapter 7 by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]], 1630.]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe concepts of [[immortality]] and [[resurrection]], with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2002|pp=86\u201387}} Without this belief, [[Christianity]], in which the [[resurrection of Jesus]] plays a central role, would have disappeared, like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=2}}\n\nDaniel was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians in the 1st century AD as predicting the imminent end-time.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=244}} Moments of national and cultural crisis continually reawakened the apocalyptic spirit, through the [[Montanism|Montanists]] of the 2nd/3rd centuries, persecuted for their [[millennialism]], to the more extreme elements of the 16th-century Reformation such as the [[Zwickau prophets]] and the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=2\u20133}} During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchy Men]] took their name and political program from Daniel 7, demanding that [[Oliver Cromwell]] allow them to form a \"government of saints\" in preparation for the coming of the Messiah; when Cromwell refused, they identified him instead as the Beast usurping the rightful place of King Jesus.{{sfn|Weber|2007|p=374}} Daniel remains one of the most influential apocalypses in modern America, foretelling the history of Jesus and the [[Second Coming]].{{sfn|Boyer|1992|pp=24, 30\u201331}}\n\nThe influence of Daniel has not been confined to Judaism and Christianity: In the Middle Ages Muslims created horoscopes whose authority was attributed to Daniel. More recently the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] movement, which originated in Persian Shi'ite Islam, justified its existence on the 1260-day prophecy of Daniel, holding that it foretold the coming of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] and an age of peace and justice in the year 1844, which is the year 1260 of the [[Hijri year|Muslim era]].{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n=== Western culture ===\nDaniel belongs not only to the religious tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage. It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophecy but as a historical book, \"a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man\".{{sfn|Godden|2013|p=231}} In the early modern period the physicist [[Isaac Newton]] paid special attention to it, and [[Francis Bacon]] borrowed a [[motto]] from it for his work ''[[Novum Organum]]''. Philosophers, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] drew on it. In the 20th century its apocalyptic second half attracted the attention of [[Carl Jung]]. The book has also inspired musicians, from medieval liturgical drama to the 20th century compositions of [[Darius Milhaud]].  Artists including [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] have all drawn on its imagery.{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Biblical numerology]]\n* [[Christian eschatology]]\n* [[Daniel (Old English poem)]]\n* [[Greek Apocalypse of Daniel]]\n* [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Daniel]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist |group=\"Notes\"}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Bandstra\n  | first     = Barry L.\n  | title     = Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n  | year      = 2008\n  | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing Company\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 978-0495391050\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Bar\n  | first     = Shaul\n  | title     = A Letter That Has Not Been Read: Dreams in the Hebrew Bible\n  | year      = 2001\n  | publisher = Hebrew Union College Press\n  | location  = Cincinnati\n  | isbn      = 978-0-87820-424-3\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=zs3gup4iFu4C\n  | ref       = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Boyer\n  | first     = Paul S.\n  | title     = When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern American Culture\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=FyTeW7vQ8K4C\n  | year      = 1992\n  | publisher = Harvard University Press\n  | isbn      = 978-0-674-95129-7\n  | ref       = harv\n}}\n*  {{cite book\n  | last      = Brettler\n  | first     = Mark Zvi\n  | title     = How To Read the Bible\n  | year      = 2005\n  | publisher = Jewish Publication Society\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=39nQafdJ_ssC\n  | \n| isbn     = 9780827610019\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Carroll\n  | first     = John T.\n  | chapter   = Eschatology\n  | editor1-last                   = Freedman \n  | editor1-first                  = David Noel  \n  | editor2-last                   = Myers\n  | editor2-first                  = Allen C.\n  | title     = Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible\n  | year      = 2000\n  | publisher = Eerdmans\n  | chapter-url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=qRtUqxkB7wkC&pg=PA422\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 9789053565032\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Cohn\n  | first     = Shaye J.D.\n  | title     = From the Maccabees to the Mishnah\n  | year      = 2006\n  | publisher = Westminster John Knox Press\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=H5hLLIrh6n8C\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 9780664227432\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last       = Collins\n  | first      = John J.\n  | authorlink = John J.

With over 850 exhibits spread over eight exhibition galleries, it sees over a million visitors a year, and over 25 million visitors up to the year 2003 when it celebrated its [[silver jubilee]]. Every year, Science Centre will include new activities.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Evening aerial view of the Singapore Science Centre - 20050926.jpg|thumb|left|A bird's eye view of the Science Centre in the evening]]\nThe Science Centre was carved out of the [[National Museum of Singapore]] as a separate institution so that the latter could focus on its artistic and historical collections. This idea was first mooted in 1969 by the former Science Council of Singapore, now known as the [[Agency for Science, Technology and Research]] (A*Star), and was approved by the [[Government of Singapore|government]].\n \nThe SCS building's design was decided by an [[architectural competition]] organised by the Science Centre Board, in which Raymond Woo architects' entry was selected. Built at a cost of [[Singapore dollar|S$]]12 million on a {{convert|60,000|sqm|adj=on}} site in [[Jurong East]], it was officially opened on 10 December 1977 by Dr. [[Toh Chin Chye]], the Minister-in-charge of the centre.\n\nIn 1987, the centre saw a significant expansion with the opening of Singapore's first and only [[IMAX#Dome_andOmnimax|OMNIMAX]] theatre, the [[Omni-Theatre, Singapore Science Centre|Omni-Theatre]]. Costing $18 million, it has a 276-seat theatre underneath a {{convert|23|m|adj=on}} tilted dome.\n\nIn 1999, a $38 million renovation expanded the centre's exhibition space with larger open areas, a direct connection to the separate Omni-Theatre building, as well as a new entrance. In 2000, [[Snow City]], a recreation of a {{convert|-5|C|adj=on}} environment in tropical Singapore, was set up beside the Omni-Theatre.\n\nOn 7 December 2007, in its 30th anniversary year, the centre rebranded itself as the '''Science Centre Singapore''' (SCS).\n\n==Observatory==\n[[File:The Observatory, Singapore Science Centre.JPG|thumb|The Observatory at the Science Centre is one of the few observatories in the world located next to the Equator]]\n\n===Location===\nThe Science Centre Observatory is situated at {{Coord|1.3342|103.7357|display = inline}}, and is {{convert|15.27|m}} above mean sea level. It is one of the few observatories in the world located next to the [[equator]]. Its unique position allows constellations in both the northern and southern celestial hemispheres to be observed and thus opens up more vistas in the sky for observers. The Observatory is endowed with a range of sophisticated facilities as well as a classroom for astronomy lessons, slide shows and public talks.\n\n===Telescope===\nThe main telescope of the Observatory is a {{convert|40|cm|adj=on}} [[Cassegrain reflector]] of a combined [[focal length]] of {{convert|520|cm}}.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chong, S.

The {{convert|5.5|m|adj=on}} stainless steel dome can be made to swivel in any direction and its shutter can be made to slide open for the telescope to be focused on to interesting objects in the sky.\n\n===Stargazing sessions===\nThe Observatory has been open to the public for stargazing sessions every Friday night since June 2006. The opening hours are from 7:50 to 10:00 pm. The Observatory can comfortably accommodate 50 visitors per session. It is important to note that stargazing through the observatory telescope is only possible when the sky is clear. However, regardless of weather conditions, the staff will be present.\n\n==Relocation plans==\nOn 4 April 2008, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] announced plans to relocate the Science Centre next to [[Chinese Garden MRT station]] within ten to 15 years.<ref>{{citation|title=Blueprint for Jurong unveiled: URA plans to transform Jurong Lake District into a unique lakeside destination for business and leisure|url=http://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/media-room/news/2008/apr/Copy%20of%20pr08-38.aspx|publisher=[[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]|date=4 April 2008}}.</ref>\n\nOn 24 May 2019, the Science Centre board awarded a multi-disciplinary team led by [[Architects 61]] for the design of the new centre, expected to be ready by 2025.
