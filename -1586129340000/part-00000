It is not to be confused with [[Benin]], the post-colonial nation state. The Kingdom of Benin's capital was Edo, now known as [[Benin City]] in [[Edo State|Edo state]]. The Benin Kingdom was \"one of the oldest and most highly developed states in the coastal hinterland of [[West Africa]], dating perhaps to the eleventh century CE\",{{sfn|Strayer|2013|pp=695-696}} until it was annexed by the [[British Empire]] in 1897.\n\n==Oral traditions==\n\nThe original people and founders of the Benin Kingdom, the [[Edo people]], were initially ruled by the [[List of the Ogiso|Ogiso]] (Kings of the Sky) who called their land [[Igodomigodo]]. The first Ogiso (Ogiso Igodo), wielded much influence and gained popularity as a good ruler. He died after a long reign and was succeeded by Ere, his eldest son. In the 12th century, a great [[palace]] intrigue erupted and crown prince Ekaladerhan, the only son of the last Ogiso, was sentenced to death as a result of the first queen (who was barren) deliberately changing an oracle's message to the Ogiso. In carrying out the royal order that he be killed, the palace messengers had mercy and set the prince free at [[Ughoton]] near Benin. When his father the Ogiso died, the Ogiso dynasty officially ended. The people and royal kingmakers preferred their late king's son as the next to rule.\n\nThe exiled Prince Ekaladerhan had by this time changed his name to Izoduwa (meaning 'I have chosen the path of prosperity') and found his way to [[Ile-Ife]]. It was during this period of confusion in Benin that the elders, led by Chief Oliha, mounted a search for the banished Prince Ekaladerhan - whom the Ife people now called [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa, who could not return due to his advanced age, granted them Oranmiyan, his grandson, to rule over them. Oranmiyan was resisted by Ogiamien Irebor, one of the palace chiefs, and took up his abode in the palace built for him at Usama by the elders (now a [[coronation]] [[shrine]]). Soon after his arrival, he married a beautiful lady, Erinmwinde, daughter of Ogie-Egor, the ninth Enogie of Egor, by whom he had a son. After residing there for some years he called a meeting of the people and renounced his office, remarking in vexation ''Ile-Ibinu'' (\"ile\" means land, \"binu\" mean anger, and thus the kingdom was called Ibinu, which was mispronounced Bini in the 15th and 16th centuries by the Portuguese). This was out of frustration as he often expressed that \"only a child born, trained and educated in the arts and mysteries of the land could reign over the people\". He arranged for his son born to him by Erinmwinde, Eweka, to be made king in his place, and returned to Yorubaland thereafter. His son the new king was soon found to be deaf and dumb, and so the elders appealed to Oranmiyan. He gave them charmed seeds known as \"omo ayo\" to play with, saying that to do so will make him talk. The little Eweka played with the seeds with his peers at Egor, his mother's hometown. While playing with the seeds, he announced \"Owomika\" as his royal name. Thus, he gave rise to the tradition of the subsequent Obas of Benin spending seven days and nights at Usama before proceeding to announce their royal names at Egor. Eweka thus started a dynasty that now bears his name. Oranmiyan went on to serve as the founder of the [[Oyo Empire]], where he ruled as the first [[Alaafin]] of Oyo. His descendants now rule in Ile Ife, Oyo and Benin.\n\nBy the 15th century, Benin had expanded into a thriving city-state. The twelfth Oba in the line, Oba [[Ewuare|Ewuare the Great]] (1440\u20131473) would expand the [[city-state]]'s territories to surrounding regions.\n\nIt was not until the 15th century, during the reign of Oba Ewuare the Great, that the kingdom's administrative centre, the city of Ubinu (or Ibinu), began to be known as [[Benin City]] by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], a pronunciation later adopted by the locals as well. The Portuguese would write this down as Benin City. Edo's neighbours, such as the Itsekiris and the Urhobos, continued to refer to the city as Ubini up until the late 19th century.\n\nAside from Benin City, the system of rule of the Oba in the empire, even through the golden age of the kingdom, was still loosely based upon the Ogiso dynasty's tradition, which was military protection in exchange for pledged allegiance and taxes paid to the royal administrative centre. The language and culture was not enforced, as the empire remained heterogeneous and localized according to each group within the kingdom, though a local enogie (or duke) was often appointed by the Oba for specific ethnic areas.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history ===\nBy the 1st century BCE, the Benin territory was partially agricultural; and it became primarily agricultural by around 500 CE, but hunting and gathering still remained important. Also by 500 CE, [[iron]] was in use by the inhabitants of the Benin territory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bondarenko|first=Dmitri|last2=Roese|first2=Peter|date=1999-01-01|title=Benin Prehistory.

The dense vegetation and narrow paths made the city easy to defend against attacks. The [[rainforest]], which Benin City is situated in, helped in the development of the city because of its vast resources \u2014 fish from rivers and creeks, animals to hunt, leaves for roofing, plants for medicine, ivory for carving and trading, and wood for boat building \u2014 that could be exploited. However, domesticated animals, from the forest and surrounding areas, could not survive, due to a disease spread by [[Tsetse fly|tsetse flies]]; after centuries of exposure, some animals, such as cattle and goat, developed a resistance to the disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forgotten Africa: An Introduction to Its Archaeology|last=Connah|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415305914|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/forgottenafricai00grah/page/125 125-6]|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottenafricai00grah/page/125}}</ref>\n\nThe original name of the Benin Kingdom, at its creation some time in the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], was [[Igodomigodo]], as its inhabitants called it.

The Oba's divinity and sacredness was the focal point of the kingship. The Oba was shrouded in mystery; he only left his palace on ceremonial occasions. It was previously punishable by death to assert that the Oba performed human acts, such as eating, sleeping, dying, washing. The Oba was also credited with having magical powers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Benin Kingdom and the Edo-speaking Peoples of South-western Nigeria|last=Bradbury|first=R.E.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1315293837|location=|pages=40}}</ref>\n\n==Golden Age==\nThe Oba had become the mount of power within the region. Oba Ewuare, the first ''Golden Age'' Oba, is credited with turning Benin City into a city-state from a military fortress built by the Ogisos, protected by moats and walls. It was from this bastion that he launched his military campaigns and began the expansion of the kingdom from the Edo-speaking heartlands.\n\nA series of walls marked the incremental growth of the sacred city from 850 AD until its decline in the 16th century. To enclose his palace he commanded the building of Benin's inner wall, an {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|adj=mid|-long|0}} earthen rampart girded by a moat {{convert|20|ft|m|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} deep. This was excavated in the early 1960s by [[Graham Connah]]. Connah estimated that its construction if spread out over five dry seasons, would have required a workforce of 1,000 laborers working ten hours a day seven days a week. Ewuare also added great thoroughfares and erected nine fortified gateways.\n\nExcavations also uncovered a rural network of earthen walls {{convert|4000|to|8000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|-3}} long that would have taken an estimated 150 million man-hours to build and must have taken hundreds of years to build. These were apparently raised to mark out territories for towns and cities. Thirteen years after Ewuare's death, tales of Benin's splendors lured more Portuguese traders to the city gates.<ref>Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Africa's Glorious Legacy (1994) pp.&nbsp;102\u20134</ref>\n\nAt its height, Benin dominated trade along the entire coastline from the Western Niger Delta, through Lagos to the kingdom of Great Accra (modern-day Ghana).<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=ZPnDBAAAQBAJ |page=152 }} |title=The History of Africa: The Quest for Eternal Harmony }}</ref> It was for this reason that this coastline was named the [[Bight of Benin]]. The present-day Republic of Benin, formerly Dahomey, decided to choose the name of this bight as the name of its country. Benin ruled over the tribes of the Niger Delta including the Western Igbo, Ijaw, Itshekiri, Ika, Isoko and Urhobo amongst others. It also held sway over the Eastern Yoruba tribes of Ondo, Ekiti, Mahin/Ugbo, and Ijebu.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B5QuAQAAIAAJ&q=orhogbua+portugal&dq=orhogbua+portugal |title=The Benin City Pilgrimage Stations |isbn=9789783153356 |last1=Aisien |first1=Ekhaguosa |year=2001 }}</ref> It also conquered what eventually became the city of [[Lagos]] hundreds of years before the British took over in 1851.<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=MCHSd62Tse8C |page=27 }} |title=Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760--1900 }}</ref>\n\nThe state developed an advanced artistic culture, especially in its famous artifacts of bronze, iron and ivory. These include bronze wall plaques and life-sized bronze heads depicting the Obas and Iyobas of Benin. The most well-known artifact is based on [[Queen Idia]], now best known as the ''[[Benin ivory mask|FESTAC Mask]]'' after its use in 1977 in the logo of the Nigeria-financed and hosted Second Festival of Black & African Arts and Culture (FESTAC 77).\n\n==European contact==\nBefore trade and contact with Europeans, supplies of metal were very scarce in Benin and writing was not present. After the Kingdom of Benin began trading with Europeans at the end of the 15th century CE, the quantity of [[bronze]] castings and thickness of casting had greatly increased; before trade with Europeans, the blades were incredibly thin and only wealthy elites could afford work with these metals that were regarded as precious.<ref name=\":0a\" /> Writing was not introduced to the Kingdom of Benin until the [[Niger Coast Protectorate|colonial period]] \u2014 near the end of the 19th century CE.<ref>Connah (2004), pp. 129</ref>\n\nThe first European travelers to reach Benin were [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorers under Jo\u00e3o Afonso de Aveiro in about 1485. A strong mercantile relationship developed, with the Edo trading slaves and tropical products such as [[ivory trade|ivory]], [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[palm oil]] for European goods such as [[Manilla (money)|manillas]] and [[guns]]. In the early 16th century, the Oba sent an ambassador to [[Lisbon]], and the king of Portugal sent [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries to Benin City. Some residents of Benin City could still speak a [[pidgin]] Portuguese in the late 19th century.\n\nThe first English expedition to Benin was in 1553, and significant trading developed between England and Benin based on the export of ivory, palm oil, pepper, and slaves. Visitors in the 16th and 19th centuries brought back to [[Europe]] tales of \"Great Benin\", a fabulous city of noble buildings, ruled over by a powerful king. This picture is for instance shown in [[Olfert Dapper]]'s [[Description of Africa (1668 book)|''Naukeurige beschrijvinge der Afrikaensche gewesten'']], published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1668.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dapper |first1=Olfert |title=Naukeurige beschrijvinge der Afrikaensche gewesten |date=1668 |publisher=[[Jacob van Meurs]] |location=Amsterdam |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gri_33125009359999/page/n676 495]-505 |url=https://archive.org/details/gri_33125009359999|quote=naukeurige beschrijvinge der afrikaensche gewesten. }}</ref> It states the following about the royal palace:\n\n''The king's court is square and located on the right-hand side of the city, as one enters it through the gate of Gotton. It is about the same size as the city of [[Haarlem]] and entirely surrounded by a special wall, comparable to the one which encircles the town. It is divided into many magnificent palaces, houses and apartments of the courtiers, and comprises beautiful and long squares with galleries, about as large as the [[Euronext Amsterdam|Exchange at Amsterdam]]. The buildings are of different sizes however, resting on wooden pillars, from top to bottom lined with copper casts, on which pictures of their war exploits and battles are engraved. All of them are being very well maintained. Most of the buildings within this court are covered with palm leaves, instead of with square planks, and every roof is adorned with a small spired tower, on which casted copper birds are standing, being very artfully sculpted and lifelike with their wings spread.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dapper |first1=Olfert |title=Naukeurige beschrijvinge der Afrikaensche gewesten |date=1668 |publisher=Jacob van Meurs |location=Amsterdam |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gri_33125009359999/page/n676 495]-496 |url=https://archive.org/details/gri_33125009359999 |quote=495. |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAnother Dutch traveler, [[David van Nyendael]], visited Benin in 1699 and also wrote an account of the kingdom. Nyendael's description was published in 1704 as an appendix to [[Willem Bosman]]'s ''Nauwkeurige beschryving van de Guinese goud-, tand- en slave-kust''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bosman |first1=Willem |title=Nauwkeurige beschryving van de Guinese goud-, tand- en slave-kust |date=1704 |publisher=Anthony Schouten |location=Utrecht |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nauwkeurigebesch00bosm_0/page/212 212]-257 |url=https://archive.org/details/nauwkeurigebesch00bosm_0 |quote=RIO FORMOSA Anders gesegt DE BENIN. |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref> In his description, Nyendael states the following about the character of the Benin people:\n\n''The inhabitants of the Benin are in general a kind and polite people, of whom one with kindness might get everything he desires. Whatever might be offered to them out of politeness, will always be doubled in return. However, they want their politeness to be returned with likewise courtesy as well, without the appearance of any disappointment or rudeness, and rightly so. To be sure, trying to take anything from them with force or violence, would be as if one tries to reach out to the [[Moon]] and will never be left unreckoned. When it comes to trade, they are very strict and will not suffer the slightest infringement of their customs, not even a [[Iota|iota]] can be changed. Though, when one is willing to accept these customs, they are very easy-going and will cooperate in every way possible to reach an agreement.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bosman |first1=Willem |title=Nauwkeurige beschryving van de Guinese goud-, tand en slave-kust |date=1704 |publisher=Anthony Schouten |location=Utrecht |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nauwkeurigebesch00bosm_0/page/222 222]-223 |url=https://archive.org/details/nauwkeurigebesch00bosm_0 |quote=de maen. |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nGiven this characterization of the Benin culture, it might be understood that the Oba did not accept any colonial aspirations. As soon as the Oba began to suspect Britain of larger colonial designs, it ceased communications with them until the [[Benin Expedition of 1897|British Expedition in 1896-97]], when troops of that country captured, burned, and looted Benin City as part of a punitive mission, which brought the kingdom's imperial era to an end.<ref>Chapter 77, [[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]</ref>\n\n==Military==\nMilitary operations relied on a well trained disciplined force.<ref name=\"Osadolor\">{{cite web |last=Osadolor |first=Osarhieme Benson |title=The military system of Benin Kingdom, c. 1440\u20131897 (D) |url=http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2001/544/pdf/abstract.pdf |publisher=University of Hamburg |date=23 July 2001 |pages=4\u2013264}}</ref> At the head of the host stood the [[Oba of Benin]]. The monarch of the realm served as supreme military commander. Beneath him were subordinate generalissimos, the ''Ezomo'', the ''Iyase'', and others who supervised a Metropolitan Regiment based in the capital, and a Royal Regiment made up of hand-picked warriors that also served as bodyguards. Benin's Queen Mother also retained her own regiment, the \"Queen's Own\". The Metropolitan and Royal regiments were relatively stable semi-permanent or permanent formations. The Village Regiments provided the bulk of the fighting force and were mobilized as needed, sending contingents of warriors upon the command of the king and his generals. Formations were broken down into sub-units under designated commanders. Foreign observers often commented favorably on Benin's discipline and organization as \"better disciplined than any other Guinea nation\", contrasting them with the slacker troops from the Gold Coast.<ref>Robert Sydney Smith, Warfare & diplomacy in pre-colonial West Africa, [[University of Wisconsin Press]]: 1989, pp. 54\u201362</ref>\n\nUntil the introduction of guns in the 15th century, traditional weapons like the spear, short sword, and bow held sway. Efforts were made to reorganize a local guild of blacksmiths in the 18th century to manufacture light firearms, but dependence on imports was still heavy. Before the coming of the gun, guilds of blacksmiths were charged with war production\u2014particularly swords and iron spearheads.<ref name=\"Osadolor\"/>\n\nBenin's tactics were well organized, with preliminary plans weighed by the Oba and his sub-commanders. Logistics were organized to support missions from the usual porter forces, water transport via canoe, and requisitioning from localities the army passed through. Movement of troops via canoes was critically important in the lagoons, creeks and rivers of the Niger Delta, a key area of Benin's domination. Tactics in the field seem to have evolved over time. While the head-on clash was well known, documentation from the 18th century shows greater emphasis on avoiding continuous battle lines, and more effort to encircle an enemy (''ifianyako'').<ref name=\"Osadolor\"/>\n\nFortifications were important in the region and numerous military campaigns fought by Benin's soldiers revolved around sieges. As noted above, Benin's military earthworks are the largest of such structures in the world, and Benin's rivals also built extensively. Barring a successful assault, most sieges were resolved by a strategy of attrition, slowly cutting off and starving out the enemy fortification until it capitulated. On occasion, however, European mercenaries were called on to aid with these sieges. In 1603\u201304 for example, European cannon helped batter and destroy the gates of a town near present-day Lagos, allowing 10,000 warriors of Benin to enter and conquer it. As payment, the Europeans received items, such as palm oil and bundles of pepper.<ref>R.S. Smith, Warfare & diplomacy pp. 54\u201362</ref> The example of Benin shows the power of indigenous military systems, but also the role outside influences and new technologies brought to bear. This is a normal pattern among many nations\n\n===Britain seeks control over trade===\nBenin began to decline after 1700. Benin's power and wealth was continuously flourishing in the 19th century with the development of the trade in palm oil, textiles, ivory, slaves, and other resources. To preserve the kingdom's independence, bit by bit the Oba banned the export of goods from Benin, until the trade was exclusively in palm oil.\n\nBy the last half of the 19th century Great Britain had come to want a closer relationship with the Kingdom of Benin; for British officials were increasingly interested in controlling trade in the area and in accessing the kingdom's rubber resources to support their own growing tire market.\n\nSeveral attempts were made to achieve this end beginning with the official visit of [[Richard Francis Burton]] in 1862 when he was consul at [[Fernando P\u00f3 (island)|Fernando P\u00f3]]. Following that came attempts to establish a treaty between Benin and the United Kingdom by Hewtt, Blair and Annesley in 1884, 1885 and 1886 respectively. However, these efforts did not yield any results. The kingdom resisted becoming a British protectorate throughout the 1880s, but the British remained persistent. Progress was made finally in 1892 during the visit of Vice-Consul [[Henry Galway]]. This mission was the first official visit after Burton's. Moreover, it would also set in motion the events to come that would lead to Oba Ovonramwen's demise.\n\n===The Galway Treaty of 1892===\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Benin had managed to retain its independence and the Oba exercised a monopoly over trade which the British found irksome. The territory was coveted by an influential group of investors for its rich natural resources such as palm-oil, rubber and ivory. After British consul Richard Burton visited Benin in 1862 he wrote of Benin's as a place of \"gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death\", a narrative which was widely publicized in Britain and increased pressure for the territory's subjugation.{{sfn|Igbafe|1970|p=385}}\nIn spite of this pressure, the kingdom maintained independence and was not visited by another representative of Britain until 1892 when [[Henry Galway|Henry Gallwey]], the British Vice-Consul of Oil Rivers Protectorate (later [[Niger Coast Protectorate]]), visited Benin City hoping to open up trade and ultimately annex Benin Kingdom and make it a [[British protectorate]].{{sfn|Igbafe|1970|pp=385-400}}  Gallwey was able to get Omo n\u2019Oba ([[Ovonramwen]]) and his chiefs to sign a treaty which gave Britain legal justification for exerting greater influence over the Empire.  While the treaty itself contains text suggesting Ovonramwen actively sought Britain's protection, this appears to be a fiction. Gallway's own account suggests the Oba was hesitant to sign the treaty.{{sfn|Igbafe|1970}} Although some suggest that humanitarian motivations were driving Britain's actions,<ref>E.G. Hernon, A. Britain's Forgotton Wars, p.409 (2002)</ref> letters written between administrators suggest that economic motivations were predominant.{{sfn|Igbafe|1970|p=387}}  The treaty itself does not explicitly mention anything about Benin's \"bloody customs\" that Burton had written about, and instead only includes a vague clause about ensuring \"the general progress of civilization\".{{sfn|Igbafe|1970|p=387}}\n\n===The conflict of 1897===\n{{Main|Benin Expedition of 1897}}\n\n[[File:Flag of the Benin Empire.svg|thumb|An unidentified [[West African flag]] allegedly brought to Britain by Admiral F. W. Kennedy after the expedition.]]\n\nWhen people in Benin discovered Britain's true intentions were an invasion to depose the king of Benin, without approval from the king his generals ordered a preemptive attack on the British party approaching Benin City, including eight unknowing British representatives, who were killed. A [[Benin Expedition of 1897|punitive expedition]] was launched in 1897. The British force, under the command of Admiral Sir [[Harry Rawson]], razed and burned the city, destroying much of the country's treasured art and dispersing nearly all that remained. The stolen portrait figures, busts, and groups created in iron, carved ivory, and especially in brass (conventionally called the \"[[Benin Bronzes]]\") are now displayed in museums around the world.\n\n==Benin today==\nThe monarchy continues to exist today as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of contemporary Nigeria.

It is not to be confused with [[Benin]], the post-colonial nation state. The Kingdom of Benin's capital was Edo, now known as [[Benin City]] in [[Edo State|Edo state]]. The Benin Kingdom was \"one of the oldest and most highly developed states in the coastal hinterland of [[West Africa]], dating perhaps to the eleventh century CE\",{{sfn|Strayer|2013|pp=695-696}} until it was annexed by the [[British Empire]] in 1897.\n\n==Oral traditions==\n\nThe original people and founders of the Benin Kingdom, the [[Edo people]], were initially ruled by the [[List of the Ogiso|Ogiso]] (Kings of the Sky) who called their land [[Igodomigodo]]. The first Ogiso (Ogiso Igodo), wielded much influence and gained popularity as a good ruler. He died after a long reign and was succeeded by Ere, his eldest son. In the 12th century, a great [[palace]] intrigue erupted and crown prince Ekaladerhan, the only son of the last Ogiso, was sentenced to death as a result of the first queen (who was barren) deliberately changing an oracle's message to the Ogiso. In carrying out the royal order that he be killed, the palace messengers had mercy and set the prince free at [[Ughoton]] near Benin. When his father the Ogiso died, the Ogiso dynasty officially ended. The people and royal kingmakers preferred their late king's son as the next to rule.\n\nThe exiled Prince Ekaladerhan had by this time changed his name to Izoduwa (meaning 'I have chosen the path of prosperity') and found his way to [[Ile-Ife]]. It was during this period of confusion in Benin that the elders, led by Chief Oliha, mounted a search for the banished Prince Ekaladerhan - whom the Ife people now called [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa, who could not return due to his advanced age, granted them Oranmiyan, his grandson, to rule over them. Oranmiyan was resisted by Ogiamien Irebor, one of the palace chiefs, and took up his abode in the palace built for him at Usama by the elders (now a [[coronation]] [[shrine]]). Soon after his arrival, he married a beautiful lady, Erinmwinde, daughter of Ogie-Egor, the ninth Enogie of Egor, by whom he had a son. After residing there for some years he called a meeting of the people and renounced his office, remarking in vexation ''Ile-Ibinu'' (\"ile\" means land, \"binu\" mean anger, and thus the kingdom was called Ibinu, which was mispronounced Bini in the 15th and 16th centuries by the Portuguese). This was out of frustration as he often expressed that \"only a child born, trained and educated in the arts and mysteries of the land could reign over the people\". He arranged for his son born to him by Erinmwinde, Eweka, to be made king in his place, and returned to Yorubaland thereafter. His son the new king was soon found to be deaf and dumb, and so the elders appealed to Oranmiyan. He gave them charmed seeds known as \"omo ayo\" to play with, saying that to do so will make him talk. The little Eweka played with the seeds with his peers at Egor, his mother's hometown. While playing with the seeds, he announced \"Owomika\" as his royal name. Thus, he gave rise to the tradition of the subsequent Obas of Benin spending seven days and nights at Usama before proceeding to announce their royal names at Egor. Eweka thus started a dynasty that now bears his name. Oranmiyan went on to serve as the founder of the [[Oyo Empire]], where he ruled as the first [[Alaafin]] of Oyo. His descendants now rule in Ile Ife, Oyo and Benin.\n\nBy the 15th century, Benin had expanded into a thriving city-state. The twelfth Oba in the line, Oba [[Ewuare|Ewuare the Great]] (1440\u20131473) would expand the [[city-state]]'s territories to surrounding regions.\n\nIt was not until the 15th century, during the reign of Oba Ewuare the Great, that the kingdom's administrative centre, the city of Ubinu (or Ibinu), began to be known as [[Benin City]] by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], a pronunciation later adopted by the locals as well. The Portuguese would write this down as Benin City. Edo's neighbours, such as the Itsekiris and the Urhobos, continued to refer to the city as Ubini up until the late 19th century.\n\nAside from Benin City, the system of rule of the Oba in the empire, even through the golden age of the kingdom, was still loosely based upon the Ogiso dynasty's tradition, which was military protection in exchange for pledged allegiance and taxes paid to the royal administrative centre. The language and culture was not enforced, as the empire remained heterogeneous and localized according to each group within the kingdom, though a local enogie (or duke) was often appointed by the Oba for specific ethnic areas.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history ===\nBy the 1st century BCE, the Benin territory was partially agricultural; and it became primarily agricultural by around 500 CE, but hunting and gathering still remained important. Also by 500 CE, [[iron]] was in use by the inhabitants of the Benin territory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bondarenko|first=Dmitri|last2=Roese|first2=Peter|date=1999-01-01|title=Benin Prehistory.

The dense vegetation and narrow paths made the city easy to defend against attacks. The [[rainforest]], which Benin City is situated in, helped in the development of the city because of its vast resources \u2014 fish from rivers and creeks, animals to hunt, leaves for roofing, plants for medicine, ivory for carving and trading, and wood for boat building \u2014 that could be exploited. However, domesticated animals, from the forest and surrounding areas, could not survive, due to a disease spread by [[Tsetse fly|tsetse flies]]; after centuries of exposure, some animals, such as cattle and goat, developed a resistance to the disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forgotten Africa: An Introduction to Its Archaeology|last=Connah|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415305914|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/forgottenafricai00grah/page/125 125-6]|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottenafricai00grah/page/125}}</ref>\n\nThe original name of the Benin Kingdom, at its creation some time in the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], was [[Igodomigodo]], as its inhabitants called it.

If the eldest son failed to complete these tasks, the eldest son might be disqualified from becoming king.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study|last=Trigger|first=Bruce G.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-82245-9|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/understandingear0000trig/page/77 77\u201378]|oclc=50291226|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingear0000trig/page/77}}</ref>\n\n=== Separation of son and mother ===\nAfter the son was installed as king, the mother was transferred to a [[palace]] just outside Benin City, in a place called Uselu. The mother held a considerable amount of power; she was, however, never allowed to meet her son \u2014 who was now divine ruler \u2014 again.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Divinity of the Oba===\nIn Benin, the Oba was seen as [[Divinity|divine]]. The Oba's divinity and sacredness was the focal point of the kingship. The Oba was shrouded in mystery; he only left his palace on ceremonial occasions. It was previously punishable by death to assert that the Oba performed human acts, such as eating, sleeping, dying, washing. The Oba was also credited with having magical powers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Benin Kingdom and the Edo-speaking Peoples of South-western Nigeria|last=Bradbury|first=R.E.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1315293837|location=|pages=40}}</ref>\n\n==Golden Age==\nThe Oba had become the mount of power within the region. Oba Ewuare, the first ''Golden Age'' Oba, is credited with turning Benin City into a city-state from a military fortress built by the Ogisos, protected by moats and walls. It was from this bastion that he launched his military campaigns and began the expansion of the kingdom from the Edo-speaking heartlands.\n\nA series of walls marked the incremental growth of the sacred city from 850 AD until its decline in the 16th century. To enclose his palace he commanded the building of Benin's inner wall, an {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|adj=mid|-long|0}} earthen rampart girded by a moat {{convert|20|ft|m|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} deep. This was excavated in the early 1960s by [[Graham Connah]]. Connah estimated that its construction if spread out over five dry seasons, would have required a workforce of 1,000 laborers working ten hours a day seven days a week. Ewuare also added great thoroughfares and erected nine fortified gateways.\n\nExcavations also uncovered a rural network of earthen walls {{convert|4000|to|8000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|-3}} long that would have taken an estimated 150 million man-hours to build and must have taken hundreds of years to build. These were apparently raised to mark out territories for towns and cities. Thirteen years after Ewuare's death, tales of Benin's splendors lured more Portuguese traders to the city gates.<ref>Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Africa's Glorious Legacy (1994) pp.&nbsp;102\u20134</ref>\n\nAt its height, Benin dominated trade along the entire coastline from the Western Niger Delta, through Lagos to the kingdom of Great Accra (modern-day Ghana).<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=ZPnDBAAAQBAJ |page=152 }} |title=The History of Africa: The Quest for Eternal Harmony }}</ref> It was for this reason that this coastline was named the [[Bight of Benin]]. The present-day Republic of Benin, formerly Dahomey, decided to choose the name of this bight as the name of its country. Benin ruled over the tribes of the Niger Delta including the Western Igbo, Ijaw, Itshekiri, Ika, Isoko and Urhobo amongst others. It also held sway over the Eastern Yoruba tribes of Ondo, Ekiti, Mahin/Ugbo, and Ijebu.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B5QuAQAAIAAJ&q=orhogbua+portugal&dq=orhogbua+portugal |title=The Benin City Pilgrimage Stations |isbn=9789783153356 |last1=Aisien |first1=Ekhaguosa |year=2001 }}</ref> It also conquered what eventually became the city of [[Lagos]] hundreds of years before the British took over in 1851.<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=MCHSd62Tse8C |page=27 }} |title=Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760--1900 }}</ref>\n\nThe state developed an advanced artistic culture, especially in its famous artifacts of bronze, iron and ivory. These include bronze wall plaques and life-sized bronze heads depicting the Obas and Iyobas of Benin. The most well-known artifact is based on [[Queen Idia]], now best known as the ''[[Benin ivory mask|FESTAC Mask]]'' after its use in 1977 in the logo of the Nigeria-financed and hosted Second Festival of Black & African Arts and Culture (FESTAC 77).\n\n==European contact==\nBefore trade and contact with Europeans, supplies of metal were very scarce in Benin and writing was not present. After the Kingdom of Benin began trading with Europeans at the end of the 15th century CE, the quantity of [[bronze]] castings and thickness of casting had greatly increased; before trade with Europeans, the blades were incredibly thin and only wealthy elites could afford work with these metals that were regarded as precious.<ref name=\":0a\" /> Writing was not introduced to the Kingdom of Benin until the [[Niger Coast Protectorate|colonial period]] \u2014 near the end of the 19th century CE.<ref>Connah (2004), pp. 129</ref>\n\nThe first European travelers to reach Benin were [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorers under Jo\u00e3o Afonso de Aveiro in about 1485. A strong mercantile relationship developed, with the Edo trading slaves and tropical products such as [[ivory trade|ivory]], [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[palm oil]] for European goods such as [[Manilla (money)|manillas]] and [[guns]]. In the early 16th century, the Oba sent an ambassador to [[Lisbon]], and the king of Portugal sent [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries to Benin City. Some residents of Benin City could still speak a [[pidgin]] Portuguese in the late 19th century.\n\nThe first English expedition to Benin was in 1553, and significant trading developed between England and Benin based on the export of ivory, palm oil, pepper, and slaves. Visitors in the 16th and 19th centuries brought back to [[Europe]] tales of \"Great Benin\", a fabulous city of noble buildings, ruled over by a powerful king. This picture is for instance shown in [[Olfert Dapper]]'s [[Description of Africa (1668 book)|''Naukeurige beschrijvinge der Afrikaensche gewesten'']], published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1668.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dapper |first1=Olfert |title=Naukeurige beschrijvinge der Afrikaensche gewesten |date=1668 |publisher=[[Jacob van Meurs]] |location=Amsterdam |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gri_33125009359999/page/n676 495]-505 |url=https://archive.org/details/gri_33125009359999|quote=naukeurige beschrijvinge der afrikaensche gewesten. }}</ref> It states the following about the royal palace:\n\n''The king's court is square and located on the right-hand side of the city, as one enters it through the gate of Gotton. It is about the same size as the city of [[Haarlem]] and entirely surrounded by a special wall, comparable to the one which encircles the town. It is divided into many magnificent palaces, houses and apartments of the courtiers, and comprises beautiful and long squares with galleries, about as large as the [[Euronext Amsterdam|Exchange at Amsterdam]]. The buildings are of different sizes however, resting on wooden pillars, from top to bottom lined with copper casts, on which pictures of their war exploits and battles are engraved. All of them are being very well maintained. Most of the buildings within this court are covered with palm leaves, instead of with square planks, and every roof is adorned with a small spired tower, on which casted copper birds are standing, being very artfully sculpted and lifelike with their wings spread.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dapper |first1=Olfert |title=Naukeurige beschrijvinge der Afrikaensche gewesten |date=1668 |publisher=Jacob van Meurs |location=Amsterdam |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gri_33125009359999/page/n676 495]-496 |url=https://archive.org/details/gri_33125009359999 |quote=495. |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAnother Dutch traveler, [[David van Nyendael]], visited Benin in 1699 and also wrote an account of the kingdom. Nyendael's description was published in 1704 as an appendix to [[Willem Bosman]]'s ''Nauwkeurige beschryving van de Guinese goud-, tand- en slave-kust''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bosman |first1=Willem |title=Nauwkeurige beschryving van de Guinese goud-, tand- en slave-kust |date=1704 |publisher=Anthony Schouten |location=Utrecht |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nauwkeurigebesch00bosm_0/page/212 212]-257 |url=https://archive.org/details/nauwkeurigebesch00bosm_0 |quote=RIO FORMOSA Anders gesegt DE BENIN. |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref> In his description, Nyendael states the following about the character of the Benin people:\n\n''The inhabitants of the Benin are in general a kind and polite people, of whom one with kindness might get everything he desires. Whatever might be offered to them out of politeness, will always be doubled in return. However, they want their politeness to be returned with likewise courtesy as well, without the appearance of any disappointment or rudeness, and rightly so. To be sure, trying to take anything from them with force or violence, would be as if one tries to reach out to the [[Moon]] and will never be left unreckoned. When it comes to trade, they are very strict and will not suffer the slightest infringement of their customs, not even a [[Iota|iota]] can be changed. Though, when one is willing to accept these customs, they are very easy-going and will cooperate in every way possible to reach an agreement.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bosman |first1=Willem |title=Nauwkeurige beschryving van de Guinese goud-, tand en slave-kust |date=1704 |publisher=Anthony Schouten |location=Utrecht |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nauwkeurigebesch00bosm_0/page/222 222]-223 |url=https://archive.org/details/nauwkeurigebesch00bosm_0 |quote=de maen. |accessdate=8 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nGiven this characterization of the Benin culture, it might be understood that the Oba did not accept any colonial aspirations. As soon as the Oba began to suspect Britain of larger colonial designs, it ceased communications with them until the [[Benin Expedition of 1897|British Expedition in 1896-97]], when troops of that country captured, burned, and looted Benin City as part of a punitive mission, which brought the kingdom's imperial era to an end.<ref>Chapter 77, [[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]</ref>\n\n==Military==\nMilitary operations relied on a well trained disciplined force.<ref name=\"Osadolor\">{{cite journal |last=Osadolor |first=Osarhieme Benson |title=The military system of Benin Kingdom, c. 1440\u20131897 (D) |url=http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2001/544/pdf/abstract.pdf |publisher=University of Hamburg |date=23 July 2001 |pages=4\u2013264}}</ref> At the head of the host stood the [[Oba of Benin]]. The monarch of the realm served as supreme military commander. Beneath him were subordinate generalissimos, the ''Ezomo'', the ''Iyase'', and others who supervised a Metropolitan Regiment based in the capital, and a Royal Regiment made up of hand-picked warriors that also served as bodyguards. Benin's Queen Mother also retained her own regiment, the \"Queen's Own\". The Metropolitan and Royal regiments were relatively stable semi-permanent or permanent formations. The Village Regiments provided the bulk of the fighting force and were mobilized as needed, sending contingents of warriors upon the command of the king and his generals. Formations were broken down into sub-units under designated commanders. Foreign observers often commented favorably on Benin's discipline and organization as \"better disciplined than any other Guinea nation\", contrasting them with the slacker troops from the Gold Coast.<ref>Robert Sydney Smith, Warfare & diplomacy in pre-colonial West Africa, [[University of Wisconsin Press]]: 1989, pp. 54\u201362</ref>\n\nUntil the introduction of guns in the 15th century, traditional weapons like the spear, short sword, and bow held sway. Efforts were made to reorganize a local guild of blacksmiths in the 18th century to manufacture light firearms, but dependence on imports was still heavy. Before the coming of the gun, guilds of blacksmiths were charged with war production\u2014particularly swords and iron spearheads.<ref name=\"Osadolor\"/>\n\nBenin's tactics were well organized, with preliminary plans weighed by the Oba and his sub-commanders. Logistics were organized to support missions from the usual porter forces, water transport via canoe, and requisitioning from localities the army passed through. Movement of troops via canoes was critically important in the lagoons, creeks and rivers of the Niger Delta, a key area of Benin's domination. Tactics in the field seem to have evolved over time. While the head-on clash was well known, documentation from the 18th century shows greater emphasis on avoiding continuous battle lines, and more effort to encircle an enemy (''ifianyako'').<ref name=\"Osadolor\"/>\n\nFortifications were important in the region and numerous military campaigns fought by Benin's soldiers revolved around sieges. As noted above, Benin's military earthworks are the largest of such structures in the world, and Benin's rivals also built extensively. Barring a successful assault, most sieges were resolved by a strategy of attrition, slowly cutting off and starving out the enemy fortification until it capitulated. On occasion, however, European mercenaries were called on to aid with these sieges. In 1603\u201304 for example, European cannon helped batter and destroy the gates of a town near present-day Lagos, allowing 10,000 warriors of Benin to enter and conquer it. As payment, the Europeans received items, such as palm oil and bundles of pepper.<ref>R.S. Smith, Warfare & diplomacy pp. 54\u201362</ref> The example of Benin shows the power of indigenous military systems, but also the role outside influences and new technologies brought to bear. This is a normal pattern among many nations\n\n===Britain seeks control over trade===\nBenin began to decline after 1700. Benin's power and wealth was continuously flourishing in the 19th century with the development of the trade in palm oil, textiles, ivory, slaves, and other resources. To preserve the kingdom's independence, bit by bit the Oba banned the export of goods from Benin, until the trade was exclusively in palm oil.\n\nBy the last half of the 19th century Great Britain had come to want a closer relationship with the Kingdom of Benin; for British officials were increasingly interested in controlling trade in the area and in accessing the kingdom's rubber resources to support their own growing tire market.\n\nSeveral attempts were made to achieve this end beginning with the official visit of [[Richard Francis Burton]] in 1862 when he was consul at [[Fernando P\u00f3 (island)|Fernando P\u00f3]]. Following that came attempts to establish a treaty between Benin and the United Kingdom by Hewtt, Blair and Annesley in 1884, 1885 and 1886 respectively. However, these efforts did not yield any results. The kingdom resisted becoming a British protectorate throughout the 1880s, but the British remained persistent. Progress was made finally in 1892 during the visit of Vice-Consul [[Henry Galway]]. This mission was the first official visit after Burton's. Moreover, it would also set in motion the events to come that would lead to Oba Ovonramwen's demise.\n\n===The Galway Treaty of 1892===\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Benin had managed to retain its independence and the Oba exercised a monopoly over trade which the British found irksome. The territory was coveted by an influential group of investors for its rich natural resources such as palm-oil, rubber and ivory. After British consul Richard Burton visited Benin in 1862 he wrote of Benin's as a place of \"gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death\", a narrative which was widely publicized in Britain and increased pressure for the territory's subjugation.{{sfn|Igbafe|1970|p=385}}\nIn spite of this pressure, the kingdom maintained independence and was not visited by another representative of Britain until 1892 when [[Henry Galway|Henry Gallwey]], the British Vice-Consul of Oil Rivers Protectorate (later [[Niger Coast Protectorate]]), visited Benin City hoping to open up trade and ultimately annex Benin Kingdom and make it a [[British protectorate]].{{sfn|Igbafe|1970|pp=385-400}}  Gallwey was able to get Omo n\u2019Oba ([[Ovonramwen]]) and his chiefs to sign a treaty which gave Britain legal justification for exerting greater influence over the Empire.  While the treaty itself contains text suggesting Ovonramwen actively sought Britain's protection, this appears to be a fiction. Gallway's own account suggests the Oba was hesitant to sign the treaty.{{sfn|Igbafe|1970}} Although some suggest that humanitarian motivations were driving Britain's actions,<ref>E.G. Hernon, A. Britain's Forgotton Wars, p.409 (2002)</ref> letters written between administrators suggest that economic motivations were predominant.{{sfn|Igbafe|1970|p=387}}  The treaty itself does not explicitly mention anything about Benin's \"bloody customs\" that Burton had written about, and instead only includes a vague clause about ensuring \"the general progress of civilization\".{{sfn|Igbafe|1970|p=387}}\n\n===The conflict of 1897===\n{{Main|Benin Expedition of 1897}}\n\n[[File:Flag of the Benin Empire.svg|thumb|An unidentified [[West African flag]] allegedly brought to Britain by Admiral F. W. Kennedy after the expedition.]]\n\nWhen people in Benin discovered Britain's true intentions were an invasion to depose the king of Benin, without approval from the king his generals ordered a preemptive attack on the British party approaching Benin City, including eight unknowing British representatives, who were killed. A [[Benin Expedition of 1897|punitive expedition]] was launched in 1897. The British force, under the command of Admiral Sir [[Harry Rawson]], razed and burned the city, destroying much of the country's treasured art and dispersing nearly all that remained. The stolen portrait figures, busts, and groups created in iron, carved ivory, and especially in brass (conventionally called the \"[[Benin Bronzes]]\") are now displayed in museums around the world.\n\n==Benin today==\nThe monarchy continues to exist today as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of contemporary Nigeria.

He learned to play the guitar and formed his first group while at high school with Robert Lester, who stayed on when they joined up with two members of another local group to form The Hi-Lites and eventually changing the name to The Chi-Lites. After a few unsuccessful singles, the group was signed by [[Brunswick Records]] production chief in Chicago, Carl Davis.\n\nRecord wrote or co-wrote (often with singer [[Barbara Acklin]]) a long series of hits for the group, including million-sellers \"[[Have You Seen Her]]\" and \"[[Oh Girl]]\", as well as major hits, such as \"Homely Girl\" and \"Give More Power To The People\".

As well as returning to sing with the group, he teamed up again with Carl Davis, formerly his mentor at Brunswick, to produce and take on executive duties for Davis' [[Chi-Sound Records]] label.\n\nRecord stayed with The Chi-Lites until the mid-1980s for several albums on various labels before leaving again. Becoming a born-again Christian, he produced a [[gospel music|gospel]] album on his own Evergreen label. He also continued to make occasional guest appearances with the group.\n\nIn 1978, he appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with [[Michael Palin]].

This led to many people getting pushed by a wave of protesters as they sang protest songs and chanted \"Makibaka, huwag matakot!\" They began to move towards [[Ayala Bridge]], with the Philippine flag raised, and decided to march directly to Malaca\u00f1ang and protest in front of Marcos' doorsteps, hearing gunfire as they slowly closed by the Palace.

Due to a loud call from someone outside the Palace to turn the lights on, the Palace did just that to accommodate the request, which led to a rock crashing to one of the lamps.

Eastern Sun, a newspaper from Singapore, wrote an editorial on the January 30 riots. This article mentioned that President Marcos was right for 'taking the hard line' in dealing with the demonstrators. Although the charge that these demonstrations were part of a Communist Chinese inspired insurrection were seen as exaggerated, they found the exaggeration to be necessary to emphasize this point. Independent Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong, however, found the idea that these students were in the January 30 riot to take over the government is excessive. While the article does not deny the possibility of the involvement of some communists in the violence, \"to say that they were trying to occupy the presidential Palace in an armed uprising to set a Chinese-Communist type of ruling power was more than an exaggeration.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Shop Talk|work=Business Day|date=February 3, 1970}}</ref>\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos saw the January 30 protest and siege in Malaca\u00f1ang not only as a personal assault but also as an assault to the presidency itself.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ma\u00f1alac|first1=Gabby|title=SOFT CELL: The Understanding Gap|work=Business Day|date=February 20, 1970}}</ref> He thought of the protests as an insurrection, and only a part of a plot to overthrow the government by force.\n\n[[Juan Ponce Enrile]], who was then Secretary of Justice, recalled in his memoir that at the time of the January 30 Malaca\u00f1ang attack, President Marcos nearly announced Martial Law.<ref name=\":4\" /> President Marcos suspected that a coup was being arranged against him as none of his generals are present, and he immediately evacuated Imelda and their children to a navy ship in Manila Bay.\n\n=== February 12:Rally at Plaza Miranda ===\n{{see also|Plaza Miranda}}\nAfter the violence of the Battle of Mendiola, the [[Movement for a Democratic Philippines]] (MDP) organized a rally at the [[Plaza Miranda]] outside the [[Quiapo Church]] on February 12, 1970.  With ten to fifty thousand people present, it became known for being the largest rally to take place in Plaza Miranda.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis really was nearly called off when some conservative MDP leaders initially agreed to have a discussion with the President Marcos that evening, about concessions he was supposedly willing to offer if the leaders would call off the rally. However, KM leaders insisted on proceeding and made assurances that provocateurs would be kept out of the proceedings.<ref name=\"7DeadlyProtests\" />\n\nThe protesters sat on the streets, climbed trees, and stood on the roofs of low buildings to spend hours listening to speakers discuss and oppose the concepts of imperialism, feudalism, and fascism.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== February 18: First \"People's Congress\" and demonstration at the U.S. Embassy ===\n{{see also|Embassy of the United States, Manila|American imperialism}}\nThe MDP-organized<ref name=\"7DeadlyProtests\" /> protest on February 18, 1970 was dubbed the \"People's Congress,\"<ref name=\":0\" /> and involved about five thousand protesters who gathered at Plaza Miranda.<ref name=\"7DeadlyProtests\" />  At some point during this gathering, a group of protesters left the Plaza Miranda venue to stage a demonstration at the U.S. Embassy, which was nearby.\n\nChanting \"Makibaka! Huwag matakot!,\" some of them broke off from the crowd and marched toward the U.S. Embassy. This group attacked the embassy with rocks and pillboxes as a way of expressing their denunciation of [[American imperialism|U.S. imperialism]], and accusing the US of being fascist and of supporting Marcos.<ref name=\":6\" /> This continued for hours, lasting until the evening before the police arrived.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe next day, the American ambassador sent a note to the government protesting the \"wanton vandalism\" that took place the night before, and the Philippine government replied with a note of apology within three hours.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== February 26: \"Second People's Congress\" demonstration ===\n{{see also|Intramuros#City_walls|Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command|Philippine College of Commerce}}\nMDP militants planned what they dubbed a second \"People's Congress\" on February 26, 1970 despite not being granted a permit to rally. The radicals insisted on their right to assembly, insisting that the rally would go on with or without a permit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Manila police and [[Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command]] (METROCOM) attacked the rallyists even before they settled down at Plaza Miranda, causing the militants to disperse. So the activists reassembled at the Sunken Garden outside the walls of [[Intramuros]], and after a few speeches continued to march to the U.S. Embassy. They stoned the Embassy and fought against the police that arrived. The activists then fled and regrouped hours later on Mendiola to reenact the protest of January 30.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe police retaliated by breaking into the [[Philippine College of Commerce]], hitting the students and professors, and ransacking the offices and classrooms.<ref name=\"7DeadlyProtests\" />\n\n=== March 3: ''The People's March'' from Welcome Rotonda to Plaza Lawton ===\n{{see also|Welcome Rotonda|Plaza Lawton|Amado V.

Since the protest focused on the issue of poverty, the march's route took it through the poor ghettoes of Manila. Finding police already positioned at the Embassy when they arrived, and wanting to avoid a confrontation, the activists instead proceeded to Mendiola, where they made bonfires in the middle of the road. But the police followed them to Mendiola, dispersing the activists by releasing [[tear gas]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Dissipation after March 17 ==\nThe March 17 demonstration is generally acknowledged as the last of the major events of the First Quarter Storm, because the demonstrations had largely been led by student groups, who had at that point reached the end of the Philippines' school semester.  Many of the students left Manila to go home to the provinces for summer vacation, leading to a lull in protest actions.<ref name=\"Waltzing1987\">Bonner, Raymond. Waltzing with a Dictator: The Marcoses and the Making of American Policy. New York, NY: Times Books, 1987.</ref>\n\nHowever, numerous protests, including the [[Diliman Commune]] and the [[Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties]] rallies led by Senator [[Jose Diokno]] continued in the period between the dissipation of the First Quarter Storm and the 1972 declaration of Martial Law.\n\n==Aftermath==\n=== Radicalization of the moderate opposition ===\nViolent dispersals of various FQS protests were among the first watershed events in which large numbers of Filipino students of the 1970s were radicalized against the Marcos administration.  Due to these dispersals, many students who had previously held \u201cmoderate\u201d positions (i.e., calling for legislative reforms), such as like [[Edgar Jopson]], became convinced that they had no choice but to call for more radical social change.<ref name=\"Rodis\"/>\n\nSimilar watershed events would later include the February 1971 [[Diliman Commune]]; the August 1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the wake of the [[Plaza Miranda]] bombing; the September 1972 [[Proclamation No. 1081|declaration of Martial Law]]; the 1980 [[murder of Macli-ing Dulag]];<ref name=\"Aureus 1985\"/> the August 1983 [[assassination of Ninoy Aquino]]; and eventually, allegations of cheating during the 1986 Snap Elections which led to the non-violent [[1986 EDSA Revolution]].<ref name=\"GazetteHistoryProtest\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of these events, Marcos lumped all of the opposition together and referred to them as communists, and many former moderates fled to the mountain encampments of the radical opposition to avoid being arrested by Marcos' forces.  Those who became disenchanted with the excesses of the Marcos administration and wanted to join the opposition after 1971 often joined the ranks of the radicals, simply because they represented the only group vocally offering opposition to the Marcos government.<ref name=\"OscarFranklinTan20141208\">{{Cite news |url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/80765/why-ateneo-is-honoring-edgar-jopson |title=Why Ateneo is honoring Edgar Jopson |last=Tan |first=Oscar Franklin |date=2014-12-08 |work=Philippine Daily InquirerO |access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Pimentel2006\">{{Cite book |title=U.G. an underground tale : the journey of Edgar Jopson and the first quarter storm generation |last=Pimentel |first=Benjamin |date=2006 |publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc |isbn=9712715906 |location=Pasig City |oclc=81146038}}</ref>\n\n=== Leadup to Martial Law ===\nThe demonstrations that took place during the first quarter storm are historically remembered as the first stirrings of the social unrest which would eventually lead to Martial Law - what Petronilo Daroy referred to as \"a torrent of mass protest actions against everything that was construed as \u2018establishment.\u2019\"<ref name=\"Daroy1988\"/>\n\nIn an editorial published in ''Philippine Panorama'', Fred Reyes remarked that these bloody demonstrations may be the signs of an upcoming revolution, shying away from 'traditional Filipino values' such as ''bahala na, pakikisama,'' and ''utang na loob'' that have long hindered radical change. He also stressed that while it seems to be clear to all that change was needed, no one seemed to know what change was needed. He also noted the slight difference in tone regarding communism, as people seemed to be more understanding of their cause. He had also noted that despite the government's accusations, no communists were produced from the riot groups.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The bugaboo of Communism and student demonstrations|last=Reyes|first=Gracianus R.|date=February 15, 1970|work=Philippine Panorama|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe First Quarter Storm was followed by a year of demonstrations, varying from picketing, long marches, live theater, people's tribunal, and parliament of the streets.\n\nThese demonstrations contributed to the image of a [[CPP\u2013NPA\u2013NDF rebellion|communist insurgency]], which was used as justification for the declaration of Martial Law.\n\n=== Pro-Marcos responses ===\n\n==== Veterans' March for Democracy ====\nThe Veterans Federation of the Philippines arranged a \"March for Democracy\" where the veterans strode around Intramuros, Rizal Park, Luneta grandstand, and then to the Sunken Garden, where speeches and a pledging ceremony were held. Col. Simeon Medalla, head of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines, explains that the rally was not Marcos-inspired, contrary to allegations sprung from rumors of American officials or allies being seen at the rally and the fact that the President himself was the most decorated veteran of the previous war. Their purpose, rather, was to \"preserve the ideals and principles for which the people fought during the war,\" a statement inscribed on the large banner carried during the march. When the veterans' march was cast in a negative light by media the following morning, Medalla remarked in jest, \"Was it because there was no violence in our rally?\" On that note, Ben Florentino, head of the United Disabled Veterans Association of the Philippines, commented that if the 'young radical activists' had experienced the hardships of war as they had, then they would not be advocating violence.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|title=Vets stand up to be counted: 'Silent Majority' breaks silence|last=Catarroja|first=Sebastian|date=April 26, 1970|work=Philippine Panorama|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFlorentino and Medalla further stressed that veterans were the first group to stage demonstrations for the sake of demanding legitimate reforms from the government. They also felt the need to call for reforms but believed that these should be achieved peacefully and undergoing democratic processes. COMELEC Chairman Jamie N. Ferrer attributed the student demonstrations to the rampant corruption in the political system, while Civil Service Commissioner Abelardo Subido attributed them to the lack of dialogue between the youth and their elders, calling on parents to tell their children \"what we need is a change through peaceful means to achieve economic independence.\" <ref name=\":9\" /> Although many veterans were gladdened by the spark of student activism, they denounced the emergence of some sectors seeking to harness student power for their own ends.\n\n==== 1970 Philippine Independence Day Celebration ====\nOn the evening of June 12, 1970, media reported that the 72nd anniversary of the declaration of Philippine independence would be celebrated differently from previous years. It was reported that there would not be a grand, colorful parade, in line with the Marcos administration's policy of fiscal restraint, but instead there would be a simple, public \"military show\" by the [[Philippine Military Academy]], the Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, and the Blue Diamonds of the [[Philippine Air Force]] at eight o'clock in the morning. Furthermore, rather than tedious speeches in the middle of the day, the President would read a loyalty pledge to the Republic and the flag at seven o'clock in the morning, a time when demonstrators against the current regime could be avoided.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/1970/06/22/official-week-in-review-june-12-june-18-1970/|title=Official Week in Review: June 12 \u2013 June 18, 1970 {{!}} GOVPH|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref>\n\n== Discussions on Violence ==\n{{Tone|section|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Demonstrations as 'portents of things to come' ===\nWhen the news of the January 30 riots broke out, spectators, especially parents of the students participating in the demonstration, were appalled by the military behavior in these riots, questioning the need for armed military men at Mendiola. Participating groups of the said riots claimed that the violence was sparked by Malaca\u00f1ang guards, who threw pellets at the protesters from the inside, thus provoking demonstrators to retaliate and to ram a fire truck into the Malaca\u00f1ang No. 4 gate. These incidents of violence were heightened to bloodshed by the arrival of METROCOM and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] as some groups, such as ''Kabataang Makabayan'', claim that the armed forces attacked the students, who were virtually unarmed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThis brought into question the necessity of arms in instilling the change that these students were demanding. [[Nemesio Prudente|Dr. Nemesio Prudente]], an educator and an ardent defender of students, predicted then that the January 26 and 30 riots were 'mere portents of what is yet to come if the leadership does not meet the demands of our students,' - demands which are clean, honest competent leadership, reforms, social justice, elimination of poverty, quality and inexpensive education for all, and the right to participate in decision making. He commented on the violence, saying that it will continue until there is no proper understanding and open communication between government leaders and student groups.\n\nThese encounters exhibited the then growing prevalence of student activism, parallel to demonstrations in other countries wherein students played a large role such as the toppling of the [[Sukarno]] regime in Indonesia and the collapse of the Soviet Union through the [[Prague Spring]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Kabataang Makabayan's stand on violence ===\nSince KM was founded under the aspiration of resuming and completing the Philippine Revolution of 1896, now fighting \"a new type of colonialism,\" it sought to inspire nationalism once more in a time wherein it was considered as a dangerous concept.<ref name=\":1\" /> The organization's positive aspirations, however, are overlooked by due to the negative image of communism, brought about by the news of communist insurgents in other parts of the world and individual actions of KM members themselves, including the dissident movement in Negros, the capture of Leoncio Co and other youths in their alleged involvement in a Stalin university in Tarlak, and the rumored activism of founder Jose Maria Sison, alias Commander Guerrero, in the Huk movement in Central Luzon. As said by Astorga-Garcia:\n\n<blockquote>The KM aims to break this monopoly of power by allying with workers, peasants, progressive intellectuals, professionals and the nationalist bourgeoisie in an effort to arouse and mobilize the masses towards the attainment of national freedom and democracy. This outlook, more than anything else, explains the persistent anti-American imperialist and anti-landlord tone in the programme, pronouncements and protest mass actions of the KM. This explains why it is for the scrapping of the parity, the abrogation of the Laurel-Langley, bases treaty, military assistance treaty, mutual defense treaty\u2014in short, the elimination of RP-US 'special relations.' The KM stand on these and other important national issues have always been pursued by its members with a militance no other youth organization has equalled. That is why the military has long ago started a hate-KM campaign that has been equally militant, although oftentimes ridiculous and silly.

Once the gate broke and gave way, bold protestors charged into the Palace grounds tossing rocks, pillboxes, [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The Presidential Guard Battalion then came out in full force with their guns.

Student protesters were steadily driven out of [[Jose Laurel Street|J.P. Laurel]] and farther down [[Mendiola Street|Mendiola]], where they built a barricade to stop the riot police and armed soldiers from the Palace. As students from nearby dormitories joined them, protesters grew in numbers. Everything was improvised and they did not have any organized plan. The protestors fought the armed forces and defended themselves with sticks and pillboxes.

Eastern Sun, a newspaper from Singapore, wrote an editorial on the January 30 riots. This article mentioned that President Marcos was right for 'taking the hard line' in dealing with the demonstrators. Although the charge that these demonstrations were part of a Communist Chinese inspired insurrection were seen as exaggerated, they found the exaggeration to be necessary to emphasize this point. Independent Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong, however, found the idea that these students were in the January 30 riot to take over the government is excessive. While the article does not deny the possibility of the involvement of some communists in the violence, \"to say that they were trying to occupy the presidential Palace in an armed uprising to set a Chinese-Communist type of ruling power was more than an exaggeration.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Shop Talk|work=Business Day|date=February 3, 1970}}</ref>\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos saw the January 30 protest and siege in Malaca\u00f1ang not only as a personal assault but also as an assault to the presidency itself.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ma\u00f1alac|first1=Gabby|title=SOFT CELL: The Understanding Gap|work=Business Day|date=February 20, 1970}}</ref> He thought of the protests as an insurrection, and only a part of a plot to overthrow the government by force.\n\n[[Juan Ponce Enrile]], who was then Secretary of Justice, recalled in his memoir that at the time of the January 30 Malaca\u00f1ang attack, President Marcos nearly announced Martial Law.<ref name=\":4\" /> President Marcos suspected that a coup was being arranged against him as none of his generals are present, and he immediately evacuated Imelda and their children to a navy ship in Manila Bay.\n\n=== February 12:Rally at Plaza Miranda ===\n{{see also|Plaza Miranda}}\nAfter the violence of the Battle of Mendiola, the [[Movement for a Democratic Philippines]] (MDP) organized a rally at the [[Plaza Miranda]] outside the [[Quiapo Church]] on February 12, 1970.  With ten to fifty thousand people present, it became known for being the largest rally to take place in Plaza Miranda.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis really was nearly called off when some conservative MDP leaders initially agreed to have a discussion with the President Marcos that evening, about concessions he was supposedly willing to offer if the leaders would call off the rally. However, KM leaders insisted on proceeding and made assurances that provocateurs would be kept out of the proceedings.<ref name=\"7DeadlyProtests\" />\n\nThe protesters sat on the streets, climbed trees, and stood on the roofs of low buildings to spend hours listening to speakers discuss and oppose the concepts of imperialism, feudalism, and fascism.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== February 18: First \"People's Congress\" and demonstration at the U.S. Embassy ===\n{{see also|Embassy of the United States, Manila|American imperialism}}\nThe MDP-organized<ref name=\"7DeadlyProtests\" /> protest on February 18, 1970 was dubbed the \"People's Congress,\"<ref name=\":0\" /> and involved about five thousand protesters who gathered at Plaza Miranda.<ref name=\"7DeadlyProtests\" />  At some point during this gathering, a group of protesters left the Plaza Miranda venue to stage a demonstration at the U.S. Embassy, which was nearby.\n\nChanting \"Makibaka! Huwag matakot!,\" some of them broke off from the crowd and marched toward the U.S. Embassy. This group attacked the embassy with rocks and pillboxes as a way of expressing their denunciation of [[American imperialism|U.S. imperialism]], and accusing the US of being fascist and of supporting Marcos.<ref name=\":6\" /> This continued for hours, lasting until the evening before the police arrived.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe next day, the American ambassador sent a note to the government protesting the \"wanton vandalism\" that took place the night before, and the Philippine government replied with a note of apology within three hours.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== February 26: \"Second People's Congress\" demonstration ===\n{{see also|Intramuros#City_walls|Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command|Philippine College of Commerce}}\nMDP militants planned what they dubbed a second \"People's Congress\" on February 26, 1970 despite not being granted a permit to rally. The radicals insisted on their right to assembly, insisting that the rally would go on with or without a permit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Manila police and [[Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command]] (METROCOM) attacked the rallyists even before they settled down at Plaza Miranda, causing the militants to disperse. So the activists reassembled at the Sunken Garden outside the walls of [[Intramuros]], and after a few speeches continued to march to the U.S. Embassy. They stoned the Embassy and fought against the police that arrived. The activists then fled and regrouped hours later on Mendiola to reenact the protest of January 30.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe police retaliated by breaking into the [[Philippine College of Commerce]], hitting the students and professors, and ransacking the offices and classrooms.<ref name=\"7DeadlyProtests\" />\n\n=== March 3: ''The People's March'' from Welcome Rotonda to Plaza Lawton ===\n{{see also|Welcome Rotonda|Plaza Lawton|Amado V. Hernandez}}\nThe protest of March 3, 1970 was organized by the MDP students and urban groups in support of jeepney drivers who held a citywide strike on that date to protest \"''tong''\"(bribe)-collecting traffic policemen.  Dubbed the \u201cPeoples\u2019 March,\u201d it involved a protest march from [[Welcome Rotonda]] on the boundary of Quezon City and the City of Manila, and passed by [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] and [[Plaza Lawton]] before ending up at the U.S. Embassy.\n\nAccording to reports, this march ended in one-sided battles between gun-toting police riot squads and stone-hurling demonstrators, seems to give people an endless number of reasons{{editorializing|date=March 2020}} to hold mass gatherings of students, farmers, and laborers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Demonstrations here to stay|last=Reyes|first=Fred J.|date=March 15, 1970|work=Philippine Panorama|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nEven though the protest involved long walks from one assembly point to another, the organizations participating in the march multiplied. \nWhen the protesters reached the U.S. Embassy, where they again struggled with the police.<ref name=\":0\" /> The police were more aggressive this time, chasing the activists all over the city.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnrique Sta.

Since the protest focused on the issue of poverty, the march's route took it through the poor ghettoes of Manila. Finding police already positioned at the Embassy when they arrived, and wanting to avoid a confrontation, the activists instead proceeded to Mendiola, where they made bonfires in the middle of the road. But the police followed them to Mendiola, dispersing the activists by releasing [[tear gas]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Dissipation after March 17 ==\nThe March 17 demonstration is generally acknowledged as the last of the major events of the First Quarter Storm, because the demonstrations had largely been led by student groups, who had at that point reached the end of the Philippines' school semester.  Many of the students left Manila to go home to the provinces for summer vacation, leading to a lull in protest actions.<ref name=\"Waltzing1987\">Bonner, Raymond. Waltzing with a Dictator: The Marcoses and the Making of American Policy. New York, NY: Times Books, 1987.</ref>\n\nHowever, numerous protests, including the [[Diliman Commune]] and the [[Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties]] rallies led by Senator [[Jose Diokno]] continued in the period between the dissipation of the First Quarter Storm and the 1972 declaration of Martial Law.\n\n==Aftermath==\n=== Radicalization of the moderate opposition ===\nViolent dispersals of various FQS protests were among the first watershed events in which large numbers of Filipino students of the 1970s were radicalized against the Marcos administration.  Due to these dispersals, many students who had previously held \u201cmoderate\u201d positions (i.e., calling for legislative reforms), such as like [[Edgar Jopson]], became convinced that they had no choice but to call for more radical social change.<ref name=\"Rodis\"/>\n\nSimilar watershed events would later include the February 1971 [[Diliman Commune]]; the August 1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the wake of the [[Plaza Miranda]] bombing; the September 1972 [[Proclamation No. 1081|declaration of Martial Law]]; the 1980 [[murder of Macli-ing Dulag]];<ref name=\"Aureus 1985\"/> the August 1983 [[assassination of Ninoy Aquino]]; and eventually, allegations of cheating during the 1986 Snap Elections which led to the non-violent [[1986 EDSA Revolution]].<ref name=\"GazetteHistoryProtest\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of these events, Marcos lumped all of the opposition together and referred to them as communists, and many former moderates fled to the mountain encampments of the radical opposition to avoid being arrested by Marcos' forces.  Those who became disenchanted with the excesses of the Marcos administration and wanted to join the opposition after 1971 often joined the ranks of the radicals, simply because they represented the only group vocally offering opposition to the Marcos government.<ref name=\"OscarFranklinTan20141208\">{{Cite news |url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/80765/why-ateneo-is-honoring-edgar-jopson |title=Why Ateneo is honoring Edgar Jopson |last=Tan |first=Oscar Franklin |date=2014-12-08 |work=Philippine Daily InquirerO |access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Pimentel2006\">{{Cite book |title=U.G. an underground tale : the journey of Edgar Jopson and the first quarter storm generation |last=Pimentel |first=Benjamin |date=2006 |publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc |isbn=9712715906 |location=Pasig City |oclc=81146038}}</ref>\n\n=== Leadup to Martial Law ===\nThe demonstrations that took place during the first quarter storm are historically remembered as the first stirrings of the social unrest which would eventually lead to Martial Law - what Petronilo Daroy referred to as \"a torrent of mass protest actions against everything that was construed as \u2018establishment.\u2019\"<ref name=\"Daroy1988\"/>\n\nIn an editorial published in ''Philippine Panorama'', Fred Reyes remarked that these bloody demonstrations may be the signs of an upcoming revolution, shying away from 'traditional Filipino values' such as ''bahala na, pakikisama,'' and ''utang na loob'' that have long hindered radical change. He also stressed that while it seems to be clear to all that change was needed, no one seemed to know what change was needed. He also noted the slight difference in tone regarding communism, as people seemed to be more understanding of their cause. He had also noted that despite the government's accusations, no communists were produced from the riot groups.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The bugaboo of Communism and student demonstrations|last=Reyes|first=Gracianus R.|date=February 15, 1970|work=Philippine Panorama|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe First Quarter Storm was followed by a year of demonstrations, varying from picketing, long marches, live theater, people's tribunal, and parliament of the streets.\n\nThese demonstrations contributed to the image of a [[CPP\u2013NPA\u2013NDF rebellion|communist insurgency]], which was used as justification for the declaration of Martial Law.\n\n=== Pro-Marcos responses ===\n\n==== Veterans' March for Democracy ====\nThe Veterans Federation of the Philippines arranged a \"March for Democracy\" where the veterans strode around Intramuros, Rizal Park, Luneta grandstand, and then to the Sunken Garden, where speeches and a pledging ceremony were held. Col. Simeon Medalla, head of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines, explains that the rally was not Marcos-inspired, contrary to allegations sprung from rumors of American officials or allies being seen at the rally and the fact that the President himself was the most decorated veteran of the previous war. Their purpose, rather, was to \"preserve the ideals and principles for which the people fought during the war,\" a statement inscribed on the large banner carried during the march. When the veterans' march was cast in a negative light by media the following morning, Medalla remarked in jest, \"Was it because there was no violence in our rally?\" On that note, Ben Florentino, head of the United Disabled Veterans Association of the Philippines, commented that if the 'young radical activists' had experienced the hardships of war as they had, then they would not be advocating violence.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|title=Vets stand up to be counted: 'Silent Majority' breaks silence|last=Catarroja|first=Sebastian|date=April 26, 1970|work=Philippine Panorama|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFlorentino and Medalla further stressed that veterans were the first group to stage demonstrations for the sake of demanding legitimate reforms from the government. They also felt the need to call for reforms but believed that these should be achieved peacefully and undergoing democratic processes. COMELEC Chairman Jamie N. Ferrer attributed the student demonstrations to the rampant corruption in the political system, while Civil Service Commissioner Abelardo Subido attributed them to the lack of dialogue between the youth and their elders, calling on parents to tell their children \"what we need is a change through peaceful means to achieve economic independence.\" <ref name=\":9\" /> Although many veterans were gladdened by the spark of student activism, they denounced the emergence of some sectors seeking to harness student power for their own ends.\n\n==== 1970 Philippine Independence Day Celebration ====\nOn the evening of June 12, 1970, media reported that the 72nd anniversary of the declaration of Philippine independence would be celebrated differently from previous years. It was reported that there would not be a grand, colorful parade, in line with the Marcos administration's policy of fiscal restraint, but instead there would be a simple, public \"military show\" by the [[Philippine Military Academy]], the Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, and the Blue Diamonds of the [[Philippine Air Force]] at eight o'clock in the morning. Furthermore, rather than tedious speeches in the middle of the day, the President would read a loyalty pledge to the Republic and the flag at seven o'clock in the morning, a time when demonstrators against the current regime could be avoided.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/1970/06/22/official-week-in-review-june-12-june-18-1970/|title=Official Week in Review: June 12 \u2013 June 18, 1970 {{!}} GOVPH|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref>\n\n== Discussions on Violence ==\n{{Tone|section|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Demonstrations as 'portents of things to come' ===\nWhen the news of the January 30 riots broke out, spectators, especially parents of the students participating in the demonstration, were appalled by the military behavior in these riots, questioning the need for armed military men at Mendiola. Participating groups of the said riots claimed that the violence was sparked by Malaca\u00f1ang guards, who threw pellets at the protesters from the inside, thus provoking demonstrators to retaliate and to ram a fire truck into the Malaca\u00f1ang No. 4 gate. These incidents of violence were heightened to bloodshed by the arrival of METROCOM and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] as some groups, such as ''Kabataang Makabayan'', claim that the armed forces attacked the students, who were virtually unarmed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThis brought into question the necessity of arms in instilling the change that these students were demanding. [[Nemesio Prudente|Dr. Nemesio Prudente]], an educator and an ardent defender of students, predicted then that the January 26 and 30 riots were 'mere portents of what is yet to come if the leadership does not meet the demands of our students,' - demands which are clean, honest competent leadership, reforms, social justice, elimination of poverty, quality and inexpensive education for all, and the right to participate in decision making. He commented on the violence, saying that it will continue until there is no proper understanding and open communication between government leaders and student groups.\n\nThese encounters exhibited the then growing prevalence of student activism, parallel to demonstrations in other countries wherein students played a large role such as the toppling of the [[Sukarno]] regime in Indonesia and the collapse of the Soviet Union through the [[Prague Spring]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Kabataang Makabayan's stand on violence ===\nSince KM was founded under the aspiration of resuming and completing the Philippine Revolution of 1896, now fighting \"a new type of colonialism,\" it sought to inspire nationalism once more in a time wherein it was considered as a dangerous concept.<ref name=\":1\" /> The organization's positive aspirations, however, are overlooked by due to the negative image of communism, brought about by the news of communist insurgents in other parts of the world and individual actions of KM members themselves, including the dissident movement in Negros, the capture of Leoncio Co and other youths in their alleged involvement in a Stalin university in Tarlak, and the rumored activism of founder Jose Maria Sison, alias Commander Guerrero, in the Huk movement in Central Luzon. As said by Astorga-Garcia:\n\n<blockquote>The KM aims to break this monopoly of power by allying with workers, peasants, progressive intellectuals, professionals and the nationalist bourgeoisie in an effort to arouse and mobilize the masses towards the attainment of national freedom and democracy. This outlook, more than anything else, explains the persistent anti-American imperialist and anti-landlord tone in the programme, pronouncements and protest mass actions of the KM. This explains why it is for the scrapping of the parity, the abrogation of the Laurel-Langley, bases treaty, military assistance treaty, mutual defense treaty\u2014in short, the elimination of RP-US 'special relations.' The KM stand on these and other important national issues have always been pursued by its members with a militance no other youth organization has equalled. That is why the military has long ago started a hate-KM campaign that has been equally militant, although oftentimes ridiculous and silly. Whenever violence erupts in a demonstration participated in by the KM, the military authorities are quick in pinpointing the KM as the instigator of violence.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Left to Right: The Student Activists|last=Astorga-Garcia|first=Milla|date=February 22, 1970|work=The Sunday Times Magazine|access-date=|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the group justifies this violence by considering it as an objective reality while maintaining their position that, while KM has taken part in numerous demonstrations that had led to violence, the riots have been incited by the police and not their members. The KM was more concerned with the \"politicalization of the masses,\" and if they wanted to stage an armed revolution, they would have come bearing arms to rallies.<ref name=\":2\">Torrevillas-Suarez, Domini. \"Violence in the Streets: The Battle of Mendiola.\" Philippine Panorama, February 15, 1970, 4-6.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{regchangeRP}}\n*[[German student movement]], late 1960s communist student movement\n*[[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]], general strike in 1968 France\n*[[Tlatelolco massacre]], violent student protests in 1968 Mexico just before the [[1968 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] held in Mexico City\n*[[List of conflicts related to the Cold War]]\n*[[Battle of Marawi]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Martial EDSA |state=expanded}}\n{{The Marcoses}}\n\n[[Category:1970 in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:1970 riots]]\n[[Category:Communism in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1965\u201386)]]\n[[Category:Protests in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos]]\n[[Category:January 1970 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:February 1970 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:March 1970 events in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Chieharumachi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe \"radical\" opposition:layout typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Quarter_Storm"}

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

Although it did not sell, it caught the attention of an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] programming executive. He met with Thomas, and expressed interest in casting her in her own series. With their encouragement, Thomas came up with her own idea for a show about a young woman who leaves home, moves to New York City, and struggles to become an actress. The network was initially hesitant, fearing audiences would find a series centering on a single female uninteresting or unrealistic.\n\nThe concept eventually evolved into the sitcom entitled ''[[That Girl]]'', in which Thomas played Ann Marie, a beautiful, up-and-coming actress with a writer boyfriend, played by [[Ted Bessell]]. The series told the daily struggles of Ann holding different temporary jobs while pursuing her dream of a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. ''That Girl'' was one of the first television shows to focus on a working, single woman who did not live with her parents, and it paved the way for many shows to come. Thomas was only the second woman to produce her own series, following [[Lucille Ball]]. ''That Girl'' aired from 1966 to 1971, producing 136 episodes, and was a solid performer in the [[Nielsen ratings]].\n\nIn 1971, Thomas chose to end the series after five years. Both ABC and the show's sponsor, [[Clairol]], wanted the series finale to be a wedding between the two central characters, but Thomas rebuffed them, saying that she felt it was the wrong message to send to her female audience, because it would give the impression that the only happy ending is [[marriage]].

Although it did not sell, it caught the attention of an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] programming executive. He met with Thomas, and expressed interest in casting her in her own series. With their encouragement, Thomas came up with her own idea for a show about a young woman who leaves home, moves to New York City, and struggles to become an actress. The network was initially hesitant, fearing audiences would find a series centering on a single female uninteresting or unrealistic.\n\nThe concept eventually evolved into the sitcom entitled ''[[That Girl]]'', in which Thomas played Ann Marie, a beautiful, up-and-coming actress with a writer boyfriend, played by [[Ted Bessell]]. The series told the daily struggles of Ann holding different temporary jobs while pursuing her dream of a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. ''That Girl'' was one of the first television shows to focus on a working, single woman who did not live with her parents, and it paved the way for many shows to come. Thomas was only the second woman to produce her own series, following [[Lucille Ball]]. ''That Girl'' aired from 1966 to 1971, producing 136 episodes, and was a solid performer in the [[Nielsen ratings]].\n\nIn 1971, Thomas chose to end the series after five years. Both ABC and the show's sponsor, [[Clairol]], wanted the series finale to be a wedding between the two central characters, but Thomas rebuffed them, saying that she felt it was the wrong message to send to her female audience, because it would give the impression that the only happy ending is [[marriage]].

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s  surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>. Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election. That September, the party joined with the other members of the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] in the successful Yes-Yes campaign in the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]] which lead to the establishment of a [[Scottish Parliament]] with tax-varying powers.\n\nBy 1999, the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections]] to the parliament were being held, although the party suffered a disappointing result, gaining just 35 MSPs in the face of Salmond's unpopular '[[Kosovo]] Broadcast' which opposed [[NATO intervention in Kosovo|NATO intervention]] in the country<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/politics-anti-bombing-salmond-hits-an-all-time-low-with-voters-1086961.html|title=Politics: Anti-bombing Salmond hits an all-time low with voters|date=1999-04-13|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Opposing Labour-Liberal Democrat Coalitions (1999-2007) ===\nThis meant that the party began as the official opposition in the parliament to a [[Dewar government|Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government]].

Constituency Associations are composed of delegates from all of the Branches within the constituency.\n\nThe annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP, and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee. The National Conference is composed of:\n* delegates from every Branch and Constituency Association\n* the members of the National Executive Committee\n* 15 members elected by the National Conference\n* every SNP MSP, MP and MEP\n* a number of SNP local councillors, and\n* delegates from one of the SNP's Affiliated Organisations ([[Young Scots for Independence]], [[SNP Students]], [[SNP Trade Union Group]] and the Association of Nationalist Councillors)\n\nThe National Council serves as the SNP's governing body between National Conferences, and its decisions are binding, unless rescinded or modified by the National Conference. There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussion of party policy by party members.\n\nThe party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference). The SNP parliamentarians (Holyrood and Westminster) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.\n\n===National Executive Committee===\nThe National Executive Committee is composed of:\n* President: [[Ian Hudghton]]\n* Leader: [[Nicola Sturgeon]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] <small>([[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]])</small>\n* Depute Leader: [[Keith Brown (Scottish politician)|Keith Brown]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] <small>([[Clackmannanshire and Dunblane (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire and Dunblane]])</small>\n* National Treasurer: [[Colin Beattie]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] <small>([[Midlothian North and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Midlothian North and Musselburgh]])</small>\n* National Secretary: Dr Angus MacLeod\n* Business Convener: [[Kirsten Oswald]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] <small>([[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]])</small>\n* Organisation Convener: Stacy Bradley\n* Member Support Convener: John Clark \n* Policy Development Convener: [[Alyn Smith]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] <small>([[Stirling (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling]])</small>\n* Local Government Convener: Councillor Ellen Forson <small>([[Clackmannanshire South]])</small>\n* Women's Convener: Councillor Rhiannon Spear <small>([[Greater Pollok (ward)|Greater Pollok]])</small>\n* Equalities Convener: Fiona Robertson\n* Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Convener: Councillor Graham Campbell <small>([[Springburn/Robroyston (ward)|Springburn/Robroyston]])</small>\n* Disabled Members' Convener: Morag Fulton\n* [[Tommy Sheppard]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] <small>([[Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East]])</small>\n* [[Alison Thewliss]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] <small>([[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]])</small>\n* Sixteen regional representatives\n* Representatives from the Association of Nationalist Councillors and affiliated organisations\n\n===Membership===\nSince 18 September 2014 (the day of the Scottish independence referendum), party membership has more than quadrupled (from 25,642), surpassing the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and, briefly, [[Conservatives (UK)|Conservatives]] to become the second-largest political party in the United Kingdom in terms of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160//|title=New figures show our party is now powered by 125,482 members - making @theSNP the second biggest party in the UK.|access-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524143611/https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160|archive-date=24 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As of August 2018, the Party has 125,482 members.\n\n===European affiliation===\nThe SNP retains close links with [[Plaid Cymru]], its counterpart in [[Wales]].

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nGradualism stands in opposition to the so-called fundamentalist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it. The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/06/uk.politicalnews1|title=SNP's radical wing threatens to split party|last=Seenan|first=By Gerard|date=1999-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Notable fundamentalists ===\n* [[Kenny MacAskill]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Margo MacDonald]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Notable gradualists ===\n* [[Alex Salmond]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[John Swinney]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/snp/865888.stm|title=Tussle for the top |website= BBC News |date=21 September 2000 |access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom|Scotland}}\n* [[Culture of Scotland]]\n* [[Politics of Scotland]]\n* [[History of Scottish devolution]]\n* [[It's Scotland's oil]]\n* [[Radio Free Scotland]]\n* [[Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\n* [[The National (Scotland)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brand, Jack, ''The National Movement in Scotland'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978\n* Brand, Jack, \u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), ''Contemporary Minority Nationalism'', Routledge, 1990\n* [[Winnie Ewing]], [[Michael Russell (politician)|Michael Russell]], ''Stop the World; The Autobiography of Winnie Ewing'' [[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]], 2004\n* [[Richard J.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s  surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]].

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to [[nuclear weapon]]s: a policy that has remained in place ever since.<ref name=\"Mitchell19961994\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=194}}</ref> The 1964 policy document, ''SNP & You'', contained a clear centre-left policy platform, including commitments to [[full employment]], government intervention in fuel, power and transport, a state bank to guide economic development, encouragement of [[cooperative]]s and [[credit union]]s, extensive building of [[council house]]s (social housing) by central and local government, pensions adjusted to cost of living, a [[minimum wage]] and an improved [[NHS Scotland|national health service]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nThe 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNP's efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland, with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group, and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns, such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a co-operative.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party, and proposed a range of social democratic policies.<ref name=\"Brand199027\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=27|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Hassan2009121\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=121}}</ref> There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the ''Scottish National Party (Social Democrats)''.<ref name=\"Hepburn2013143\">{{cite book|author=Eve Hepburn|title=New Challenges for Stateless Nationalist and Regionalist Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96596-1|page=143|access-date=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503092815/https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the UK wide referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change, the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Devenney|first=Andrew D.|date=2008|title=Regional Resistance to European Integration: The Case of the Scottish National Party, 1961-1972|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20762312|journal=Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung|volume=33|issue=3 (125)|pages=319\u2013345|issn=0172-6404}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37107148|title=The dilemma facing Scotland's Eurosceptic nationalists|last=Ley|first=Shaun|date=2016-08-18|access-date=2020-01-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThere were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979, with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a \"social-democratic\" party, to an expressly \"[[socialism|socialist]]\" party. Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Current ideology===\nThe SNP's policy base is mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nGradualism stands in opposition to the so-called fundamentalist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it. The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/06/uk.politicalnews1|title=SNP's radical wing threatens to split party|last=Seenan|first=By Gerard|date=1999-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Notable fundamentalists ===\n* [[Kenny MacAskill]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Margo MacDonald]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Notable gradualists ===\n* [[Alex Salmond]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[John Swinney]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/snp/865888.stm|title=Tussle for the top |website= BBC News |date=21 September 2000 |access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom|Scotland}}\n* [[Culture of Scotland]]\n* [[Politics of Scotland]]\n* [[History of Scottish devolution]]\n* [[It's Scotland's oil]]\n* [[Radio Free Scotland]]\n* [[Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\n* [[The National (Scotland)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brand, Jack, ''The National Movement in Scotland'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978\n* Brand, Jack, \u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), ''Contemporary Minority Nationalism'', Routledge, 1990\n* [[Winnie Ewing]], [[Michael Russell (politician)|Michael Russell]], ''Stop the World; The Autobiography of Winnie Ewing'' [[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]], 2004\n* [[Richard J.

It was designed by [[Polyphony Digital]], the same team behind the popular ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' [[auto racing]] series. Tourist Trophy is one of only four titles for the [[PlayStation 2]] that is capable of [[1080i]] output, another being ''Gran Turismo 4'', the game engine of which is heavily used in ''Tourist Trophy''.\n\n''Tourist Trophy'' was first released in [[China]] on January 26, 2006, then in [[Japan]] on February 2, 2006. The [[NTSC]] edition was officially released on April 4, 2006 with seven extra motorcycles, new riding gear, seven bonus [[background music]] tracks, enhanced visual effects, an exclusive \"Semi-Pro Mode\" and bike profiles. The [[PAL]] edition was launched on June 1, 2006 in Australia, and in Europe the next day. The PAL version offers two additional motorcycles and five new BGM tracks from European artists [[Infadels]], [[Vitalic]] and Hystereo.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n=== TT Mode ===\n\n==== License School ====\n''Tourist Trophy's'' core \"Race Event\" mode requires licenses, gained after completing riding lessons on various circuits using various motorcycles. There are four licenses to unlock, and each following license is progressively more difficult to obtain and allows the player to unlock faster motorcycles upon completion.\n\n====Challenge Mode====\nUnlike the ''Gran Turismo'' games, ''Tourist Trophy'' does not contain a currency system. The player has to obtain licenses in order to complete short races in \"Challenge Mode\" and win motorcycles to add to their garage.  Motorcycles won by the player are used and tuned to compete in championships, and are unlocked for use in Arcade Mode.\n\nThe developers have recreated 135 motorcycles with [[Engine displacement|engine displacements]] from [[Yamaha TZ125|124 cc]] to [[Yamaha MT-01|1670 cc]], including both road and race versions from 1961 through 2007. Dedicated racing bikes exist as semi-licensed \"RacingModified\" versions of street bikes, as well as five official fully licensed 2005 [[Suzuka 8 Hours]] [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance]] bikes. Motorcycles from many major manufacturers, as well as two specialized Japanese tuners, [[Moriwaki Engineering|Moriwaki]] and [[Pops Yoshimura|Yoshimura]], are included; bikes from the latter two can only be obtained as prizes in Race Events.\n\nThe motorcycle selection covers a broad range of modern motorcycles, including [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]s, [[Enduro motorcycle|enduros]], motards, [[Sport bike|sports bike]]s and [[naked bike]]s, as well as any respective \"RacingModified\" versions. For \"RacingModified\" bikes, a [[Number (sports)|racing number]] from 5 through 99 can be selected\u2014numbers 1 through 4 must be won in Race Events.\n\n==== Race Event ====\nRace Events are championships that consist of multiple races. Winning all races within a championship will award new motorcycles and riding gear, and finishing an entire championship will grant the player's motorcycle a special racing number depending on their overall position.\n\nBeating all Race Events will unlock a bonus 23rd Race Event, extra motorcycles, new tracks, and a classic racing motorcycle, the Honda RC162. Completing the game will unlock the \"Ending Movie\" and add the \"[[Rosso (band)|Clover Crown]]\" ending theme to the \"Music Theater\".\n\n==== Riding Gear ====\nA feature exclusive to ''Tourist Trophy'' is \"Riding Gear\" (named \"Closet\" in the Asian editions). The player can unlock and collect 186 different riding accessories for their [[Player character|rider]], including different helmets, gloves, boots or shoes, pants, one-piece racing suits, and jackets commercially available from more than a dozen manufacturers ([[Simpson Performance Products|Simpson]], Vanson Leathers, [[Alpinestars]], [[Arai (company)|Arai]], [[Shoei]], Kushitani, RS Taichi, [[Dainese]], [[AGV (helmet manufacturer)|AGV]], [[Lewis Leathers]], [[Bell Helmets|Bell]], SPIDI, and XPD). Up to four different combinations can be saved, including two racing suits and two casual outfits.\n\nCertain motorcycles (specifically, the [[Suzuka 8 Hours]] racing motorcycles) have their own respective racing suits, which can only be used with said bikes selected. The player cannot use any other riding gear with these motorcycles.\n\n===Riding Form===\nThe \"Riding Form\" option is available in both Arcade Mode and TT Mode.\n\nBefore an Arcade Mode race, the user can choose among four Riding Form presets: \"Lean Body\", \"Neutral\", \"Lean Bike\" and \"[[Supermoto|Motard]]/Dirt\". Lean Body focuses on quick cornering, Neutral focuses on handling, and Lean Bike prioritizes slow cornering. The Motard/Dirt form with one leg out in turns is dedicated to [[Enduro motorcycle|enduro]] and [[naked bike]] riding; however, the user is free to use it on all bikes. This mode is named after the mode in Gran Turismo games.\n\nIn TT Mode, the user can enter the Garage Riding Form settings with up to four fully customizable forms to save. They are saved as \"Form A\", \"Form B\", \"Form C\" and \"Motard/Dirt\". Each one has eleven unique parameters and four presets: \"Neutral\", \"Lean Body\", \"Lean Bike\" and \"Motard/Dirt\" from which to choose. The adjustable parameters are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/929988-tourist-trophy/faqs/42513|title=Tourist Trophy Riding Form FAQ for PlayStation 2 by aj_the_one - GameFAQs|website=gamefaqs.gamespot.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref>\n\n* \"Head Roll Angle\" dictates how far to the side the rider's head turns in corners.\n* \"Head Pitch Angle\" dictates how far up or down the rider's head is positioned.\n* \"Lateral Slide\" determines how far the rider's hips slide towards the inside of a turn. Increasing this value will raise cornering speed at the cost of stability.\n* \"Vertical Slide\" dictates how much the rider tucks their body into the bike in corners.\n* \"Body Lean (Full Bank)\" dictates the extent to which the rider leans into corners.\n* \"Torso Roll Angle\" determines the rider's torso roll in corners. This setting has a significant impact on stability in turns.\n* \"Torso Yaw Angle\" determines how far the rider's torso twists toward corners. Decreasing this value results in increased responsiveness.\n* \"Arm Angle\" determines how far in or out the rider's arms are positioned. Decreasing this value results in increased cornering speed at the cost of responsiveness.\n* \"Seat Position (Forward/Back)\" determines how far forward or back the rider sits, influencing their posture and the extent to which they tuck.\n* \"Leg Angle\" works much the same as the \"Arm Angle\" setting, offering increased responsiveness while sacrificing cornering speed.\n* \"Body Lean (Upright)\" dictates the extent to which the rider tucks on straights. An increased value results in higher acceleration and top speed.\n\n=== Gameplay settings ===\n''Tourist Trophy's'' default setting is \"Normal\". Using the Normal setting, the player can perform maneuvers such as [[wheelie|wheelies]] and the [[stoppie|stoppies]] on powerful-enough bikes. These possibilities are disabled with the \"Professional\" setting. Enabling \"Professional\" will enhance the simulation aspect as well as the difficulty level, over the arcade-oriented Normal. The \"Professional\" setting is supposed to allow a more realistic experience with autonomous upper body control (as the \"Tuck\" manual function is enabled), and separate front and rear brake controls replace the double-brake default system. \"Semi-Pro Mode\" is an exclusive feature of the North American edition. Other options enhancing difficulty are \"Strict Judgment\"\u2014a 10-second slow down penalty as seen in ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]''\u2014and a \"[[Racing line|Best Line]]\" display.\n\n===Other features===\n\n====Photo mode and \"Best Shot\"====\nPre-generated photos can be taken from a race replay and saved on a PS2 [[memory card]] or a connected [[USB flash drive]], like in [[Gran Turismo 4]]. This function is known in the game as \"Best Shot\". Using various replay angles as a digital camera, the game is able to produce a selection of [[Screenshot|screenshots]] with variable compression rate (Normal, Fine, or Super Fine) and size (up to 1280x960/72 dpi). The user can choose to save the photo, print it with an [[Epson]]-compatible USB printer, or display it on TV using the \"Musical [[Diaporama]]\" feature. Saved game screenshots can be exchanged with friends or made public on the Internet. Unlike Best Shot, Photo Mode's parameters are fully adjustable and it gives the user the opportunity to compose their own photographs. The user can tune various parameters such as camera angle or course section. Formatting the USB device in Photo Mode or Best Shot will create the \"DCIM/100PDITT\" folder, allowing ''Tourist Trophy'' to store, upload and download game picture files generated under the form \"IMG_00X.JPG\". Standard USB 2.0 flash drives (including MP3 players and mobile phones) can be used to manage game JPEG files instead of the official I-O Data model.\n\n====Replay/ghost files====\nA [[USB flash drive]] can host ''Tourist Trophy'' replay/[[Glossary of video game terms#ghost|ghost]] files downloaded from either the official game website or elsewhere online. It can also be used to exchange files with another USB device. Once the files are in the flash drive, the user can upload them from within the game in order to compete with a ghost (\"Time Attack\") or to watch a replay (\"Replay Theater\"). Each file can be used as Replay or as Ghost. The first such files released on the Japanese site featured Japanese pro rider and ''Tourist Trophy'' test rider Satoshi Tsujimoto and ''Tourist Trophy'' producer [[Kazunori Yamauchi]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Formatting the USB device from Theater Mode will create the \"PDI\" folder, allowing ''Tourist Trophy'' to store, upload and download files generated under the name \"replay[[.dat]]\". Standard third-party USB devices are also compatible with such files.\n\n==Development==\nPolyphony Digital reused the physics engine, [[graphical user interface]] design, and all but one circuit from ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]''. However, the number of AI racers (computer-controlled opponents) has been reduced from five in the ''Gran Turismo'' series to only three. ''Tourist Trophy'' also uses the License School feature that was popularized by the ''Gran Turismo'' series, as well as the Photo Mode introduced in ''Gran Turismo 4''. The B-spec mode, which appeared in ''Gran Turismo 4'', was removed from ''Tourist Trophy''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nWhile wet, dirt and reverse classic ''GT4'' racing conditions, and tracks such as [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] have been removed (as the game doesn't have any motorcycles eligible for snow and dirt conditions); a unique course was specially recreated for ''Tourist Trophy''. The [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo|Circuit de la Comunitat Valenciana Ricardo Tormo]] is an official track appearing in the [[Superbike World Championship]] and [[MotoGP]].

It was designed by [[Polyphony Digital]], the same team behind the popular ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' [[auto racing]] series. Tourist Trophy is one of only four titles for the [[PlayStation 2]] that is capable of [[1080i]] output, another being ''Gran Turismo 4'', the game engine of which is heavily used in ''Tourist Trophy''.\n\n''Tourist Trophy'' was first released in [[China]] on January 26, 2006, then in [[Japan]] on February 2, 2006. The [[NTSC]] edition was officially released on April 4, 2006 with seven extra motorcycles, new riding gear, seven bonus background music (BGM) tracks, enhanced visual effects, an exclusive \"Semi-Pro Mode\" and bike profiles. The [[PAL]] edition was launched on June 1, 2006 in Australia, and in Europe the next day. The PAL version offers two additional motorcycles and five new BGM tracks from European artists [[Infadels]], [[Vitalic]] and Hystereo.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n=== TT Mode ===\n\n==== License School ====\n''Tourist Trophy's'' core \"Race Event\" mode requires licenses, gained after completing riding lessons on various circuits using various motorcycles. There are four licenses to unlock, and each following license is progressively more difficult to obtain and allows the player to unlock faster motorcycles upon completion.\n\n====Challenge Mode====\nUnlike the ''Gran Turismo'' games, ''Tourist Trophy'' does not contain a currency system. The player has to obtain licenses in order to complete short races in \"Challenge Mode\" and win motorcycles to add to their garage.  Motorcycles won by the player are used and tuned to compete in championships, and are unlocked for use in Arcade Mode.\n\nThe developers have recreated 135 motorcycles from [[Yamaha TZ125|124 cc]] up to [[Yamaha MT-01|1670 cc]], including both road and race versions from 1961 through 2007. Dedicated racing bikes are divided into categories: semi-licensed \"RacingModified\" versions of street bikes, and five official fully licensed 2005 [[Suzuka 8 Hours]] endurance bikes. Motorcycles from all major manufacturers, as well as two specialized Japanese tuners, [[Moriwaki Engineering|Moriwaki]] and [[Pops Yoshimura|Yoshimura]], are included; bikes from the latter two can only be obtained as prizes in Race Events.\n\nThe motorcycle selection covers a broad range of modern motorcycles, including [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]s, [[Enduro motorcycle|enduros]], motards, [[Sport bike|sports bike]]s and [[naked bike]]s, as well as versions modified for racing (labelled \"RacingModified\"). For \"RacingModified\" bikes, a [[Number (sports)|racing number]] from 4 through 100 can be selected\u2014numbers 1 through 4 must be won in Race Events.\n\n==== Race Event ====\nRace Events are championships that consist of multiple races. Winning all races within a championship will award new motorcycles and riding gear, and finishing an entire championship will grant the player's motorcycle a special racing number depending on their overall position.\n\nBeating all Race Events will unlock a bonus 23rd Race Event, extra motorcycles, new tracks, and a classic racing motorcycle, the Honda RC162. Completing the game will unlock the \"Ending Movie\" and add the \"[[Rosso (band)|Clover Crown]]\" ending theme to the \"Music Theater\".\n\n==== Riding Gear ====\nA feature exclusive to ''Tourist Trophy'' is \"Riding Gear\" (named \"Closet\" in the Asian editions). The player can unlock and collect 186 different riding accessories for their [[Player character|rider]], including different helmets, gloves, boots or shoes, pants, one-piece racing suits, and jackets commercially available from more than a dozen manufacturers ([[Simpson Performance Products|Simpson]], Vanson Leathers, [[Alpinestars]], [[Arai (company)|Arai]], [[Shoei]], Kushitani, RS Taichi, [[Dainese]], [[AGV (helmet manufacturer)|AGV]], [[Lewis Leathers]], [[Bell Helmets|Bell]], SPIDI, and XPD). Up to four different combinations can be saved, including two racing suits and two casual outfits.\n\nCertain motorcycles (specifically, the [[Suzuka 8 Hours]] racing motorcycles) have their own respective racing suits, which can only be used with said bikes selected. The player cannot use any other riding gear with these motorcycles.\n\n===Riding Form===\nThe \"Riding Form\" option is available in both Arcade Mode and TT Mode.\n\nBefore an Arcade Mode race, the user can choose among four Riding Form presets: \"Lean Body\", \"Neutral\", \"Lean Bike\" and \"[[Supermoto|Motard]]/Dirt\". Lean Body focuses on quick cornering, Neutral focuses on handling, and Lean Bike prioritizes slow cornering. The Motard/Dirt form with one leg out in turns is dedicated to [[Enduro motorcycle|enduro]] and [[naked bike]] riding; however, the user is free to use it on all bikes. This mode is named after the mode in Gran Turismo games.\n\nIn TT Mode, the user can enter the Garage Riding Form settings with up to four fully customizable forms to save. They are saved as \"Form A\", \"Form B\", \"Form C\" and \"Motard/Dirt\". Each one has eleven unique parameters and four presets: \"Neutral\", \"Lean Body\", \"Lean Bike\" and \"Motard/Dirt\" from which to choose. The adjustable parameters are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/929988-tourist-trophy/faqs/42513|title=Tourist Trophy Riding Form FAQ for PlayStation 2 by aj_the_one - GameFAQs|website=gamefaqs.gamespot.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref>\n\n* \"Head Roll Angle\" dictates how far to the side the rider's head turns in corners.\n* \"Head Pitch Angle\" dictates how far up or down the rider's head is positioned.\n* \"Lateral Slide\" determines how far the rider's hips slide towards the inside of a turn. Increasing this value will raise cornering speed at the cost of stability.\n* \"Vertical Slide\" dictates how much the rider tucks their body into the bike in corners.\n* \"Body Lean (Full Bank)\" dictates the extent to which the rider leans into corners.\n* \"Torso Roll Angle\" determines the rider's torso roll in corners. This setting has a significant impact on stability in turns.\n* \"Torso Yaw Angle\" determines how far the rider's torso twists toward corners. Decreasing this value results in increased responsiveness.\n* \"Arm Angle\" determines how far in or out the rider's arms are positioned. Decreasing this value results in increased cornering speed at the cost of responsiveness.\n* \"Seat Position (Forward/Back)\" determines how far forward or back the rider sits, influencing their posture and the extent to which they tuck.\n* \"Leg Angle\" works much the same as the \"Arm Angle\" setting, offering increased responsiveness while sacrificing cornering speed.\n* \"Body Lean (Upright)\" dictates the extent to which the rider tucks on straights. An increased value results in higher acceleration and top speed.\n\n=== Gameplay settings ===\n''Tourist Trophy's'' default setting is \"Normal\". Using the Normal setting, the player can perform maneuvers such as [[wheelie|wheelies]] and the [[stoppie|stoppies]] on powerful-enough bikes. These possibilities are disabled with the \"Professional\" setting. Enabling \"Professional\" will enhance the simulation aspect as well as the difficulty level, over the arcade-oriented Normal. The \"Professional\" setting is supposed to allow a more realistic experience with autonomous upper body control (as the \"Tuck\" manual function is enabled), and separate front and rear brake controls replace the double-brake default system. \"Semi-Pro Mode\" is an exclusive feature of the North American edition. Other options enhancing difficulty are \"Strict Judgment\"\u2014a 10-second slow down penalty as seen in ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]''\u2014and a \"[[Racing line|Best Line]]\" display.\n\n===Other features===\n\n====Photo mode and \"Best Shot\"====\nPre-generated photos can be taken from a race replay and saved on a PS2 [[memory card]] or a connected [[USB flash drive]], like in [[Gran Turismo 4]]. This function is known in the game as \"Best Shot\". Using various replay angles as a digital camera, the game is able to produce a selection of [[Screenshot|screenshots]] with variable compression rate (Normal, Fine, or Super Fine) and size (up to 1280x960/72 dpi). The user can choose to save the photo, print it with an [[Epson]]-compatible USB printer, or display it on TV using the \"Musical [[Diaporama]]\" feature. Saved game screenshots can be exchanged with friends or made public on the Internet. Unlike Best Shot, Photo Mode's parameters are fully adjustable and it gives the user the opportunity to compose their own photographs. The user can tune various parameters such as camera angle or course section. Formatting the USB device in Photo Mode or Best Shot will create the \"DCIM/100PDITT\" folder, allowing ''Tourist Trophy'' to store, upload and download game picture files generated under the form \"IMG_00X.JPG\". Standard USB 2.0 flash drives (including MP3 players and mobile phones) can be used to manage game JPEG files instead of the official I-O Data model.\n\n====Replay/ghost files====\nA [[USB flash drive]] can host ''Tourist Trophy'' replay/[[Glossary of video game terms#ghost|ghost]] files downloaded from either the official game website or elsewhere online. It can also be used to exchange files with another USB device. Once the files are in the flash drive, the user can upload them from within the game in order to compete with a ghost (\"Time Attack\") or to watch a replay (\"Replay Theater\"). Each file can be used as Replay or as Ghost. The first such files released on the Japanese site featured Japanese pro rider and ''Tourist Trophy'' test rider Satoshi Tsujimoto and ''Tourist Trophy'' producer [[Kazunori Yamauchi]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Formatting the USB device from Theater Mode will create the \"PDI\" folder, allowing ''Tourist Trophy'' to store, upload and download files generated under the name \"replay[[.dat]]\". Standard third-party USB devices are also compatible with such files.\n\n==Development==\nPolyphony Digital reused the physics engine, [[graphical user interface]] design, and all but one circuit from ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]''. However, the number of AI racers (computer-controlled opponents) has been reduced from five in the ''Gran Turismo'' series to only three. ''Tourist Trophy'' also uses the License School feature that was popularized by the ''Gran Turismo'' series, as well as the Photo Mode introduced in ''Gran Turismo 4''. The B-spec mode, which appeared in ''Gran Turismo 4'', was removed from ''Tourist Trophy''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nWhile wet, dirt and reverse classic ''GT4'' racing conditions, and French tracks such as [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] have been removed (as the game doesn't have any motorcycles eligible for snow and dirt conditions); a unique course was specially recreated for ''Tourist Trophy''. The [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo|Circuit de la Comunitat Valenciana Ricardo Tormo]] is an official track appearing in the [[Superbike World Championship]] and [[MotoGP]].
