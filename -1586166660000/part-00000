The songs express the special melody and rhythm, performing an extraordinary effect.

Taking the school uniform as the topic, although the content is not related to the school uniform, it is enough to attract people to listen to it.\u00a0 This single has a great influence in the local student circle in Chengdu. Every student has this song in the MP3, which can be said to be the youth of many people. Later in 2013, Ansr J focused more on running his own clothing brand Johnny Designs, and music was left behind. In 2016, the single \"Renmin South Road\"(\u4eba\u6c11\u5357\u8def)<ref name=\"163com\"/> was released, and it is another popular song after \"School Uniform is not fashion\". Then many classic singles and Mixtape \"FNTE\"<ref name=\"163com\"/> was released, FNTE's full spell is \"from nothing to everything\", from nothing to everything , AnsrJ did indeed rely on himself from scratch, step by step to the present.\n\nLil Shin is also the \"old guy\" of Chengdu Rap House, one of the founding members of C.D.C. As early as the end of BigZoo in 2010, Chengdu Rap entered the Cypher in the C.D.C era, and there was Lil Shin. Lil Shin\u2019s current job is as a director, and he also commutes from 9 to 5 while doing rap. The director's work also made him handy in MV editing, which is also a special skill that other Rapper does not have. One of the Lil Shin's most widely circulated works is \"Intoo\"<ref name=\"163com\"/> included in \"No. 901\",<ref name=\"163com\"/> which is a gentle and delicate love song that favors popular style. This song is adapted from [[Sam Smith]]'s classic single \"I'm Not The Only One<ref>{{Citation|title=I'm Not The Only One|url=https://open.spotify.com/track/7795WJLVKJoAyVoOtCWqXN|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\", which uses the original song as a hook part, and adds a low rap, and illustrates Chengdu dialect is not only suitable for trap, it is also very tender to sing love songs.\n\nAnother member, Mengzi, was also one of the earliest members of the Chengdu rap club. In 2011, he formed the Onstyle combination with Lil Shin, which is also the first combination of the rap club. But Onstyle currently does not have many songs on the platform. Mengzi left the team for almost two years for some reasons and was unable to participate in the team's song.\n\n==Group Members==\nThese are Chinese names; surnames appear first.\n\n* Ansr J\uff08\u5218\u9759\u5b81\uff09from Chengdu\n* Lil Shin\uff08\u674e\u5c14\u65b0\uff09from Chengdu\n* Mengzi\uff08\u5b5f\u5b50\uff09from Chengdu\n\n==Discography==\n'''First album: Ding ji Wan Jia (\u9876\u7ea7\u73a9\u5bb6)'''<ref name=\"163com\"/>\n\nThe group released the first album: Ding Ji Wan Jia in 2018.

In terms of creation, the top three players have made new breakthroughs. The genre is wider than the first album.

In addition to new trap, electronic and rock, there are soft love songs and R&B parts. The single \"Hi business\" pays homage to [[Run-DMC]]. This single is full of skills and strong rhythms; \"Get it done\"<ref name=\"163com\"/> is the most breakthrough single. In this single, Ansrj combines rock's energy and the powerful rap which is perfectly embodies the top player spirit of A.T.M.; the single \"color\",<ref name=\"163com\"/> produced by producer G23, is a typical new trap. In the song, Mengzi's flow is quite prominent, which can be called textbook level flow. It is worth mentioning that the single \"friends\",<ref name=\"163com\"/> in which the comfortable melody of Lil shin shows the all-around rap talent of A.T.M.\n\nA.T.M., who just finished touring in 2019, released the album at the end of the year, and will continue to release their second official album next year.

Twelve tracks from the album and one bonus track, combining local and overseas cultures, the high and lows are obviously like a roller coaster to bring a new experience to the listener, which interprets the new level of hip-hop in China.\n\n==History==\nAnsr J released his first single \"School Uniform is not fashion\"<ref>{{Citation|title=\u6821\u670d\u4e0d\u6f6e\u3010Mixtape\u8bd5\u542c\u3011 - AnsrJ|url=https://streetvoice.com/answerj/songs/74248/|language=zh-Hant|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> (\u6821\u670d\u4e0d\u6f6e) as early as 2009, when he was a high school student. Taking the school uniform as the topic, although the content is not related to the school uniform, it is enough to attract people to listen to it.\u00a0 This single has a great influence in the local student circle in Chengdu. Every student has this song in the MP3, which can be said to be the youth of many people. Later in 2013, Ansr J focused more on running his own clothing brand Johnny Designs, and music was left behind. In 2016, the single \"Renmin South Road\"(\u4eba\u6c11\u5357\u8def)<ref name=\"163com /> was released, and it is another popular song after \"School Uniform is not fashion\". Then many classic singles and Mixtape \"FNTE\"<ref name=\"163com /> was released, FNTE's full spell is \"from nothing to everything\", from nothing to everything , AnsrJ did indeed rely on himself from scratch, step by step to the present.\n\nLil Shin is also the \"old guy\" of Chengdu Rap House, one of the founding members of C.D.C. As early as the end of BigZoo in 2010, Chengdu Rap entered the Cypher in the C.D.C era, and there was Lil Shin. Lil Shin\u2019s current job is as a director, and he also commutes from 9 to 5 while doing rap. The director's work also made him handy in MV editing, which is also a special skill that other Rapper does not have. One of the Lil Shin's most widely circulated works is \"Intoo\"<ref name=\"163com /> included in \"No. 901\",<ref name=\"163com /> which is a gentle and delicate love song that favors popular style. This song is adapted from [[Sam Smith]]'s classic single \"I'm Not The Only One<ref>{{Citation|title=I'm Not The Only One|url=https://open.spotify.com/track/7795WJLVKJoAyVoOtCWqXN|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\", which uses the original song as a hook part, and adds a low rap, and illustrates Chengdu dialect is not only suitable for trap, it is also very tender to sing love songs.\n\nAnother member, Mengzi, was also one of the earliest members of the Chengdu rap club. In 2011, he formed the Onstyle combination with Lil Shin, which is also the first combination of the rap club. But Onstyle currently does not have many songs on the platform. Mengzi left the team for almost two years for some reasons and was unable to participate in the team's song.\n\n==Group Members==\nThese are Chinese names; surnames appear first.\n\n* Ansr J\uff08\u5218\u9759\u5b81\uff09from Chengdu\n* Lil Shin\uff08\u674e\u5c14\u65b0\uff09from Chengdu\n* Mengzi\uff08\u5b5f\u5b50\uff09from Chengdu\n\n==Discography==\n'''First album: Ding ji Wan Jia (\u9876\u7ea7\u73a9\u5bb6)'''<ref name=\"163com />\n\nThe group released the first album: Ding Ji Wan Jia in 2018. It consists 12 tracks and one bonus track called \"Food & Liquor\"<ref name=\"163com /> which were made by themselves including lyrics, composing, recording and mixing.\n\n'''Second album: 1Fan!LP (\u4e00\u756a!LP)'''<ref name=\"163com />\n\nIn the same year, they dropped their second album: 1Fan!LP, compared to the last album, the track has increased to 13. In terms of creation, the top three players have made new breakthroughs. The genre is wider than the first album. Here, \"1fan!\" is regarded as top-level meaning, and can also be read as \"Awesome!\"\n\n'''The latest album: Hi Business (\u55e8\u751f\u610f)'''<ref name=\"163com />\n\nThis album contains eight newly created songs, which can be said to be a hard and soft album. In addition to new trap, electronic and rock, there are soft love songs and R&B parts. The single \"Hi business\" pays homage to [[Run-DMC]]. This single is full of skills and strong rhythms; \"Get it done\"<ref name=\"163com /> is the most breakthrough single. In this single, Ansrj combines rock's energy and the powerful rap which is perfectly embodies the top player spirit of A.T.M.; the single \"color\",<ref name=\"163com /> produced by producer G23, is a typical new trap. In the song, Mengzi's flow is quite prominent, which can be called textbook level flow. It is worth mentioning that the single \"friends\",<ref name=\"163com /> in which the comfortable melody of Lil shin shows the all-around rap talent of A.T.M.\n\nA.T.M., who just finished touring in 2019, released the album at the end of the year, and will continue to release their second official album next year. The changeable music style and breakthrough of have laid an all-around stage for them and laid a perfect foundation for their debut next year.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Chinese hip hop musicians]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "ref name", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_Top_Masta"}

It was released on 8&nbsp;May 1970, almost a month after [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]], in tandem with the [[Let It Be (1970 film)|motion picture of the same name]]. Like most of the band's previous releases, the album topped record charts in many countries, including both the US and the UK. However, the critical response was generally unfavourable, and ''Let It Be'' came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums ever.<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/let-it-be-mw0000192939 |title=Review: Let It Be |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |work=Allmusic |accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nRehearsals began at [[Twickenham Film Studios]] in January 1969 as part of a planned documentary showing the Beatles' return to live performance. [[Paul McCartney]] conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the band by returning to simpler [[rock and roll]] configurations.<ref name=\"Kot\"/> The filmed rehearsals were marked by ill-feeling, leading to [[George Harrison]]'s temporary departure from the group. As a condition of his return, the members reconvened at their own [[Apple Studio]] with guest keyboardist [[Billy Preston]]. The project then yielded a [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|single public concert]], held impromptu on the studio's rooftop on 30 January, from which three of the album's tracks were drawn.\n\nIn April 1969, the Beatles issued the single \"[[Get Back]]\", after which engineer [[Glyn Johns]] proposed rejected mixes of the album, then titled ''Get Back'', that were widely [[bootleg recording|bootlegged]] before release.<ref name=\"Kot\">{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|date=November 17, 2003|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-11-17-0311180043-story.html|title=Let It Be, Paul|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref> From then, the project lay in limbo as they moved onto the recording of ''[[Abbey Road]]'', released that September. By then, [[John Lennon]] had departed the group. In January 1970, the remaining Beatles finished the album with the completion of \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\" and \"[[I Me Mine]]\". The former was issued as a single in April 1970, and like all the album's recording to this point, was produced by [[George Martin]].\n\n''Get Back'' was ultimately assembled under the title of ''Let It Be'' by the American producer [[Phil Spector]] in early 1970. He omitted \"[[Don't Let Me Down (Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]\", the B-side of the \"Get Back\" single, and instead included a 1968 take of \"[[Across the Universe]]\". Spector also included excerpts of studio chatter and applied original orchestral and choir overdubs to four tracks. The additions offended McCartney, particularly in the case of \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\". In 2003, he spearheaded ''[[Let It Be... Naked]]'', an alternative mix of ''Let It Be'' that removes Spector's embellishments.\n\n==Background==\nBy late 1968, more than two years after the Beatles gave up touring, [[Paul McCartney]] was eager for the group to perform live again. The other three Beatles were less enthusiastic about McCartney's proposals as they had just completed five months' work on the band's [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"), and the sessions had seen a number of serious arguments and strained relations among the group.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=137}} [[George Harrison]] in particular was opposed to the idea of touring, having taken the strongest dislike of any in the group to the gruelling tours of the [[Beatlemania]] era.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=636}}\n\n==Recording and production==\n===Twickenham and Apple sessions===\nThe Twickenham rehearsals quickly disintegrated into what was characterised as a \"hostile lethargy\".<ref>Brown, Peter and Steven Gaines, \"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles\". {{ISBN|9781440674075}}.</ref> According to journalist Michael Housego of the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', disagreements between Harrison and Lennon descended into violence with them allegedly throwing punches at each other. Harrison denied this in a 16 January interview for the ''[[Daily Express]]'', saying: \"There was no punch-up. We just fell out.\" After lunch, Harrison announced that he was \"leaving the band now\" and told the others \"see you round the clubs\".{{sfn|Schweighardt|Sulpy|2007|p=123}}\n\nA week later the band agreed to Harrison's terms for returning to the group, which included abandoning the cold and cavernous soundstage at Twickenham. Sessions resumed on 21 January when the Beatles moved to [[Apple Studio]], in the basement of their [[Apple Corps]] building at 3 [[Savile Row]], central London. Multi-track recording began on that date{{sfn|Schweighardt|Sulpy|2007|p=154}} and continued until 31 January.{{sfn|Schweighardt|Sulpy|2007|p=257}}\n\n===''Get Back'' mixes===\n[[File:beatles_get_back_album_cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of the aborted ''Get Back'' album, mirroring the cover of the band's first album, ''[[Please Please Me]].'']]\n\nDays after the sessions at Apple had ended, Glyn Johns put together a rough mix [[acetate disc|acetate]] of several songs, for the band to listen to. A tape copy of this acetate made its way to America, where it was played on radio stations in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Boston]] over September 1969. In March 1969, Lennon and McCartney had called Johns to Abbey Road and offered him free rein to compile an album from the ''Get Back'' recordings.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1996}}\n\nJohns booked time at [[Olympic Studios]] between 10 March and 28 May to mix the album and completed the final banded master tape on 28 May. Only one track, \"One After 909\", was taken from the rooftop concert, with \"I've Got a Feeling\" and \"Dig a Pony\" (then called \"All I Want Is You\") being studio recordings instead. Johns also favoured earlier, rougher versions of \"Two of Us\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" over the more polished performances from the final, 31 January session (which were eventually chosen for the ''Let It Be'' album). It also included a [[Jam session|jam]] called \"Rocker\", a brief rendition of [[the Drifters]]' \"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\", Lennon's \"[[Don't Let Me Down (Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]\" and a five-minute version of \"[[Dig It (Beatles song)|Dig It]]\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=176}}\n\n''Get Back'' version one, May 1969:{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=176}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = Side one\n| title1 = [[One After 909|The One After 909]]\n| length1 = \n| title2 = Rocker\n| length2 = \n| title3 = [[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\n| length3 = \n| title4 = [[Don't Let Me Down (Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]\n| length4 = \n| title5 = [[Dig a Pony]]\n| length5 = \n| title6 = [[I've Got a Feeling]]\n| length6 = \n| title7 = [[Get Back]]\n| length7 = \n| all_writing = \n| title8 = \n| length8 = \n| title9 = \n| length9 = \n| title10 = \n| length10 = \n| total_length = \n| note2 = Improvisation\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = Side two\n| title1          = [[For You Blue]]\n| length1         =\n| title2          = [[Teddy Boy (song)|Teddy Boy]]\n| length2         =\n| title3          = [[Two of Us (song)|Two of Us]]\n| length3         =\n| title4          = [[Maggie May (traditional song)#The Beatles version|Maggie Mae]]\n| length4         =\n| title5          = [[Dig It (Beatles song)|Dig It]]\n| length5         =\n| title6          = [[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\n| length6         =\n| title7          = [[The Long and Winding Road]]\n| length7         =\n| title8          = [[Get Back]] (reprise)\n| length8         =\n}}\n\nThe cover of the proposed album featured a photograph of the Beatles by [[Angus McBean]] taken in the interior stairwell at EMI's [[Manchester Square]] headquarters. The photo was intended as an update of the group's ''[[Please Please Me]]'' cover image from 1963 and was particularly favoured by Lennon. The text design and placement similarly mirrored that of the 1963 LP sleeve.{{sfn|Spizer|2003|p=162}}\n\nOn 15 December, the Beatles again approached Johns to compile an album, but this time with the instruction that the songs must match those included in the as yet unreleased ''Get Back'' film. Between 15 December 1969 and 8 January 1970, new mixes were prepared. Glyn Johns' new mix omitted \"Teddy Boy\" as the song did not appear in the film. It added \"Across the Universe\" (a [[remix]] of the 1968 studio version, as the January 1969 rehearsals had not been properly recorded) and \"I Me Mine\", on which only Harrison, McCartney and [[Ringo Starr]] performed. \"I Me Mine\" was newly recorded on 3 January 1970, as it appeared in the film and no multi-track recording had yet been made.

Contrary to the original concept, the album versions of \"For You Blue\", \"I Me Mine\", \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" feature editing, splicing and/or overdubs. \"Don't Let Me Down\", also recorded live and previously released as the B-side of \"Get Back\", was not included on the album.{{sfn|Schweighardt|Sulpy|1997|p=316}} The third track on the album is an edited version of the original 1968 recording of \"Across the Universe\", slowed down from D-natural to D-flat, which had only been rehearsed at Twickenham and not professionally recorded on multi-track tape during the January 1969 sessions.{{sfn|MacDonald|2007|p=277}}\n\nMcCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of some songs, particularly \"The Long and Winding Road\". McCartney had conceived of the song as a simple piano ballad, but Spector dubbed in orchestral and choral accompaniment. McCartney unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version or at least have it altered. Despite the criticisms levelled at Spector over the years for his handling of the material, Lennon defended him in his December 1970 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, saying, \"He was given the shittiest load of badly-recorded shit with a lousy feeling to it ever, and he made something of it.\"{{cn|date=December 2019}} When EMI informed Martin that he would not get a production credit because Spector produced the final version, he commented \"I produced the original, and what you should do is have a credit saying 'Produced by George Martin, over-produced by Phil Spector'\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Michael |last2=Spignesi |first2=Stephen J. |title=100 Best Beatles Songs: A Passionate Fan's Guide |publisher=Hachette Books |isbn=9781603762656 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R1_REbXry8C&pg=PT42 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\" />\n| rev2 = ''[[The A.V.

It was released on 8&nbsp;May 1970, almost a month after [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]], in tandem with the [[Let It Be (1970 film)|motion picture of the same name]]. Like most of the band's previous releases, the album topped record charts in many countries, including both the US and the UK. However, the critical response was generally unfavourable, and ''Let It Be'' came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums ever.<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/let-it-be-mw0000192939 |title=Review: Let It Be |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |work=Allmusic |accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nRehearsals began at [[Twickenham Film Studios]] in January 1969 as part of a planned documentary showing the Beatles' return to live performance. [[Paul McCartney]] conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the band by returning to simpler [[rock and roll]] configurations.<ref name=\"Kot\"/> The filmed rehearsals were marked by ill-feeling, leading to [[George Harrison]]'s temporary departure from the group. As a condition of his return, the members reconvened at their own [[Apple Studio]] with guest keyboardist [[Billy Preston]]. The project then yielded a [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|single public concert]], held impromptu on the studio's rooftop on 30 January, from which three of the album's tracks were drawn.\n\nIn April 1969, the Beatles issued the single \"[[Get Back]]\", after which engineer [[Glyn Johns]] proposed rejected mixes of the album, then titled ''Get Back'', that were widely [[bootleg recording|bootlegged]] before release.<ref name=\"Kot\">{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|date=November 17, 2003|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-11-17-0311180043-story.html|title=Let It Be, Paul|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref> From then, the project lay in limbo as they moved onto the recording of ''[[Abbey Road]]'', released that September. By then, [[John Lennon]] had departed the group. In January 1970, the remaining Beatles finished the album with the completion of \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\" and \"[[I Me Mine]]\". The former was issued as a single in April 1970, and like all the album's recording to this point, was produced by [[George Martin]].\n\n''Get Back'' was ultimately assembled under the title of ''Let It Be'' by the American producer [[Phil Spector]] in early 1970. He omitted \"[[Don't Let Me Down (Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]\", the B-side of the \"Get Back\" single, and instead included a 1968 take of \"[[Across the Universe]]\". Spector also included excerpts of studio chatter and applied original orchestral and choir overdubs to four tracks. The additions offended McCartney, particularly in the case of \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\". In 2003, he spearheaded ''[[Let It Be... Naked]]'', an alternative mix of ''Let It Be'' that removes Spector's embellishments.\n\n==Background==\nBy late 1968, more than two years after the Beatles gave up touring, [[Paul McCartney]] was eager for the group to perform live again. The other three Beatles were less enthusiastic about McCartney's proposals as they had just completed five months' work on the band's [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"), and the sessions had seen a number of serious arguments and strained relations among the group.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=137}} [[George Harrison]] in particular was opposed to the idea of touring, having taken the strongest dislike of any in the group to the gruelling tours of the [[Beatlemania]] era.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=636}}\n\n==Recording and production==\n===Twickenham and Apple sessions===\nThe Twickenham rehearsals quickly disintegrated into what was characterised as a \"hostile lethargy\".<ref>Brown, Peter and Steven Gaines, \"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles\". {{ISBN|9781440674075}}.</ref> According to journalist Michael Housego of the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', disagreements between Harrison and Lennon descended into violence with them allegedly throwing punches at each other. Harrison denied this in a 16 January interview for the ''[[Daily Express]]'', saying: \"There was no punch-up. We just fell out.\" After lunch, Harrison announced that he was \"leaving the band now\" and told the others \"see you round the clubs\".{{sfn|Schweighardt|Sulpy|2007|p=123}}\n\nA week later the band agreed to Harrison's terms for returning to the group, which included abandoning the cold and cavernous soundstage at Twickenham. Sessions resumed on 21 January when the Beatles moved to [[Apple Studio]], in the basement of their [[Apple Corps]] building at 3 [[Savile Row]], central London. Multi-track recording began on that date{{sfn|Schweighardt|Sulpy|2007|p=154}} and continued until 31 January.{{sfn|Schweighardt|Sulpy|2007|p=257}}\n\n===''Get Back'' mixes===\n[[File:beatles_get_back_album_cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of the aborted ''Get Back'' album, mirroring the cover of the band's first album, ''[[Please Please Me]].'']]\n\nDays after the sessions at Apple had ended, Glyn Johns put together a rough mix [[acetate disc|acetate]] of several songs, for the band to listen to. A tape copy of this acetate made its way to America, where it was played on radio stations in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Boston]] over September 1969. In March 1969, Lennon and McCartney had called Johns to Abbey Road and offered him free rein to compile an album from the ''Get Back'' recordings.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1996}}\n\nJohns booked time at [[Olympic Studios]] between 10 March and 28 May to mix the album and completed the final banded master tape on 28 May. Only one track, \"One After 909\", was taken from the rooftop concert, with \"I've Got a Feeling\" and \"Dig a Pony\" (then called \"All I Want Is You\") being studio recordings instead. Johns also favoured earlier, rougher versions of \"Two of Us\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" over the more polished performances from the final, 31 January session (which were eventually chosen for the ''Let It Be'' album). It also included a [[Jam session|jam]] called \"Rocker\", a brief rendition of [[the Drifters]]' \"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\", Lennon's \"[[Don't Let Me Down (Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]\" and a five-minute version of \"[[Dig It (Beatles song)|Dig It]]\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=176}}\n\n''Get Back'' version one, May 1969:{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=176}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = Side one\n| title1 = [[One After 909|The One After 909]]\n| length1 = \n| title2 = Rocker\n| length2 = \n| title3 = [[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\n| length3 = \n| title4 = [[Don't Let Me Down (Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]\n| length4 = \n| title5 = [[Dig a Pony]]\n| length5 = \n| title6 = [[I've Got a Feeling]]\n| length6 = \n| title7 = [[Get Back]]\n| length7 = \n| all_writing = \n| title8 = \n| length8 = \n| title9 = \n| length9 = \n| title10 = \n| length10 = \n| total_length = \n| note2 = Improvisation\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = Side two\n| title1          = [[For You Blue]]\n| length1         =\n| title2          = [[Teddy Boy (song)|Teddy Boy]]\n| length2         =\n| title3          = [[Two of Us (song)|Two of Us]]\n| length3         =\n| title4          = [[Maggie May (traditional song)#The Beatles version|Maggie Mae]]\n| length4         =\n| title5          = [[Dig It (Beatles song)|Dig It]]\n| length5         =\n| title6          = [[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\n| length6         =\n| title7          = [[The Long and Winding Road]]\n| length7         =\n| title8          = [[Get Back]] (reprise)\n| length8         =\n}}\n\nThe cover of the proposed album featured a photograph of the Beatles by [[Angus McBean]] taken in the interior stairwell at EMI's [[Manchester Square]] headquarters. The photo was intended as an update of the group's ''[[Please Please Me]]'' cover image from 1963 and was particularly favoured by Lennon. The text design and placement similarly mirrored that of the 1963 LP sleeve.{{sfn|Spizer|2003|p=162}}\n\nOn 15 December, the Beatles again approached Johns to compile an album, but this time with the instruction that the songs must match those included in the as yet unreleased ''Get Back'' film. Between 15 December 1969 and 8 January 1970, new mixes were prepared. Glyn Johns' new mix omitted \"Teddy Boy\" as the song did not appear in the film. It added \"Across the Universe\" (a [[remix]] of the 1968 studio version, as the January 1969 rehearsals had not been properly recorded) and \"I Me Mine\", on which only Harrison, McCartney and [[Ringo Starr]] performed. \"I Me Mine\" was newly recorded on 3 January 1970, as it appeared in the film and no multi-track recording had yet been made.

Contrary to the original concept, the album versions of \"For You Blue\", \"I Me Mine\", \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" feature editing, splicing and/or overdubs. \"Don't Let Me Down\", also recorded live and previously released as the B-side of \"Get Back\", was not included on the album.{{sfn|Schweighardt|Sulpy|1997|p=316}} The third track on the album is an edited version of the original 1968 recording of \"Across the Universe\", slowed down from D-natural to D-flat, which had only been rehearsed at Twickenham and not professionally recorded on multi-track tape during the January 1969 sessions.{{sfn|MacDonald|2007|p=277}}\n\nMcCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of some songs, particularly \"The Long and Winding Road\". McCartney had conceived of the song as a simple piano ballad, but Spector dubbed in orchestral and choral accompaniment. McCartney unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version or at least have it altered. Despite the criticisms levelled at Spector over the years for his handling of the material, Lennon defended him in his December 1970 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, saying, \"He was given the shittiest load of badly-recorded shit with a lousy feeling to it ever, and he made something of it.\"{{cn|date=December 2019}} When EMI informed Martin that he would not get a production credit because Spector produced the final version, he commented \"I produced the original, and what you should do is have a credit saying 'Produced by George Martin, over-produced by Phil Spector'\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Michael |last2=Spignesi |first2=Stephen J. |title=100 Best Beatles Songs: A Passionate Fan's Guide |publisher=Hachette Books |isbn=9781603762656 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R1_REbXry8C&pg=PT42 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\" />\n| rev2 = ''[[The A.V.

The Legion became a depository for those who did not conform to the governing agenda. There was also concern over those seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had journeyed in the hopes of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} To the State, they threatened the stability of the kingdom and its economy it became urgent to group and distance them.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the men in the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}} and the war, deemed very unpopular. Louis Philipe I was a pacifist and did not want to weigh the national and military opinion on a costly conquest which would endanger French lives and thus sought to use foreign troops. However, since the Kingdom was reduced, it was not feasible to recruit contingents in occupied lands such as during Napoleon's era. Accordingly, a new sort of troop was required.\n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries.

Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion.

Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favor this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839 and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand maneuvers. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843, and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

Louis Philipe I was a pacifist and did not want to weigh the national and military opinion on a costly conquest which would endanger French lives and thus sought to use foreign troops. However, since the Kingdom was reduced, it was not feasible to recruit contingents in occupied lands such as during Napoleon's era. Accordingly, a new sort of troop was required.\n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends of France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n!  !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\n\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essence base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835).{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\n\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favor this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\n\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} \n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\n\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\n\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836-1837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839 and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand maneuvers. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\n\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843, and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

In 1923, the Faculty of Medicine became the first faculty to accept secondary school ([[Mattayom]]) graduates. The remaining faculties then followed suit. After the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|1932 Revolution]], the [[Khana Ratsadon|People's Party]] wanted legal and political studies to be independent of \"royalists\" so they moved the Faculty of Law and Political Science to the new [[Thammasat University]] in 1933.\n\nIn 1938, Chulalongkorn University's Preparatory School was founded to provide pre-collegiate education to students. Those who managed to enter the university had to spend two years in the [[University-preparatory school|Preparatory School]] before going on to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Preparatory School, however, ceased to be a university-owned preparatory school in 1947 and became the independent [[Triam Udom Suksa School]].

Wearing a dark blue necktie with colored ''phra kiao'' engraved on its front is mandatory for first-year students but optional for higher years.
