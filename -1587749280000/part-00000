When H.M. the King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) ascended to the throne, he follow a royal tradition that Kings of Siam would build temples and monasteries in order to contribute to [[Buddhism]]. However at the time, there were already large numbers of religious sites in Bangkok, so H.M. the King Vajiravudh decides on building a hospital instead, as to improve the lives of citizens, providing efficient primary healthcare. He donated money from his own private funds for the establishment of the hospital. The hospital was built in an area once called \u201cHimmapan Garden\u201d located in the northern part of Bangkok, near the bank of Chao Phraya River.\n\nThe hospital was opened by King Vajiravudh on January 2, 1913 ([[Thai solar calendar|B.E.]] 2455). The King named the hospital \"Wachiraphayaban\" (\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25) translated \"Vajira Healthcare\" or simply \"Vajira Hospital\".

Vajira hospital underwent immense changes and improvements. It expanded from its historic site next to Samsen road to the edges of the Chao Phraya River. In 1954 it became a teaching hospital for its nursing school, now [[Kuakarun college of nursing]]. In 1985 it became a Medical School known as the Faculty of Medicine [[Srinakharinwirot University]]. Srinakharinwirot medical student attend clinical years training at Vajira hospital. Later on in 1993 the BMA Medical College was established, which headquarters here in Vajira hospital.

From 1960-1962, each participant was given an initial examination in which serum cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, height and the participant's responses to a number of health behavior and medical history questions. A follow-up consisting of a similar battery of tests was completed from 1967-1969. For 90.9% of the study population, a physical similar to the preliminary one was completed. For another 7.9%, health status was ascertained by a phone survey of either subject or a family member. The total rate of follow-up was 98.8%. Factors assessed at the time of follow-up were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, cigarette smoking, body weight, [[hematocrit]] value, ECG abnormalities and diet. Socioeconomic status was also assessed for whites, but not for blacks, as little variability was found in this factor among black subjects.<ref>Cassel, J., ed., 1971. Evans County cardiovascular and cerebrovascular study. Archives of internal medicine, 128 (6), 883-992.</ref>\n\n== Results/Conclusions ==\nA central finding of the study was that, across race and social class differences, factors associated with increased risk of [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD) did so equally for blacks and whites whether the risk factors were considered singly or in combination. CHD incidence remained markedly higher for white [[Evans County]] residents. The only [[social grouping]] of white residents that had equally low incidence of CHD was white [[sharecroppers]], which was attributed to higher rates of [[physical activity]] among sharecroppers when compared to whites of higher [[socioeconomic status]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.epi.umn.edu/cvdepi/study-synopsis/evans-county-cardiovascular-and-cerebrovascular-study/|title=Evans County Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Study \u00ab Heart Attack Prevention|website=www.epi.umn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>\n\nA strength of the study was the high response rate of the population in its entirety, one of only two of its kind to successfully examine an entire community. The publication of the initial study results did not include statistical analysis. Hames attributes his decision to avoid statistical analysis to the unique design of the study. He wrote, \u201c\u2026it certainly is not clear to us [the investigators] what differences such tests could make in our interpretations in the context of this study\u2026 the population over 40 does not constitute a sample of some universe. They are a [[universe]].\u201d\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Evans County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Health research]]\n[[Category:Heart]]\n[[Category:1958 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGoals and Methods:clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1960-1962 \u2192 1960 to 1962 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_County_Heart_Study"}

He is considered a key figure of the Spanish techno of the 1990s, and his works feature electronic instruments and repetitions, as in the refrains of ''Exta s\u00ed, exta no'' or ''As\u00ed me gusta a m\u00ed''. Chimo Bayo defines himself as World Heritage<ref>https://www.eldiario.es/cultura/libros/entrevista-chimo-bayo_0_573593684.html</ref> and specializes in the bakalao music genre (a type of electronic music born in Spain in the mid 80s).<ref>https://www.theransomnote.com/music/interviews/bacalao-the-untold-story-of-valencias-pioneering-80s-90s-rave-scene/</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nHe lived in [[Rubielos de Mora]] in the [[province of Teruel]] before he moved to [[Valencia]], where his mother was from.\n\nIn his youth, he was a motocross competition rider, but a spinal injury ended his career. Later, as a [[DJ]], he spent ten years mixing [[electronic music]] in the 1980s; his musical style goes from dance to [[Industrial music|industrial]]/[[Electronic body music|EBM]], resembling the bands [[Front 242]] or [[Renegade Soundwave]]. He gained popularity as a DJ at the clubs of ''Arsenal'' in [[Oliva]] and ''El Templo'' (later known as Paris-Texas) in [[Cullera]].\n\nThe clothes chosen for his performances were always extravagant: he wore a motocross-style jacket, sunglasses with lights on them, and a cap with his name or the acronym \"[[CCCP]]\" that stands for the [[Soviet Union]] in Russian.\n\nHis daughter, Tanya Bayo, born in 1992, also works in the music industry.<ref>https://cadenaser.com/emisora/2016/05/31/radio_valencia/1464713803_971354.html</ref>\n\n== Musical career== \n\nChimo Bayo started his professional musical career as a DJ in the early 1980s, but it wasn't until 1987 that he released his first mixtape of [[electronic music]]. ''R\u00e1yate'', the cover of which was styled as a [[Smoking (rolling paper)|Smoking]] brand of rolling paper, sold over 20 million copies at that time. Later, his company ''Raya Records'' (Valencia) released ''R\u00e1yate 2'', which also brought oustanding commercial success.\n\nHis first hit was the [[Single (music)|single]] ''As\u00ed me gusta a m\u00ed'' (1991), which sold more than a million copies all over the world, reaching number one in [[Japan]] and [[Israel]]. It was the best selling [[maxi single]] in the history of Spain. An [[Israel|Israeli]] [[singer]], [[Dana International]], [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] this song in her hit ''Saida Sultana'' in 1993.\n\nDue to his rising popularity, he started touring around Europe and Asia, giving more than 100 performances. His most outstanding performance took place in [[Japan]], gathering more than 55.000 people in [[Tokyo Dome]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOtU8hS211Q</ref>\n\nAfter his first grand hit, Chimo Bayo released the [[singles]] ''Qu\u00edmica'' and ''Bombas'', his first No. 1 in [[Japan]] and his most selling record worldwide. Germ\u00e1n Bou is the composer behind Chimo Bayo's hits, being Bayo the author of the lyrics. \n\nHe attended the [[MIDEM]] of [[Cannes]], the prestigious international music festival, as a guest artist representing Spanish [[DJs]] and dance music artists in 1994, named the MIDEM Latino that year.  \n\nHis last successful records were ''La T\u00eda Enriqueta'' and ''La T\u00eda Enriqueta remix'' (1994). \n\nThe downfall of the so-called ''Sonido de Valencia'' and the unpopularity of the best known as ''Ruta Destroy'' in the mid-1990s ended up marking the end of Chimo Bayo's career. His posterior work included hits such as ''B\u00fascala'' and ''Vamos al espacio exterior'', among others. He tried to build an empire of discotheques as an entrepreneur (Planet Valencia, 1999) which ultimately failed. \n\nHe regularly participated in festivals and television shows. Among his latest appearances is his participation in the FEA 2005,  a festival that took place in [[Barcelona]]; in 2006 he recorded a single with the well-known television character [[Dinio]], under the title of ''Mira qu\u00e9 alegr\u00eda (otra vez la polic\u00eda)''.\n\nIn 2007, with his ''Hiper Dance Tour Tazo he performed in all the main cities of [[Spain]],  obtaining  a considerable great public success in his return to the scene of the ''technofiestas''. That same year, he was honoured  by the Mexican singer [[Alaska]] and the Spanish group [[Fangoria]] during the [[FIB]] 2007.\n\n== Chimo Bayo in media ==\n\nAt the end of the 90s, he decided to promote his facet as a showman on television. From 2000 to 2006 he hosted a local late-night show, ''Esto se mueve''. He has been interviewed on [[MTV]], [[Paramount Comedy]], [[Cuatro]] and [[TV3]].\n\nOn March 30, 2007, he made an appearance on [[Antena 3]] where he performed at the late-night show ''Buenafuente'' while on tour in [[Valencia]]. Also that year, he became a protagonist of ''[[La Hora Chanante]]'' in the section \"''Los consejos de Chimo Bayo''\", in which a cartoon character parodied the singer. In fact, this program turned him into an idol in a person of a passionate young man Vicent\u00edn, with whom he danced in the famous Florida Park in [[Madrid]] as a part of ''Fiestaca de la Hora Chanante'' event on [[Comedy Central Spain]].\n\nIn 2008, he appeared on the ''Buenafuente'' TV show on [[LaSexta]] to give an interview and perform for the audience. Later, he composed the popular musical theme ''Zascatronic'', a song that had a great impact on the Internet and was recorded with the invaluable help of [[Berto Romero]].\n\nIn March 2009, ''[[S\u00e9 lo que hicisteis...]]'' show of [[La Sexta]] invited him to star in one of the best TV reports of Pilar Rubio and drive a custom three-seater [[Formula 1]] car in [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo]] in [[Valencia]]. In [[2009]], he also participated in some comedy shows, like in a [[Muchachada Nui|''Muchachada Nui'']] sketch and in an episode of the ''Socarrats'' TV show on [[Canal Nou]].\n\nFrom October 2009 to January 2010, Bayo was one of the jury on the talent scout show ''Un beso y una flor'' presented by [[Bert\u00edn Osborne]] on ''[[Radiotelevisi\u00f3 Valenciana]]''. In the last broadcast, Bayo even mixed a peculiar electronic version of the song of [[Nino Bravo]], the name of which was used as the name of the show. \n\nChimo Bayo has also left his mark in cinematography. His tunes were used to advertise several movies. Just like in his movie [[Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n|''Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n'']] of 1992, [[Bigas Luna]] included the legendary ''As\u00ed me gusta a m\u00ed'' in the trailer and the film [[Yo soy la Juani|''Yo soy la Juani'']].\n\nNowadays he performs on a radio program called ''La casa de la T\u00eda Enriqueta'' (produced by Javier Fern\u00e1ndez) on the local ''Radio Express Valencia. That broadcaster has a website where the program can be followed from across [[Europe]]\n\nIn 2012, in the television show [[Tu cara me suena|''Tu cara me suena,'']] broadcast on the Spanish channel [[Antena 3]], Arturo Valls, a host and an actor, imitated the figure of Chimo Bayo. After that, Chimo regained his popularity. \n\nIn 2016 Chimo Bayo published his first novel, with the journalist Emma Zaf\u00f3n:''No iba a salir y me li\u00e9'', they show their experiences on the Ruta del Bakalao in the form of fiction.\n\n== Eurovision 2010 ==\nIn January 2010 he was a candidate for [[Eurovision]] 2010 with the song ''La Fiesta del Fuego.'' He recorded \"Code Name\" with a popular band from Valencia. His candidature had an outstanding reception in popular vote. In only four days, public votes took his song to the top 4 list, with more than 40.000 votes. However, [[RTVE]] disqualified his song because it did not meet the contest rules. The tune was played in the pubs of Valencia before the deadline, October 1st.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100124044825/http://www.rtve.es/television/20100121/pop-star-queen-chimo-bayo-kejio-juan-losada-estan-fuera-preseleccion-eurovision-2010/313563.shtml RTVE descalifica a Chimo Bayo]</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\nChimo Bayo doesn't have studio albums, his contributions were only singles.\n\n* 1991 - \"As\u00ed me gusta a m\u00ed\".\n* 1992 - \"Qu\u00edmica\".\n* 1992 - \"Bombas\".\n* 1994 - \"La t\u00eda Enriqueta\".\n* 1994 - \"La t\u00eda Enriqueta (Remix)\".\n* 1995 - \"Vamos al espacio exterior\".\n* 1996 - \"B\u00fascala\".\n* 2009 - \"Videodrome\".\n* 2009 - \"La fiesta del fuego\".\n* 2009 - \"Zaskatronik\".\n* 2011 - \"Revoluci\u00f3n\".\n\nHis singles reached leading sales positions in [[Europe]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:21em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"4\"| Position\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"35\"| [[Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a|Spain]]<br><ref>{{cite book|title=S\u00f3lo \u00e9xitos: a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, 1959\u20132002|last=Salaverri|first=Fernando|date=September 2005|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Autor-SGAE|isbn=84-8048-639-2|edition=1st|location=Spain}}<!--|accessdate=2011-01-26--></ref>\n! width=\"35\"| [[Ultratop 50|Belgium<br>(Vl)]]<br><ref name=\"Asi\">[http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Chimo+Bayo&titel=A+si+me+gusta+a+mi+%28x-ta+si%2C+x-ta+no%29&cat=s Belgian and Dutch peak]</ref>\n! width=\"35\"| [[Finnish Singles Chart|Finland]]<br><ref name=\"FIN\">{{cite book|first= Timo |last= Pennanen |year= 2006 |title= Sis\u00e4lt\u00e4\u00e4 hitin - levyt ja esitt\u00e4j\u00e4t Suomen musiikkilistoilla vuodesta 1972 |language= fi |edition= 1st |publisher= Tammi |isbn= 978-951-1-21053-5 |location= Helsinki}}</ref>\n! width=\"35\"| [[Dutch Singles Chart|Netherlands]]<br><ref name=\"Asi\"/>\n|-\n| 1991\n! scope=\"row\"| \"As\u00ed me gusta a m\u00ed\"\n| 1\n| 7\n| \u2014\n| 43\n| rowspan=\"7\"| Only Singles\n|- \n| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Qu\u00edmica\"\n| 1\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Bombas\"\n| 2\n| \u2014\n| 7\n| \u2014\n|- \n| 1994\n! scope=\"row\"| \"La Tia Enriqueta\"\n| 3\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|- \n| 1994\n! scope=\"row\"| \"La Tia Enriqueta (Remix)\"\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|- \n| 1995\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Vamos Al Espacio Exterior\"\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|- \n| 1996\n! scope=\"row\"| \"B\u00fascala\"\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" no data\n|-\n|}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{listaref|group=nota}}\n\n== References ==\n{{listaref}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite publication|last=Rodr\u00edguez Serrano|first=Aar\u00f3n|url=http://elgeniomaligno.eu/pdf/materia_3_malestar_apologiadelapornografia_arodriguezs.pdf|title=Apolog\u00eda de la pornograf\u00eda en la sociedad del malestar|journal=El Genio Maligno.
