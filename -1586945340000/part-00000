He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

[[Hat]]s, [[Chaperon (headgear)|hoods]], and other [[headdress]]es assumed increasing importance, and were draped, jewelled, and [[feather]]ed.\n\nAs Europe continued to grow more prosperous, the urban middle classes, skilled workers, began to wear more complex clothes that followed, at a distance, the fashions set by the elites.

Having added Holland and [[Flanders]] to their dominion, the Dukes of Burgundy had access to the latest [[fabrics]] of Italy and the East and to English wool exports through the great trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]].<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', p. 199</ref>  Purchases of fabrics through Italian merchants like the two cousins [[Giovanni Arnolfini]] amounted to a noticeable proportion of all government expenditure.<ref>2% to the elder Giovanni alone, in 1444\u201346, p. 195 National Gallery Catalogues, The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings, Lorne Campbell, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85709-171-X}}</ref>  Especially in Florence, where [[sumptuary law]]s prevented the citizens from wearing the most luxurious cloths on which the city's fortunes were built, the materials of men's clothing in particular often appear plain in paintings, but contemporaries who understood the difference in grades of cloth very well would have appreciated the beauty and great expense of a very fine grade.<ref name=\"frick\">Frick, Carole Collier.

Stately floral designs featuring a [[pomegranate]] or [[artichoke]] motif had reached Europe from China in the 14th century and became a dominant design in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] silk-producing cities of Istanbul and [[Bursa]], and spread to silk weavers in [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Seville]] in this period.<ref name=\"Koslin\" /><ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=20&item=12%2E49%2E8&viewMode=0&section=description Late 15th century Italian (Venice) Velvet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]</ref>\n\nFur was worn, mostly as a [[lining (sewing)|lining]] layer, by those who could afford it.

As a result, the French nobility were introduced to the fabrics and styles of Italy, which would combine with German influence to become mainstream fashion of the nobility in France (and later spread to England) in the [[1500\u20131550 in fashion|first half of the 16th century]].<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', chapters 3 and 4 ''passim''</ref>\n\n==Women's fashion==\n\n===Dress, kirtle, and chemise===\n[[Image:Petrus Christus 004 detail.jpg|thumb|Fur-trimmed [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundia]]n gown of mid-15th century has a [[Shirt#Neck|V-neck]] that displays the black kirtle and a band of the chemise.

The sleeves were made detachable and were heavily ornamented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laver|first=James|title=The Concise History of Costume and Fashion|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York|page=74}}</ref>  The long-waisted silhouette of the [[1300\u20131400 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a high-waisted style with fullness over the belly, often confined by a belt.  The wide, shallow scooped neckline was replaced by a V-neck, often cut low enough to reveal the decorated front of the kirtle beneath.\n\nVarious styles of overdresses were worn. The ''[[:File:Plaid cotehardie.jpg|cotehardie]]'' fitted smoothly from the shoulders to the hips and then flared by means of inserted triangular gores.  It featured sleeves tight to the elbow with hanging streamers or ''tippets''. The tight fit was achieved with lacing or [[Button (clothing)|button]]s. This style faded rapidly from fashion in favor of the houppelande, a full robe with a high collar and wide sleeves that had become fashionable around 1380 and remained so to mid-15th century.<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965.</ref> The later houppelande had sleeves that were snug at the wrist, making a full \"bag\" sleeve.  The bag sleeve was sometimes slashed in the front to allow the lower arm to reach through.\n\nAround 1450, the dress of northern Europe developed a low V-neck that showed a glimpse of the square-necked kirtle.  The neckline could be filled in with a sheer linen [[partlet]].  Wide turn-backs like revers displayed a contrasting lining, frequently of fur or black velvet, and the sleeves might be cuffed to match.  Sleeves were very long, covering half of the hand, and often highly decorated with embroidery.  Fine sleeves were often transferred from one dress to another.  The term ''robe d\u00e9guis\u00e9e'' was coined in the mid-1400s to describe garments reflecting the very latest fashions, a term which endured into the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cosman|first=Madeleine Pelner|title=Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, 3-Volume Set|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438109077|pages=868|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Jf5t1vFw1QC&pg=PA868}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lewandowski|first=Elizabeth J.|title=The complete costume dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0810877856|pages=251|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gbIsJ2tZJS4C&pg=PA251}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cressot|first=Marcel|title=Vocabulaire des Quinze joyes de mariage: d'apr\u00e8s le texte de la seconde \u00e9dition de la Biblioth\u00e8que elz\u00e9virienne de 1857|year=1939|publisher=Slatkine|pages=42|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eZ4W11DIzJIC&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the low scoop-neck of the early decades gave way to a neckline that was high in front with a lower V-neck at the back at mid-15th century.  This was followed by a V-neckline that displayed the kirtle or ''gamurra'' (sometimes spelled ''camorra'').  Sleeveless overdresses such as the ''cioppa'' were popular, and the gamurra sleeves displayed were often of rich figured silks.  The ''{{vanchor|cotta}}'' was a lighter-weight underdress for summerwear.  A sideless overdress called the ''giornea'' was worn with the gamurra or cotta.  Toward the end of the period, sleeves were made in sections or panels and slashed, allowing the full chemise sleeves below to be pulled through in puffs along the arm, at the shoulder, and at the elbow.  This was the beginning of the fashion for puffed and slashed sleeves that would last for two centuries.<ref name=\"Payne\" /><ref>Condra 2008, p. 22</ref>\n\nThe ''partlet'', a separate item to fill in a low neckline, appeared in this period, usually of sheer fabric (linen or possibly silk) with an open V-neckline. Some partlets have a collar and a back similar to the upper part of a shirt.  Burgundian partlets are usually depicted worn under the dress (but over the kirtle); in Italy the partlet seems to have been worn over the dress and could be pointed or cut straight across at the lower front.\n\nTwo uniquely Spanish fashions appear from the 1470s. The ''{{lang|es|verdugada}}'' or ''{{lang|es|verdugado}}'' was a gown with a bell-shaped [[hoop skirt]] with visible casings stiffened with reeds, which would become the [[farthingale]].  The earliest depictions of this garment come from [[Catalonia]], where it is worn with pieced or slashed sleeves and the second new style, a chemise with trumpet sleeves, open and very wide at the wrist.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nThe sideless surcoat of the [[1300\u20131400 in fashion|14th century]] became fossilized as a ceremonial costume for royalty, usually with an ermine front panel (called a ''plackard'' or ''placket'') and a mantle draped from the shoulders; it can be seen in variety of royal portraits and as \"shorthand\" to identify queens in illuminated manuscripts of the period.\n\n===Hairstyles and headdresses===\n\nA variety of hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in the 15th century. The ''crespine'' of Northern Europe, originally a thick hairnet or [[snood (headgear)|snood]], had evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head by the end of the 14th century.  Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed, like horns (''\u00e0 corn\u00e9'').<ref name=\"Payne\" /> By mid-15th century, the hair was pulled back from the forehead, and the crespine, now usually called a ''caul'', sat on the back of the head.  Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows. Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll, sometimes arranged in a heart-shape, or a veil, or both. [[Veil]]s were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead.\n\nWomen also wore the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], a draped hat based on the [[hood (headgear)|hood]] and [[liripipe]], and a variety of related draped and wrapped [[turban]]s.\n\nThe most extravagant headdress of Burgundian fashion is the [[hennin]], a cone or truncated-cone shaped cap with a wire frame covered in fabric and topped by a floating veil.  Later hennins feature a turned-back brim, or are worn over a hood with a turned-back brim.<ref>M. Vibbert, ''Headdresses of the 14th and 15th Centuries'', The Compleat Anachronist, No. 133, SCA monograph series (August 2006)</ref><ref>B. Payne, \"Women's Costume of the Fifteenth Century\", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)</ref> Towards the end of the 15th century women's head-dresses became smaller, more convenient, and less picturesque. The gable hood, a stiff and elaborate head-dress, emerged around 1480 and was popular among elder ladies up until the mid 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cookson|first=Nesfield|title=The Costume Book|year=1935|publisher=Robert M. McBride & Company|location=New York|page=83}}</ref>\n\nWomen of the merchant classes in Northern Europe wore modified versions of courtly hairstyles, with coifs or caps, veils, and [[wimple]]s of crisp linen (often with visible creases from ironing and folding). A brief fashion added rows of gathered frills to the coif or veil; this style is sometimes known by the German name ''{{lang|de|kruseler}}''.<ref name=\"Kohler\">K\u00f5hler, ''History of Costume''</ref>\n\nThe general European convention of completely covering married women's hair was not accepted in warmer Italy.<ref name=\"Payne\" />  Italian women wore their hair very long, wound with ribbons or braided, and twisted up into knots of various shapes with the ends hanging free.  The hair was then covered with sheer veils or small caps.  Toward the 1480s women wore chin-length sections of hair in loose waves or ripples over the ears (a style that would inspire \"vintage\" hair fashions in the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|1620s and '30s]] and again in the [[1840s in fashion|1840s]] and [[1850s in fashion|1850s]]).  Blond hair was considered desirable (by [[Botticelli]] for one), and visitors to Venice reported that ladies sat out in the sun on their terraces with their hair spread out around large circular disks worn like hats, attempting to bleach it in the sun.  Chemical methods were also used.<ref>For the fashion of bleached blond hair in Venice, see Tortora and Eubanks 1994, p. 146</ref>\n\n===Women's footwear===\nWomen from the 14th century wore laced ankle-boots, which were often lined with fur. Later in the 15th century, women also wore \"poulaines\". They used pattens to protect their tight shoes. \n<ref>{{cite book|author1=Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|author2-link=Yvonne Deslandres |author2=Yvonne Deslandres  |title=20,000 Years of Fashion: the History of Costume and Personal Adornment|date=1987|publisher=Harry N.

As the cut of doublets revealed more fabric, wealthy men's shirts were often decorated with [[embroidery]] or applied braid.\n\nOver the shirt was worn a [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]].  From around the mid-15th century very tight-fitting doublets, belted or tailored to be tight at the waist, giving in effect a short skirt below, were fashionable, at least for the young. Sleeves were generally full, even puffy, and when worn with a large chaperon, the look was extremely stylish, but very top-heavy.  Very tight hose, and long pointed shoes or thigh-boots gave a long attenuated appearance below the waist, and a chunky, solid one above.  The doublet was often elaborately pleated, especially at the back, the pleats being achieved by various means.  In Italy both shirt and doublet were often high, tight and collarless at the front of the neck; sometimes they are shown higher at the front than the back.\n\nMen of all classes wore short ''braies'' or [[Breeches#Etymology|breeches]], a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt.  [[Hose (clothing)|Hose]] or [[chausses]] made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored.  Early hose sometimes had leather soles and were worn without shoes or boots.  Hose were generally tied to the breech belt, or to the breeches themselves, or to a doublet.\n\nAs doublets became shorter, hose reached to the waist rather than the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the [[codpiece]].\n\nThe hose exposed by short tops were, especially in Italy late in the 15th century, often strikingly patterned, parti-coloured (different colours for each leg, or vertically divided), or embroidered. Hose were cut on the [[bias (textile)|cross-grain or bias]] for stretch.<ref name=\"Kohler\" />\n\n===Overrobes and outerwear===\nThe [[Houppelande]], in Italy called the ''{{lang|it|cioppa}}'', is the characteristic overgarment of the wealthy in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Laver\">Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>  It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ pleats<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume''</ref> and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor with, at the start of the 16th century, a high collar.  The houppelande could be lined in fur, and the hem and sleeves might be dagged or cut into scallops.  It was initially often worn belted, but later mostly hanging straight.  The length of the garment shortened from around the ankle to above the knee over this period.  The floor-length sleeves were later wrist-length but very full, forming a bag or sack sleeve, or were worn off the arm, hanging ornamentally behind.\n\nA sideless tunic or [[tabard]], called a ''giornea'' in Italy and a ''[[journade]]'' in France,<ref>Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', p, 197</ref> was popular.  It was usually pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted.  Young men wore them short and older men wore them calf- or ankle-length.\n\nThe middle of the 15th century in Burgundy saw what seems to have been the earliest occurrence of the male fashion for dressing all in black, which was to reappear so strongly in the \"Spanish\" style of the mid-16th\u201317th century and again in the 19th\u201320th centuries.  This was apparently begun by Duke [[Philip the Good]].<ref>Anne Hollander, ''Seeing through Clothes'',1978, The Viking Press, {{ISBN|0-380-48777-2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Venice]], the patrician class, after the age of joining the [[Senate of Venice|Great Council]], wore their long red robes as a uniform virtually unchanged throughout the 15th century.  In contrast, the young men and the famous [[courtesan]]s of the city dressed very extravagantly.\n\nIn the last decades of the 15th century, a new style of overgown appeared; this was of various lengths, generally worn unbelted, and featured wide turned back revers and collar.<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', pp. 219\u201320</ref>\n\nShort or long [[cloak]]s or mantles were worn overall for ceremonial occasions and in bad weather; these typically fastened on one shoulder.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[Image:Italienischer Meister des 15. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|Young Italian men wear brimless caps, ''The [[Betrothal]]'', c. 1470<ref>Boucher, ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', p. 214</ref>]]\n\nEarly in the 15th century, the hood remained a common component of dress for all classes, although it was frequently worn around the neck as a cowl or twisted into the fantastical shapes of the [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]].  [[Hat]]s of various styles&mdash;tall-crowned with small brims or no brims at all, hats with brims turned up on one side for variations of the coif,<ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Douglas|title=Costume History and Style|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632|isbn=0-13-181214-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/costumehistoryst00russ/page/164 164]|url=https://archive.org/details/costumehistoryst00russ/page/164}}</ref> or low-crowned with wider brims pulled to a point in front&mdash;began to compete with the draped chaperon, especially in Italy.<ref name=\"Laver\" /> A brimless scarlet cap became nearly universal for young Florentines in particular, and was widely worn by older men and those in other cities.\n\nIn mid-15th century, a bowl haircut with the hair shaved at the back of the neck was stylish.  In Germany, and briefly in Venice, a wide shock of frizzy blond hair was often seen on images of lovers (and angels) in the later part of the 15th century\u2014less often in portraits.   By the end of the 15th century, shoulder-length hair became fashionable, a trend that would continue into the [[1500\u20131550 in fashion|early 16th century]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Style gallery 1400\u20131450===\n<gallery>\nImage:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg|1 \u2013 1405\u201310\nImage:John the Fearless D of Burgundy.jpg|2 \u2013 1400\u201319\nImage:Masaccio 032.jpg|3 \u2013 c. 1425\nImage:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|4 \u2013 1433\nImage:Anoniem_-_Koning_Johan_I_van_Portugal_(1450-1500)_-_Lissabon_Museu_Nacional_de_Arte_Antiga_19-10-2010_16-12-61.jpg|5 \u2013 c.1435\nImage:Chancellor_Rolin_detail.jpg|6 \u2013 c.1435\nImage:Chausses 1440 Cleeves.jpg|7 \u2013 1440\nImage:Pellegrinaio Santa Maria della Scala n4 detail.jpg|8 \u2013 1442\nImage:Van der weyden miniature detail Philip.jpg|9 \u2013 1447\u20138\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg|The lord]] on the left wears a long figured houppelande with full sleeves lined in fur, while the men of his household wear short solid-coloured overrobes with parti-coloured or matching hose.

The heiress [[Mary of Burgundy]] married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] but died young.  In the last decade of the 15th century, [[Charles VIII of France]] [[Italian Wars|invaded Italy]] and was briefly declared [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]].  As a result, the French nobility were introduced to the fabrics and styles of Italy, which would combine with German influence to become mainstream fashion of the nobility in France (and later spread to England) in the [[1500\u20131550 in fashion|first half of the 16th century]].<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', chapters 3 and 4 ''passim''</ref>\n\n==Women's fashion==\n\n===Dress, kirtle, and chemise===\n[[Image:Petrus Christus 004 detail.jpg|thumb|Fur-trimmed [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundia]]n gown of mid-15th century has a [[Shirt#Neck|V-neck]] that displays the black kirtle and a band of the chemise.

The sleeves were made detachable and were heavily ornamented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laver|first=James|title=The Concise History of Costume and Fashion|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York|page=74}}</ref>  The long-waisted silhouette of the [[1300\u20131400 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a high-waisted style with fullness over the belly, often confined by a belt.  The wide, shallow scooped neckline was replaced by a V-neck, often cut low enough to reveal the decorated front of the kirtle beneath.\n\nVarious styles of overdresses were worn. The ''[[:File:Plaid cotehardie.jpg|cotehardie]]'' fitted smoothly from the shoulders to the hips and then flared by means of inserted triangular gores.  It featured sleeves tight to the elbow with hanging streamers or ''tippets''. The tight fit was achieved with lacing or [[Button (clothing)|button]]s. This style faded rapidly from fashion in favor of the houppelande, a full robe with a high collar and wide sleeves that had become fashionable around 1380 and remained so to mid-15th century.<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965.</ref> The later houppelande had sleeves that were snug at the wrist, making a full \"bag\" sleeve.  The bag sleeve was sometimes slashed in the front to allow the lower arm to reach through.\n\nAround 1450, the dress of northern Europe developed a low V-neck that showed a glimpse of the square-necked kirtle.  The neckline could be filled in with a sheer linen [[partlet]].  Wide turn-backs like revers displayed a contrasting lining, frequently of fur or black velvet, and the sleeves might be cuffed to match.  Sleeves were very long, covering half of the hand, and often highly decorated with embroidery.  Fine sleeves were often transferred from one dress to another.  The term ''robe d\u00e9guis\u00e9e'' was coined in the mid-1400s to describe garments reflecting the very latest fashions, a term which endured into the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cosman|first=Madeleine Pelner|title=Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, 3-Volume Set|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438109077|pages=868|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Jf5t1vFw1QC&pg=PA868}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lewandowski|first=Elizabeth J.|title=The complete costume dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0810877856|pages=251|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gbIsJ2tZJS4C&pg=PA251}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cressot|first=Marcel|title=Vocabulaire des Quinze joyes de mariage: d'apr\u00e8s le texte de la seconde \u00e9dition de la Biblioth\u00e8que elz\u00e9virienne de 1857|year=1939|publisher=Slatkine|pages=42|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eZ4W11DIzJIC&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the low scoop-neck of the early decades gave way to a neckline that was high in front with a lower V-neck at the back at mid-15th century.  This was followed by a V-neckline that displayed the kirtle or ''gamurra'' (sometimes spelled ''camorra'').  Sleeveless overdresses such as the ''cioppa'' were popular, and the gamurra sleeves displayed were often of rich figured silks.  The ''{{vanchor|cotta}}'' was a lighter-weight underdress for summerwear.  A sideless overdress called the ''giornea'' was worn with the gamurra or cotta.  Toward the end of the period, sleeves were made in sections or panels and slashed, allowing the full chemise sleeves below to be pulled through in puffs along the arm, at the shoulder, and at the elbow.  This was the beginning of the fashion for puffed and slashed sleeves that would last for two centuries.<ref name=\"Payne\" /><ref>Condra 2008, p. 22</ref>\n\nThe ''partlet'', a separate item to fill in a low neckline, appeared in this period, usually of sheer fabric (linen or possibly silk) with an open V-neckline. Some partlets have a collar and a back similar to the upper part of a shirt.  Burgundian partlets are usually depicted worn under the dress (but over the kirtle); in Italy the partlet seems to have been worn over the dress and could be pointed or cut straight across at the lower front.\n\nTwo uniquely Spanish fashions appear from the 1470s. The ''{{lang|es|verdugada}}'' or ''{{lang|es|verdugado}}'' was a gown with a bell-shaped [[hoop skirt]] with visible casings stiffened with reeds, which would become the [[farthingale]].  The earliest depictions of this garment come from [[Catalonia]], where it is worn with pieced or slashed sleeves and the second new style, a chemise with trumpet sleeves, open and very wide at the wrist.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nThe sideless surcoat of the [[1300\u20131400 in fashion|14th century]] became fossilized as a ceremonial costume for royalty, usually with an ermine front panel (called a ''plackard'' or ''placket'') and a mantle draped from the shoulders; it can be seen in variety of royal portraits and as \"shorthand\" to identify queens in illuminated manuscripts of the period.\n\n===Hairstyles and headdresses===\n\nA variety of hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in the 15th century. The ''crespine'' of Northern Europe, originally a thick hairnet or [[snood (headgear)|snood]], had evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head by the end of the 14th century.  Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed, like horns (''\u00e0 corn\u00e9'').<ref name=\"Payne\" /> By mid-15th century, the hair was pulled back from the forehead, and the crespine, now usually called a ''caul'', sat on the back of the head.  Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows. Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll, sometimes arranged in a heart-shape, or a veil, or both. [[Veil]]s were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead.\n\nWomen also wore the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], a draped hat based on the [[hood (headgear)|hood]] and [[liripipe]], and a variety of related draped and wrapped [[turban]]s.\n\nThe most extravagant headdress of Burgundian fashion is the [[hennin]], a cone or truncated-cone shaped cap with a wire frame covered in fabric and topped by a floating veil.  Later hennins feature a turned-back brim, or are worn over a hood with a turned-back brim.<ref>M. Vibbert, ''Headdresses of the 14th and 15th Centuries'', The Compleat Anachronist, No. 133, SCA monograph series (August 2006)</ref><ref>B. Payne, \"Women's Costume of the Fifteenth Century\", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)</ref> Towards the end of the 15th century women's head-dresses became smaller, more convenient, and less picturesque. The gable hood, a stiff and elaborate head-dress, emerged around 1480 and was popular among elder ladies up until the mid 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cookson|first=Nesfield|title=The Costume Book|year=1935|publisher=Robert M. McBride & Company|location=New York|page=83}}</ref>\n\nWomen of the merchant classes in Northern Europe wore modified versions of courtly hairstyles, with coifs or caps, veils, and [[wimple]]s of crisp linen (often with visible creases from ironing and folding). A brief fashion added rows of gathered frills to the coif or veil; this style is sometimes known by the German name ''{{lang|de|kruseler}}''.<ref name=\"Kohler\">K\u00f5hler, ''History of Costume''</ref>\n\nThe general European convention of completely covering married women's hair was not accepted in warmer Italy.<ref name=\"Payne\" />  Italian women wore their hair very long, wound with ribbons or braided, and twisted up into knots of various shapes with the ends hanging free.  The hair was then covered with sheer veils or small caps.  Toward the 1480s women wore chin-length sections of hair in loose waves or ripples over the ears (a style that would inspire \"vintage\" hair fashions in the [[1600\u20131650 in fashion|1620s and '30s]] and again in the [[1840s in fashion|1840s]] and [[1850s in fashion|1850s]]).  Blond hair was considered desirable (by [[Botticelli]] for one), and visitors to Venice reported that ladies sat out in the sun on their terraces with their hair spread out around large circular disks worn like hats, attempting to bleach it in the sun.  Chemical methods were also used.<ref>For the fashion of bleached blond hair in Venice, see Tortora and Eubanks 1994, p. 146</ref>\n\n===Women's footwear===\nWomen from the 14th century wore laced ankle-boots, which were often lined with fur. Later in the 15th century, women also wore \"poulaines\". They used pattens to protect their tight shoes. \n<ref>{{cite book|author1=Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|author2-link=Yvonne Deslandres |author2=Yvonne Deslandres  |title=20,000 Years of Fashion: the History of Costume and Personal Adornment|date=1987|publisher=Harry N.

Her companion (probably her daughter Juana or Joanna) wears undersleeves fastened up the back over full chemise sleeves.  Her red dress is open from the waist down in back and has very long hanging sleeves, one of which is looped up over her right shoulder.  Her hair is braided and wrapped with a knot or tassel at the end.

Her sleeves are tied to her dress, and the chemise beneath is pulled out in puffs between the ribbon ties.  The puffs and the lower waist would be important fashion trends in the next decades.\n\n==Men's fashion==\n[[Image:Botticelli magi detail.jpg|thumb|Italian fashion of the 1470s features short overgowns worn over doublets, and hats of many shapes.]]\n[[Image:Aveu Ren\u00e9 2.jpg|thumb|Hats in a variety of styles are also worn by this group of French noblemen in high-collared overgowns lined with fur, c. 1470.]]\n[[Image:Vittore Carpaccio 038.jpg|thumb|Late in the 15th century, a new style of loose overgown with revers and collar appeared. Italy, 1495]]\n\n===Shirt, doublet, and hose===\nThe basic costume of men in this period consisted of a shirt, doublet, and hose, with some sort of overrobe (robe worn over clothing).\n\nLinen shirts were worn next to the skin.  Toward the end of the period, shirts (French ''[[chemise]]'', Italian ''camicia'', Spanish ''camisa'') began to be full through the body and sleeves with wide, low necklines; the sleeves were pulled through the slashings or piecing of the doublet sleeves to make puffs, especially at the elbow and the back of the arm.  As the cut of doublets revealed more fabric, wealthy men's shirts were often decorated with [[embroidery]] or applied braid.\n\nOver the shirt was worn a [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]].  From around the mid-15th century very tight-fitting doublets, belted or tailored to be tight at the waist, giving in effect a short skirt below, were fashionable, at least for the young. Sleeves were generally full, even puffy, and when worn with a large chaperon, the look was extremely stylish, but very top-heavy.  Very tight hose, and long pointed shoes or thigh-boots gave a long attenuated appearance below the waist, and a chunky, solid one above.  The doublet was often elaborately pleated, especially at the back, the pleats being achieved by various means.  In Italy both shirt and doublet were often high, tight and collarless at the front of the neck; sometimes they are shown higher at the front than the back.\n\nMen of all classes wore short ''braies'' or [[Breeches#Etymology|breeches]], a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt.  [[Hose (clothing)|Hose]] or [[chausses]] made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored.  Early hose sometimes had leather soles and were worn without shoes or boots.  Hose were generally tied to the breech belt, or to the breeches themselves, or to a doublet.\n\nAs doublets became shorter, hose reached to the waist rather than the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the [[codpiece]].\n\nThe hose exposed by short tops were, especially in Italy late in the 15th century, often strikingly patterned, parti-coloured (different colours for each leg, or vertically divided), or embroidered. Hose were cut on the [[bias (textile)|cross-grain or bias]] for stretch.<ref name=\"Kohler\" />\n\n===Overrobes and outerwear===\nThe [[Houppelande]], in Italy called the ''{{lang|it|cioppa}}'', is the characteristic overgarment of the wealthy in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Laver\">Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>  It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ pleats<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume''</ref> and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor with, at the start of the 16th century, a high collar.  The houppelande could be lined in fur, and the hem and sleeves might be dagged or cut into scallops.  It was initially often worn belted, but later mostly hanging straight.  The length of the garment shortened from around the ankle to above the knee over this period.  The floor-length sleeves were later wrist-length but very full, forming a bag or sack sleeve, or were worn off the arm, hanging ornamentally behind.\n\nA sideless tunic or [[tabard]], called a ''giornea'' in Italy and a ''[[journade]]'' in France,<ref>Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', p, 197</ref> was popular.  It was usually pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted.  Young men wore them short and older men wore them calf- or ankle-length.\n\nThe middle of the 15th century in Burgundy saw what seems to have been the earliest occurrence of the male fashion for dressing all in black, which was to reappear so strongly in the \"Spanish\" style of the mid-16th\u201317th century and again in the 19th\u201320th centuries.  This was apparently begun by Duke [[Philip the Good]].<ref>Anne Hollander, ''Seeing through Clothes'',1978, The Viking Press, {{ISBN|0-380-48777-2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Venice]], the patrician class, after the age of joining the [[Senate of Venice|Great Council]], wore their long red robes as a uniform virtually unchanged throughout the 15th century.  In contrast, the young men and the famous [[courtesan]]s of the city dressed very extravagantly.\n\nIn the last decades of the 15th century, a new style of overgown appeared; this was of various lengths, generally worn unbelted, and featured wide turned back revers and collar.<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', pp. 219\u201320</ref>\n\nShort or long [[cloak]]s or mantles were worn overall for ceremonial occasions and in bad weather; these typically fastened on one shoulder.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[Image:Italienischer Meister des 15. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|Young Italian men wear brimless caps, ''The [[Betrothal]]'', c. 1470<ref>Boucher, ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', p. 214</ref>]]\n\nEarly in the 15th century, the hood remained a common component of dress for all classes, although it was frequently worn around the neck as a cowl or twisted into the fantastical shapes of the [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]].  [[Hat]]s of various styles&mdash;tall-crowned with small brims or no brims at all, hats with brims turned up on one side for variations of the coif,<ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Douglas|title=Costume History and Style|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632|isbn=0-13-181214-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/costumehistoryst00russ/page/164 164]|url=https://archive.org/details/costumehistoryst00russ/page/164}}</ref> or low-crowned with wider brims pulled to a point in front&mdash;began to compete with the draped chaperon, especially in Italy.<ref name=\"Laver\" /> A brimless scarlet cap became nearly universal for young Florentines in particular, and was widely worn by older men and those in other cities.\n\nIn mid-15th century, a bowl haircut with the hair shaved at the back of the neck was stylish.  In Germany, and briefly in Venice, a wide shock of frizzy blond hair was often seen on images of lovers (and angels) in the later part of the 15th century\u2014less often in portraits.   By the end of the 15th century, shoulder-length hair became fashionable, a trend that would continue into the [[1500\u20131550 in fashion|early 16th century]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Style gallery 1400\u20131450===\n<gallery>\nImage:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg|1 \u2013 1405\u201310\nImage:John the Fearless D of Burgundy.jpg|2 \u2013 1400\u201319\nImage:Masaccio 032.jpg|3 \u2013 c. 1425\nImage:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|4 \u2013 1433\nImage:Anoniem_-_Koning_Johan_I_van_Portugal_(1450-1500)_-_Lissabon_Museu_Nacional_de_Arte_Antiga_19-10-2010_16-12-61.jpg|5 \u2013 c.1435\nImage:Chancellor_Rolin_detail.jpg|6 \u2013 c.1435\nImage:Chausses 1440 Cleeves.jpg|7 \u2013 1440\nImage:Pellegrinaio Santa Maria della Scala n4 detail.jpg|8 \u2013 1442\nImage:Van der weyden miniature detail Philip.jpg|9 \u2013 1447\u20138\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg|The lord]] on the left wears a long figured houppelande with full sleeves lined in fur, while the men of his household wear short solid-coloured overrobes with parti-coloured or matching hose.

Greenwood Press, London, 2005 {{ISBN|0-313-29375-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the century the length of female hem-lines progressively reduced, and by the end of the century it was fashionable for men to omit the long loose over-garment of previous centuries (whether called tunic, kirtle, or other names)  altogether, putting the emphasis on a tailored top that fell a little below the waist\u2014a silhouette that is still reflected in men's costume today.<ref>See discussion in Laver: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>\n\n==Fabrics and furs==\n[[Image:The Wilton Diptych (left).jpg|thumb|left|The young [[Richard II of England]], kneeling, wears a [[houppelande]] of silk brocade with the badge of his [[livery]].

However, the trend during the century was for hem-lengths to shorten for all classes.\n\nHowever, in the second half of the century, courtiers are often shown, if they have the figure for it, wearing nothing over their closely tailored cotehardie.  A French [[chronicle]] records: \"Around that year (1350), men, in particular, noblemen and their squires, took to wearing tunics so short and tight that they revealed what modesty bids us hide.  This was a most astonishing thing for the people\".<ref>Continuation of a chronicle of [[Guillaume de Nangis]], Archives Nationales, Paris.  Quoted in: Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,\" p. 317, William Collins & Sons, London 1981</ref>\nThis fashion may well have derived from military clothing, where long loose robes were naturally not worn in action. At this period, the most dignified figures, like King Charles in the illustration, continue to wear long robes\u2014although as the Royal Chamberlain, de Vaudetar was himself a person of very high rank.  This abandonment of the robe to emphasize a tight top over the torso, with breeches or trousers below, was to become the distinctive feature of European men's fashion for centuries to come. Men had carried purses up to this time because tunics did not provide pockets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashevillelist.com/history/medieval-clothing.htm |title=Medieval Clothing Facts and information - Medieval clothing history, fashions |publisher=Ashevillelist.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BookoftheduchessIIIcchaucer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chaucer]] reading his work to the court of Richard II, c. 1400]]\nThe funeral effigy and \"achievements\" of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], who died in 1376, show the military version of the same outline.  Over [[Plate armour|armour]] he is shown wearing a short fitted ''arming-coat'' or ''jupon'' or ''gipon'', the original of which was hung above and still survives. This has the quartered arms of England and France, with a rather similar effect to a parti-coloured jacket.  The \"charges\" (figures) of the arms are embroidered in gold on linen pieces, [[appliqu\u00e9]]d onto coloured silk velvet fields.  It is vertically quilted, with wool stuffing and a silk satin lining.  This type of coat, originally worn out of sight under armour, was in fashion as an outer garment from about 1360 until early the next century.  Only this and a child's version (Chartres Cathedral) survive.<ref>[[Claude Blair]] in Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds), ''Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200\u20131400'', Royal Academy/Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1987, p 480.[http://www.forest.gen.nz/Medieval/articles/garments/blackprince/blackprince.html The effigy and arming-coat of the Black Prince]</ref>  As an indication of the rapid spread of fashion between the courts of Europe, a manuscript chronicle illuminated in Hungary by 1360 shows very [[Chronicon Pictum|similar styles]] to Edward's English version.\n\nEdward's son, King [[Richard II of England]], led a court that, like many in Europe late in the century, was extremely refined and fashion-conscious.  He himself is credited with having invented the [[handkerchief]]; \"little pieces [of cloth] for the lord King to wipe and clean his nose,\" appear in the Household Rolls (accounts), which is the first documentation of their use.  He distributed jeweled [[livery]] badges with his personal emblem of the white [[Deer|hart]] (deer) to his friends, like the one he himself wears in the [[Wilton Diptych]] (above).  In the miniature (left) of Chaucer reading to his court both men and women wear very high collars and quantities of jewelry.  The King (standing to the left of Chaucer; his face has been defaced) wears a patterned gold-coloured costume with matching hat.  Most of the men wear [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] hats, and the women have their hair elaborately dressed.  Male courtiers enjoyed wearing fancy-dress for festivities; the disastrous [[Charles VI of France#Bal des Ardents|Bal des Ardents]] in 1393 in Paris is the most famous example. Men, as well as women, wore decorated and jewelled clothes; for the entry of the [[Isabeau of Bavaria|Queen of France]] into Paris in 1389, the [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]] wore a velvet doublet embroidered with forty sheep and forty swans, each with a pearl bell around its neck.<ref>Barbara Tuchman;A Distant Mirror, 1978, Alfred A Knopf Ltd, p456, quoting Vaughan's biography of Philip.</ref>\n\nA new garment, the [[houppelande]], appeared around 1380 and was to remain fashionable well into the next century.<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>  It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders, very full trailing sleeves, and the high collar favored at the English court.  The extravagance of the sleeves was criticized by moralists.\n\n===Headgear and accessories===\n[[Image:20-alimenti vino rosso Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 detail chaperon.jpg|thumb|Man wearing a chaperon, Italy, late 14th century]]\nDuring this century, the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] made a transformation from being a utilitarian hood with a small cape to becoming a complicated and fashionable hat worn by the wealthy in town settings.  This came when they began to be worn with the opening for the face placed instead on the top of the head.\n\nBelts were worn below waist at all times, and very low on the hips with the tightly fitted fashions of the latter half of the century.  Belt pouches or purses were used, and long daggers, usually hanging diagonally to the front.\n\nIn armour, the century saw increases in the amount of [[plate armour]] worn, and by the end of the century the full suit had been developed, although mixtures of [[chain mail]] and plate remained more common.  The visored [[bascinet]] helmet was a new development in this century.  Ordinary soldiers were lucky to have a mail [[hauberk]], and perhaps some ''[[Boiled leather|cuir bouilli]]'' (\"boiled leather\") knee or shin pieces.<ref>Claude Blair, in Alexander & Binski, op cit pp 169\u201370</ref>\n\n===Style gallery===\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Braies 14th century.jpg|1 \u2013 Braies\nImage:3-piantagione Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 shirt..jpg|2 \u2013 Shirt and braies\nImage:Luttrell servant.jpg|3 \u2013 Servant\nImage:Bologna marriage men.jpg|4 \u2013 Cotehardie and hood\nImage:Plaid cotehardie.jpg|5 \u2013 Cotehardie\nImage:37-svaghi cacciaTaccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 cacciatore..jpg|6 \u2013 Huntsman\nImage:33-vento orientale Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 detail..jpg|7 \u2013 Walking\nImage:46-aspetti di vita quotidiana discrezione Taccuino Sanitatis detail2..jpg|8 \u2013 Men's gowns\n</gallery>\n\n#[[:Image:Braies 14th century.jpg|Braies]] are worn rolled over a belt at the waist.

Many in the lower classes wore their undergarments to bed because of the cold weather at night time and since their beds usually consisted of a straw mattress and a few sheets, the undergarment would act as another layer.\n\n===Dresses and outerwear===\nOver the chemise, women wore a loose or fitted dress called a ''cotte'' or [[kirtle]], usually ankle or floor-length, and with [[train (clothing)|trains]] for formal occasions.  Fitted kirtles had wide skirts made by adding triangular gores to widen the hem without adding bulk at the waist.  Kirtles also had long, fitted sleeves that sometimes reached down to cover the knuckles.\n\nVarious sorts of robes were worn over the kirtle, and are called by different names by costume historians. When fitted, this garment is often called a [[cotehardie]] (although this usage of the word has been heavily criticized<ref>[http://www.cottesimple.com/ La Cotte Simple]</ref>) and might have hanging sleeves and sometimes worn with a jeweled or metalworked belt.  Over time, the hanging part of the sleeve became longer and narrower until it was the merest streamer, called a ''tippet'', then gaining the floral or leaflike daggings in the end of the century.<ref name=payne>Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965</ref>\n\nSleeveless dresses or [[tabard]]s derive from the [[Cyclas (garment)|cyclas]], an unfitted rectangle of cloth with an opening for the head that was worn in the 13th century.  By the early 14th century, the sides began to be sewn together, creating a sleeveless overdress or surcoat.<ref name=payne/>\n\nOutdoors, women wore [[cloak]]s or [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]]s, often lined in fur.  The [[houppelande]] was also adopted by women late in the century.  Women invariably wore their houppelandes floor-length, the waistline rising up to right underneath the bust, sleeves very wide and hanging, like [[angel sleeves]].\n\n===Headdresses===\n\nAs one might imagine, a woman's outfit was not complete without some kind of headwear. As with today, a medieval woman had many options- from straw hats, to hoods to elaborate headpieces. A woman's activity and occasion would dictate what she wore on her head.\n\nThe Middle Ages, particularly the 14th and 15th centuries, were home to some of the most outstanding and gravity-defying headwear in history.\n\nBefore the [[hennin]] rocketed skywards, padded rolls and truncated and reticulated headdresses graced the heads of fashionable ladies everywhere in Europe and England. [[Caul (headgear)|Cauls]], the cylindrical cages worn at the side of the head and temples, added to the richness of dress of the fashionable and the well-to-do. Other more simple forms of headdress included the [[coronet]] or simple [[circlet]] of flowers.\n\n====Northern and western Europe====\nMarried women in Northern and Western Europe wore some type of headcovering.  The ''barbet'' was a band of linen that passed under the chin and was pinned on top of the head; it descended from the earlier [[wimple]] (in French, ''barbe''), which was now worn only by older women, widows, and [[nun]]s.  The barbet was worn with a linen [[Fillet (clothing)|fillet]] or headband, or with a linen cap called a [[coif]], with or without a ''couvrechef'' ([[kerchief]]) or [[Veil#History|veil]] overall.<ref>Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979;</ref> It passed out of fashion by mid-century. Unmarried girls simply braided the hair to keep the dirt out.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Isabeau of Bavaria statue.jpg|thumb|A crespine worn by [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], Queen of France{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 26 November 2012}}]] -->\nThe barbet and fillet or barbet and veil could also be worn over the ''crespine'', a thick hairnet or [[snood (headgear)|snood]].  Over time, the crespine evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head, and even later, at the back.  This metal crespine was also called a ''caul'', and remained stylish long after the barbet had fallen out of fashion.<ref>Payne, ''History of Costume''</ref> For example, it was used in [[Hungary]] until the beginning of the second half of the 15th century, as it was used by the Hungarian queen consort [[Barbara of Celje]] around 1440.\n\n====Italy====\nUncovered hair was acceptable for women in the Italian states.  Many women twisted their long hair with cords or ribbons and wrapped the twists around their heads, often without any cap or veil.  Hair was also worn braided.  Older women and widows wore a veil and wimple, and a simple knotted kerchief was worn while working. In the image at right, one woman wears a red hood draped over her twisted and bound hair.\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Giotto joachim detail.jpg|1 \u2013 Italian gowns\nImage:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg detail.jpg|2 \u2013 Barbet and fillet\nImage:Luttrell women.jpg|3 \u2013 Women dining\nImage:Luttrell1 detail woman.jpg|4 \u2013 In a garden\nImage:Romance of alexander.jpg|5 \u2013 Hood\nImage:Ambrogio Lorenzetti 003.jpg|6 \u2013 Italian fashion\nImage:Bologna marriage women.jpg|7 \u2013 Bride and ladies\nImage:46-aspetti di vita quotidiana discrezione Taccuino Sanitatis detail..jpg|8 \u2013 Houppelande\nImage:El\u017cbieta \u0141okietk\u00f3wna z dzie\u0107mi.JPG|9 - Hungarian fashion ([[Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary]] and her children.

Costume historian [[James Laver]] suggests that the mid-14th century marks the emergence of recognizable \"[[fashion]]\" in clothing,<ref>Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979, p. 62</ref> in which [[Fernand Braudel]] concurs.<ref>Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,\" p. 317, William Collins & Sons, London 1981</ref> The draped garments and straight seams of previous centuries were replaced by curved seams and the beginnings of [[tailor]]ing, which allowed clothing to more closely fit the human form. Also, the use of lacing and buttons allowed a more snug fit to clothing.<ref>Singman, Jeffrey L. and Will McLean: ''Daily Life in Chaucer's England'', page 93. Greenwood Press, London, 2005 {{ISBN|0-313-29375-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the century the length of female hem-lines progressively reduced, and by the end of the century it was fashionable for men to omit the long loose over-garment of previous centuries (whether called tunic, kirtle, or other names)  altogether, putting the emphasis on a tailored top that fell a little below the waist\u2014a silhouette that is still reflected in men's costume today.<ref>See discussion in Laver: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>\n\n==Fabrics and furs==\n[[Image:The Wilton Diptych (left).jpg|thumb|left|The young [[Richard II of England]], kneeling, wears a [[houppelande]] of silk brocade with the badge of his [[livery]].

Trade in textiles continued to grow throughout the century and formed an important part of the economy for many areas from England to Italy. Clothes were very expensive, and employees, even high-ranking officials, were usually supplied with, typically, one outfit per year, as part of their remuneration.\n\n[[Image:Psalter of Mary de Bohun and Henry Bolingbroke 1380-85 Abigail.jpg|thumb|Mary de Bohun wears an ermine-lined mantle tied with red strings.

[[Embroidery]] in wool, and silk or gold thread for the rich were used for decoration. [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] established an embroidery workshop in the [[Tower of London]], which presumably produced the robes he and his Queen wore in 1351 of red velvet \"embroidered with clouds of silver and eagles of pearl and gold, under each alternate cloud an eagle of pearl, and under each of the other clouds a golden eagle, every eagle having in its beak a Garter with the motto ''[[Order of the Garter|hony soyt qui mal y pense]]'' embroidered thereon.\"<ref>Donald King in Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds), op cit, p 160</ref>\n\n[[Silk]] was the finest fabric of all.

However, the trend during the century was for hem-lengths to shorten for all classes.\n\nHowever, in the second half of the century, courtiers are often shown, if they have the figure for it, wearing nothing over their closely tailored cotehardie.  A French [[chronicle]] records: \"Around that year (1350), men, in particular, noblemen and their squires, took to wearing tunics so short and tight that they revealed what modesty bids us hide.  This was a most astonishing thing for the people\".<ref>Continuation of a chronicle of [[Guillaume de Nangis]], Archives Nationales, Paris.  Quoted in: Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life,\" p. 317, William Collins & Sons, London 1981</ref>\nThis fashion may well have derived from military clothing, where long loose robes were naturally not worn in action. At this period, the most dignified figures, like King Charles in the illustration, continue to wear long robes\u2014although as the Royal Chamberlain, de Vaudetar was himself a person of very high rank.  This abandonment of the robe to emphasize a tight top over the torso, with breeches or trousers below, was to become the distinctive feature of European men's fashion for centuries to come. Men had carried purses up to this time because tunics did not provide pockets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashevillelist.com/history/medieval-clothing.htm |title=Medieval Clothing Facts and information - Medieval clothing history, fashions |publisher=Ashevillelist.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BookoftheduchessIIIcchaucer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chaucer]] reading his work to the court of Richard II, c. 1400]]\nThe funeral effigy and \"achievements\" of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], who died in 1376, show the military version of the same outline.  Over [[Plate armour|armour]] he is shown wearing a short fitted ''arming-coat'' or ''jupon'' or ''gipon'', the original of which was hung above and still survives. This has the quartered arms of England and France, with a rather similar effect to a parti-coloured jacket.  The \"charges\" (figures) of the arms are embroidered in gold on linen pieces, [[appliqu\u00e9]]d onto coloured silk velvet fields.  It is vertically quilted, with wool stuffing and a silk satin lining.  This type of coat, originally worn out of sight under armour, was in fashion as an outer garment from about 1360 until early the next century.  Only this and a child's version (Chartres Cathedral) survive.<ref>[[Claude Blair]] in Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds), ''Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200\u20131400'', Royal Academy/Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1987, p 480.[http://www.forest.gen.nz/Medieval/articles/garments/blackprince/blackprince.html The effigy and arming-coat of the Black Prince]</ref>  As an indication of the rapid spread of fashion between the courts of Europe, a manuscript chronicle illuminated in Hungary by 1360 shows very [[Chronicon Pictum|similar styles]] to Edward's English version.\n\nEdward's son, King [[Richard II of England]], led a court that, like many in Europe late in the century, was extremely refined and fashion-conscious.  He himself is credited with having invented the [[handkerchief]]; \"little pieces [of cloth] for the lord King to wipe and clean his nose,\" appear in the Household Rolls (accounts), which is the first documentation of their use.  He distributed jeweled [[livery]] badges with his personal emblem of the white [[Deer|hart]] (deer) to his friends, like the one he himself wears in the [[Wilton Diptych]] (above).  In the miniature (left) of Chaucer reading to his court both men and women wear very high collars and quantities of jewelry.  The King (standing to the left of Chaucer; his face has been defaced) wears a patterned gold-coloured costume with matching hat.  Most of the men wear [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] hats, and the women have their hair elaborately dressed.  Male courtiers enjoyed wearing fancy-dress for festivities; the disastrous [[Charles VI of France#Bal des Ardents|Bal des Ardents]] in 1393 in Paris is the most famous example. Men, as well as women, wore decorated and jewelled clothes; for the entry of the [[Isabeau of Bavaria|Queen of France]] into Paris in 1389, the [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]] wore a velvet doublet embroidered with forty sheep and forty swans, each with a pearl bell around its neck.<ref>Barbara Tuchman;A Distant Mirror, 1978, Alfred A Knopf Ltd, p456, quoting Vaughan's biography of Philip.</ref>\n\nA new garment, the [[houppelande]], appeared around 1380 and was to remain fashionable well into the next century.<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>  It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders, very full trailing sleeves, and the high collar favored at the English court.  The extravagance of the sleeves was criticized by moralists.\n\n===Headgear and accessories===\n[[Image:20-alimenti vino rosso Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 detail chaperon.jpg|thumb|Man wearing a chaperon, Italy, late 14th century]]\nDuring this century, the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] made a transformation from being a utilitarian hood with a small cape to becoming a complicated and fashionable hat worn by the wealthy in town settings.  This came when they began to be worn with the opening for the face placed instead on the top of the head.\n\nBelts were worn below waist at all times, and very low on the hips with the tightly fitted fashions of the latter half of the century.  Belt pouches or purses were used, and long daggers, usually hanging diagonally to the front.\n\nIn armour, the century saw increases in the amount of [[plate armour]] worn, and by the end of the century the full suit had been developed, although mixtures of [[chain mail]] and plate remained more common.  The visored [[bascinet]] helmet was a new development in this century.  Ordinary soldiers were lucky to have a mail [[hauberk]], and perhaps some ''[[Boiled leather|cuir bouilli]]'' (\"boiled leather\") knee or shin pieces.<ref>Claude Blair, in Alexander & Binski, op cit pp 169\u201370</ref>\n\n===Style gallery===\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Braies 14th century.jpg|1 \u2013 Braies\nImage:3-piantagione Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 shirt..jpg|2 \u2013 Shirt and braies\nImage:Luttrell servant.jpg|3 \u2013 Servant\nImage:Bologna marriage men.jpg|4 \u2013 Cotehardie and hood\nImage:Plaid cotehardie.jpg|5 \u2013 Cotehardie\nImage:37-svaghi cacciaTaccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 cacciatore..jpg|6 \u2013 Huntsman\nImage:33-vento orientale Taccuino Sanitatis Casanatense 4182 detail..jpg|7 \u2013 Walking\nImage:46-aspetti di vita quotidiana discrezione Taccuino Sanitatis detail2..jpg|8 \u2013 Men's gowns\n</gallery>\n\n#[[:Image:Braies 14th century.jpg|Braies]] are worn rolled over a belt at the waist.

Many in the lower classes wore their undergarments to bed because of the cold weather at night time and since their beds usually consisted of a straw mattress and a few sheets, the undergarment would act as another layer.\n\n===Dresses and outerwear===\nOver the chemise, women wore a loose or fitted dress called a ''cotte'' or [[kirtle]], usually ankle or floor-length, and with [[train (clothing)|trains]] for formal occasions.  Fitted kirtles had wide skirts made by adding triangular gores to widen the hem without adding bulk at the waist.  Kirtles also had long, fitted sleeves that sometimes reached down to cover the knuckles.\n\nVarious sorts of robes were worn over the kirtle, and are called by different names by costume historians. When fitted, this garment is often called a [[cotehardie]] (although this usage of the word has been heavily criticized<ref>[http://www.cottesimple.com/ La Cotte Simple]</ref>) and might have hanging sleeves and sometimes worn with a jeweled or metalworked belt.  Over time, the hanging part of the sleeve became longer and narrower until it was the merest streamer, called a ''tippet'', then gaining the floral or leaflike daggings in the end of the century.<ref name=payne>Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965</ref>\n\nSleeveless dresses or [[tabard]]s derive from the [[Cyclas (garment)|cyclas]], an unfitted rectangle of cloth with an opening for the head that was worn in the 13th century.  By the early 14th century, the sides began to be sewn together, creating a sleeveless overdress or surcoat.<ref name=payne/>\n\nOutdoors, women wore [[cloak]]s or [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]]s, often lined in fur.  The [[houppelande]] was also adopted by women late in the century.  Women invariably wore their houppelandes floor-length, the waistline rising up to right underneath the bust, sleeves very wide and hanging, like [[angel sleeves]].\n\n===Headdresses===\n\nAs one might imagine, a woman's outfit was not complete without some kind of headwear. As with today, a medieval woman had many options- from straw hats, to hoods to elaborate headpieces. A woman's activity and occasion would dictate what she wore on her head.\n\nThe Middle Ages, particularly the 14th and 15th centuries, were home to some of the most outstanding and gravity-defying headwear in history.\n\nBefore the [[hennin]] rocketed skywards, padded rolls and truncated and reticulated headdresses graced the heads of fashionable ladies everywhere in Europe and England. [[Caul (headgear)|Cauls]], the cylindrical cages worn at the side of the head and temples, added to the richness of dress of the fashionable and the well-to-do. Other more simple forms of headdress included the [[coronet]] or simple [[circlet]] of flowers.\n\n====Northern and western Europe====\nMarried women in Northern and Western Europe wore some type of headcovering.  The ''barbet'' was a band of linen that passed under the chin and was pinned on top of the head; it descended from the earlier [[wimple]] (in French, ''barbe''), which was now worn only by older women, widows, and [[nun]]s.  The barbet was worn with a linen [[Fillet (clothing)|fillet]] or headband, or with a linen cap called a [[coif]], with or without a ''couvrechef'' ([[kerchief]]) or [[Veil#History|veil]] overall.<ref>Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979;</ref> It passed out of fashion by mid-century. Unmarried girls simply braided the hair to keep the dirt out.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Isabeau of Bavaria statue.jpg|thumb|A crespine worn by [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], Queen of France{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 26 November 2012}}]] -->\nThe barbet and fillet or barbet and veil could also be worn over the ''crespine'', a thick hairnet or [[snood (headgear)|snood]].  Over time, the crespine evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head, and even later, at the back.  This metal crespine was also called a ''caul'', and remained stylish long after the barbet had fallen out of fashion.<ref>Payne, ''History of Costume''</ref> For example, it was used in [[Hungary]] until the beginning of the second half of the 15th century, as it was used by the Hungarian queen consort [[Barbara of Celje]] around 1440.\n\n====Italy====\nUncovered hair was acceptable for women in the Italian states.  Many women twisted their long hair with cords or ribbons and wrapped the twists around their heads, often without any cap or veil.  Hair was also worn braided.

Silk, although extremely expensive, was readily available to wealthy people of consequence. [[Silk]]s from [[Byzantium]] were traded in [[Pavia]] by way of [[Venice]], and silks from [[Andalusia]] reached [[France]] via [[Spain]].  In the last decade of the previous century, the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest of Sicily]] and the [[First Crusade]] had opened additional routes for Eastern fabrics and style influences into Europe.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nFur was worn as an inside [[lining (sewing)|lining]] for warmth. [[Vair]], the fur of the squirrel, was particularly popular and can be seen in many [[illuminated manuscript]] illustrations, where it is shown as a white and blue-grey softly striped or checkered pattern lining the mantles of the wealthy.\n\n===The bliaut===\nA new French fashion for both men and women was the ''[[bliaut]]'' or ''bliaud'', a long outer tunic with full skirts from the hip and sleeves that fitted tightly to the elbow and then flared into a trumpet shape.  Early bliauts were moderately fitted and bloused slightly over the belt at the waist.  Later the bliaut was fitted tightly to the body from shoulder to hip, and the belt, or girdle was wrapped twice around the waist and knotted in front of the abdomen.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\n==Men's clothing==\n[[Image:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 Gemini.jpg|right|thumb|200px|\"Gemini\" from the ''[[Hunterian Psalter]]'' shows the twins in knee-length tunics over chausses and shoes with pointed toes.  England, c. 1170]]\n\n===Shirt, braies, and chausses===\nUnderclothes consisted of an inner tunic (French ''chainse'') or shirt with long, tight sleeves, and drawers or ''braies'', usually of linen. Tailored cloth [[leggings]] called ''chausses'' or [[Hose (clothing)|hose]], made as separate garments for each leg, were often worn with the tunic; striped hose were popular.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nDuring this period, beginning with the middle and upper classes, hose became longer and more fitting, and they reached above the knees. Previously, they were looser and worn with drawers that ranged from knee- to ankle-length. The new type of hose were worn with drawers that reached the knees or above, and they were wide enough at the top to allow the drawers to be tucked into them. They were held up in place by being attached to the girdle of the drawers.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Bradfield, 19.</ref>\n\nThe better fit and girdle attachment of these new hose eliminated the need for the leg bands often worn with earlier hose. In England, however, leg bands continued to be worn by some people, both rich and poor, right up to the reign of [[Richard I]].<ref>Bradfield, 23.</ref> After 1200, they were largely abandoned.<ref>Bradfield, 27.</ref>\n\n===Outer tunics and doublets===\nOver the undertunic and hose, men wore an outer tunic that reached to the knees or ankles, and that was fastened at the waist with a belt.  Fitted bliauts, of wool or, increasingly, silk, had sleeves that were cut wide at the wrist and gored skirts.  Men wore bliauts open to the waist front and back or at the side seams.<ref name=\"Boucher\" /><ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\nNewly fashionable were short, fitted garments for the upper body, worn under the tunic: the [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]], made of two layers of linen, and an early form of quilted and padded ''jupe'' or ''gipon''.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nThe sleeveless [[surcoat]] or ''cyclas'' was introduced during this period as protective covering for armour (especially against the sun) during the [[Crusades]].<ref>\"Dress and Adornment\", 489.</ref> By the [[1200\u20131300 in fashion|next century]], it would become widely adopted as civilian dress.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\nRectangular and circular cloaks were worn over the tunic.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />  These fastened on the right shoulder or at the center front.\n\n===Headgear===\nMen of the upper classes often went hatless.  The [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] in the form of hood and attached shoulder-length cape was worn during this period, especially by the rural lower classes, and the fitted linen [[coif]] tied under the chin appeared very late in the century. Small round or slightly conical caps with rolled brims were worn, and straw hats were worn for outdoor work in summer.<ref name=\"multiref1\" /><ref name=\"Payne\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Hortus Deliciarum - Antichrist.jpg|1 \u2013 Tunics\nImage:Richard coeurdelion g.jpg|2 \u2013 Richard I of England\nImage:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 feasting.jpg|3 \u2013 Feasting\nImage:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|4 \u2013 Geoffrey of Anjou\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Hortus Deliciarum - Antichrist.jpg|Illustration]] of the [[Anti-christ]] shows long and short tunics and hose or leggings.

Tailored cloth [[leggings]] called ''chausses'' or [[Hose (clothing)|hose]], made as separate garments for each leg, were often worn with the tunic; striped hose were popular.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nDuring this period, beginning with the middle and upper classes, hose became longer and more fitting, and they reached above the knees. Previously, they were looser and worn with drawers that ranged from knee- to ankle-length. The new type of hose were worn with drawers that reached the knees or above, and they were wide enough at the top to allow the drawers to be tucked into them. They were held up in place by being attached to the girdle of the drawers.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Bradfield, 19.</ref>\n\nThe better fit and girdle attachment of these new hose eliminated the need for the leg bands often worn with earlier hose. In England, however, leg bands continued to be worn by some people, both rich and poor, right up to the reign of [[Richard I]].<ref>Bradfield, 23.</ref> After 1200, they were largely abandoned.<ref>Bradfield, 27.</ref>\n\n===Outer tunics and doublets===\nOver the undertunic and hose, men wore an outer tunic that reached to the knees or ankles, and that was fastened at the waist with a belt.  Fitted bliauts, of wool or, increasingly, silk, had sleeves that were cut wide at the wrist and gored skirts.  Men wore bliauts open to the waist front and back or at the side seams.<ref name=\"Boucher\" /><ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\nNewly fashionable were short, fitted garments for the upper body, worn under the tunic: the [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]], made of two layers of linen, and an early form of quilted and padded ''jupe'' or ''gipon''.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\nThe sleeveless [[surcoat]] or ''cyclas'' was introduced during this period as protective covering for armour (especially against the sun) during the [[Crusades]].<ref>\"Dress and Adornment\", 489.</ref> By the [[1200\u20131300 in fashion|next century]], it would become widely adopted as civilian dress.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\nRectangular and circular cloaks were worn over the tunic.<ref name=\"Boucher\" />  These fastened on the right shoulder or at the center front.\n\n===Headgear===\nMen of the upper classes often went hatless.  The [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] in the form of hood and attached shoulder-length cape was worn during this period, especially by the rural lower classes, and the fitted linen [[coif]] tied under the chin appeared very late in the century. Small round or slightly conical caps with rolled brims were worn, and straw hats were worn for outdoor work in summer.<ref name=\"multiref1\" /><ref name=\"Payne\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Hortus Deliciarum - Antichrist.jpg|1 \u2013 Tunics\nImage:Richard coeurdelion g.jpg|2 \u2013 Richard I of England\nImage:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 feasting.jpg|3 \u2013 Feasting\nImage:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|4 \u2013 Geoffrey of Anjou\n</gallery>\n#[[:Image:Hortus Deliciarum - Antichrist.jpg|Illustration]] of the [[Anti-christ]] shows long and short tunics and hose or leggings.

Women wore [[linen]] headdresses or [[wimple]]s and veils, c. 1250]]\n'''Costume during the thirteenth century''' in Europe was very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the continent.  Male and female clothing were relatively similar, and changed very slowly, if at all.  Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; Dress in the Middle Ages; p. 39; Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}</ref>  The century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear.

Blue was introduced and became very fashionable, being adopted by the [[Kings of France]] as their heraldic colour.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, op cit, p. 60</ref>\n\n==Men's clothing==\nMen wore a [[tunic]], ''cote'' or ''cotte'' with a [[surcoat]] over a linen [[shirt]]. One of these surcoats was the cyclas, which began as a rectangular piece of cloth with a hole in it for the head. Over time the sides were sewn together to make a long, sleeveless tunic. When sleeves and sometimes a hood were added, the cyclas became a ganache (a cap-sleeved surcoat, usually shown with hood of matching color) or a gardcorps (a long, generous-sleeved traveling robe, somewhat resembling a modern academic robe). A [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]] was worn as a formal wrap. Men also wore hose, [[shoes]], and headdress. The clothing of [[royal family|royalty]] was set apart by its rich fabric and luxurious furs. Hair and beard were moderate in length, and men generally wore their hair in a \"[[pageboy]]\" style, curling under at necklength. Shoes were slightly pointed, and embroidered for royalty and higher [[clergy]].<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965</ref>\n\n===Working men's clothing===\nWorking men wore a short coat, or [[tunic]], with a belt. It was slit up the center of the front so that they could tuck the corners into their belt to create more freedom of movement. They wore long [[braies]] or leggings with legs of varying length, often visible as they worked with their cotte tucked into their belt.  Hose could be worn over this, attached to the drawstring or belt at the waist. Hats included a round cap with a slight brim, the [[beret]] (just like modern French ones, complete with a little tab at the top), the [[coif]] (a little tight white hood with strings that tied under the chin), the straw hat (in widespread use among farmworkers), and the [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], then still a hood that came round the neck and over the shoulders.

Sketch by [[Villard de Honnecourt]], c.1230]]\n\n===Overview===\nDress for women was modest and restrained, and a narrow [[belt (clothing)|belt]] was uniform. Over it was worn the 'cyclas' or sleeveless [[surcoat]] also worn by men. More wealthy women wore more [[embroidery]] and their [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]], held in place by a cord across the chest, might be lined with fur. Women, like men, wore hose and leather shoes.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\n===Headdresses and hairstyles===\nIndividuality in women's costume was expressed through their hair and headdress. One distinctive feature of women's headwear was the [[Barbette (headdress)|barbette]], a chin band to which a hat or various other headdresses might be attached. This hat might be a \"woman's coif\", which more nearly resembled a [[pillbox hat]], severely plain or fluted. The hair was often confined by a net called a [[crespine]] or [[crespinette]], visible only at the back. Later in the century the barbette and coif were reduced to narrow strips of cloth, and the entire hairdress might be covered with the crespine, the hair fashionable bulky over the ears. Coif and barbettes were white, while the crespine might be colored or gold. The [[wimple]] and [[veil]] of the [[1100-1200 in fashion|12th century]] still seen on [[nuns]] today was still worn, mainly by older women and [[widow]]s.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\nWomen also wore long tunics that went down to their ankles. This was worn over a shirt.\n\n===Wealthier Women's Jewelry===\nWealthy women often wore clothes lined with fur. They wore jewelry and jewels such to make them look rich and wealthy. However, rings and brooches were not worn as gemstone cutting was only invented in the 15th century.\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Maciejowski Bible Woman.jpg|1 \u2013 From the [[Morgan Bible]], c. 1250: [[Wife of Manoah|the wife]] of [[Manoah]] wears a [[veil]] and [[wimple]]. Note striped hose.\n</gallery>\n\n==Sumptuary laws==\nThe [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] of 1215 ruled that Jews and Muslims must be distinguishable by their dress, beginning the process that transformed the conical or pointed [[Jewish hat]] from something worn as a voluntary mark of difference to an enforced one. Previously it had been worn but had been regarded by European Jews as \"an element of traditional garb, rather than an imposed discrimination\".<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p. 138, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}. Seals from Norman Roth, op cit. Also Schreckenburg p. 15 & passim.</ref>  A law in [[Breslau]] in 1267 said that since Jews had stopped wearing the pointed hats they used to wear, this would be made compulsory.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia.

Over time these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm.<ref>Piponnier and Mane:139\u2013141</ref>\n\nThese probably reflected both a growing concern for control over the increasing urban populations, and the increasing effectiveness of the Church's control over social issues across the continent.\n\n==Footwear==\nShoes began to develop a pointed toe at this time however, they were much more restrained than they were in the 14th century. The usual shoe for men opened at the front, from the instep to the toe. Commoners also wore stockings with leather sewn to the sole, and wooden clogs. Woollen garters were also worn by commoners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Talbot|title=Dress design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers|year=1920|publisher=PITMAN & SONS|location=LONDON|pages=80\u201382|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34903/34903-h/34903-h.htm#III_TENTH_FIFTEENTH_MALE}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:13th century shoes.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Shoes with an ankle strap and open instep, c. 1250]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|13th-century fashion}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*Black, J.

Sketch by [[Villard de Honnecourt]], c.1230]]\n\n===Overview===\nDress for women was modest and restrained, and a narrow [[belt (clothing)|belt]] was uniform. Over it was worn the 'cyclas' or sleeveless [[surcoat]] also worn by men. More wealthy women wore more [[embroidery]] and their [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]], held in place by a cord across the chest, might be lined with fur. Women, like men, wore hose and leather shoes.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\n\n===Headdresses and hairstyles===\nIndividuality in women's costume was expressed through their hair and headdress. One distinctive feature of women's headwear was the [[Barbette (headdress)|barbette]], a chin band to which a hat or various other headdresses might be attached. This hat might be a \"woman's coif\", which more nearly resembled a [[pillbox hat]], severely plain or fluted. The hair was often confined by a net called a [[crespine]] or [[crespinette]], visible only at the back. Later in the century the barbette and coif were reduced to narrow strips of cloth, and the entire hairdress might be covered with the crespine, the hair fashionable bulky over the ears. Coif and barbettes were white, while the crespine might be colored or gold. The [[wimple]] and [[veil]] of the [[1100-1200 in fashion|12th century]] still seen on [[nuns]] today was still worn, mainly by older women and [[widow]]s.<ref name=\"Payne\" />\nWomen also wore long tunics that went down to their ankles. This was worn over a shirt.\n\n===Wealthier Women's Jewelry===\nWealthy women often wore clothes lined with fur. They wore jewelry and jewels such to make them look rich and wealthy. However, rings and brooches were not worn as gemstone cutting was only invented in the 15th century.\n\n===Style gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Maciejowski Bible Woman.jpg|1 \u2013 From the [[Morgan Bible]], c. 1250: [[Wife of Manoah|the wife]] of [[Manoah]] wears a [[veil]] and [[wimple]]. Note striped hose.\n</gallery>\n\n==Sumptuary laws==\nThe [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] of 1215 ruled that Jews and Muslims must be distinguishable by their dress, beginning the process that transformed the conical or pointed [[Jewish hat]] from something worn as a voluntary mark of difference to an enforced one. Previously it had been worn but had been regarded by European Jews as \"an element of traditional garb, rather than an imposed discrimination\".<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p. 138, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}.

Over time these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm.<ref>Piponnier and Mane:139\u2013141</ref>\n\nThese probably reflected both a growing concern for control over the increasing urban populations, and the increasing effectiveness of the Church's control over social issues across the continent.\n\n==Footwear==\nShoes began to develop a pointed toe at this time however, they were much more restrained than they were in the 14th century. The usual shoe for men opened at the front, from the instep to the toe. Commoners also wore stockings with leather sewn to the sole, and wooden clogs. Woollen garters were also worn by commoners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Talbot|title=Dress design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers|year=1920|publisher=PITMAN & SONS|location=LONDON|pages=80\u201382|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34903/34903-h/34903-h.htm#III_TENTH_FIFTEENTH_MALE}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:13th century shoes.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Shoes with an ankle strap and open instep, c. 1250]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|13th-century fashion}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*Black, J.

The setting for the sermon is given in [[Matthew 5:1]]-[[Matthew 5:2|2]]. Jesus sees the multitudes, goes up into the mountain, is followed by his disciples, and begins to preach. The Sermon is brought to its close by {{bibleverse||Matthew|8:1|NKJV}}, which reports that Jesus \"came down from the mountain followed by great multitudes\".\n\n==Components==\n{{See also|Beatitudes|Salt and Light|Light of the World|Lamp under a bushel|The Mote and the Beam|Wise and Foolish Builders}}\nWhile the issue of the exact theological structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount is subject to debate among scholars, specific components within it, each associated with particular teachings, can be identified.<ref name=Talbert21 /><ref name=WCarter >''What are they saying about Matthew's Sermon on the mount?'', Warren Carter 1994 {{ISBN|0-8091-3473-X}} pp.&nbsp;35\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[File:Meister des Lehrbuchs Kaiser Maximilians I. 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Lord's Prayer]], in [[Matthew 6:9]], 1500, Vienna]]\n{{bibleref2|Matthew|5:3-12|9|Matthew 5:3\u201312}} discusses the [[Beatitudes]].

The text has the largest number of perennial and universal doctrines, and spiritual advice of all Scripture. Much of what Bible readers remember from Scripture derives from the Sermon. Source of spiritual and moral instructions, the Sermon on the Mount is regarded by the Perennial Philosophy \"as the quintessence itself of religion\".<ref>Mateus Soares de Azevedo, \"Esoterism and exoterism in the Sermon of the Mount\".

The setting for the sermon is given in [[Matthew 5:1]]-[[Matthew 5:2|2]]. Jesus sees the multitudes, goes up into the mountain, is followed by his disciples, and begins to preach.

Ulysses Press. 2004.</ref>\n\n===According to the Perennial Philosophy===\nAccording to [[Perennial philosophy|perennialist]] author [[Frithjof Schuon]], the message of the Sermon is a perfect synthesis of the whole Christian tradition. The text has the largest number of perennial and universal doctrines, and spiritual advice of all Scripture. Much of what Bible readers remember from Scripture derives from the Sermon. Source of spiritual and moral instructions, the Sermon on the Mount is regarded by the Perennial Philosophy \"as the quintessence itself of religion\".<ref>Mateus Soares de Azevedo, \"Esoterism and exoterism in the Sermon of the Mount\".

Emily was the third-eldest of the four surviving [[Bront\u00eb family|Bront\u00eb siblings]], between the youngest Anne and her brother [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]]. She published under the [[pen name]] '''Ellis Bell'''.\n\n==Early life and loss==\n[[File:Painting of Bront\u00eb sisters.png|thumb|upright|The three Bront\u00eb sisters, in an 1834 painting by their brother [[Branwell Bront\u00eb]]. From left to right: Anne, Emily and Charlotte. (Branwell used to be between Emily and Charlotte, but subsequently painted himself out.)]]\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb was born on 30 July 1818 to [[Maria Branwell]] and an Irish father, [[Patrick Bront\u00eb]].  The family was living on Market Street in the village of [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]] on the outskirts of [[Bradford]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Northern England]].  Emily's older siblings included, eldest to youngest, Maria, Elizabeth, [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] and [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]], making Emily the Bront\u00ebs' fifth child.  In 1820, Emily's younger sister [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]], the last Bront\u00eb child, was born. Shortly thereafter, the family moved eight miles away to [[Haworth]], where Patrick was employed as [[perpetual curate]],<ref name=\"Fraser 16\" />  In Haworth, the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents.<ref name=\"Fraser 16\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 16</ref>\n\nWhen Emily was only three, and all six children under the age of eight, she and her siblings lost their mother, Maria, to cancer on 15 September 1821.<ref name=\"Fraser 28\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 28</ref> The younger children were to be cared for by [[Elizabeth Branwell]], their aunt and mother Maria's sister. \n\nEmily's three elder sisters, [[Maria Bront\u00eb|Maria]], Elizabeth, and Charlotte, were sent to the [[Cowan Bridge School|Clergy Daughters' School]] at Cowan Bridge. At the age of six, on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period.<ref name=\"Fraser 35\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 35</ref>  At school, however, the children suffered abuse and privations, and when a [[typhoid]] epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth became ill. Maria, who may actually have had [[tuberculosis]], was sent home, where she died. Emily, Charlotte and Elizabeth were subsequently removed from the school in June 1825. Elizabeth died soon after their return home. \n\nThe four youngest Bront\u00eb children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest females in their immediate family.<ref name=\" Fraser 31\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 31</ref>\n\nCharlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=261}} Charlotte would use her experiences and knowledge of the school as the basis for Lowood School in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.\n\nThe three remaining sisters and their brother [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]] were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt [[Elizabeth Branwell]]. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover, especially for befriending stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside.<ref>Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 20.</ref> Despite the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''.<ref name=\"Fraser 44-45\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\n[[File:Gondal Poems.jpg|thumb|179 px|Emily's [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]] poems]]\n\nInspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift, <ref>Richard E.

With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne's lists of Gondal's characters and place-names, Emily and Anne's Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some \"diary papers,\" written by Emily in her twenties, which describe current events in Gondal.<ref>[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/diary_papers#diary \"Emily Bront\u00eb's Letters and Diary Papers\"], City University of New York</ref> The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image of the Scottish Highlander, a sort of British version of the \"noble savage\": romantic outlaws capable of more nobility, passion, and bravery than the denizens of \"civilization\".{{sfn|Austin|p=578}} Similar themes of romanticism and noble savagery are apparent across the Bront\u00eb's juvenilia, notably in Branwell's ''The Life of Alexander Percy'', which tells the story of an all-consuming, death-defying, and ultimately self-destructive love and is generally considered an inspiration for ''Wuthering Heights''.<ref name=\"Paddock p. 199\">Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 199.</ref>\n\nAt seventeen, Emily began to attend the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte was a teacher, but suffered from extreme [[homesickness]] and left after only a few months. Charlotte wrote later that \"Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it, she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring...

Unlike Charlotte, Emily was uncomfortable in Brussels, and refused to adopt Belgian fashions, saying \"I wish to be as God made me\", which rendered her  something of an outcast.<ref>Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 21.</ref> Nine of Emily's French essays survive from this period. H\u00e9ger seems to have been impressed with the strength of Emily's character, writing that:\n<blockquote><div>\nShe should have been a man \u2013 a great navigator. Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.<ref>[[Constantin H\u00e9ger]], 1842, referring to Emily Bront\u00eb, as quoted in ''The Oxford History of the Novel in English'' (2011), Volume 3, p. 208</ref>\n</div></blockquote>\nThe two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had become so competent in French that Madame H\u00e9ger proposed that they both stay another half-year, even, according to Charlotte, offering to dismiss the English master so that she could take his place. Emily had, by this time, become a competent pianist and teacher and it was suggested that she might stay on to teach music.<ref>{{cite book|author=Norma Crandall|title=Emily Bront\u00eb, a Psychological Portrait|publisher=R.

One was labelled \"Gondal Poems\"; the other was unlabelled. Scholars such as Fannie Ratchford and Derek Roper have attempted to piece together a Gondal storyline and chronology from these poems.<ref>Fannie Ratchford, ed., ''Gondal's Queen''.

Emily, furious at the invasion of her privacy, at first refused but relented when Anne brought out her own manuscripts and revealed to Charlotte that she had been writing poems in secret as well. As co-authors of Gondal stories, Anne and Emily were accustomed to read their Gondal stories and poems to each other, while Charlotte was excluded from their privacy.<ref name= \"fr2\">{{cite book |title= The Brontes of Haworth |first= David W |last= Harrison | publisher= Trafford Publishing | page = 47 |year = 2003 |isbn=978-1-55369-809-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5F_n_qxvHSYC}}</ref> Around this time she had written one of her most famous poems \"No coward soul is mine\", probably as an answer to the violation of her privacy and her own transformation into a published writer.<ref>{{cite book|author=Meredith L.

The Bront\u00eb sisters had adopted pseudonyms for publication, preserving their initials: Charlotte was \"Currer Bell\", Emily was \"Ellis Bell\" and Anne was \"Acton Bell\".<ref>''Encyclopedia of British writers, 19th century'' (2009), p. 41</ref> Charlotte wrote in the 'Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell' that their \"ambiguous choice\" was \"dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because... we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice\".<ref name=\"Gaskell 335\">Gaskell, ''The life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb'' (1857), p. 335</ref> Charlotte contributed 19 poems, and Emily and Anne each contributed 21. Although the sisters were told several months after publication that only two copies had sold,<ref>Winifred G\u00e9rin, ''Charlotte Bront\u00eb: the evolution of genius'' (1969), p. 322</ref> they were not discouraged (of their two readers, one was impressed enough to request their autographs).<ref>Margot Peters, ''Unquiet Soul: A Biography of Charlotte Bront\u00eb'' (1976), p. 219</ref> ''The Athenaeum'' reviewer praised Ellis Bell's work for its music and power, singling out his poems as the best: \"Ellis possesses a fine, quaint spirit and an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted\",<ref>''In the footsteps of the Bront\u00ebs'' (1895), p. 306</ref> and ''The Critic'' reviewer recognised \"the presence of more genius than it was supposed this utilitarian age had devoted to the loftier exercises of the intellect.\"<ref>''The poems of Emily Jane Bront\u00eb and Anne Bront\u00eb'' (1932), p. 102</ref>\n\n==Personality and character==\n[[Image:Emily Bront\u00eb cropped.jpg|thumb|Portrait painted by [[Branwell Bront\u00eb]] in 1833; sources are in disagreement over whether this image is of Emily or Anne.<ref name=\"Portrait\" />]]\nEmily Bront\u00eb remains a mysterious figure and a challenge to biographers because information about her is sparse<ref>Lorna Sage ''The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English'' (1999), p. 90</ref> due to her solitary and reclusive nature.<ref>U. C. Knoepflmacher, ''Emily Bront\u00eb: Wuthering Heights'' (1989), p. 112</ref> Except for [[Ellen Nussey]] and Louise de Bassompierre, Emily's fellow student in Brussels, she does not seem to have made any friends outside her family. Her closest friend was her sister Anne. Together they shared their own fantasy world, Gondal, and, according to Ellen Nussey, in childhood they were \"like twins\", \"inseparable companions\" and \"in the very closest sympathy which never had any interruption\".<ref name=\"Fraser 39\">Fraser, ''A Life of Anne Bront\u00eb'', p. 39</ref><ref name=\"Barker 195\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 195</ref> In 1845 Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she had come to know and love in the five years she spent as governess. A plan to visit [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] fell through and instead the sisters went to [[York]] where Anne showed Emily [[York Minster]]. During the trip the sisters acted out some of their Gondal characters.<ref name=\"Barker 451\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 451</ref>\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb remains the primary source of information about Emily, although as an elder sister, writing publicly about her only shortly after her death, she is considered by certain scholars not to be a neutral witness. [[Stevie Davies]] believes that there is what might be called Charlotte's smoke-screen and argues that Emily evidently shocked her, to the point where she may even have doubted her sister's sanity.

In 1820, Emily's younger sister [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]], the last Bront\u00eb child, was born.

Elizabeth died soon after their return home. \n\nThe four youngest Bront\u00eb children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest females in their immediate family.<ref name=\" Fraser 31\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 31</ref>\n\nCharlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825.

Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life.

It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled ports ===\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\n=== Expansion pack ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a.

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nuke.com/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|title=Sales of Worms skyrockets|work=[[Computer Game Review]]|publisher=[[Ziff-Davis]]|date=1996|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|archive-date=1996-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=\"RG23\">{{cite magazine|last=Day|first=Ashley|title=The Making of... Worms|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=March 2006|pages=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{under construction|placedby=KGRAMR|nosection=yes}}\n{{in use}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled ports ===\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\n=== Expansion pack ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a.

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRelease", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)"}

A caravan stopping point during the [[Himyarite Kingdom]], the Haraz was later the stronghold of the [[Sulayhid dynasty]], which was established in Yemen in 1037. Then and subsequently the population have been [[Ism'aili]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] [[Muslim]]s.\n\nHaraz is as famous for its fortified villages which cling to nearly inaccessible rocky peaks. Their imposing architecture meets two needs: defending the villagers, while leaving plenty of space for crops. Each town is built like a castle; the houses, themselves, form the wall, equipped with one or two easily defensible doors. Constructed from sandstone and basalt, the buildings are integrated into the landscape and it is difficult to tell where the rock and the village begins or ends. The mountain is divided into terraces of a few acres or more, separated by walls sometimes several meters high. On these terraced fields grow alfalfa for livestock, millet, lentils, large areas for coffee and [[Khat|qat]].\n\nWithin a day's journey are [[Bani Murrah]] and other villages located on the ridge overlooking [[Manakhah]]. Manakhah is the heart of mountain range, a large town whose market attracts villagers from the entire neighbourhood. [[Al Hajjara]], to the west of Manakhah, is a walled village whose citadel was founded in the 12th century by the Sulayhids. From there, other villages are accessible, such as [[Bayt al-Qamus]]  and [[Bayt Shimran]].

A caravan stopping point during the [[Himyarite Kingdom]], the Haraz was later the stronghold of the [[Sulayhid dynasty]], which was established in Yemen in 1037. Then and subsequently the population have been [[Ism'aili]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] [[Muslim]]s.\n\nHaraz is as famous for its fortified villages which cling to nearly inaccessible rocky peaks. Their imposing architecture meets two needs: defending the villagers, while leaving plenty of space for crops. Each town is built like a castle; the houses, themselves, form the wall, equipped with one or two easily defensible doors. Constructed from sandstone and basalt, the buildings are integrated into the landscape and it is difficult to tell where the rock and the village begins or ends. The mountain is divided into terraces of a few acres or more, separated by walls sometimes several meters high. On these terraced fields grow alfalfa for livestock, millet, lentils, large areas for coffee and [[Khat|qat]].\n\nWithin a day's journey are [[Bani Murrah]] and other villages located on the ridge overlooking [[Manakhah]]. Manakhah is the heart of mountain range, a large town whose market attracts villagers from the entire neighbourhood. [[Al Hajjara]], to the west of Manakhah, is a walled village whose citadel was founded in the 12th century by the Sulayhids. From there, other villages are accessible, such as [[Bayt al-Qamus]]  and [[Bayt Shimran]]. The village of [[Hutaib]] is built on a platform of red sandstone, facing a view of terraced hills which host a score of villages. Here also is the mausoleum of the third Yemeni ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]'' [[Hatim ibn Ibrahim]]. [[Mustaali|Bohras]] from [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]] and other countries gather here.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== World Heritage Status ==\nThis area was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on July 8, 2002, in the mixed (cultural and natural) category, as a site that has \"outstanding universal value\".<ref name=unesco/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Haraz 200612 Yemen-115 (353667843).jpg|A terraced mountain side in [[Al Mahwit Governorate]] near [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]] (the highest mountain in the Arabian Peninsula)\nFile:\u0645\u0646\u062a\u0632\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062f\u0633\u064a\u0629 - panoramio.jpg|Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb is behind the mountain in the background, facing west of southern [[Sanaa]]\nFile:Haraz Mountains, Yemen (12633745063).jpg|Jabal Haraz terraces\nFile:Manakha 01.jpg|[[Manakhah]]\nFile:Haraz Mtns, Yemen (13970993973).jpg|Buildings at the base of a mountain\nFile:Haraz Mountains, Yemen (14616928081).jpg|Fortified settlement amid the mountains\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ad Dahrah]], located in the Haraz, the stronghold of the Sulaihid dynasty, many of whose buildings still survive to this day\n* [[Geology of Yemen]]\n* [[Hajhir Mountains]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120922020555/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/yemen/the-harazmountains Lonely Planet]\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Jabal Haraz}}\n* [https://www.architecturerevived.com/architectural-beauty-out-of-poverty-jabal-haraz-yemen/ Architecture Revived: Architectural Beauty out of Poverty, Jabal Haraz Yemen]\n* [http://medomed.org/featured_item/jabal-bura-and-jabal-haraz-the-mountanous-cultural-landscape-of-yemen-yemen/ Med-O-Med: Cultural landscapes: Jabal Bura and Jabal Haraz, Yemen]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcgXBQlPUJs Jabal Haraz] ([[YouTube]])\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqJSqAjtbCA Yemen - Haraz Mountains]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbooIXhPq-E Yemen 2008 Jebel Haraz]\n\n{{Tourist attractions in Yemen}}\n{{Mountains in the Arabian Peninsula}}\n\n[[Category:Jabal Haraz|*]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of mainland Yemen]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Tentative List]]\n", "name_user": "Leo1pard", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGallery", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabal_Haraz"}
