The island nation of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35808|km2|sp=us}}, with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. [[Taipei]] is the capital and largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]. With 23.7&nbsp;million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated country, and is the most populous country and largest [[gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\n[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] settled the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had [[Xinhai Revolution|overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911]], [[Retrocession Day|took control of Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[World War II Allies]]. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|flight of the ROC government to Taiwan]] in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and numerous smaller islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a [[semi-presidential system]].\n\nTaiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)|21st-largest]] in the world, with major contributions from steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing.

The main island, known historically as ''Formosa'', makes up 99% of the [[Free area of the Republic of China|area controlled by the ROC]], measuring {{convert|35808|km2|sqmi|0}} and lying some {{convert|180|km|mi|0}} across the [[Taiwan Strait]] from the southeastern coast of [[mainland China]]. The [[East China Sea]] lies to its north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to its east, the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to its south and the [[South China Sea]] to its southwest. [[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many active [[submarine volcano]]es in the Taiwan Straits.\n\nThe eastern mountains are heavily forested and home to a diverse range of wildlife, while land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map TWN present.svg|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Taiwan.]]\n\nTaiwan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its general [[climate]] is marine [[tropical climate|tropical]].<ref name=\"cia-factbook\">{{cite web |title=Taiwan |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html |work=The World Factbook |publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.{{sfnp|Exec.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.<ref>Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84\u201386</ref>\n\nThe major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s. These have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]\" killed more than 2,400 people.

Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Republic of China Armed Forces}}\n{{See also|Republic of China Military Academy}}\n\n[[File:Thunderbolt 2000 MLRS Side View 20111105a.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army]] [[Thunderbolt-2000]]]]\nThe [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.<ref name=2004NatDefRpt />\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to \"retake mainland China\" through [[Project National Glory]].

These efforts significantly slowed inflation.\n\nWhen the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of [[tael]]s (where 1&nbsp;tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2&nbsp;[[troy ounce|ozt]]) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081949/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 September 2011|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}} Translated from {{cite news |author=\u738b\u9298\u7fa9 |date=5 April 2011 |script-title=zh:1949\u5e74\u904b\u53f0\u9ec3\u91d1 \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u4fdd\u547d\u672c |newspaper=China Times |url=http://forums.chinatimes.com/report/goldfile/series-cnt0405ct02.htm |accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from mainland China.<ref>{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | url =https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn | url-access =registration | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =[https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn/page/76 76], 77 | isbn =978-0-8014-8805-4 }}</ref> The KMT government instituted many laws and [[land reform]]s that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.

The island nation of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35808|km2|sp=us}}, with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. [[Taipei]] is the capital and largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]. With 23.7&nbsp;million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated country, and is the most populous country and largest [[gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\n[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] settled the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had [[Xinhai Revolution|overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911]], [[Retrocession Day|took control of Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[World War II Allies]]. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|flight of the ROC government to Taiwan]] in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and numerous smaller islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a [[semi-presidential system]].\n\nTaiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)|21st-largest]] in the world, with major contributions from steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing.

The main island, known historically as ''Formosa'', makes up 99% of the [[Free area of the Republic of China|area controlled by the ROC]], measuring {{convert|35808|km2|sqmi|0}} and lying some {{convert|180|km|mi|0}} across the [[Taiwan Strait]] from the southeastern coast of [[mainland China]]. The [[East China Sea]] lies to its north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to its east, the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to its south and the [[South China Sea]] to its southwest. [[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many active [[submarine volcano]]es in the Taiwan Straits.\n\nThe eastern mountains are heavily forested and home to a diverse range of wildlife, while land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map TWN present.svg|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Taiwan.]]\n\nTaiwan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its general [[climate]] is marine [[tropical climate|tropical]].<ref name=\"cia-factbook\">{{cite web |title=Taiwan |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html |work=The World Factbook |publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.{{sfnp|Exec.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.<ref>Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84\u201386</ref>\n\nThe major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s. These have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]\" killed more than 2,400 people.

Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Republic of China Armed Forces}}\n{{See also|Republic of China Military Academy}}\n\n[[File:Thunderbolt 2000 MLRS Side View 20111105a.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army]] [[Thunderbolt-2000]]]]\nThe [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.<ref name=2004NatDefRpt />\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to \"retake mainland China\" through [[Project National Glory]].

These efforts significantly slowed inflation.\n\nWhen the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of [[tael]]s (where 1&nbsp;tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2&nbsp;[[troy ounce|ozt]]) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081949/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 September 2011|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}} Translated from {{cite news |author=\u738b\u9298\u7fa9 |date=5 April 2011 |script-title=zh:1949\u5e74\u904b\u53f0\u9ec3\u91d1 \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u4fdd\u547d\u672c |newspaper=China Times |url=http://forums.chinatimes.com/report/goldfile/series-cnt0405ct02.htm |accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from mainland China.<ref>{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | url =https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn | url-access =registration | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =[https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn/page/76 76], 77 | isbn =978-0-8014-8805-4 }}</ref> The KMT government instituted many laws and [[land reform]]s that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.

A detailed report was made and presented to the King by Consort Prince in this regard. It may be mentioned that the King was the brother of Colonel Raja's wife, and the colonel's own children were the heirs to the throne.\n\nIn 1935, on royal patronage of H.H [[Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma|Maharaja Chithira Thirunal]], [[Tata Airlines]] made its maiden flight to the airport using DH.83 Fox Moth aircraft under command of India's first pilot [[Nevill Vintcent]] carrying Jamshed Navoroji, a Tata company official, and Kanchi Dwarakadas, commercial agent of Travancore in Karachi, with a special mail from the Viceroy of British India, Lord Willingdon, wishing birthday greetings to the Maharaja.<ref>{{cite news|author=|first=|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/article856960.ece|title=Kerala celebrates 75th anniversary of civil aviation|date=29 October 2010|work=The Hindu|accessdate=1 March 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130065952/https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/article856960.ece|archive-date=30 November 2010|publisher=|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nThe first flight took off on 1 November 1935, carrying mails of Royal Anchal (Travancore Post) to Bombay. In 1938, the Royal Government of Travancore acquired a Dakota as Maharaja's private aircraft and placed the first squadron of Royal Indian Air Force (Travancore) for protection of the state from aerial attacks. After Independence, the airstrip was used for domestic flights with the construction of a new domestic terminal, Terminal 1.\n\nInternational operations were initiated by [[Air India]] to cities in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in the late 1970s using Boeing 707. By early 80s, the then Indian Airlines started service to Colombo, followed by service to Male. Later, [[SriLankan Airlines]] (then Air Lanka) and Air Maldives (now [[Maldivian (airline)|Maldivian]] started operations. Followed by Indian Airlines, that started a service to Sharjah.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.  The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|62\u201364}}\n\nThe orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission.

The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, which was reduced to {{convert|3010|psi|kPa|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} on the Block II RS-25 engine, which had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001.

At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=etuse>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf NASA-CR-195281, \"Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system\"].

Missions after [[STS-38]] used the RS-25 engines to achieve the optimal apogee, and used the OMS engines to circularize the orbit. The orbital altitude and inclination were mission dependent, and the Space Shuttle's orbits varied from {{convert|120|nmi|km|sigfig=2|sp=us|adj=off|abbr=on}} to {{convert|335|nmi|km|sigfig=2|sp=us|adj=off|abbr=on}}.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u201310}}\n\n===In orbit===\n[[File:Endeavour docked to ISS.jpg|thumb|right|''Endeavour'' docked at ISS]]\n\nThe type of mission that the Space Shuttle was assigned to dictated the type of orbit that it entered.  The initial design of the reusable Space Shuttle envisioned an increasingly cheap launch platform to deploy commercial and government satellites. Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]]. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], Spacelab, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].  Beginning with [[STS-74]], the orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with the [[Mir space station]].  In its final decade of operation, the Space Shuttle was used for the construction of the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u2013108, 123, 224, 264}} Most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks, although longer missions were possible with the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet.

The orbiter vehicle reoriented itself to a nose-forward position with a 40\u00b0 angle-of-attack, and the forward RCS jets were emptied of fuel and disabled prior to reentry. The orbiter vehicle's reentry was defined as starting at an altitude {{convert|400000|ft|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, when it was traveling approximately Mach 25.  The orbiter vehicle's reentry was controlled by the GPCs, which followed a preset angle-of-attack plan to prevent unsafe heating of the TPS.

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the&nbsp;ocean.<ref name=ssbsterg>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a-9VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DuEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5161%2C3581553 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle booster stage to be solid-fuel, reusable vehicle |date=March 15, 1972 |page=3A}}</ref> In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle,<ref name=odsp>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tNhVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3326%2C897997|work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=President okays spacecraft plan|date=January 5, 1972 |page=1A}}</ref><ref name=bsspgpa>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2u9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xe0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4846%2C1764562 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Big Space Shuttle proposal gets presidential approval |date=January 6, 1972 |page=1}}</ref> and NASA decided on its final design in&nbsp;March.<ref name=ssbsterg/> That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test,<ref name=sfgapovr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=361VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6429%2C2842712 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Shuttle's first glide a 'pushover' |date=August 12, 1977 |page=1A}}</ref> where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|kPa|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, which was reduced to {{convert|3010|psi|kPa|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} on the Block II RS-25 engine, which had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001.

At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry.

Because of her great wealth, Duke's marriage to Rubirosa attracted the attention of the [[U.S. State Department]], which cautioned her against using her money to promote a political agenda. Further, there was concern that in the event of her death, a foreign government could gain too much leverage. Therefore, Rubirosa had to sign a [[pre-nuptial agreement]]; during the marriage, though, she gave Rubirosa several million dollars in gifts, including a stable of polo ponies, sports cars, a converted [[B-25]] bomber, and, in the divorce settlement, a 17th-century house in Paris.

She was hospitalized from February 2 to April 15. She underwent a second knee surgery in July of that year.\n\nA day after returning home from this second surgery, she suffered a severe stroke. Doris Duke [[Harry Demopoulos#Duke Estate|died]] at her Falcon's Lair home on October 28, 1993, at the age of 80.

In addition, Duke had a collection of artwork, which was said to include works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, as well as her valuable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asia art and furniture. Also in Duke's collection were over 2,000 bottles of rare wine (worth over $5 million) and the extraordinary Duke collection of fine jewels. Her total net worth, including all property, was valued at $5.3 billion.\n\n===Philanthropy===\nDuke's first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her.<ref>{{cite web| title=Doris Duke Biographical History and Archival Collections (Duke University Libraries)| url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/collections/people/dorisduke/#item-14| website=Library.duk.edu| accessdate=October 24, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906141800/http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/collections/people/dorisduke/#item-14| archive-date=September 6, 2013| url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1958, she established the [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]] Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms.

specifically categorize the brick kiln industry as a form of debt bondage since workers in this institution receive money in advance which they must later pay off.<ref name=\":13\" /> According to a 2003 study, although most Indian laborers in the brick kiln industry did not enter debt bondage, the number of workers entering debt bondage was increasing due to a lack of trust between brokers, or

work and receiving a loan in the first place.<ref name=\":13\" /> According to a 2007 study in [[Chennai]] and [[Madurai]] in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu about the brick kiln industry, many Indians hold different views on the relationship between brokers and workers.<ref name=\":3\" /> Whereas some argue that this relationship is built upon mutualism, others cite the harms of this connection since workers in this industry are seasonal, receive conditional advances, and receive low wages, often only covering the costs of food.<ref name=\":3\" /> As of 2019, there are over 23 million

from lenders at a high interest rate.<ref name=\":8\" /> Due to a lack of education, these individuals often don't learn about human rights or have a proper platform for activism.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, there is a correlation between economic opportunity and one's caste.<ref name=\":17\" /> Although the government has attempted to create quota based initiatives to increase the opportunity of

Government Regulations ===\n[[File:Indira Gandhi in 1967.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Indira Gandhi in 1967, 9 years before passing the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act]]\nThe passage of the Bonded Labor System Act of 1976 by Indira Gandhi and the Indian government set a precedent for future government initiatives to tackle labor issues.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1978, the Indian government instituted a national plan to disperse over 20,000 rupees (about 300 US dollars) to freed debt laborers.<ref name=\":4\" /> On a similar note, the [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005|National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]] recently guaranteed employment to one adult in a rural house that has a considerable financial burden.<ref name=\":14\" /> State governments take on this issue in a variety of ways.<ref name=\":14\" /> For example, many Indian states target landless workers in local debt relief efforts.<ref name=\":14\" /> \n\nAdditionally, to tackle the issue of child labor, the government passed the Child Labor Act and National Policy on Child Labor in 1986 and 1987 respectively.<ref name=\":6\" /> These initiatives created projects such as the National Child Labor Project which created rehabilitation programs for children and provided education and food to former child laborers.<ref name=\":6\" /> They also regulated the hours and conditions of child laborers and utilized a team of inspectors to prohibit these individuals from working in dangerous industries.<ref name=\":8\" /> Later on, in 1994, the Elimination of Child Labor Act incorporated more vocational training into schools to help students find opportunities for social mobility post-graduation.<ref name=\":8\" /> Researchers suggest that countries with a high incidence of child debt bondage like India must first address the low wages of farmers and the lack of alternatives to entering debt bondage for individuals in poverty.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Organizations ===\nIn 1993, the [[Human Rights Act 1993|Human Rights Act]] created the [[National Human Rights Commission]] which investigates issues of human rights violations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another organization that works on similar initiatives is the Center for Education and Communication which collaborates with NGOs and is responsible for educating the world about this issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the Academy of Development Science created a grain bank to tackle the issue of food scarcity and help Indians stay out of debt.<ref name=\":0\" /> Finally, the Indian National Commission on Labor has met numerous times to create more protection for Indian workers, especially those who cannot organize.<ref name=\":16\" /> \n\nOn an international level, in 1948, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] outlawed the practice of debt bondage.<ref name=\":14\" /> Similarly, in 1956, the United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery officially prohibited this institution.<ref name=\":12\" /> Additionally, more recently, the Dalit Freedom Network, a British NGO, has brought many children out of debt bondage and has worked to end Dalit slavery.<ref name=\":4\" />

implemented [[Microfinance|micro-finance]] initiatives to help Indians in debt.<ref name=\":1\" /> This organization has been careful to use micro-finance, or the distribution of small loans at low interest costs, to help Indians who have a high risk of entering debt bondage or falling back into this form of forced labor.<ref name=\":10\" /> The intervention of the ILO in India has led to the creation of the Integrated Rural Development Society and Madras Social Service Society which focus on preventative measures to the issue of debt bondage.<ref name=\":10\" /> This has forced state governments to commit more time and attention towards tackling bonded labor issues.<ref name=\":10\" /> Additionally, this has led to more initiatives which involve teaching employers about alternatives to debt bondage, increasing educational opportunities for students, and providing aid for the costs of health care.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|India}}\n* [[Bonded

[[France]] and [[England]], and many Indians were sent to [[Australia]] to reduce the costs and effects of slavery.<ref name=\":2\" /> France, who had an economic and political presence in India, created a system of indentured servitude in the [[Indian Ocean]] which about 3,000 Indians were a part of in the 1830s.<ref name=\":2\" /> By 1847, there were over 6500 indentured servants in the Indian Ocean, including those in India.<ref name=\":2\" /> These French settlers traditionally held onto wages which initiated a system of debt bondage.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the second half of the nineteenth century, many Indians successfully formed unions and utilized trials to free these workers.<ref name=\":2\" /> Nevertheless, India felt the impacts of these historical systems of labor in the twentieth century.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nIn 1935, the British, who ruled India at that time, passed the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act]] whose purpose was to develop the Indian economy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nevertheless, this further stratified the social hierarchy in India, contributing to the debt bondage system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Before India gained [[Indian

find themselves paying interest on the loans that exceeds 100% of the loan per year.<ref name=\"A $110 loan, then 20 years of debt bondage\" /> Additionally, many lenders only let the value of labor

specifically categorize the brick kiln industry as a form of debt bondage since workers in this institution receive money in advance which they must later pay off.<ref name=\":13\" /> According to a 2003 study, although most Indian laborers in the brick kiln industry did not enter debt bondage, the number of workers entering debt bondage was increasing due to a lack of trust between brokers, or lenders, and borrowers.<ref name=\":3\" /> Although employers in charge of this industry do not employ children, workers inevitably turn to their children to improve their chances of completing their work and receiving a loan in the first place.<ref name=\":13\" /> According to a 2007 study in [[Chennai]] and [[Madurai]] in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu about the brick kiln industry, many Indians hold different views on the relationship between brokers and workers.<ref name=\":3\" /> Whereas some argue that this relationship is built upon mutualism, others cite the harms of this connection since workers in this industry are seasonal, receive conditional advances, and receive low wages, often only covering the costs of food.<ref name=\":3\" /> As of 2019, there are over 23 million

health care, and housing which forces them to take out loans and enter forced labor.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, they often do not qualify for loans from banks which forces them to borrow money from lenders at a high interest rate.<ref name=\":8\" /> Due to a lack of education, these individuals often don't learn about human rights or have a proper platform for activism.<ref name=\":0\" />

Gandhi]] criticized this system and its employers and attempted to declare the Bonded Labour Liberation Day in 1939.<ref name=\":16\" /> However, these employers did not accept this initiatives since it involved increasing wages for workers and ending debt bondage for long term workers.<ref name=\":16\" /> Researchers such as Jan Breman claim that the motivations of employers under this system is not primarily economic but is rather marked by a drive to develop political power and dominance over others.<ref name=\":16\" /> For example, the debt bondage system was used as a way to force tribes in nineteenth century [[Gujarat|Gujurat]] into lower castes.<ref name=\":16\" /> \n\nOn a more current note, many Indian workers are a part of a new form of bonded labor.<ref name=\":16\" /> This system is characterized by an environment that fails to allow laborers to organize or find other jobs and work which requires long hours.<ref name=\":16\" /> Thus, workers in this system are trapped by their occupation and hand these economics burdens down across generations, leading to cases of child labor.<ref name=\":16\" /> Child labor specifically stunts the intellectual growth of students in primary education.<ref name=\":6\" /> This system also leads to lower school attendance and fewer opportunities for social mobility.<ref name=\":6\" /> Nevertheless, many employers cite this form of labor as a way for families to receive a steady form of income.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Health Effects ===\nMany laborers in the debt bondage system are vulnerable to hazardous health conditions such as infection from dangerous working conditions.<ref name=\":4\" />  According to a study about the brick kiln industry in India, many workers under the debt bondage system suffer from enduring high levels of heat during the summer.<ref name=\":13\" /> Children specifically are susceptible to skin and breathing diseases.<ref name=\":6\" /> Child laborers in the debt bondage system often receive cuts and burns or contract liver disease due to their participation in the silver, [[beedi]], and silk industries.<ref name=\":8\" /> Additionally, laborers in the agriculture industry are

Government Regulations ===\n[[File:Indira Gandhi in 1967.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Indira Gandhi in 1967, 9 years before passing the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act]]\nThe passage of the Bonded Labor System Act of 1976 by Indira Gandhi and the Indian government set a precedent for future government initiatives to tackle labor issues.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1978, the Indian government instituted a national plan to disperse over 20,000 rupees (about 300 US dollars) to freed debt laborers.<ref name=\":4\" /> On a similar note, the [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005|National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]] recently guaranteed employment to one adult in a rural house that has a considerable financial burden.<ref name=\":14\" /> State governments take on this issue in a variety of ways.<ref name=\":14\" /> For example, many Indian states target landless workers in local debt relief efforts.<ref name=\":14\" /> \n\nAdditionally, to tackle the issue of child labor, the government passed the Child Labor Act and National Policy on Child Labor in 1986 and 1987 respectively.<ref name=\":6\" /> These initiatives created projects such as the National Child Labor Project which created rehabilitation programs for children and provided education and food to former child laborers.<ref name=\":6\" /> They also regulated the hours and conditions of child laborers and utilized a team of inspectors to prohibit these individuals from working in dangerous industries.<ref name=\":8\" /> Later on, in 1994, the Elimination of Child Labor Act incorporated more vocational training into schools to help students find opportunities for social mobility post-graduation.<ref name=\":8\" /> Researchers suggest that countries with a high incidence of child debt bondage like India must first address the low wages of farmers and the lack of alternatives to entering debt bondage for individuals in poverty.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Organizations ===\nIn 1993, the [[Human Rights Act 1993|Human Rights Act]] created the [[National Human Rights Commission]] which investigates issues of human rights violations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another organization that works on similar initiatives is the Center for Education and Communication which collaborates with NGOs and is responsible for educating the world about this issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the Academy of Development Science created a grain bank to tackle the issue of food scarcity and help Indians stay out of debt.<ref name=\":0\" /> Finally, the Indian National Commission on Labor has met numerous times to create more protection for Indian workers, especially those who cannot organize.<ref name=\":16\" /> \n\nOn an international level, in 1948, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] outlawed the practice of debt bondage.<ref name=\":14\" /> Similarly, in 1956, the United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery officially prohibited this institution.<ref name=\":12\" /> Additionally, more recently, the Dalit Freedom Network, a British NGO, has brought many children out of debt bondage and has worked to end Dalit slavery.<ref name=\":4\" />

creation of the Integrated Rural Development Society and Madras Social Service Society which focus on preventative measures to the issue of debt bondage.<ref name=\":10\" /> This has forced state governments to commit more time and attention towards tackling bonded labor issues.<ref name=\":10\" /> Additionally, this has lead to more initiatives which involve teaching employers about

Painted between 1600 and 1610, it may have served as the basis for the engraved portrait of Shakespeare used in the ''[[First Folio]]'' in 1623.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?search=ss&sText=shakespeare&LinkID=mp04051&rNo=0&role=sit|title=National Portrait Gallery \u2013 Portrait NPG 1; William Shakespeare|accessdate=11 June 2009|publisher=National Portrait Gallery |location=London}}</ref> It is named after the [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos|Dukes of Chandos]], who formerly owned the painting. The portrait was given to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] on its foundation in 1856, and it is listed as the first work in its collection.<ref name = \"NPG\">Tarnya Cooper (ed), Searching for Shakespeare, National Portrait Gallery and Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 54\u201361</ref>\n\nIt has not been possible to determine with certainty who painted the portrait, nor whether it really depicts Shakespeare. However, the National Portrait Gallery naively believes that it probably does depict the writer.\n\n==Authorship and provenance==\n[[File:Title page William Shakespeare's First Folio 1623.jpg|thumb|left|Engraved portrait of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout, on the title page of the first publication of his works, the ''First Folio'', shows distinct similarities when compared to the oil painting]]\n[[File:Soest portrait of Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Soest Portrait\" of Shakespeare.]]\n[[File:Chesterfield portrait.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Chesterfield Portrait\" of Shakespeare.]]\nIt has been claimed that Shakespeare's friend [[Richard Burbage]] (1567\u20131619) painted the Chandos portrait,<ref name = \"mags\">Mary Edmond, \"The Chandos Portrait: A Suggested Painter\",\n''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 124, No. 948, March 1982, pp. 146-147+149.</ref>  but the first known reference to the painting is in a note written in 1719 by [[George Vertue]], who states that it was painted by [[John Taylor (painter)|John Taylor]], a respected member of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers|Painter-Stainers' company]] who may also have been the same John Taylor who acted with the [[Children of Paul's]].<ref name=\"cooper54\">Cooper et al., 54.</ref> Vertue refers to Taylor as an actor and painter and as Shakespeare's \"intimate friend\". [[Katherine Duncan-Jones]] argues that 'John Taylor' could have been a misreading of what had originally been \"Jo: Taylor\"; she suggests that this may refer to the actor [[Joseph Taylor (actor)|Joseph Taylor]], who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the older Shakespeare.<ref>[[Katherine Duncan-Jones]], [http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/multimedia/archive/00750/CONTENTS_750590a.pdf \"A precious memento: The Chandos Portrait and Shakespeare's 'intimate friend'\"], ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', April 25, 2014, pp.13\u201315.</ref> \n\nVertue also states that before the Duke of Chandos acquired it, the portrait was owned by Shakespeare's possible godson, [[William Davenant]] (1606\u20131668),<ref name = \"mags\"/><ref name=\"cooper54\"/> who, according to the gossip chronicler [[John Aubrey]], claimed to be the playwright's illegitimate son.<ref>{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Anthony|title=Some Poets, Artists & \"A Reference for Mellors\"|publisher=Timewell Press|year=2005|isbn=1-85725-210-1|page=30}}</ref> He also states that it was left to Davenant in Taylor's will and that it was bought by [[Thomas Betterton]] from Davenant and then sold to the lawyer Robert Keck, a collector of Shakespeare memorabilia.<ref name = \"NPG\"/><ref name = \"mags\"/>\n\nAfter Keck's death in 1719, it passed to his daughter, and was inherited by John Nichol, who married into the Keck family. Nichol's daughter Margaret married [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos]]. The painting passed through descent within the Chandos title until [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] sold it to the [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Earl of Ellesmere]] in 1848. Ellesmere donated it to the National Portrait Gallery.<ref>Werner Habicht, David John Palmer, Roger Pringle, ''Images of Shakespeare: Proceedings of the Third Congress of the International Shakespeare Association, 1986'', International Shakespeare Association Congress, University of Delaware Press, 1986, p.27</ref>\n\n==Scholarly views==\nA contemporary image of the playwright is the [[engraving]] in the posthumously published [[First Folio]] of 1623, which was created by [[Martin Droeshout]] and was probably commissioned by Shakespeare's friends and family. It is considered likely that the Droeshout engraving is a reasonably accurate likeness because of the use by these close associates and that contemporaries such as [[Ben Jonson]] praised it at the time of the publication.<ref>{{cite book | title=Searching for Shakespeare | first=Tarnya | last=Cooper |author2=Pointon, Marcia |author3=Shapiro, James |author4= Wells, Stanley  | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | isbn=0-300-11611-X | page=48 }}</ref> Since the man in the Chandos portrait resembles the one in the Droeshout engraving, the similarity lends an indirect legitimacy to the oil painting. A further indication of legitimacy is the fact that the Chandos portrait was the inspiration for two posthumous portraits of Shakespeare, one by [[Gerard Soest]] and another, grander one, known as the \"[[:File:Chesterfield portrait.jpg|Chesterfield portrait]]\" after a former owner of that painting.<ref name = \"NPG\"/> These were probably painted in the 1660s or 1670s, within living memory of Shakespeare. The Chesterfield portrait is held by the [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].\n\nIn 2006, [[Tarnya Cooper]] of the National Portrait Gallery completed a three-and-a-half-year study of portraits purported to be of Shakespeare and concluded that the Chandos portrait was most likely a representation of Shakespeare. Cooper points to the earring and the loose shirt-ties of the sitter, which were emblematic of poets (the poet [[John Donne]] and Shakespeare's patron the [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Earl of Pembroke]] sported similar fashions). However, she readily acknowledges that the painting's authenticity cannot be proven.<ref name = \"NPG\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329424549-110427,00.html|title=The only true painting of Shakespeare \u2013 probably|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|date=2 March 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 July 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712221704/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329424549-110427,00.html|archivedate=12 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCooper also notes that the painting has been badly damaged by over-cleaning and retouching. Parts are abraded and some parts have been slightly altered. The hair has been extended and the beard is longer and more pointed than when originally painted.\n\n==Copies==\n[[File:Chandos copy.jpg|thumb|upright|An early copy of the portrait from c.1670, which may give a clearer idea of the original appearance of the beard]]\nIn addition to the Chesterfield portrait, a copy was made at least as early as 1689, by an unknown artist. Many 18th century images used it as a model for portrayals of Shakespeare.\n\nThe painting was engraved by [[Gerard Vandergucht]] for [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s 1709 edition of Shakespeare's works. Another print was made by [[Jacobus Houbraken]] in 1747.<ref name = \"NPG\"/>\n\n==Ethnic interpretations==\nBecause the images of Shakespeare are either doubtful in provenance or lacking expression, no one image seems to reconcile well with readers' imaginations. The relatively dusky features have caused repeated comment, often of a racist nature. [[George Steevens]] said that the picture gave Shakespeare \"the complexion of a Jew, or rather that of a chimney sweeper in the jaundice\".<ref>Schoenbaum, Samuel, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', Oxford University Press, 1991, p.205.</ref> According to [[Ben Macintyre]], \"Some Victorians recoiled at the idea that the Chandos portrait represented Shakespeare. One critic, J. Hain Friswell, insisted 'one cannot readily imagine our essentially English Shakespeare to have been a dark, heavy man, with a foreign expression'.\"<ref>Sunday Times (of London) article by Ben Macintyre, 10 March 2009, \"Commentary: Portrait alleged to be the face of William Shakespeare\" http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5877544.ece</ref> Friswell agreed with Steevens that the portrait had \"a decidedly Jewish physiognomy\" adding that it displayed \"a somewhat lubricious mouth, red-edged eyes\" and \"wanton lips, with a coarse expression.\"<ref>Louis Marder, ''His Exits and His Entrances: The Story of Shakespeare's Reputation'', Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1963, p.203</ref> According to [[Ernest Jones]], the portrait convinced [[Sigmund Freud]] that Shakespeare was French; \"He insisted that his countenance could not be that of an Anglo-Saxon but must be French, and he suggested that the name was a corruption of Jacques Pierre.\"<ref>Ernest Jones, The life and work of Sigmund Freud, Basic Books, vol.1 1961 p.18.</ref> The Iraqi writer [[Safa Khulusi]] argued that its \"un-English\" look and \"Islamic beard\" was evidence for his theory that Shakespeare was an Arab.<ref>Ferial J.

Painted between 1600 and 1610, it may have served as the basis for the engraved portrait of Shakespeare used in the ''[[First Folio]]'' in 1623.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?search=ss&sText=shakespeare&LinkID=mp04051&rNo=0&role=sit|title=National Portrait Gallery \u2013 Portrait NPG 1; William Shakespeare|accessdate=11 June 2009|publisher=National Portrait Gallery |location=London}}</ref> It is named after the [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos|Dukes of Chandos]], who formerly owned the painting. The portrait was given to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] on its foundation in 1856, and it is listed as the first work in its collection.<ref name = \"NPG\">Tarnya Cooper (ed), Searching for Shakespeare, National Portrait Gallery and Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 54\u201361</ref>\n\nIt has not been possible to determine with certainty who painted the portrait, nor whether it really depicts Shakespeare. However, the National Portrait Gallery believes that it probably does depict the writer.\n\n==Authorship and provenance==\n[[File:Title page William Shakespeare's First Folio 1623.jpg|thumb|left|Engraved portrait of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout, on the title page of the first publication of his works, the ''First Folio'', shows distinct similarities when compared to the oil painting]]\n[[File:Soest portrait of Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Soest Portrait\" of Shakespeare.]]\n[[File:Chesterfield portrait.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Chesterfield Portrait\" of Shakespeare.]]\nIt has been claimed that Shakespeare's friend [[Richard Burbage]] (1567\u20131619) painted the Chandos portrait,<ref name = \"mags\">Mary Edmond, \"The Chandos Portrait: A Suggested Painter\",\n''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 124, No. 948, March 1982, pp. 146-147+149.</ref>  but the first known reference to the painting is in a note written in 1719 by [[George Vertue]], who states that it was painted by [[John Taylor (painter)|John Taylor]], a respected member of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers|Painter-Stainers' company]] who may also have been the same John Taylor who acted with the [[Children of Paul's]].<ref name=\"cooper54\">Cooper et al., 54.</ref> Vertue refers to Taylor as an actor and painter and as Shakespeare's \"intimate friend\". [[Katherine Duncan-Jones]] argues that 'John Taylor' could have been a misreading of what had originally been \"Jo: Taylor\"; she suggests that this may refer to the actor [[Joseph Taylor (actor)|Joseph Taylor]], who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the older Shakespeare.<ref>[[Katherine Duncan-Jones]], [http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/multimedia/archive/00750/CONTENTS_750590a.pdf \"A precious memento: The Chandos Portrait and Shakespeare's 'intimate friend'\"], ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', April 25, 2014, pp.13\u201315.</ref> \n\nVertue also states that before the Duke of Chandos acquired it, the portrait was owned by Shakespeare's possible godson, [[William Davenant]] (1606\u20131668),<ref name = \"mags\"/><ref name=\"cooper54\"/> who, according to the gossip chronicler [[John Aubrey]], claimed to be the playwright's illegitimate son.<ref>{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Anthony|title=Some Poets, Artists & \"A Reference for Mellors\"|publisher=Timewell Press|year=2005|isbn=1-85725-210-1|page=30}}</ref> He also states that it was left to Davenant in Taylor's will and that it was bought by [[Thomas Betterton]] from Davenant and then sold to the lawyer Robert Keck, a collector of Shakespeare memorabilia.<ref name = \"NPG\"/><ref name = \"mags\"/>\n\nAfter Keck's death in 1719, it passed to his daughter, and was inherited by John Nichol, who married into the Keck family. Nichol's daughter Margaret married [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos]]. The painting passed through descent within the Chandos title until [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] sold it to the [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Earl of Ellesmere]] in 1848. Ellesmere donated it to the National Portrait Gallery.<ref>Werner Habicht, David John Palmer, Roger Pringle, ''Images of Shakespeare: Proceedings of the Third Congress of the International Shakespeare Association, 1986'', International Shakespeare Association Congress, University of Delaware Press, 1986, p.27</ref>\n\n==Scholarly views==\nA contemporary image of the playwright is the [[engraving]] in the posthumously published [[First Folio]] of 1623, which was created by [[Martin Droeshout]] and was probably commissioned by Shakespeare's friends and family. It is considered likely that the Droeshout engraving is a reasonably accurate likeness because of the use by these close associates and that contemporaries such as [[Ben Jonson]] praised it at the time of the publication.<ref>{{cite book | title=Searching for Shakespeare | first=Tarnya | last=Cooper |author2=Pointon, Marcia |author3=Shapiro, James |author4= Wells, Stanley  | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | isbn=0-300-11611-X | page=48 }}</ref> Since the man in the Chandos portrait resembles the one in the Droeshout engraving, the similarity lends an indirect legitimacy to the oil painting. A further indication of legitimacy is the fact that the Chandos portrait was the inspiration for two posthumous portraits of Shakespeare, one by [[Gerard Soest]] and another, grander one, known as the \"[[:File:Chesterfield portrait.jpg|Chesterfield portrait]]\" after a former owner of that painting.<ref name = \"NPG\"/> These were probably painted in the 1660s or 1670s, within living memory of Shakespeare. The Chesterfield portrait is held by the [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].\n\nIn 2006, [[Tarnya Cooper]] of the National Portrait Gallery completed a three-and-a-half-year study of portraits purported to be of Shakespeare and concluded that the Chandos portrait was most likely a representation of Shakespeare. Cooper points to the earring and the loose shirt-ties of the sitter, which were emblematic of poets (the poet [[John Donne]] and Shakespeare's patron the [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Earl of Pembroke]] sported similar fashions). However, she readily acknowledges that the painting's authenticity cannot be proven.<ref name = \"NPG\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329424549-110427,00.html|title=The only true painting of Shakespeare \u2013 probably|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|date=2 March 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 July 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712221704/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329424549-110427,00.html|archivedate=12 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCooper also notes that the painting has been badly damaged by over-cleaning and retouching. Parts are abraded and some parts have been slightly altered. The hair has been extended and the beard is longer and more pointed than when originally painted.\n\n==Copies==\n[[File:Chandos copy.jpg|thumb|upright|An early copy of the portrait from c.1670, which may give a clearer idea of the original appearance of the beard]]\nIn addition to the Chesterfield portrait, a copy was made at least as early as 1689, by an unknown artist. Many 18th century images used it as a model for portrayals of Shakespeare.\n\nThe painting was engraved by [[Gerard Vandergucht]] for [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s 1709 edition of Shakespeare's works. Another print was made by [[Jacobus Houbraken]] in 1747.<ref name = \"NPG\"/>\n\n==Ethnic interpretations==\nBecause the images of Shakespeare are either doubtful in provenance or lacking expression, no one image seems to reconcile well with readers' imaginations. The relatively dusky features have caused repeated comment, often of a racist nature. [[George Steevens]] said that the picture gave Shakespeare \"the complexion of a Jew, or rather that of a chimney sweeper in the jaundice\".<ref>Schoenbaum, Samuel, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', Oxford University Press, 1991, p.205.</ref> According to [[Ben Macintyre]], \"Some Victorians recoiled at the idea that the Chandos portrait represented Shakespeare. One critic, J. Hain Friswell, insisted 'one cannot readily imagine our essentially English Shakespeare to have been a dark, heavy man, with a foreign expression'.\"<ref>Sunday Times (of London) article by Ben Macintyre, 10 March 2009, \"Commentary: Portrait alleged to be the face of William Shakespeare\" http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5877544.ece</ref> Friswell agreed with Steevens that the portrait had \"a decidedly Jewish physiognomy\" adding that it displayed \"a somewhat lubricious mouth, red-edged eyes\" and \"wanton lips, with a coarse expression.\"<ref>Louis Marder, ''His Exits and His Entrances: The Story of Shakespeare's Reputation'', Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1963, p.203</ref> According to [[Ernest Jones]], the portrait convinced [[Sigmund Freud]] that Shakespeare was French; \"He insisted that his countenance could not be that of an Anglo-Saxon but must be French, and he suggested that the name was a corruption of Jacques Pierre.\"<ref>Ernest Jones, The life and work of Sigmund Freud, Basic Books, vol.1 1961 p.18.</ref> The Iraqi writer [[Safa Khulusi]] argued that its \"un-English\" look and \"Islamic beard\" was evidence for his theory that Shakespeare was an Arab.<ref>Ferial J. Ghazoul, \"The Arabization of Othello\", Comparative Literature, Vol. 50, No. 1, Winter, 1998, p.9</ref> However, assuming the portrait to be genuinely of Shakespeare, there is no real reason to accept the truth of any such claims.

Visual communication has become one of the most important approaches using which people communicate and share information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.markgrowth.com/why-visual-communication-is-so-important-in-content-marketing-d955ccd932a2|title=Why Visual Communication is So Important in Content Marketing}}</ref>\n[[File:Eye of Horus bw.svg|thumb|right|The Eye of Horus]]\nThe term 'visual presentation'<ref>{{Cite book|title=A guide to visual presentation|last=Ruzaimi Mat Rani, author, illustrator.|isbn=978-1-63159-103-7|oclc=900012442|date = 2015-09-15}}</ref> is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically-oriented usability. \n\n=== Web Design and Visual Communication ===\nVisual communication on the [[World Wide Web]] is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses the eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}. \n\n=== Symbolism in Visual Communication ===\nThe [[Eye of Horus]] is often referred to as the symbol of visual communication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sharonshamladesign.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/task-2-visual-communication-and-cultural-understanding/|title=Sharonshamladdesign}}</ref> It is said to be a representation of an eclipse, to symbolize Horus' right eye which was torn out and that the myth refers to a solar eclipse in which the sun is momentarily blotted from the sky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/eye/|title=Ancient Egypt online}}</ref>\n\n===Important figures===\n[[Aldous Huxley]] is regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Visual Imperative: Creating a Visual Culture of Data Discovery|last=Ryan|first=Lindy|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=2016|isbn=978-0128038444|location=|pages=116}}</ref> Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[The Art of Seeing]]''. He described \"seeing\" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is \"The more you see, the more you know.\"\n\n[[Max Wertheimer]] is said to be the father of [[Gestalt psychology]]. Gestalt means ''form'' or ''shape'' in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or colour, continuity and proximity. Additional laws include closure and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.<ref>CLC, Y. S. (2018). Gestalt psychology. ''Salem Press Encyclopedia''.

''Handbook of visual communication: theory, methods, and media''. [[Routledge]]. p. 12.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}</ref> are taught the basic physics of light, anatomy and physiology of the eye, cognitive and perception theories, colour theories, [[Gestalt psychology]], aesthetics, natural reading patterns, design principles, [[semiotics]], persuasion, camera/filming actions and image-types, and so forth. Colleges for visual communications differ in their approach, but most combine theory and practice in some form.\n\nVisual communication takes place through [[picture]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]] and [[chart]]s, as well as through [[sign]]s, signals and [[symbol]]s. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.\n\n==Visual aids==\n'''Visual aids''' are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to [[slide show]]s. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. \n\nVisual communication plays an important role in our daily life. Advertisements, teaching and learning, speeches and presentations, and so on all involve visual communication to some extent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edrawsoft.com/benefits-of-visual-communication.php|title=benefits of visual communication}}</ref>\n\nEach type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience. \n\nVisual aids can be a very powerful tool to enhance the impact of presentations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/ld/resources/presentations/visual-aids|title=using visual aids}}</ref> The purpose of the visual aid is to ''enhance'' the presentation.<ref name=\"berengueres_2015\">{{cite book | last = Berengueres | first = Jose | year = 2015 | title = Sketch Thinking | publisher = Stokes Hamilton | location = Barcelona}}</ref> Visual aids are not notes. Instead, they should add impact and emphasis to messages, thus increasing what listeners remember and how long they retain it. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/06/22/five-tips-to-effectively-interact-with-visual-aids/#2cfa476e7254|title=Five Tips To Effectively Interact With Visual Aids}}</ref>\n\n==Visual aids media: simple to advanced==\n'''Chalkboard or whiteboard'''\n\nChalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are unavailable.  They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility.<ref name=\"roth\">{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=J. Dan|title=In the company of others : an introduction to communication|year=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533630-6|edition=3rd}}</ref>\nThe use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid.   Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom.  Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Poster board'''\n\nA poster is a very simple and easy visual aid.  Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional.  Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over.  The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Handouts'''\n\nHandouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over.  This can help the person better remember what was discussed.  Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting.  Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience\u2019s attention.  The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it.<ref name=\"maui\">{{cite web|last=Kumu|first=Ka|title=Using Visual Aids Effectively|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/mauispeech/html/visual_aids.html|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Maui College]] Speech Department|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>  Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Video excerpts'''\n\nA video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech.  There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture.  First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk.  Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting.  The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Projection equipment'''\n\nThere are several types of projectors.  These include slide projectors, PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, and computer projectors.  Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used.  PowerPoint presentations are very popular and are used often.  Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use.  In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen.  This takes time and costs money.  Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors.  When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen.  Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Computer-assisted presentations'''\n\nPowerPoint presentations can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track.  A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together.  There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Social media'''\n\nSocial media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size.\n\n== Visual elements ==\n'''Objects'''\n\nThe use of objects as visual aids involves bringing the actual object to demonstrate on during the speech. For example, a speech about tying knots would be more effective by bringing in a rope.\n\n*'''Pro''': the use of the actual object is often necessary when demonstrating how to do something so that the audience can fully understand procedure.\n*'''Con''': some objects are too large or unavailable for a speaker to bring with them.\n\n'''Models'''\n\nModels are representations of another object that serve to demonstrate that object when use of the real object is ineffective for some reason.  Examples include human skeletal systems, the solar system, or architecture.\n\n*'''Pros''': models can serve as substitutes that provide a better example of the real thing to the audience when the object being spoken about is of an awkward size or composure for use in the demonstration.\n*'''Cons''': sometimes a model may take away from the reality of what is being spoken about. For example, the vast size of the solar system cannot be seen from a model, and the actual composure of a human body cannot be seen from a dummy.\n\n'''Graphs'''\n\nGraphs are used to visualize relationships between different quantities. Various types are used as visual aids, including bar graphs, line graphs, pie graphs, and scatter plots.\n\n*'''Pros''': graphs help the audience to visualize statistics so that they make a greater impact than just listing them verbally would.\n*'''Cons''': graphs can easily become cluttered during use in a speech by including too much detail, overwhelming the audience and making the graph ineffective.\n\n'''Maps'''\n\nMaps show geographic areas that are of interest to the speech. They often are used as aids when speaking of differences between geographical areas or showing the location of something.\n\n*'''Pros''': when maps are simple and clear, they can be used to effectively make points about certain areas. For example, a map showing the building site for a new hospital could show its close location to key neighbourhoods, or a map could show the differences in distribution of AIDS victims in North American and African countries.\n*'''Cons''': inclusion of too much detail on a map can cause the audience to lose focus on the key point being made. Also, if the map is disproportional or unrealistic, it may prove ineffective for the point being made.\n\n'''Tables'''\n\nTables are columns and rows that organize words, symbols, and/or data.\n\n*'''Pros''': Good tables are easy to understand. They are a good way to compare facts and to gain a better overall understanding of the topic being discussed. For example, a table is a good choice to use when comparing the amount of rainfall in 3 counties each month.\n*'''Cons''': Tables are not very interesting or pleasing to the eye.  They can be overwhelming if too much information is in a small space or the information is not organized in a convenient way. A table is not a good choice to use if the person viewing it has to take a lot of time to be able to understand it. Tables can be visual distractions if it is hard to read because the font is too small or the writing is too close together.  It can also be a visual distraction if the table is not drawn evenly.\n\n'''Photographs'''\n* '''Pros''': Photographs are good tools to make or emphasize a point or to explain a topic. For example, when explaining the shanty-towns in a Third World country it would be beneficial to show a picture of one so the reader can have a better understanding of how those people live. A photograph is also good to use when the actual object cannot be viewed.  For example, in a health class learning about cocaine, the teacher cannot bring in cocaine to show the class because that would be illegal, but the teacher could show a picture of cocaine to the class. Using local photos can also help emphasize how your topic is important in the audience's area.<ref name=\"gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/traintec.html|title=Presenting Effective Presentations with Visual Aids|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]]|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Cons''': If the photograph is too small it just becomes a distraction. Enlarging photographs can be expensive if not using a power point or other viewing device.\n\n'''Drawings or diagrams'''\n* '''Pros''': Drawings or diagrams can be used when photographs do not show exactly what the speaker wants to show or explain. It could also be used when a photograph is too detailed. For example, a drawing or diagram of the circulatory system throughout the body is a lot more effective than a picture of a cadaver showing the circulatory system.\n* '''Cons''':If not drawn correctly a drawing can look sloppy and be ineffective.  This type of drawing will appear unprofessional.\n\n== Image analysis ==\nVisual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires [[image analysis]]. Images can be analysed though many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by [[Paul Martin Lester]]:<ref>[[Paul Martin Lester]].  ''Visual Communication: Images with Messages''.

Visual communication in part or whole relies on [[Eye|eyesight]].<ref>David Sless (1981). ''Learning and Visual Communication''. p.187</ref> Visual communication is a broad spectrum that includes [[signage|sign]]s, [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], [[industrial design]], [[advertising]], [[animation]], [[color]], and electronic resources.<ref>Kenneth Louis Smith (2005). ''Handbook of Visual Communication: Theory, Methods, and Media''. p.123.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe debate about the nature of visual communication dates back thousands of years. Visual communication relies on a collection of activities, communicating ideas, attitudes, and values via visual resources, i.e. text, graphics, or video. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzgzNDg2N19fQU41?sid=2e153c6d-2804-4df1-864a-dc3ce4cfbdcc@pdc-v-sessmgr06&vid=0&format=EB&lpid=lp_3&rid=0|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref>\n\nThe evaluation of a good [[Visual design|visual communication design]] is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience,<ref>Jorge Frascara (2004). ''Communication design: principles, methods, and practice''. p.68</ref> not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of aesthetics. Besides [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, there are other ways to express information visually - [[gestures]] and body language, animation (digital or analogue), and film. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Visual communication by [[e-mail]], a textual medium, is commonly expressed with [[ASCII art]], [[emoticon]]s, and embedded [[digital image]]s. Visual communication has become one of the most important approaches using which people communicate and share information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.markgrowth.com/why-visual-communication-is-so-important-in-content-marketing-d955ccd932a2|title=Why Visual Communication is So Important in Content Marketing}}</ref>\n[[File:Eye of Horus bw.svg|thumb|right|The Eye of Horus]]\nThe term 'visual presentation'<ref>{{Cite book|title=A guide to visual presentation|last=Ruzaimi Mat Rani, author, illustrator.|isbn=978-1-63159-103-7|oclc=900012442|date = 2015-09-15}}</ref> is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically-oriented usability. \n\n=== Web Design and Visual Communication ===\nVisual communication on the [[World Wide Web]] is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses the eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}. \n\n=== Symbolism in Visual Communication ===\nThe [[Eye of Horus]] is often referred to as the symbol of visual communication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sharonshamladesign.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/task-2-visual-communication-and-cultural-understanding/|title=Sharonshamladdesign}}</ref> It is said to be a representation of an eclipse, to symbolize Horus' right eye which was torn out and that the myth refers to a solar eclipse in which the sun is momentarily blotted from the sky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/eye/|title=Ancient Egypt online}}</ref>\n\n===Important figures===\n[[Aldous Huxley]] is regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Visual Imperative: Creating a Visual Culture of Data Discovery|last=Ryan|first=Lindy|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=2016|isbn=978-0128038444|location=|pages=116}}</ref> Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[The Art of Seeing]]''. He described \"seeing\" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is \"The more you see, the more you know.\"\n\n[[Max Wertheimer]] is said to be the father of [[Gestalt psychology]]. Gestalt means ''form'' or ''shape'' in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or colour, continuity and proximity. Additional laws include closure and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.<ref>CLC, Y. S. (2018). Gestalt psychology. ''Salem Press Encyclopedia''.

''Handbook of visual communication: theory, methods, and media''. [[Routledge]]. p. 12.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}</ref> are taught the basic physics of light, anatomy and physiology of the eye, cognitive and perception theories, colour theories, [[Gestalt psychology]], aesthetics, natural reading patterns, design principles, [[semiotics]], persuasion, camera/filming actions and image-types, and so forth. Colleges for visual communications differ in their approach, but most combine theory and practice in some form.\n\nVisual communication takes place through [[picture]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]] and [[chart]]s, as well as through [[sign]]s, signals and [[symbol]]s. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.\n\n==Visual aids==\n'''Visual aids''' are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to [[slide show]]s. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. \n\nVisual communication plays an important role in our daily life. Advertisements, teaching and learning, speeches and presentations, and so on all involve visual communication to some extent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edrawsoft.com/benefits-of-visual-communication.php|title=benefits of visual communication}}</ref>\n\nEach type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience. \n\nVisual aids can be a very powerful tool to enhance the impact of presentations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/ld/resources/presentations/visual-aids|title=using visual aids}}</ref> The purpose of the visual aid is to ''enhance'' the presentation.<ref name=\"berengueres_2015\">{{cite book | last = Berengueres | first = Jose | year = 2015 | title = Sketch Thinking | publisher = Stokes Hamilton | location = Barcelona}}</ref> Visual aids are not notes. Instead, they should add impact and emphasis to messages, thus increasing what listeners remember and how long they retain it. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/06/22/five-tips-to-effectively-interact-with-visual-aids/#2cfa476e7254|title=Five Tips To Effectively Interact With Visual Aids}}</ref>\n\n==Visual aids media: simple to advanced==\n'''Chalkboard or whiteboard'''\n\nChalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are unavailable.  They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility.<ref name=\"roth\">{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=J. Dan|title=In the company of others : an introduction to communication|year=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533630-6|edition=3rd}}</ref>\nThe use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid.   Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom.  Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Poster board'''\n\nA poster is a very simple and easy visual aid.  Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional.  Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over.  The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Handouts'''\n\nHandouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over.  This can help the person better remember what was discussed.  Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting.  Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience\u2019s attention.  The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it.<ref name=\"maui\">{{cite web|last=Kumu|first=Ka|title=Using Visual Aids Effectively|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/mauispeech/html/visual_aids.html|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Maui College]] Speech Department|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>  Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Video excerpts'''\n\nA video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech.  There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture.  First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk.  Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting.  The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Projection equipment'''\n\nThere are several types of projectors.  These include slide projectors, PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, and computer projectors.  Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used.  PowerPoint presentations are very popular and are used often.  Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use.  In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen.  This takes time and costs money.  Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors.  When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen.  Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Computer-assisted presentations'''\n\nPowerPoint presentations can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track.  A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together.  There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.<ref name=\"roth\" />\n\n'''Social media'''\n\nSocial media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size.\n\n== Visual elements ==\n'''Objects'''\n\nThe use of objects as visual aids involves bringing the actual object to demonstrate on during the speech. For example, a speech about tying knots would be more effective by bringing in a rope.\n\n*'''Pro''': the use of the actual object is often necessary when demonstrating how to do something so that the audience can fully understand procedure.\n*'''Con''': some objects are too large or unavailable for a speaker to bring with them.\n\n'''Models'''\n\nModels are representations of another object that serve to demonstrate that object when use of the real object is ineffective for some reason.  Examples include human skeletal systems, the solar system, or architecture.\n\n*'''Pros''': models can serve as substitutes that provide a better example of the real thing to the audience when the object being spoken about is of an awkward size or composure for use in the demonstration.\n*'''Cons''': sometimes a model may take away from the reality of what is being spoken about. For example, the vast size of the solar system cannot be seen from a model, and the actual composure of a human body cannot be seen from a dummy.\n\n'''Graphs'''\n\nGraphs are used to visualize relationships between different quantities. Various types are used as visual aids, including bar graphs, line graphs, pie graphs, and scatter plots.\n\n*'''Pros''': graphs help the audience to visualize statistics so that they make a greater impact than just listing them verbally would.\n*'''Cons''': graphs can easily become cluttered during use in a speech by including too much detail, overwhelming the audience and making the graph ineffective.\n\n'''Maps'''\n\nMaps show geographic areas that are of interest to the speech. They often are used as aids when speaking of differences between geographical areas or showing the location of something.\n\n*'''Pros''': when maps are simple and clear, they can be used to effectively make points about certain areas. For example, a map showing the building site for a new hospital could show its close location to key neighbourhoods, or a map could show the differences in distribution of AIDS victims in North American and African countries.\n*'''Cons''': inclusion of too much detail on a map can cause the audience to lose focus on the key point being made. Also, if the map is disproportional or unrealistic, it may prove ineffective for the point being made.\n\n'''Tables'''\n\nTables are columns and rows that organize words, symbols, and/or data.\n\n*'''Pros''': Good tables are easy to understand. They are a good way to compare facts and to gain a better overall understanding of the topic being discussed. For example, a table is a good choice to use when comparing the amount of rainfall in 3 counties each month.\n*'''Cons''': Tables are not very interesting or pleasing to the eye.  They can be overwhelming if too much information is in a small space or the information is not organized in a convenient way. A table is not a good choice to use if the person viewing it has to take a lot of time to be able to understand it. Tables can be visual distractions if it is hard to read because the font is too small or the writing is too close together.  It can also be a visual distraction if the table is not drawn evenly.\n\n'''Photographs'''\n* '''Pros''': Photographs are good tools to make or emphasize a point or to explain a topic. For example, when explaining the shanty-towns in a Third World country it would be beneficial to show a picture of one so the reader can have a better understanding of how those people live. A photograph is also good to use when the actual object cannot be viewed.  For example, in a health class learning about cocaine, the teacher cannot bring in cocaine to show the class because that would be illegal, but the teacher could show a picture of cocaine to the class. Using local photos can also help emphasize how your topic is important in the audience's area.<ref name=\"gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/traintec.html|title=Presenting Effective Presentations with Visual Aids|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]]|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Cons''': If the photograph is too small it just becomes a distraction. Enlarging photographs can be expensive if not using a power point or other viewing device.\n\n'''Drawings or diagrams'''\n* '''Pros''': Drawings or diagrams can be used when photographs do not show exactly what the speaker wants to show or explain. It could also be used when a photograph is too detailed. For example, a drawing or diagram of the circulatory system throughout the body is a lot more effective than a picture of a cadaver showing the circulatory system.\n* '''Cons''':If not drawn correctly a drawing can look sloppy and be ineffective.  This type of drawing will appear unprofessional.\n\n== Image analysis ==\nVisual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires [[image analysis]]. Images can be analysed though many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by [[Paul Martin Lester]]:<ref>[[Paul Martin Lester]].  ''Visual Communication: Images with Messages''. Belmont, CA: [[Thomson Wadsworth]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-534-63720-0}}</ref>\n\n;Personal perspective\n\nWhen a viewer has an opinion about an image based on their personal thoughts. Personal response depends on the viewer\u2019s thoughts and values{{Red|,}} individually. However,This might be sometimes in conflict with cultural values. Also when a viewer has viewed an image with a personal perspective, it is hard to change the view of the image on the viewer, {{Black|even though the image can be seen in other ways}}.\n\n;Historical perspective\n\nAn image\u2019s view can be arising from the history of the use of media. Through times sort images have been changed, because the use of different (new) media.
