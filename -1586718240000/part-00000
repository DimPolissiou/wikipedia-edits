He made significant contributions to the fields of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[number theory]], and both [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[celestial mechanics]].\n\nIn 1766, on the recommendation of Swiss [[Leonhard Euler]] and French [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin, [[Prussia]], where he stayed for over twenty years, producing volumes of work and winning several prizes of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. Lagrange's treatise on [[analytical mechanics]] (''[[M\u00e9canique analytique]]'', 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1788\u201389), written in Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to Paris and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He remained in France until the end of his life. He was significantly involved in the [[History of the metric system|decimalisation]] in [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]], became the first professor of analysis at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] upon its opening in 1794, was a founding member of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]], and became [[S\u00e9nat conservateur|Senator]] in 1799.\n\n==Scientific contribution==\nLagrange was one of the creators of the [[calculus of variations]], deriving the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s for extrema of [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]]. He extended the method to include possible constraints, arriving at the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]].\nLagrange invented the method of solving [[differential equation]]s known as [[method of variation of parameters|variation of parameters]], applied [[differential calculus]] to the [[probability theory|theory of probabilities]] and worked on solutions for [[algebraic equations]]. He proved that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every natural number is a sum of four squares]]. His treatise ''Theorie des fonctions analytiques'' laid some of the foundations of [[group theory]], anticipating [[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]]. In [[calculus]], Lagrange developed a novel approach to [[Lagrange interpolation|interpolation]] and [[Taylor series]]. He studied the [[three-body problem]] for the Earth, Sun and Moon (1764) and the movement of Jupiter's satellites (1766), and in 1772 found the special-case solutions to this problem that yield what are now known as [[Lagrangian point]]s. Lagrange is best known for transforming [[Newtonian mechanics]] into a branch of analysis, [[Lagrangian mechanics]], and presented the mechanical \"principles\" as simple results of the variational calculus.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote box |align=right |width=20% |quote=\n\nIn appearance he was of medium height, and slightly formed, with pale blue eyes and a colourless complexion.

His paternal great-grandfather was a French army officer who had moved to Turin, the ''de facto'' capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] at Lagrange's time, and married an Italian; so did his grandfather and his father. His mother was from the countryside of [[Turin]].<ref name=\"St Andrew\">[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lagrange.html Lagrange] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325121637/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lagrange.html |date=25 March 2007 }} St. Andrew University</ref> He was raised as a Roman Catholic (but later on became an [[agnostic]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematics and the Search for Knowledge|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504230-6|author=Morris Kline|page=214|quote=Lagrange and Laplace, though of Catholic parentage, were agnostics.}}</ref>\n\nHis father, who had charge of the [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|king's]] military chest and was Treasurer of the Office of Public Works and Fortifications in Turin, should have maintained a good social position and wealth, but before his son grew up he had lost most of his property in speculations. A career as a lawyer was planned out for Lagrange by his father, and certainly Lagrange seems to have accepted this willingly. He studied at the [[University of Turin]] and his favourite subject was classical Latin. At first he had no great enthusiasm for mathematics, finding Greek geometry rather dull.\n\nIt was not until he was seventeen that he showed any taste for mathematics \u2013 his interest in the subject being first excited by a paper by [[Edmond Halley]] which he came across by accident. Alone and unaided he threw himself into mathematical studies; at the end of a year's incessant toil he was already an accomplished mathematician. [[Charles Emmanuel III]] appointed Lagrange to serve as the \"Sostituto del Maestro di Matematica\" (mathematics assistant professor) at the Royal Military Academy of the Theory and Practice of Artillery in 1755, where he taught courses in calculus and mechanics to support the Piedmontese army's early adoption of the ballistics theories of [[Benjamin Robins]] and [[Leonhard Euler]].  In that capacity, Lagrange was the first to teach calculus in an engineering school.  According to [[:it:Alessandro Vittorio Papacino D'Antoni|Alessandro Papacino D'Antoni]], the academy's military commander and famous artillery theorist, Lagrange unfortunately proved to be a problematic professor with his oblivious teaching style, abstract reasoning, and impatience with artillery and fortification-engineering applications.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Brett|title=The Heirs of Archimedes: Science and the Art of War through the Age of Enlightenment|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-262-19516-X|pages=368, 375|authorlink=Military 'Progress' and Newtonian Science|editor=Brett Steele |editor2=Tamera Dorland|chapter=13}}</ref> In this Academy one of his students was [[Fran\u00e7ois Daviet de Foncenex|Fran\u00e7ois Daviet]].<ref>{{cite book | last = de Andrade Martins | first = Roberto | chapter = A busca da Ci\u00eancia ''a priori'' no final do Seculo XVIII e a origem da An\u00e1lise dimensional | editor= Roberto de Andrade Martins |editor2=Lilian Al-Chueyr Pereira Martins |editor3=Cibelle Celestino Silva |editor4=Juliana Mesquita Hidalgo Ferreira| title = Filosofia E Historia Da Ci\u00eancia No Cone Sul. 3 Encontro | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yiuwanC2NlYC | date = 2008 | publisher = AFHIC | page = 406 | isbn = 978-1-4357-1633-9|language=pt}}</ref>\n\n==== Variational calculus ====\nLagrange is one of the founders of the [[calculus of variations]]. Starting in 1754, he worked on the problem of the [[tautochrone]], discovering a method of maximizing and minimizing functionals in a way similar to finding extrema of functions. Lagrange wrote several letters to [[Leonhard Euler]] between 1754 and 1756 describing his results. He outlined his \"\u03b4-algorithm\", leading to the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s of variational calculus and considerably simplifying Euler's earlier analysis.<ref>Although some authors speak of general method of solving \"[[isoperimetric]] problems\", the eighteenth century meaning of this expression amounts to \"problems in variational calculus\", reserving the adjective \"relative\" for problems with isoperimetric-type constraints. The celebrated method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], which applies to optimization of functions of several variables subject to constraints, did not appear until much later. See {{cite journal | last = Fraser | first = Craig | title = Isoperimetric Problems in the Variational Calculus of Euler and Lagrange | journal = Historia Mathematica | volume = 19 | pages = 4\u201323 |year = 1992 | doi = 10.1016/0315-0860(92)90052-D }}</ref> Lagrange also applied his ideas to problems of classical mechanics, generalising the results of Euler and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]].\n\nEuler was very impressed with Lagrange's results. It has been stated that \"with characteristic courtesy he withheld a paper he had previously written, which covered some of the same ground, in order that the young Italian might have time to complete his work, and claim the undisputed invention of the new calculus\"; however, this chivalric view has been disputed.<ref>Galletto, D., ''The genesis of M\u00e9canique analytique'', La M\u00e9canique analytique de Lagrange et son h\u00e9ritage, II (Turin, 1989). Atti Accad. Sci. Torino Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Natur. 126 (1992), suppl. 2, 277\u2013370, {{MathSciNet|id=1264671}}.</ref> Lagrange published his method in two memoirs of the Turin Society in 1762 and 1773.\n\n==== ''Miscellanea Taurinensia'' ====\nIn 1758, with the aid of his pupils (mainly with Daviet), Lagrange established a society, which was subsequently incorporated as the [[Turin Academy of Sciences]], and most of his early writings are to be found in the five volumes of its transactions, usually known as the ''Miscellanea Taurinensia''. Many of these are elaborate papers. The first volume contains a paper on the theory of the propagation of sound; in this he indicates a mistake made by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], obtains the general [[differential equation]] for the motion, and integrates it for motion in a straight line. This volume also contains the complete solution of the problem of a [[vibrating string|string vibrating transversely]]; in this paper he points out a lack of generality in the solutions previously given by [[Brook Taylor]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]], and Euler, and arrives at the conclusion that the form of the curve at any time ''t'' is given by the equation <math>y = a \\sin (mx) \\sin (nt)\\,</math>. The article concludes with a masterly discussion of [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]es, [[beat (acoustics)|beat]]s, and compound sounds. Other articles in this volume are on [[recurrence relation|recurring]] [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[probability|probabilities]], and the [[calculus of variations]].\n\nThe second volume contains a long paper embodying the results of several papers in the first volume on the theory and notation of the calculus of variations; and he illustrates its use by deducing the [[principle of least action]], and by solutions of various problems in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]].\n\nThe third volume includes the solution of several dynamical problems by means of the calculus of variations; some papers on the [[integral calculus]]; a solution of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]'s problem mentioned above: given an integer ''n'' which is not a [[square number|perfect square]], to find a number ''x'' such that ''x''<sup>2</sup>''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is a perfect square; and the general differential equations of [[N-body problem|motion for three bodies]] moving under their mutual attractions.\n\nThe next work he produced was in 1764 on the [[libration]] of the Moon, and an explanation as to why the same face was always turned to the earth, a problem which he treated by the aid of [[virtual work]]. His solution is especially interesting as containing the germ of the idea of generalised equations of motion, equations which he first formally proved in 1780.\n\n=== Berlin ===\nAlready by 1756, [[Euler]] and [[Maupertuis]], seeing his mathematical talent, tried to persuade him to come to Berlin, but Lagrange shyly refused the offer. In 1765, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] interceded on Lagrange's behalf with [[Frederick the Great|Frederick of Prussia]] and by letter, asked him to leave Turin for a considerably more prestigious position in Berlin. He again turned down the offer, responding that<ref name=\"Vinter2000\">{{cite book|author=Richard B. Vinter|title=Optimal Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PY9xscfbfiYC|date=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-8176-4075-0}}</ref>{{rp|361}}\n: ''It seems to me that Berlin would not be at all suitable for me while M.Euler is there''.\n\nIn 1766, after Euler left Berlin for [[Saint Petersburg]], Frederick himself wrote to Lagrange expressing the wish of \"the greatest king in Europe\" to have \"the greatest mathematician in Europe\" resident at his court. Lagrange was finally persuaded and he spent the next twenty years in [[Prussia]], where he produced a long series of papers published in the Berlin and Turin transactions, and composed his monumental work, the ''M\u00e9canique analytique''. In 1767, he married his cousin Vittoria Conti.\n\nLagrange was a favourite of the king, who frequently lectured him on the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson was accepted, and Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and experimented to find the exact amount of work which he could do before exhaustion. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He carefully planned his papers before writing them, usually without a single erasure or correction.\n\nNonetheless, during his years in Berlin, Lagrange's health was rather poor, and that of his wife Vittoria was even worse. She died in 1783 after years of illness and Lagrange was very depressed. In 1786, Frederick II died, and the climate of Berlin became difficult for Lagrange.<ref name=\"St Andrew\" />\n\n=== Paris ===\nIn 1786, following Frederick's death, Lagrange received similar invitations from states including Spain and [[Naples]], and he accepted the offer of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to move to Paris. In France he was received with every mark of distinction and special apartments in the Louvre were prepared for his reception, and he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], which later became part of the [[French Institute|Institut de France]] (1795). At the beginning of his residence in Paris he was seized with an attack of melancholy, and even the printed copy of his ''M\u00e9canique'' on which he had worked for a quarter of a century lay for more than two years unopened on his desk. Curiosity as to the results of the [[French revolution]] first stirred him out of his lethargy, a curiosity which soon turned to alarm as the revolution developed.\n\nIt was about the same time, 1792, that the unaccountable sadness of his life and his timidity moved the compassion of 24-year-old Ren\u00e9e-Fran\u00e7oise-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Le Monnier, daughter of his friend, the astronomer [[Pierre Charles Le Monnier]]. She insisted on marrying him, and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached.\n\nIn September 1793, the [[Reign of Terror]] began. Under intervention of Antoine [[Lavoisier]], who himself was by then already thrown out of the Academy along with many other scholars, Lagrange was specifically exempted by name in the decree of October 1793 that ordered all foreigners to leave France. On 4 May 1794, Lavoisier and 27 other [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] were arrested and sentenced to death and guillotined on the afternoon after the trial. Lagrange said on the death of Lavoisier:\n\n: ''It took only a moment to cause this head to fall and a hundred years will not suffice to produce its like.''<ref name=\"St Andrew\" />\n\nThough Lagrange had been preparing to escape from France while there was yet time, he was never in any danger; different revolutionary governments (and at a later time, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]) loaded him with honours and distinctions. This luckiness or safety may to some extent be due to his life attitude he expressed many years before: \"''I believe that, in general, one of the first principles of every wise man is to conform strictly to the laws of the country in which he is living, even when they are unreasonable''\".<ref name=\"St Andrew\" /> A striking testimony to the respect in which he was held was shown in 1796 when the French commissary in Italy was ordered to attend in full state on Lagrange's father, and tender the congratulations of the republic on the achievements of his son, who \"had done honor to all mankind by his genius, and whom it was the special glory of [[Piedmont]] to have produced.\" It may be added that Napoleon, when he attained power, warmly encouraged scientific studies in France, and was a liberal benefactor of them. Appointed [[S\u00e9nat conservateur|senator]] in 1799, he was the first signer of the [[S\u00e9natus-consulte]] which in 1802 annexed his fatherland Piedmont to France.<ref name=laei/> He acquired French citizenship in consequence.<ref name=laei/> The French claimed he was a French mathematician, but the Italians continued to claim him as Italian.''<ref name=\"St Andrew\" />\n\n==== Units of measurement ====\nLagrange was involved in the development [[metric system]] of measurement in the 1790s. He was offered the presidency of the Commission for the reform of weights and measures (''[[General Conference on Weights and Measures|la Commission des Poids et Mesures]]'') when he was preparing to escape. After Lavoisier's death in 1794, it was largely Lagrange who influenced the choice of the [[metre]] and [[kilogram]] units with [[decimal]] subdivision, by the commission of 1799.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Lagrange was also one of the founding members of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]] in 1795.\n\n==== \u00c9cole Normale ====\nIn 1795, Lagrange was appointed to a mathematical chair at the newly established [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure|\u00c9cole Normale]], which enjoyed only a brief existence of four months. His lectures there were quite elementary, and contain nothing of any special importance, but they were published because the professors had to \"pledge themselves to the representatives of the people and to each other neither to read nor to repeat from memory,\" and the discourses were ordered to be taken down in shorthand to enable the deputies to see how the professors acquitted themselves.\n\n==== \u00c9cole Polytechnique ====\nIn 1794, Lagrange was appointed professor of the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]]; and his lectures there, described by mathematicians who had the good fortune to be able to attend them, were almost perfect both in form and matter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation.\n\nBut Lagrange does not seem to have been a successful teacher. [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]], who attended his lectures in 1795, wrote:\n:his voice is very feeble, at least in that he does not become heated; he has a very marked Italian accent and pronounces the ''s'' like ''z'' [...] The students, of whom the majority are incapable of appreciating him, give him little welcome, but the ''professeurs'' make amends for it.<ref>Ivor Grattan-Guinness.

Napoleon honoured him with the Grand Croix of the Ordre Imp\u00e9rial de la R\u00e9union just two days before he died. He was buried that same year in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris. The inscription on his tomb reads in translation:<blockquote>JOSEPH LOUIS LAGRANGE. Senator. Count of the Empire. Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. Grand Cross of the Imperial [[Order of the Reunion]]. Member of the Institute and the Bureau of Longitude. Born in Turin on 25&nbsp;January 1736. Died in Paris on 10&nbsp;April 1813.</blockquote>\n\n==Work in Berlin==\nLagrange was extremely active scientifically during twenty years he spent in Berlin. Not only did he produce his ''M\u00e9canique analytique'', but he contributed between one and two hundred papers to the Academy of Turin, the Berlin Academy, and the French Academy. Some of these are really treatises, and all without exception are of a high order of excellence. Except for a short time when he was ill he produced on average about one paper a month. Of these, note the following as amongst the most important.\n\nFirst, his contributions to the fourth and fifth volumes, 1766\u20131773, of the ''Miscellanea Taurinensia''; of which the most important was the one in 1771, in which he discussed how numerous [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations should be combined so as to give the most probable result. And later, his contributions to the first two volumes, 1784\u20131785, of the transactions of the Turin Academy; to the first of which he contributed a paper on the pressure exerted by fluids in motion, and to the second an article on integration by [[infinite series]], and the kind of problems for which it is suitable.\n\nMost of the papers sent to Paris were on astronomical questions, and among these including his paper on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] system in 1766, his essay on the problem of three bodies in 1772, his work on the [[secular equation]] of the Moon in 1773, and his treatise on cometary perturbations in 1778. These were all written on subjects proposed by the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], and in each case the prize was awarded to him.\n\n===Lagrangian mechanics===\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}\nBetween 1772 and 1788, Lagrange re-formulated Classical/Newtonian mechanics to simplify formulas and ease calculations. These mechanics are called [[Lagrangian mechanics]].\n\n===Algebra===\nThe greater number of his papers during this time were, however, contributed to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. Several of them deal with questions in [[algebra]].\n\n*His discussion of representations of integers by [[quadratic form]]s (1769) and by more general algebraic forms (1770).\n*His tract on the [[Elimination theory|Theory of Elimination]], 1770.\n*[[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] that the order of a subgroup H of a group G must divide the order of G.\n*His papers of 1770 and 1771 on the general process for solving an [[algebraic equation]] of any degree via the ''[[Lagrange resolvents]]''. This method fails to give a general formula for solutions of an equation of degree five and higher, because the auxiliary equation involved has higher degree than the original one. The significance of this method is that it exhibits the already known formulas for solving equations of second, third, and fourth degrees as manifestations of a single principle, and was foundational in [[Galois theory]]. The complete solution of a binomial equation (namely an equation of the form <math>ax^n</math> \u00b1 <math>b=0</math>) is also treated in these papers.\n*In 1773, Lagrange considered a [[functional determinant]] of order 3, a special case of a [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]. He also proved the expression for the [[volume]] of a [[tetrahedron]] with one of the vertices at the origin as the one sixth of the [[absolute value]] of the [[determinant]] formed by the coordinates of the other three vertices.\n\n===Number theory===\nSeveral of his early papers also deal with questions of number theory.\n\n*Lagrange (1766\u20131769) was the first European to prove that [[Pell's equation]] {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''ny''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}} has a nontrivial solution in the integers for any non-square natural number {{mvar|n}}.<ref>[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=41029 ''\u0152uvres'', t.1, 671\u2013732]</ref>\n*He proved the theorem, stated by [[Bachet]] without justification, that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every positive integer is the sum of four squares]], 1770.\n*He proved [[Wilson's theorem]] that (for any integer {{math|''n'' > 1}}): {{mvar|n}} is a prime if and only if {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)! + 1}} is a multiple of {{mvar|n}}, 1771.\n*His papers of 1773, 1775, and 1777 gave demonstrations of several results enunciated by Fermat, and not previously proved.\n*His [[List of important publications in mathematics#Recherches d'Arithm\u00e9tique|Recherches d'Arithm\u00e9tique]] of 1775 developed a general theory of binary [[quadratic forms]] to handle the general problem of when an integer is representable by the form {{math|''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''by''<sup>2</sup> + ''cxy''}}.\n*He made contributions to the theory of [[continued fraction]]s.\n\n===Other mathematical work===\nThere are also numerous articles on various points of [[analytical geometry]]. In two of them, written rather later, in 1792 and 1793, he reduced the [[quadric|equations of the quadrics]] (or conicoids) to their [[canonical form]]s.\n\nDuring the years from 1772 to 1785, he contributed a long series of papers which created the science of [[partial differential equation]]s. A large part of these results were collected in the second edition of Euler's integral calculus which was published in 1794.\n\n===Astronomy===\nLastly, there are numerous papers on problems in [[astronomy]]. Of these the most important are the following:\n\n*Attempting to solve the [[three-body problem|general three-body problem]], with the consequent discovery of the two constant-pattern solutions, collinear and equilateral, 1772. Those solutions were later seen to explain what are now known as the [[Lagrangian point]]s. <!-- Read Lagrange's \"Essai\" before fiddling with this entry. -->\n*On the attraction of ellipsoids, 1773: this is founded on [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]]'s work.\n*On the secular equation of the Moon, 1773; also noticeable for the earliest introduction of the idea of the potential. The potential of a body at any point is the sum of the mass of every element of the body when divided by its distance from the point. Lagrange showed that if the potential of a body at an external point were known, the attraction in any direction could be at once found. The theory of the potential was elaborated in a paper sent to Berlin in 1777.\n*On the motion of the nodes of a planet's [[orbit]], 1774.\n*On the stability of the planetary orbits, 1776.\n*Two papers in which the method of determining the orbit of a [[comet]] from three observations is completely worked out, 1778 and 1783: this has not indeed proved practically available, but his system of calculating the perturbations by means of mechanical quadratures has formed the basis of most subsequent researches on the subject.\n*His determination of the secular and periodic variations of the [[orbital elements|elements]] of the planets, 1781\u20131784: the upper limits assigned for these agree closely with those obtained later by [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier]], and Lagrange proceeded as far as the knowledge then possessed of the masses of the planets permitted.\n*Three papers on the method of interpolation, 1783, 1792 and 1793: the part of finite differences dealing therewith is now in the same stage as that in which Lagrange left it.\n\n===Fundamental Treatise by Lagrange===\nOver and above these various papers he composed his fundamental treatise, the ''M\u00e9canique analytique''. \n\nIn this opera, he lays down the law of virtual work, and from that one fundamental principle, by the aid of the calculus of variations, deduces the whole of [[mechanics]], both of solids and fluids.\n\nThe object of the book is to show that the subject is implicitly included in a single principle, and to give general formulae from which any particular result can be obtained. The method of generalised co-ordinates by which he obtained this result is perhaps the most brilliant result of his analysis. Instead of following the motion of each individual part of a material system, as D'Alembert and Euler had done, he showed that, if we determine its configuration by a sufficient number of variables ''x'', called [[generalized coordinates]], whose number is the same as that of the degrees of freedom possessed by the system, then the kinetic and potential energies of the system can be expressed in terms of those variables, and the differential equations of motion thence deduced by simple differentiation. For example, in dynamics of a rigid system he replaces the consideration of the particular problem by the general equation, which is now usually written in the form\n\n:<math>\n  \\frac{d}{dt}\n  \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\n- \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\n+ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = 0,\n</math>\nwhere ''T'' represents the kinetic energy and ''V'' represents the potential energy of the system.\nHe then presented what we now know as the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]]\u2014though this is not the first time that method was published\u2014as a means to solve this equation.<ref>Marco Panza, \"The Origins of Analytic Mechanics in the 18th Century\", in Hans Niels Jahnke (editor), ''A History of Analysis'', 2003, p. 149</ref>\nAmongst other minor theorems here given it may suffice to mention the proposition that the kinetic energy imparted by the given impulses to a material system under given constraints is a maximum, and the [[principle of least action]]. All the analysis is so elegant that Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]] said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of [[pure mathematics]] analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, the time and the three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning to the end of the work there was not a single diagram. At first no printer could be found who would publish the book; but [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] at last persuaded a Paris firm to undertake it, and it was issued under the supervision of Laplace, Cousin, Legendre (editor) and Condorcet in 1788.<ref name=\"St Andrew\" />\n\n==Work in France==\n=== Differential calculus and calculus of variations ===\n\nLagrange's lectures on the [[differential calculus]] at \u00c9cole Polytechnique form the basis of his treatise ''Th\u00e9orie des fonctions analytiques'', which was published in 1797. This work is the extension of an idea contained in a paper he had sent to the Berlin papers in 1772, and its object is to substitute for the differential calculus a group of theorems based on the development of algebraic functions in series, relying in particular on the principle of the [[generality of algebra]].\n\nA somewhat similar method had been previously used by [[John Landen]] in the ''Residual Analysis'', published in London in 1758. Lagrange believed that he could thus get rid of those difficulties, connected with the use of infinitely large and infinitely small quantities, to which philosophers objected in the usual treatment of the differential calculus. The book is divided into three parts: of these, the first treats of the general theory of functions, and gives an algebraic proof of [[Taylor's theorem]], the validity of which is, however, open to question; the second deals with applications to geometry; and the third with applications to mechanics.\n\nAnother treatise on the same lines was his ''Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul des fonctions'', issued in 1804, with the second edition in 1806. It is in this book that Lagrange formulated his celebrated method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], in the context of problems of variational calculus with integral constraints. These works devoted to differential calculus and calculus of variations may be considered as the starting point for the researches of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]], and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]].\n\n===Infinitesimals===\nAt a later period Lagrange fully embraced the use of [[infinitesimal]]s in preference to founding the differential calculus on the study of algebraic forms; and in the preface to the second edition of the ''M\u00e9canique Analytique'', which was issued in 1811, he justifies the employment of infinitesimals, and concludes by saying that:\n\n: ''When we have grasped the spirit of the infinitesimal method, and have verified the exactness of its results either by the geometrical method of prime and ultimate ratios, or by the analytical method of derived functions, we may employ infinitely small quantities as a sure and valuable means of shortening and simplifying our proofs.''\n\n===Number theory===\nHis ''R\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations num\u00e9riques'', published in 1798, was also the fruit of his lectures at \u00c9cole Polytechnique. There he gives the method of approximating to the real roots of an equation by means of [[continued fraction]]s, and enunciates several other theorems. In a note at the end he shows how [[Fermat's little theorem]], that is\n\n: <math> a^{p-1}-1 \\equiv 0\\pmod p </math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is a prime and ''a'' is prime to ''p'', may be applied to give the complete algebraic solution of any binomial equation. He also here explains how the equation whose roots are the squares of the differences of the roots of the original equation may be used so as to give considerable information as to the position and nature of those roots.\n\n===Celestial mechanics===\nThe theory of the [[planetary motion]]s had formed the subject of some of the most remarkable of Lagrange's Berlin papers. In 1806 the subject was reopened by [[Sim\u00e9on Poisson|Poisson]], who, in a paper read before the French Academy, showed that Lagrange's formulae led to certain limits for the stability of the orbits. Lagrange, who was present, now discussed the whole subject afresh, and in a letter communicated to the Academy in 1808 explained how, by the variation of arbitrary constants, the periodical and secular inequalities of any system of mutually interacting bodies could be determined.\n\n==Prizes and distinctions==\nEuler proposed Lagrange for election to the Berlin Academy and he was elected on 2 September 1756. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1790, a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1806. In 1808, [[Napoleon]] made Lagrange a Grand Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]] and a [[Count of the Empire]]. He was awarded the Grand Croix of the [[Order of the Reunion|Ordre Imp\u00e9rial de la R\u00e9union]] in 1813, a week before his death in Paris.\n\nLagrange was awarded the 1764 prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] for his memoir on the [[libration]] of the Moon. In 1766 the Academy proposed a problem of the motion of the [[satellites of Jupiter]], and the prize again was awarded to Lagrange. He also shared or won the prizes of 1772, 1774, and 1778.\n\nLagrange is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 prominent French scientists]] who were commemorated on plaques at the first stage of the [[Eiffel Tower]] when it first opened. ''Rue Lagrange'' in the 5th Arrondissement in Paris is named after him. In Turin, the street where the house of his birth still stands is named ''via Lagrange''. The [[lunar crater]] [[Lagrange (crater)|Lagrange]] and the asteroid [[1006 Lagrangea]] also bear his name.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of things named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]\n*[[History of the metre]]\n*[[Seconds pendulum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\nThe initial version of this article was taken from the [[public domain]] resource ''[[Rouse History of Mathematics|A Short Account of the History of Mathematics]]'' (4th edition, 1908) by [[W.

He made significant contributions to the fields of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[number theory]], and both [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[celestial mechanics]].\n\nIn 1766, on the recommendation of Swiss [[Leonhard Euler]] and French [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin, [[Prussia]], where he stayed for over twenty years, producing volumes of work and winning several prizes of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. Lagrange's treatise on [[analytical mechanics]] (''[[M\u00e9canique analytique]]'', 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1788\u201389), written in Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to Paris and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He remained in France until the end of his life. He was significantly involved in the [[History of the metric system|decimalisation]] in [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]], became the first professor of analysis at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] upon its opening in 1794, was a founding member of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]], and became [[S\u00e9nat conservateur|Senator]] in 1799.\n\n==Scientific contribution==\nLagrange was one of the creators of the [[calculus of variations]], deriving the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s for extrema of [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]]. He extended the method to include possible constraints, arriving at the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]].\nLagrange invented the method of solving [[differential equation]]s known as [[method of variation of parameters|variation of parameters]], applied [[differential calculus]] to the [[probability theory|theory of probabilities]] and worked on solutions for [[algebraic equations]]. He proved that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every natural number is a sum of four squares]]. His treatise ''Theorie des fonctions analytiques'' laid some of the foundations of [[group theory]], anticipating [[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]]. In [[calculus]], Lagrange developed a novel approach to [[Lagrange interpolation|interpolation]] and [[Taylor series]]. He studied the [[three-body problem]] for the Earth, Sun and Moon (1764) and the movement of Jupiter's satellites (1766), and in 1772 found the special-case solutions to this problem that yield what are now known as [[Lagrangian point]]s. Lagrange is best known for transforming [[Newtonian mechanics]] into a branch of analysis, [[Lagrangian mechanics]], and presented the mechanical \"principles\" as simple results of the variational calculus.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote box |align=right |width=20% |quote=\n\nIn appearance he was of medium height, and slightly formed, with pale blue eyes and a colourless complexion. In character he was nervous and timid, he detested controversy, and to avoid it willingly allowed others to take the credit for what he had himself done. \n \nHe always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote them straight off without a single erasure or correction.\n\n[[W.W.

His paternal great-grandfather was a French army officer who had moved to Turin, the ''de facto'' capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] at Lagrange's time, and married an Italian; so did his grandfather and his father. His mother was from the countryside of [[Turin]].<ref name=\"St Andrew\">[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lagrange.html Lagrange] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325121637/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lagrange.html |date=25 March 2007 }} St. Andrew University</ref> He was raised as a Roman Catholic (but later on became an [[agnostic]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematics and the Search for Knowledge|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504230-6|author=Morris Kline|page=214|quote=Lagrange and Laplace, though of Catholic parentage, were agnostics.}}</ref>\n\nHis father, who had charge of the [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|king's]] military chest and was Treasurer of the Office of Public Works and Fortifications in Turin, should have maintained a good social position and wealth, but before his son grew up he had lost most of his property in speculations. A career as a lawyer was planned out for Lagrange by his father, and certainly Lagrange seems to have accepted this willingly. He studied at the [[University of Turin]] and his favourite subject was classical Latin. At first he had no great enthusiasm for mathematics, finding Greek geometry rather dull.\n\nIt was not until he was seventeen that he showed any taste for mathematics \u2013 his interest in the subject being first excited by a paper by [[Edmond Halley]] which he came across by accident. Alone and unaided he threw himself into mathematical studies; at the end of a year's incessant toil he was already an accomplished mathematician. [[Charles Emmanuel III]] appointed Lagrange to serve as the \"Sostituto del Maestro di Matematica\" (mathematics assistant professor) at the Royal Military Academy of the Theory and Practice of Artillery in 1755, where he taught courses in calculus and mechanics to support the Piedmontese army's early adoption of the ballistics theories of [[Benjamin Robins]] and [[Leonhard Euler]].  In that capacity, Lagrange was the first to teach calculus in an engineering school.  According to [[:it:Alessandro Vittorio Papacino D'Antoni|Alessandro Papacino D'Antoni]], the academy's military commander and famous artillery theorist, Lagrange unfortunately proved to be a problematic professor with his oblivious teaching style, abstract reasoning, and impatience with artillery and fortification-engineering applications.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Brett|title=The Heirs of Archimedes: Science and the Art of War through the Age of Enlightenment|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-262-19516-X|pages=368, 375|authorlink=Military 'Progress' and Newtonian Science|editor=Brett Steele |editor2=Tamera Dorland|chapter=13}}</ref> In this Academy one of his students was [[Fran\u00e7ois Daviet de Foncenex|Fran\u00e7ois Daviet]].<ref>{{cite book | last = de Andrade Martins | first = Roberto | chapter = A busca da Ci\u00eancia ''a priori'' no final do Seculo XVIII e a origem da An\u00e1lise dimensional | editor= Roberto de Andrade Martins |editor2=Lilian Al-Chueyr Pereira Martins |editor3=Cibelle Celestino Silva |editor4=Juliana Mesquita Hidalgo Ferreira| title = Filosofia E Historia Da Ci\u00eancia No Cone Sul. 3 Encontro | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yiuwanC2NlYC | date = 2008 | publisher = AFHIC | page = 406 | isbn = 978-1-4357-1633-9|language=pt}}</ref>\n\n==== Variational calculus ====\nLagrange is one of the founders of the [[calculus of variations]]. Starting in 1754, he worked on the problem of [[tautochrone]], discovering a method of maximising and minimising functionals in a way similar to finding extrema of functions. Lagrange wrote several letters to [[Leonhard Euler]] between 1754 and 1756 describing his results. He outlined his \"\u03b4-algorithm\", leading to the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s of variational calculus and considerably simplifying Euler's earlier analysis.<ref>Although some authors speak of general method of solving \"[[isoperimetric]] problems\", the eighteenth century meaning of this expression amounts to \"problems in variational calculus\", reserving the adjective \"relative\" for problems with isoperimetric-type constraints. The celebrated method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], which applies to optimization of functions of several variables subject to constraints, did not appear until much later. See {{cite journal | last = Fraser | first = Craig | title = Isoperimetric Problems in the Variational Calculus of Euler and Lagrange | journal = Historia Mathematica | volume = 19 | pages = 4\u201323 |year = 1992 | doi = 10.1016/0315-0860(92)90052-D }}</ref> Lagrange also applied his ideas to problems of classical mechanics, generalising the results of Euler and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]].\n\nEuler was very impressed with Lagrange's results. It has been stated that \"with characteristic courtesy he withheld a paper he had previously written, which covered some of the same ground, in order that the young Italian might have time to complete his work, and claim the undisputed invention of the new calculus\"; however, this chivalric view has been disputed.<ref>Galletto, D., ''The genesis of M\u00e9canique analytique'', La M\u00e9canique analytique de Lagrange et son h\u00e9ritage, II (Turin, 1989). Atti Accad. Sci. Torino Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Natur. 126 (1992), suppl. 2, 277\u2013370, {{MathSciNet|id=1264671}}.</ref> Lagrange published his method in two memoirs of the Turin Society in 1762 and 1773.\n\n==== ''Miscellanea Taurinensia'' ====\nIn 1758, with the aid of his pupils (mainly with Daviet), Lagrange established a society, which was subsequently incorporated as the [[Turin Academy of Sciences]], and most of his early writings are to be found in the five volumes of its transactions, usually known as the ''Miscellanea Taurinensia''. Many of these are elaborate papers. The first volume contains a paper on the theory of the propagation of sound; in this he indicates a mistake made by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], obtains the general [[differential equation]] for the motion, and integrates it for motion in a straight line. This volume also contains the complete solution of the problem of a [[vibrating string|string vibrating transversely]]; in this paper he points out a lack of generality in the solutions previously given by [[Brook Taylor]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]], and Euler, and arrives at the conclusion that the form of the curve at any time ''t'' is given by the equation <math>y = a \\sin (mx) \\sin (nt)\\,</math>. The article concludes with a masterly discussion of [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]es, [[beat (acoustics)|beat]]s, and compound sounds. Other articles in this volume are on [[recurrence relation|recurring]] [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[probability|probabilities]], and the [[calculus of variations]].\n\nThe second volume contains a long paper embodying the results of several papers in the first volume on the theory and notation of the calculus of variations; and he illustrates its use by deducing the [[principle of least action]], and by solutions of various problems in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]].\n\nThe third volume includes the solution of several dynamical problems by means of the calculus of variations; some papers on the [[integral calculus]]; a solution of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]'s problem mentioned above: given an integer ''n'' which is not a [[square number|perfect square]], to find a number ''x'' such that ''x''<sup>2</sup>''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is a perfect square; and the general differential equations of [[N-body problem|motion for three bodies]] moving under their mutual attractions.\n\nThe next work he produced was in 1764 on the [[libration]] of the Moon, and an explanation as to why the same face was always turned to the earth, a problem which he treated by the aid of [[virtual work]]. His solution is especially interesting as containing the germ of the idea of generalised equations of motion, equations which he first formally proved in 1780.\n\n=== Berlin ===\nAlready by 1756, [[Euler]] and [[Maupertuis]], seeing his mathematical talent, tried to persuade him to come to Berlin, but Lagrange shyly refused the offer. In 1765, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] interceded on Lagrange's behalf with [[Frederick the Great|Frederick of Prussia]] and by letter, asked him to leave Turin for a considerably more prestigious position in Berlin. He again turned down the offer, responding that<ref name=\"Vinter2000\">{{cite book|author=Richard B. Vinter|title=Optimal Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PY9xscfbfiYC|date=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-8176-4075-0}}</ref>{{rp|361}}\n: ''It seems to me that Berlin would not be at all suitable for me while M.Euler is there''.\n\nIn 1766, after Euler left Berlin for [[Saint Petersburg]], Frederick himself wrote to Lagrange expressing the wish of \"the greatest king in Europe\" to have \"the greatest mathematician in Europe\" resident at his court. Lagrange was finally persuaded and he spent the next twenty years in [[Prussia]], where he produced a long series of papers published in the Berlin and Turin transactions, and composed his monumental work, the ''M\u00e9canique analytique''. In 1767, he married his cousin Vittoria Conti.\n\nLagrange was a favourite of the king, who frequently lectured him on the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson was accepted, and Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and experimented to find the exact amount of work which he could do before exhaustion. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He carefully planned his papers before writing them, usually without a single erasure or correction.\n\nNonetheless, during his years in Berlin, Lagrange's health was rather poor, and that of his wife Vittoria was even worse. She died in 1783 after years of illness and Lagrange was very depressed. In 1786, Frederick II died, and the climate of Berlin became difficult for Lagrange.<ref name=\"St Andrew\" />\n\n=== Paris ===\nIn 1786, following Frederick's death, Lagrange received similar invitations from states including Spain and [[Naples]], and he accepted the offer of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to move to Paris. In France he was received with every mark of distinction and special apartments in the Louvre were prepared for his reception, and he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], which later became part of the [[French Institute|Institut de France]] (1795). At the beginning of his residence in Paris he was seized with an attack of melancholy, and even the printed copy of his ''M\u00e9canique'' on which he had worked for a quarter of a century lay for more than two years unopened on his desk. Curiosity as to the results of the [[French revolution]] first stirred him out of his lethargy, a curiosity which soon turned to alarm as the revolution developed.\n\nIt was about the same time, 1792, that the unaccountable sadness of his life and his timidity moved the compassion of 24-year-old Ren\u00e9e-Fran\u00e7oise-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Le Monnier, daughter of his friend, the astronomer [[Pierre Charles Le Monnier]]. She insisted on marrying him, and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached.\n\nIn September 1793, the [[Reign of Terror]] began. Under intervention of Antoine [[Lavoisier]], who himself was by then already thrown out of the Academy along with many other scholars, Lagrange was specifically exempted by name in the decree of October 1793 that ordered all foreigners to leave France. On 4 May 1794, Lavoisier and 27 other [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] were arrested and sentenced to death and guillotined on the afternoon after the trial. Lagrange said on the death of Lavoisier:\n\n: ''It took only a moment to cause this head to fall and a hundred years will not suffice to produce its like.''<ref name=\"St Andrew\" />\n\nThough Lagrange had been preparing to escape from France while there was yet time, he was never in any danger; different revolutionary governments (and at a later time, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]) loaded him with honours and distinctions. This luckiness or safety may to some extent be due to his life attitude he expressed many years before: \"''I believe that, in general, one of the first principles of every wise man is to conform strictly to the laws of the country in which he is living, even when they are unreasonable''\".<ref name=\"St Andrew\" /> A striking testimony to the respect in which he was held was shown in 1796 when the French commissary in Italy was ordered to attend in full state on Lagrange's father, and tender the congratulations of the republic on the achievements of his son, who \"had done honor to all mankind by his genius, and whom it was the special glory of [[Piedmont]] to have produced.\" It may be added that Napoleon, when he attained power, warmly encouraged scientific studies in France, and was a liberal benefactor of them. Appointed [[S\u00e9nat conservateur|senator]] in 1799, he was the first signer of the [[S\u00e9natus-consulte]] which in 1802 annexed his fatherland Piedmont to France.<ref name=laei/> He acquired French citizenship in consequence.<ref name=laei/> The French claimed he was a French mathematician, but the Italians continued to claim him as Italian.''<ref name=\"St Andrew\" />\n\n==== Units of measurement ====\nLagrange was involved in the development [[metric system]] of measurement in the 1790s. He was offered the presidency of the Commission for the reform of weights and measures (''[[General Conference on Weights and Measures|la Commission des Poids et Mesures]]'') when he was preparing to escape. After Lavoisier's death in 1794, it was largely Lagrange who influenced the choice of the [[metre]] and [[kilogram]] units with [[decimal]] subdivision, by the commission of 1799.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Lagrange was also one of the founding members of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]] in 1795.\n\n==== \u00c9cole Normale ====\nIn 1795, Lagrange was appointed to a mathematical chair at the newly established [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure|\u00c9cole Normale]], which enjoyed only a brief existence of four months. His lectures there were quite elementary, and contain nothing of any special importance, but they were published because the professors had to \"pledge themselves to the representatives of the people and to each other neither to read nor to repeat from memory,\" and the discourses were ordered to be taken down in shorthand to enable the deputies to see how the professors acquitted themselves.\n\n==== \u00c9cole Polytechnique ====\nIn 1794, Lagrange was appointed professor of the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]]; and his lectures there, described by mathematicians who had the good fortune to be able to attend them, were almost perfect both in form and matter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation.\n\nBut Lagrange does not seem to have been a successful teacher. [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]], who attended his lectures in 1795, wrote:\n:his voice is very feeble, at least in that he does not become heated; he has a very marked Italian accent and pronounces the ''s'' like ''z'' [...] The students, of whom the majority are incapable of appreciating him, give him little welcome, but the ''professeurs'' make amends for it.<ref>Ivor Grattan-Guinness.

Napoleon honoured him with the Grand Croix of the Ordre Imp\u00e9rial de la R\u00e9union just two days before he died. He was buried that same year in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris. The inscription on his tomb reads in translation:<blockquote>JOSEPH LOUIS LAGRANGE. Senator. Count of the Empire. Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. Grand Cross of the Imperial [[Order of the Reunion]]. Member of the Institute and the Bureau of Longitude. Born in Turin on 25&nbsp;January 1736. Died in Paris on 10&nbsp;April 1813.</blockquote>\n\n==Work in Berlin==\nLagrange was extremely active scientifically during twenty years he spent in Berlin. Not only did he produce his ''M\u00e9canique analytique'', but he contributed between one and two hundred papers to the Academy of Turin, the Berlin Academy, and the French Academy. Some of these are really treatises, and all without exception are of a high order of excellence. Except for a short time when he was ill he produced on average about one paper a month. Of these, note the following as amongst the most important.\n\nFirst, his contributions to the fourth and fifth volumes, 1766\u20131773, of the ''Miscellanea Taurinensia''; of which the most important was the one in 1771, in which he discussed how numerous [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations should be combined so as to give the most probable result. And later, his contributions to the first two volumes, 1784\u20131785, of the transactions of the Turin Academy; to the first of which he contributed a paper on the pressure exerted by fluids in motion, and to the second an article on integration by [[infinite series]], and the kind of problems for which it is suitable.\n\nMost of the papers sent to Paris were on astronomical questions, and among these including his paper on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] system in 1766, his essay on the problem of three bodies in 1772, his work on the [[secular equation]] of the Moon in 1773, and his treatise on cometary perturbations in 1778. These were all written on subjects proposed by the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], and in each case the prize was awarded to him.\n\n===Lagrangian mechanics===\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}\nBetween 1772 and 1788, Lagrange re-formulated Classical/Newtonian mechanics to simplify formulas and ease calculations. These mechanics are called [[Lagrangian mechanics]].\n\n===Algebra===\nThe greater number of his papers during this time were, however, contributed to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. Several of them deal with questions in [[algebra]].\n\n*His discussion of representations of integers by [[quadratic form]]s (1769) and by more general algebraic forms (1770).\n*His tract on the [[Elimination theory|Theory of Elimination]], 1770.\n*[[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] that the order of a subgroup H of a group G must divide the order of G.\n*His papers of 1770 and 1771 on the general process for solving an [[algebraic equation]] of any degree via the ''[[Lagrange resolvents]]''. This method fails to give a general formula for solutions of an equation of degree five and higher, because the auxiliary equation involved has higher degree than the original one. The significance of this method is that it exhibits the already known formulas for solving equations of second, third, and fourth degrees as manifestations of a single principle, and was foundational in [[Galois theory]]. The complete solution of a binomial equation (namely an equation of the form <math>ax^n</math> \u00b1 <math>b=0</math>) is also treated in these papers.\n*In 1773, Lagrange considered a [[functional determinant]] of order 3, a special case of a [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]. He also proved the expression for the [[volume]] of a [[tetrahedron]] with one of the vertices at the origin as the one sixth of the [[absolute value]] of the [[determinant]] formed by the coordinates of the other three vertices.\n\n===Number theory===\nSeveral of his early papers also deal with questions of number theory.\n\n*Lagrange (1766\u20131769) was the first European to prove that [[Pell's equation]] {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''ny''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}} has a nontrivial solution in the integers for any non-square natural number {{mvar|n}}.<ref>[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=41029 ''\u0152uvres'', t.1, 671\u2013732]</ref>\n*He proved the theorem, stated by [[Bachet]] without justification, that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every positive integer is the sum of four squares]], 1770.\n*He proved [[Wilson's theorem]] that (for any integer {{math|''n'' > 1}}): {{mvar|n}} is a prime if and only if {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)! + 1}} is a multiple of {{mvar|n}}, 1771.\n*His papers of 1773, 1775, and 1777 gave demonstrations of several results enunciated by Fermat, and not previously proved.\n*His [[List of important publications in mathematics#Recherches d'Arithm\u00e9tique|Recherches d'Arithm\u00e9tique]] of 1775 developed a general theory of binary [[quadratic forms]] to handle the general problem of when an integer is representable by the form {{math|''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''by''<sup>2</sup> + ''cxy''}}.\n*He made contributions to the theory of [[continued fraction]]s.\n\n===Other mathematical work===\nThere are also numerous articles on various points of [[analytical geometry]]. In two of them, written rather later, in 1792 and 1793, he reduced the [[quadric|equations of the quadrics]] (or conicoids) to their [[canonical form]]s.\n\nDuring the years from 1772 to 1785, he contributed a long series of papers which created the science of [[partial differential equation]]s. A large part of these results were collected in the second edition of Euler's integral calculus which was published in 1794.\n\n===Astronomy===\nLastly, there are numerous papers on problems in [[astronomy]]. Of these the most important are the following:\n\n*Attempting to solve the [[three-body problem|general three-body problem]], with the consequent discovery of the two constant-pattern solutions, collinear and equilateral, 1772. Those solutions were later seen to explain what are now known as the [[Lagrangian point]]s. <!-- Read Lagrange's \"Essai\" before fiddling with this entry. -->\n*On the attraction of ellipsoids, 1773: this is founded on [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]]'s work.\n*On the secular equation of the Moon, 1773; also noticeable for the earliest introduction of the idea of the potential. The potential of a body at any point is the sum of the mass of every element of the body when divided by its distance from the point. Lagrange showed that if the potential of a body at an external point were known, the attraction in any direction could be at once found. The theory of the potential was elaborated in a paper sent to Berlin in 1777.\n*On the motion of the nodes of a planet's [[orbit]], 1774.\n*On the stability of the planetary orbits, 1776.\n*Two papers in which the method of determining the orbit of a [[comet]] from three observations is completely worked out, 1778 and 1783: this has not indeed proved practically available, but his system of calculating the perturbations by means of mechanical quadratures has formed the basis of most subsequent researches on the subject.\n*His determination of the secular and periodic variations of the [[orbital elements|elements]] of the planets, 1781\u20131784: the upper limits assigned for these agree closely with those obtained later by [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier]], and Lagrange proceeded as far as the knowledge then possessed of the masses of the planets permitted.\n*Three papers on the method of interpolation, 1783, 1792 and 1793: the part of finite differences dealing therewith is now in the same stage as that in which Lagrange left it.\n\n===Fundamental Treatise by Lagrange===\nOver and above these various papers he composed his fundamental treatise, the ''M\u00e9canique analytique''. \n\nIn this opera, he lays down the law of virtual work, and from that one fundamental principle, by the aid of the calculus of variations, deduces the whole of [[mechanics]], both of solids and fluids.\n\nThe object of the book is to show that the subject is implicitly included in a single principle, and to give general formulae from which any particular result can be obtained. The method of generalised co-ordinates by which he obtained this result is perhaps the most brilliant result of his analysis. Instead of following the motion of each individual part of a material system, as D'Alembert and Euler had done, he showed that, if we determine its configuration by a sufficient number of variables ''x'', called [[generalized coordinates]], whose number is the same as that of the degrees of freedom possessed by the system, then the kinetic and potential energies of the system can be expressed in terms of those variables, and the differential equations of motion thence deduced by simple differentiation. For example, in dynamics of a rigid system he replaces the consideration of the particular problem by the general equation, which is now usually written in the form\n\n:<math>\n  \\frac{d}{dt}\n  \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\n- \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\n+ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = 0,\n</math>\nwhere ''T'' represents the kinetic energy and ''V'' represents the potential energy of the system.\nHe then presented what we now know as the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]]\u2014though this is not the first time that method was published\u2014as a means to solve this equation.<ref>Marco Panza, \"The Origins of Analytic Mechanics in the 18th Century\", in Hans Niels Jahnke (editor), ''A History of Analysis'', 2003, p. 149</ref>\nAmongst other minor theorems here given it may suffice to mention the proposition that the kinetic energy imparted by the given impulses to a material system under given constraints is a maximum, and the [[principle of least action]]. All the analysis is so elegant that Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]] said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of [[pure mathematics]] analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, the time and the three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning to the end of the work there was not a single diagram. At first no printer could be found who would publish the book; but [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] at last persuaded a Paris firm to undertake it, and it was issued under the supervision of Laplace, Cousin, Legendre (editor) and Condorcet in 1788.<ref name=\"St Andrew\" />\n\n==Work in France==\n=== Differential calculus and calculus of variations ===\n\nLagrange's lectures on the [[differential calculus]] at \u00c9cole Polytechnique form the basis of his treatise ''Th\u00e9orie des fonctions analytiques'', which was published in 1797. This work is the extension of an idea contained in a paper he had sent to the Berlin papers in 1772, and its object is to substitute for the differential calculus a group of theorems based on the development of algebraic functions in series, relying in particular on the principle of the [[generality of algebra]].\n\nA somewhat similar method had been previously used by [[John Landen]] in the ''Residual Analysis'', published in London in 1758. Lagrange believed that he could thus get rid of those difficulties, connected with the use of infinitely large and infinitely small quantities, to which philosophers objected in the usual treatment of the differential calculus. The book is divided into three parts: of these, the first treats of the general theory of functions, and gives an algebraic proof of [[Taylor's theorem]], the validity of which is, however, open to question; the second deals with applications to geometry; and the third with applications to mechanics.\n\nAnother treatise on the same lines was his ''Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul des fonctions'', issued in 1804, with the second edition in 1806. It is in this book that Lagrange formulated his celebrated method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], in the context of problems of variational calculus with integral constraints. These works devoted to differential calculus and calculus of variations may be considered as the starting point for the researches of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]], and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]].\n\n===Infinitesimals===\nAt a later period Lagrange fully embraced the use of [[infinitesimal]]s in preference to founding the differential calculus on the study of algebraic forms; and in the preface to the second edition of the ''M\u00e9canique Analytique'', which was issued in 1811, he justifies the employment of infinitesimals, and concludes by saying that:\n\n: ''When we have grasped the spirit of the infinitesimal method, and have verified the exactness of its results either by the geometrical method of prime and ultimate ratios, or by the analytical method of derived functions, we may employ infinitely small quantities as a sure and valuable means of shortening and simplifying our proofs.''\n\n===Number theory===\nHis ''R\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations num\u00e9riques'', published in 1798, was also the fruit of his lectures at \u00c9cole Polytechnique. There he gives the method of approximating to the real roots of an equation by means of [[continued fraction]]s, and enunciates several other theorems. In a note at the end he shows how [[Fermat's little theorem]], that is\n\n: <math> a^{p-1}-1 \\equiv 0\\pmod p </math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is a prime and ''a'' is prime to ''p'', may be applied to give the complete algebraic solution of any binomial equation. He also here explains how the equation whose roots are the squares of the differences of the roots of the original equation may be used so as to give considerable information as to the position and nature of those roots.\n\n===Celestial mechanics===\nThe theory of the [[planetary motion]]s had formed the subject of some of the most remarkable of Lagrange's Berlin papers. In 1806 the subject was reopened by [[Sim\u00e9on Poisson|Poisson]], who, in a paper read before the French Academy, showed that Lagrange's formulae led to certain limits for the stability of the orbits. Lagrange, who was present, now discussed the whole subject afresh, and in a letter communicated to the Academy in 1808 explained how, by the variation of arbitrary constants, the periodical and secular inequalities of any system of mutually interacting bodies could be determined.\n\n==Prizes and distinctions==\nEuler proposed Lagrange for election to the Berlin Academy and he was elected on 2 September 1756. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1790, a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1806. In 1808, [[Napoleon]] made Lagrange a Grand Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]] and a [[Count of the Empire]]. He was awarded the Grand Croix of the [[Order of the Reunion|Ordre Imp\u00e9rial de la R\u00e9union]] in 1813, a week before his death in Paris.\n\nLagrange was awarded the 1764 prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] for his memoir on the [[libration]] of the Moon. In 1766 the Academy proposed a problem of the motion of the [[satellites of Jupiter]], and the prize again was awarded to Lagrange. He also shared or won the prizes of 1772, 1774, and 1778.\n\nLagrange is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 prominent French scientists]] who were commemorated on plaques at the first stage of the [[Eiffel Tower]] when it first opened. ''Rue Lagrange'' in the 5th Arrondissement in Paris is named after him. In Turin, the street where the house of his birth still stands is named ''via Lagrange''. The [[lunar crater]] [[Lagrange (crater)|Lagrange]] and the asteroid [[1006 Lagrangea]] also bear his name.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of things named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]\n*[[History of the metre]]\n*[[Seconds pendulum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\nThe initial version of this article was taken from the [[public domain]] resource ''[[Rouse History of Mathematics|A Short Account of the History of Mathematics]]'' (4th edition, 1908) by [[W.

Originally published in 1942, it remains one of the most-read English-language versions of the novel. The translation also won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] in 1942.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Main|Journey to the West}}\nAt the outset of the novel, [[Buddha]] seeks a pilgrim who will travel to India. The hope is to retrieve sacred scriptures by which the Chinese people may be enlightened so that their behaviour may accord with the tenets of [[Buddhism]]. The young monk [[Tang Sanzang|Tripitaka]] volunteers to undertake the pilgrimage. Along the way, he encounters and frees the Monkey King, and he and [[Sun Wukong|Monkey]] thereafter recruit [[Zhu Bajie|Pigsy]] and [[Sha Wujing|Sandy]]. They liberate a captive princess and punish her abductor, who has also murdered her father. The father is resurrected and reinstalled as king. They meet several [[bodhisattva]]s and fight fierce monsters, before finally arriving at Buddha's palace.\n\n==Translation==\n[[Arthur Waley]]'s abridged translation was published in 1942, and has also been published as ''Adventures of the Monkey God''; and ''Monkey: [A] Folk Novel of China'' and ''The Adventures of Monkey'', and in a further abridged version for children, ''Dear Monkey''.<ref>Amazon.com, [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_19?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=arthur+waley+monkey&sprefix=Arthur+Waley+monkey%2Caps%2C483 Books by Arthur Waley].</ref> Whereas previous abridged versions of ''Journey to the West'' retained the original number of chapters but reduced their length significantly, Waley adopted the opposite approach; he translated only 30 chapters out of 100 episodes, but did so nearly in full, omitting mainly the poetry. He is also responsible for inventing the names of the main characters: [[Sun Wukong]] as \"Monkey\", [[Tang Sanzang]] as \"[[Tripitaka]]\", [[Zhu Bajie]] as \"Pigsy\", and [[Sha Wujing]] as \"Sandy\".<ref name=Monkey>Wu Ch'\u00eang-\u00ean. ''Monkey.'' Arthur Waley (trans.). London: Penguin Books, 1961.</ref>\n\n''Journey to the West'' may be roughly divided into three parts: first, the introduction including the origin of Monkey, Tripitaka, Pigsy, and Sandy; second, the actual journey to the west, which has an episodic nature; and last, the ending, telling what happens when the pilgrims reach their destination. Waley chose to translate the entirety of the introductory and ending chapters, as well as three episodes, each several chapters long, of the journey to the west.\n\n==Influence==\nWaley's translation was for many years the most popular translation of ''Journey to the West'' available in the English language and therefore cited by Western scholars of [[Chinese literature]] and appreciated by Western readers. The British poet [[Edith Sitwell]] characterized ''Monkey'' as \"a masterpiece of right sound\", one that was \"absence of shadow, like the clearance and directness of Monkey's mind.\"<ref name=NYT>David Lattimore, [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/books/the-complete-monkey.html?pagewanted=all 'The Complete Monkey'], The New York Times, 6 March 1983.</ref>  Professor of Chinese literature David Lattimore described it as a \"minor landmark of 20th-century English translation\", though adding that it had been overtaken as the most authoritative English edition with the publication of [[Anthony C. Yu]]'s four-volumes, unabridged translation published in the late 1970s and early 80s by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. Lattimore also doubts that Wu Cheng'en can safely be identified as the author.<ref name=NYT/> Elaine Yee Lin Ho in her study of the British writer [[Timothy Mo]] says ''Monkey'' remains \"the most popular and textually accessible translation\" of ''Journey to the West''.<ref>Elaine Yee Lin Ho, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoZzauqXqFIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Timothy Mo\"], (New York, NY:Manchester University Press, 2000), p. 154.</ref>\n\nThe literary scholar [[Andrew H. Plaks]] has voiced reservations. Waley's \"brilliant translation,\" he points out, not only shortened the work, but \"through its selection of episodes gave rise to the misleading impression that this is essentially a compendium of popular materials marked by folk wit and humor.\" In this, Waley consciously followed the interpretation put forth earlier in the century by the scholar [[Hu Shih]], who wrote an introduction to the 1943 edition of Waley's book. Hu scorned the allegorical interpretations of the novel as old-fashioned and instead insisted that the stories were simply comic. Hu Shih's interpretation reflected the popular reading of the novel, but does not account for the levels of meaning and the allegorical framework which scholars in China and the west have shown to be an important part of the late Ming text.<ref>\"The Journey to the West,\" in Barbara Stoler Miller.

The hope is to retrieve sacred scriptures by which the Chinese people may be enlightened so that their behaviour may accord with the tenets of [[Buddhism]]. The young monk [[Tang Sanzang|Tripitaka]] volunteers to undertake the pilgrimage. Along the way, he encounters and frees the Monkey King, and he and [[Sun Wukong|Monkey]] thereafter recruit [[Zhu Bajie|Pigsy]] and [[Sha Wujing|Sandy]]. They liberate a captive princess and punish her abductor, who has also murdered her father. The father is resurrected and reinstalled as king. They meet several [[bodhisattva]]s and fight fierce monsters, before finally arriving at Buddha's palace.\n\n==Translation==\n[[Arthur Waley]]'s abridged translation was published in 1942, and has also been published as ''Adventures of the Monkey God''; and ''Monkey: [A] Folk Novel of China'' and ''The Adventures of Monkey'', and in a further abridged version for children, ''Dear Monkey''.<ref>Amazon.com, [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_19?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=arthur+waley+monkey&sprefix=Arthur+Waley+monkey%2Caps%2C483 Books by Arthur Waley].</ref> Whereas previous abridged versions of ''Journey to the West'' retained the original number of chapters but reduced their length significantly, Waley adopted the opposite approach; he translated only 30 chapters out of 100 episodes, but did so nearly in full, omitting mainly the poetry. He is also responsible for inventing the names of the main characters: [[Sun Wukong]] as \"Monkey\", [[Tang Sanzang]] as \"[[Tripitaka]]\", [[Zhu Bajie]] as \"Pigsy\", and [[Sha Wujing]] as \"Sandy\".<ref name=Monkey>Wu Ch'\u00eang-\u00ean. ''Monkey.'' Arthur Waley (trans.). London: Penguin Books, 1961.</ref>\n\n''Journey to the West'' may be roughly divided into three parts: first, the introduction including the origin of Monkey, Tripitaka, Pigsy, and Sandy; second, the actual journey to the west, which has an episodic nature; and last, the ending, telling what happens when the pilgrims reach their destination. Waley chose to translate the entirety of the introductory and ending chapters, as well as three episodes, each several chapters long, of the journey to the west.\n\n==Influence==\nWaley's translation was for many years the most popular translation of ''Journey to the West'' available in the English language and therefore cited by Western scholars of [[Chinese literature]] and appreciated by Western readers. The British poet [[Edith Sitwell]] characterized ''Monkey'' as \"a masterpiece of right sound\", one that was \"absence of shadow, like the clearance and directness of Monkey's mind.\"<ref name=NYT>David Lattimore, [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/books/the-complete-monkey.html?pagewanted=all 'The Complete Monkey'], The New York Times, 6 March 1983.</ref>  Professor of Chinese literature David Lattimore described it as a \"minor landmark of 20th-century English translation\", though adding that it had been overtaken as the most authoritative English edition with the publication of [[Anthony C. Yu]]'s four-volumes, unabridged translation published in the late 1970s and early 80s by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. Lattimore also doubts that Wu Cheng'en can safely be identified as the author.<ref name=NYT/> Elaine Yee Lin Ho in her study of the British writer [[Timothy Mo]] says ''Monkey'' remains \"the most popular and textually accessible translation\" of ''Journey to the West''.<ref>Elaine Yee Lin Ho, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoZzauqXqFIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Timothy Mo\"], (New York, NY:Manchester University Press, 2000), p. 154.</ref>\n\nThe literary scholar [[Andrew H. Plaks]] has voiced reservations. Waley's \"brilliant translation,\" he points out, not only shortened the work, but \"through its selection of episodes gave rise to the misleading impression that this is essentially a compendium of popular materials marked by folk wit and humor.\" In this, Waley consciously followed the interpretation put forth earlier in the century by the scholar [[Hu Shih]], who wrote an introduction to the 1943 edition of Waley's book. Hu scorned the allegorical interpretations of the novel as old-fashioned and instead insisted that the stories were simply comic. Hu Shih's interpretation reflected the popular reading of the novel, but does not account for the levels of meaning and the allegorical framework which scholars in China and the west have shown to be an important part of the late Ming text.<ref>\"The Journey to the West,\" in Barbara Stoler Miller.

Sharpe, 1994 {{ISBN|1563242575}}), pp. 274-275</ref>\n\nWaley's translation was also in its turn re-translated into other languages, e.&nbsp;g. into Swedish as ''Kung Markatta'' (1949).<ref>{{cite web|title=Kung Markatta|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/8209828|website=[[LIBRIS]]|accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Monkey'' is said to have been the inspiration for [[Cordwainer Smith]]'s epic novel ''[[Norstrilia]]''.<ref>Alan C.

Its architecture is a [[front controller]], routing all requests for non-static [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]<nowiki/>s to a single PHP file which parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable [[permalink]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wpshout.com/wordpress-front-controller/|title=WordPress and the Front Controller Design Pattern {{!}} WPShout|date=2014-02-11|newspaper=WPShout|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517172044/http://wpshout.com/wordpress-front-controller/|archive-date=May 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Themes ===\nWordPress users may install and switch among different [[Theme (computing)|themes]]. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content. Every WordPress website requires at least one theme to be present and every theme should be designed  using WordPress standards with structured [[PHP]], valid [[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language), and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS). Themes may be directly installed using the WordPress \"Appearance\" administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the themes directory, for example via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://codex.wordpress.org |title=Theme Installation |publisher=Codex.wordpress.org |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426211036/http://codex.wordpress.org/ |archive-date=April 26, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[PHP]], [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] found in themes can be directly modified to alter theme behavior, or a theme can be a \"child\" theme that inherits settings from another theme and selectively overrides features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes|title=Child Themes \"WordPress Codex|website=codex.wordpress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222110349/https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes|archive-date=February 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and premium. Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory (also known as the repository), and premium themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual WordPress developers. WordPress users may also create and develop their own custom themes. The free theme Underscores created by the WordPress developers has become a popular basis for new themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wptavern.com/introduction-to-underscores-a-wordpress-starter-theme-with-konstantin-obenland |title=Introduction To Underscores: A WordPress Starter Theme With Konstantin Obenland |first=Jeff |last=Chandler |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819111713/https://wptavern.com/introduction-to-underscores-a-wordpress-starter-theme-with-konstantin-obenland |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Plugins ===\nWordPress' [[plugin (computing)|plugin]] architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog. As of January 2020, WordPress.org has 55,487 plugins available,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wordpress.org/plugins/|title=WordPress > WordPress Plugins|publisher=WordPress|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126184743/https://wordpress.org/plugins/|archive-date=January 26, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref> each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs.  However, this does not include the premium plugins that are available (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed in the WordPress.org repository. These customizations range from [[search engine optimization|search engine optimization (SEO)]], to [[client portal]]s used to display private information to logged in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of [[GUI widget|widgets]] and [[navigation bar]]s. Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades and as a result they may not function properly or may not function at all. Most plugins are available through WordPress themselves, either via downloading them and installing the files manually via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.\n\nWeb developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists of over 300 hooks divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks.\n\n=== Mobile applications ===\nPhone apps for WordPress exist for [[WebOS]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://webos.wordpress.org/ |title=WordPress for WebOS |work=WordPress |accessdate=March 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zrM7ZQpF?url=https://webos.wordpress.org/ |archive-date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Android (operating system)|Android]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://androidandme.com/2010/02/news/wordpress-publishes-native-android-application/ |title=WordPress publishes native Android application |publisher=Android and Me |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721081639/http://androidandme.com/2010/02/news/wordpress-publishes-native-android-application/ |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[iOS]] (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad),<ref name=\"altafsayani\">{{cite web |url=http://www.altafsayani.com/2008/07/12/wordpress-app-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch/ |title=Idea: WordPress App For iPhone and iPod Touch |work=WordPress iPhone & iPod Touch |date=July 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314142538/http://altafsayani.com/2008/07/12/wordpress-app-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch |archive-date=March 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"post\">{{cite news|url=https://readwrite.com/2011/03/23/18_million_wordpress_blogs_land_on_the_ipad/|title=18 Million WordPress Blogs Land on the iPad|date=March 24, 2011|work=ReadWriteWeb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123112140/https://readwrite.com/2011/03/23/18_million_wordpress_blogs_land_on_the_ipad/|archive-date=November 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Windows Phone]], and [[BlackBerry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blackberry.wordpress.org/ |title=WordPress for BlackBerry |work=WordPress |accessdate=December 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20131106094925/http://blackberry.wordpress.org/ |archivedate=November 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> These applications, designed by [[Automattic]], have options such as adding new blog posts and pages, commenting, moderating comments, replying to comments in addition to the ability to view the stats.<ref name=\"altafsayani\" /><ref name=\"post\" />\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nThe [[WordPress Accessibility Team]] has worked to improve the accessibility for core WordPress as well as support a clear identification of accessible themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/ |title=Make WordPress Accessible |work=WordPress}}</ref> The WordPress Accessibility Team provides continuing educational support about web accessibility and inclusive design. The WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards state that \"All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at level AA.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/ |title=Accessibility Coding Standards  |work=WordPress}}</ref>\n\n=== Other features ===\nWordPress also features integrated link management; a [[Web search engine|search engine]]\u2013friendly, clean [[permalink]] structure; the ability to assign multiple categories to posts; and support for [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] of posts. Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to [[Quotation marks in English#Smart quotes|smart quotes]]). WordPress also supports the [[Trackback]] and [[Pingback]] standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. WordPress posts can be edited in HTML, using the visual editor, or using one of a number of plugins that allow for a variety of customized editing features.\n\n== Multi-user and multi-blogging ==\nPrior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MS adds eight new data tables for each blog.\n\nAs of the release of WordPress 3, WordPress MU has merged with WordPress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/ |title=WordPress 3.0 \"Thelonious\" |publisher=WordPress.org |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630061059/http://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/ |archive-date=June 30, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n''b2/cafelog'', more commonly known as ''b2'' or ''cafelog'', was the precursor to WordPress.<ref>{{cite video |people=Andrew Warner, [[Matt Mullenweg]] |date=September 10, 2009 |title=The Biography Of WordPress&nbsp;\u2013 With Matt Mullenweg |url=http://mixergy.com/the-biography-of-wordpress-with-matt-mullenweg/ |format=[[MPEG-4 Part 14]] |medium=Podcast |publisher=Mixergy |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |time=10:57 |quote=b2 had actually, through a series of circumstances, essentially become abandoned. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914084204/http://mixergy.com/the-biography-of-wordpress-with-matt-mullenweg/ |archive-date=September 14, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> b2/cafelog was estimated to have been installed on approximately 2,000 blogs as of May 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last=Valdrighi |first=Michel |title=b2 test weblog \u2013 post dated 23.05.03 |url=http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=500 |accessdate=May 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522163322/http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=500 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was written in PHP for use with [[MySQL]] by Michel Valdrighi, who is now a contributing developer to WordPress.

It is especially important to keep WordPress plugins updated because would-be [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] can easily list all the plugins a site uses, and then run scans searching for any vulnerabilities against those plugins. If vulnerabilities are found, they may be exploited to allow hackers to, for example, upload their own files (such as a [[web shell]]) that collect sensitive information.\n\nDevelopers can also use tools to analyze potential vulnerabilities, including WPScan, WordPress Auditor and WordPress Sploit Framework developed by 0pc0deFR. These types of tools research known vulnerabilities, such as a [[Cross-site request forgery|CSRF]], [[Local File Inclusion|LFI]], [[File inclusion vulnerability|RFI]], [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]], SQL injection and user enumeration. However, not all vulnerabilities can be detected by tools, so it is advisable to check the code of plugins, themes and other add-ins from other developers.\n\nIn March 2015, it was reported by many security experts and SEOs, including Search Engine Land, that a [[SEO]] plugin for WordPress called [[Yoast]] which is used by more than 14 million users worldwide has a vulnerability which can lead to an exploit where hackers can do a Blind SQL injection.<ref>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2292 \"CVE-2015-2292\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614212804/http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2292 |date=June 14, 2017 }}, Retrieved on July 7, 2017</ref><ref>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2293 \"CVE-2015-2293\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615040555/http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2293 |date=June 15, 2017 }}, Retrieved on July 7, 2017</ref> To fix that issue they immediately introduced a newer version 1.7.4 of the same plugin to avoid any disturbance on web because of the security lapse that the plugin had.<ref>Barry Schwartz [http://searchengineland.com/yoast-wordpress-seo-plugin-vulnerable-to-hackers-216656 \"Yoast WordPress SEO Plugin Vulnerable To Hackers\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211201247/http://searchengineland.com/yoast-wordpress-seo-plugin-vulnerable-to-hackers-216656 |date=February 11, 2016 }}, Retrieved on February 13, 2016.</ref>\n\nIn January 2017, security auditors at Sucuri identified a vulnerability in the WordPress [[REST API]] that would allow any unauthenticated user to modify any post or page within a site running WordPress 4.7 or greater.

Its architecture is a [[front controller]], routing all requests for non-static [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]<nowiki/>s to a single PHP file which parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable [[permalink]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wpshout.com/wordpress-front-controller/|title=WordPress and the Front Controller Design Pattern {{!}} WPShout|date=2014-02-11|newspaper=WPShout|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517172044/http://wpshout.com/wordpress-front-controller/|archive-date=May 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Themes ===\nWordPress users may install and switch among different [[Theme (computing)|themes]]. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content. Every WordPress website requires at least one theme to be present and every theme should be designed  using WordPress standards with structured [[PHP]], valid [[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language), and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS). Themes may be directly installed using the WordPress \"Appearance\" administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the themes directory, for example via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://codex.wordpress.org |title=Theme Installation |publisher=Codex.wordpress.org |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426211036/http://codex.wordpress.org/ |archive-date=April 26, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[PHP]], [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] found in themes can be directly modified to alter theme behavior, or a theme can be a \"child\" theme that inherits settings from another theme and selectively overrides features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes|title=Child Themes \"WordPress Codex|website=codex.wordpress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222110349/https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes|archive-date=February 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and premium. Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory (also known as the repository), and premium themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual WordPress developers. WordPress users may also create and develop their own custom themes. The free theme Underscores created by the WordPress developers has become a popular basis for new themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wptavern.com/introduction-to-underscores-a-wordpress-starter-theme-with-konstantin-obenland |title=Introduction To Underscores: A WordPress Starter Theme With Konstantin Obenland |first=Jeff |last=Chandler |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819111713/https://wptavern.com/introduction-to-underscores-a-wordpress-starter-theme-with-konstantin-obenland |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Plugins ===\nWordPress' [[plugin (computing)|plugin]] architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog. As of January 2020, WordPress.org has 55,487 plugins available,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wordpress.org/plugins/|title=WordPress > WordPress Plugins|publisher=WordPress|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126184743/https://wordpress.org/plugins/|archive-date=January 26, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref> each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs.  However, this does not include the premium plugins that are available (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed in the WordPress.org repository. These customizations range from [[search engine optimization|search engine optimization (SEO)]], to [[client portal]]s used to display private information to logged in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of [[GUI widget|widgets]] and [[navigation bar]]s. Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades and as a result they may not function properly or may not function at all. Most plugins are available through WordPress themselves, either via downloading them and installing the files manually via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.\n\nWeb developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists of over 300 hooks divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks.\n\n=== Mobile applications ===\nPhone apps for WordPress exist for [[WebOS]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://webos.wordpress.org/ |title=WordPress for WebOS |work=WordPress |accessdate=March 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zrM7ZQpF?url=https://webos.wordpress.org/ |archive-date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Android (operating system)|Android]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://androidandme.com/2010/02/news/wordpress-publishes-native-android-application/ |title=WordPress publishes native Android application |publisher=Android and Me |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721081639/http://androidandme.com/2010/02/news/wordpress-publishes-native-android-application/ |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[iOS]] (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad),<ref name=\"altafsayani\">{{cite web |url=http://www.altafsayani.com/2008/07/12/wordpress-app-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch/ |title=Idea: WordPress App For iPhone and iPod Touch |work=WordPress iPhone & iPod Touch |date=July 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314142538/http://altafsayani.com/2008/07/12/wordpress-app-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch |archive-date=March 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"post\">{{cite news|url=https://readwrite.com/2011/03/23/18_million_wordpress_blogs_land_on_the_ipad/|title=18 Million WordPress Blogs Land on the iPad|date=March 24, 2011|work=ReadWriteWeb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123112140/https://readwrite.com/2011/03/23/18_million_wordpress_blogs_land_on_the_ipad/|archive-date=November 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Windows Phone]], and [[BlackBerry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blackberry.wordpress.org/ |title=WordPress for BlackBerry |work=WordPress |accessdate=December 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20131106094925/http://blackberry.wordpress.org/ |archivedate=November 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> These applications, designed by [[Automattic]], have options such as adding new blog posts and pages, commenting, moderating comments, replying to comments in addition to the ability to view the stats.<ref name=\"altafsayani\" /><ref name=\"post\" />\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nThe [[WordPress Accessibility Team]] has worked to improve the accessibility for core WordPress as well as support a clear identification of accessible themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/ |title=Make WordPress Accessible |work=WordPress}}</ref> The WordPress Accessibility Team provides continuing educational support about web accessibility and inclusive design. The WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards state that \"All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at level AA.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/ |title=Accessibility Coding Standards  |work=WordPress}}</ref>\n\n=== Other features ===\nWordPress also features integrated link management; a [[Web search engine|search engine]]\u2013friendly, clean [[permalink]] structure; the ability to assign multiple categories to posts; and support for [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] of posts. Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to [[Quotation marks in English#Smart quotes|smart quotes]]). WordPress also supports the [[Trackback]] and [[Pingback]] standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. WordPress posts can be edited in HTML, using the visual editor, or using one of a number of plugins that allow for a variety of customized editing features.\n\n== Multi-user and multi-blogging ==\nPrior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard.

Originally, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate.  The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775, after [[Lumpy Stevens]] bowled three successive deliveries to [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] that went straight through the two stumps rather than hitting them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/articles/z683qp3 |title=The origins of cricket jargon |work=BBC Bitesize |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Stumps and bails==\n{{main|Stump (cricket)|Bail (cricket)}}\n[[Image:Cricket Stumps en.svg|right|thumb|260px|Each wicket consists of three [[stump (cricket)|stumps]], upright wooden poles that are hammered into the ground, topped with two wooden crosspieces, known as the [[bail (cricket)|bails]].]]\n\nThe size and shape of the wicket has changed several times during the last 500 years; its dimensions and placing is now determined by Law 8 in the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'', thus:\n\n* '''Law 8: The wickets'''.  The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are {{convert|28|in|cm|2}} tall. The stumps are placed along the batting crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so they are {{convert|9|in|cm|2}} wide. Two wooden bails are placed in shallow grooves on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than {{convert|0.5|in|cm|2}} above the stumps, and must, for cricket, be {{convert|4.31 |in|cm|2}} long.\n\nThere are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (e.g., if it is windy they might fall off by themselves).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecricketer.com/Topics/news/old_trafford_england_australia_bails_ashes.html |title=Strange sight at Old Trafford as England and Australia forced to play without bails |work=thecricketer.com |date=4 September 2019 |accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix D to the laws.\n\n===Putting down a wicket===\n\nFor a batsman to be dismissed by being [[bowled]], [[run out]], [[stumped]] or [[hit wicket]], his wicket needs to be put down. What this means is defined by Law 29. A wicket is put down if a [[Bail (cricket)|bail]] is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a [[Fielding (cricket)|fielder]] (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/latest-news/news-archive/mcc-announces-eight-law-changes,1735,NS.html)|title=MCC announce eight Law changes|date=30 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221092414/http://www.lords.org/latest-news/news-archive/mcc-announces-eight-law-changes,1735,NS.html)|archivedate=21 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.\n[[File:Sutcliffe - bail stays put.jpg|thumb|200px|A ball from [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] hits the stumps but does not dislodge the [[Bail (cricket)|bail]], [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932\u201333|Sydney, 1932]]. The wicket was not put down, and so the batsman ([[Herbert Sutcliffe]]) was [[not out]].]]\nIf one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, in order to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman.\n\nIf however both bails are off, a fielder must remove one of the three stumps out of the ground with the ball, or pull it out of the ground with a hand or arm, provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used.\n\nIf the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's [[Bat (cricket)|bat]], person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball.\n\n{{anchor|Dismissing_a_batsman}}\n\n==Dismissal of a batsman==<!-- This section is linked from [[James Graham (cricketer)]] -->\n[[File:Loughton Cricket Club ground scoreboard at Loughton, Essex, England.jpg|thumb|300px|A scoreboard showing the total runs scored and wickets lost]]\n{{Main article|Dismissal (cricket)}}\nThe [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]] of a batsman is known as the ''taking of a wicket''. The batsman is said to have ''lost his wicket'', the batting side is said to have ''lost a wicket'', the fielding side to have ''taken a wicket'', and the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] is also said to have ''taken his'' (i.e. the batsman's) ''wicket'', if the dismissal is one of the types for which the bowler receives credit. This language is used even if the dismissal did not actually involve the stumps and bails in any way, for example, a catch. Though note that the other three of the five most common methods of dismissal (bowled, LBW, run out, and stumped) involve the stumps and bails being put down. \n\nThe word ''wicket'' has this meaning in the following contexts:\n\n===Scoring===\nA team's [[Scoring (cricket)|score]] is described in terms of the total number of [[run (cricket)|runs]] scored and the total number of wickets lost. \n\n===Bowling analyses===\nThe number of wickets taken is a primary measure of an individual bowler's ability, and a key part of a [[bowling analysis]].\n\n===Batting partnerships===\nThe sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together, a [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]], is referred to as a specifically numbered wicket when discriminating it from other partnerships in the [[innings]].\n*The '''first wicket partnership''' is from the start of the innings until the team loses its first wicket, i.e. one of the first two batsmen is dismissed.\n* The '''second wicket partnership''' is from when the third batsman starts batting until the team loses its second wicket, i.e. a second batsman is dismissed.\n* etc...\n* The '''tenth wicket''' or '''last wicket partnership''' is from when the eleventh (last) batsman starts batting until the team loses its tenth (last) wicket, i.e. a tenth (last) batsman is dismissed.\n\n===Winning by number of wickets===\nA team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. For example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets (as a team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed).\n\n==The pitch==\nThe word ''wicket'' is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/wicket|title=wicket - Definition of wicket in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wicket|title=Wicket definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}</ref> According to the ''Laws of Cricket'', this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers.\nThe term ''[[sticky wicket]]'' refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp, typically due to rain or high humidity. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult. The full phrase is thought to have originally been \"to bat on a sticky wicket.\" Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game (i.e. up to Test Match level) until the late 1950s.\n\n==In other sports==\nThe arches used in [[croquet]] and [[roque]] are sometimes referred to as ''wickets'', especially in [[American English]].  These arches descend from the ancestral game of [[ground billiards]] (which may also be related to cricket), and were formerly called the ''hoop'', ''arch'' or ''port''.

Originally, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate.  The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775, after [[Lumpy Stevens]] bowled three successive deliveries to [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] that went straight through the two stumps rather than hitting them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/articles/z683qp3 |title=The origins of cricket jargon |work=BBC Bitesize |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Stumps and bails==\n{{main|Stump (cricket)|Bail (cricket)}}\n[[Image:Cricket Stumps en.svg|right|thumb|260px|Each wicket consists of three [[stump (cricket)|stumps]], upright wooden poles that are hammered into the ground, topped with two wooden crosspieces, known as the [[bail (cricket)|bails]].]]\n\nThe size and shape of the wicket has changed several times during the last 300 years; its dimensions and placing is now determined by Law 8 in the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'', thus:\n\n* '''Law 8: The wickets'''.  The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are {{convert|28|in|cm|2}} tall. The stumps are placed along the batting crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so they are {{convert|9|in|cm|2}} wide. Two wooden bails are placed in shallow grooves on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than {{convert|0.5|in|cm|2}} above the stumps, and must, for cricket, be {{convert|4.31 |in|cm|2}} long.\n\nThere are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (e.g., if it is windy they might fall off by themselves).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecricketer.com/Topics/news/old_trafford_england_australia_bails_ashes.html |title=Strange sight at Old Trafford as England and Australia forced to play without bails |work=thecricketer.com |date=4 September 2019 |accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix D to the laws.\n\n===Putting down a wicket===\n\nFor a batsman to be dismissed by being [[bowled]], [[run out]], [[stumped]] or [[hit wicket]], his wicket needs to be put down. What this means is defined by Law 29. A wicket is put down if a [[Bail (cricket)|bail]] is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a [[Fielding (cricket)|fielder]] (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/latest-news/news-archive/mcc-announces-eight-law-changes,1735,NS.html)|title=MCC announce eight Law changes|date=30 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221092414/http://www.lords.org/latest-news/news-archive/mcc-announces-eight-law-changes,1735,NS.html)|archivedate=21 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.\n[[File:Sutcliffe - bail stays put.jpg|thumb|200px|A ball from [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] hits the stumps but does not dislodge the [[Bail (cricket)|bail]], [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932\u201333|Sydney, 1932]]. The wicket was not put down, and so the batsman ([[Herbert Sutcliffe]]) was [[not out]].]]\nIf one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, in order to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman.\n\nIf however both bails are off, a fielder must remove one of the three stumps out of the ground with the ball, or pull it out of the ground with a hand or arm, provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used.\n\nIf the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's [[Bat (cricket)|bat]], person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball.\n\n{{anchor|Dismissing_a_batsman}}\n==Dismissal of a batsman==<!-- This section is linked from [[James Graham (cricketer)]] -->\n[[File:Loughton Cricket Club ground scoreboard at Loughton, Essex, England.jpg|thumb|300px|A scoreboard showing the total runs scored and wickets lost]]\n{{Main article|Dismissal (cricket)}}\nThe [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]] of a batsman is known as the ''taking of a wicket''. The batsman is said to have ''lost his wicket'', the batting side is said to have ''lost a wicket'', the fielding side to have ''taken a wicket'', and the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] is also said to have ''taken his'' (i.e. the batsman's) ''wicket'', if the dismissal is one of the types for which the bowler receives credit. This language is used even if the dismissal did not actually involve the stumps and bails in any way, for example, a catch. Though note that the other three of the five most common methods of dismissal (bowled, LBW, run out, and stumped) involve the stumps and bails being put down. \n\nThe word ''wicket'' has this meaning in the following contexts:\n\n===Scoring===\nA team's [[Scoring (cricket)|score]] is described in terms of the total number of [[run (cricket)|runs]] scored and the total number of wickets lost. \n\n===Bowling analyses===\nThe number of wickets taken is a primary measure of an individual bowler's ability, and a key part of a [[bowling analysis]].\n\n===Batting partnerships===\nThe sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together, a [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]], is referred to as a specifically numbered wicket when discriminating it from other partnerships in the [[innings]].\n*The '''first wicket partnership''' is from the start of the innings until the team loses its first wicket, i.e. one of the first two batsmen is dismissed.\n* The '''second wicket partnership''' is from when the third batsman starts batting until the team loses its second wicket, i.e. a second batsman is dismissed.\n* etc...\n* The '''tenth wicket''' or '''last wicket partnership''' is from when the eleventh (last) batsman starts batting until the team loses its tenth (last) wicket, i.e. a tenth (last) batsman is dismissed.\n\n===Winning by number of wickets===\nA team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. For example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets (as a team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed).\n\n==The pitch==\nThe word ''wicket'' is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/wicket|title=wicket - Definition of wicket in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wicket|title=Wicket definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}</ref> According to the ''Laws of Cricket'', this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers.\nThe term ''[[sticky wicket]]'' refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp, typically due to rain or high humidity. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult. The full phrase is thought to have originally been \"to bat on a sticky wicket.\" Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game (i.e. up to Test Match level) until the late 1950s.\n\n==In other sports==\nThe arches used in [[croquet]] and [[roque]] are sometimes referred to as ''wickets'', especially in [[American English]].  These arches descend from the ancestral game of [[ground billiards]] (which may also be related to cricket), and were formerly called the ''hoop'', ''arch'' or ''port''.  The port remained a prominent feature of indoor table [[Cue sport|billiards]] until well into the 18th century.<ref name=\"Clare\">{{Cite book\n|title=Billiards and Snooker Bygones\n|last=Clare\n|first=Norman\n|publisher=Shire Publications\n|location=[[Princes Risborough]], England\n|year=1996 | origyear = 1985\n|edition=amended\n|isbn=0-85263-730-6\n|pages=3, 6, 7\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cricket}}\n*[[Cricket terminology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cricket statistics}}\n\n[[Category:Cricket terminology]]\n[[Category:Cricket equipment]]\n[[Category:Cricket laws and regulations]]\n", "name_user": "37.111.136.32", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eStumps and bails:Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket"}
