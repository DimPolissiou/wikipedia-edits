His older brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] ([[Michael McKean]]) became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) general store in Cicero, and watched as con artists regularly scammed his weak, na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy became a con artist himself, and earned the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"[[slip and fall]]\" accidents to make quick cash. He also ran petty scams on drunk strangers with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak ([[Mel Rodriguez]]). He eventually [[embezzlement|embezzled]] $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father declaring bankruptcy. His father died six months later; Jimmy cried inconsolably at the funeral.\n\nJimmy ran into trouble with the Chicago police when he drunkenly defecated through the sunroof of an adversary's car while the man's children were in the car. Facing the possibility of having to register as a sex offender, Jimmy asked Chuck for help. Chuck successfully defended him, but required that he move to Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Some years later, near the time of his divorce, Chuck developed symptoms of [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], was unable to work at HHM's offices and became housebound while living without without using electricity. Jimmy became his caregiver, bringing him groceries and running his errands.\n\nWhile working in the HHM mail room, Jimmy befriended [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]), an HHM employee who was attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completed his college degree and attended a correspondence law school. He passed the [[bar exam]] and hoped to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) denied Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then started a solo practice out of the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon, which he still operates at the start of ''Better Call Saul''. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot. Jimmy still struggles with finances, and, at the start of the show, drives a signature [[Suzuki Esteem]] with mismatched panel doors, a visual pun reflecting on Jimmy's current poor esteem of himself at this stage of his life.<ref name=\"esquire car\">{{cite web | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32707/suzuki-esteem-better-call-saul-premiere/ | title = Meet the Suzuki Esteem, the Sad-Sack, Scene-Stealing Car From Better Call Saul | first = Kenny | last =Herzog | date = February 8, 2015 | accessdate = April 8, 2020 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> At some point prior to the start of the show, Jimmy had been married and divorced twice.\n\nJimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in TV ads he produces during the suspension of his law license,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/better-call-saul-season-3-premiere-breaking-bad-1202018973/|title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 3 Premiere: Jimmy McGill Gets Closer to \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019|last=Gordon|first=Diane|date=March 29, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street. \n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nUnhappy with working as a public defender for low pay, Jimmy attempts to represent Craig ([[Jeremy Shamos]]) and Betsy Kettleman ([[Julie Ann Emery]]), a couple accused of [[embezzling]] over a million dollars. They hire HHM to represent them and Jimmy attempts to persuade them to switch, leading to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), Tuco's subordinate in the Salamanca drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nFollowing Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding near their home.  When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him to keep silent. When HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, they use their payment to Jimmy to blackmail him into defending them.  Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place.  Mike steals their money and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing the Kettlemans to accept a guilty plea for Craig so that both Kettlemans will not go to prison and leave their children alone.\n\nJimmy produces wills for several elderly clients and seems to have great rapport with them, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients.  With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a [[class action lawsuit]] against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation.\n\nJimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past.  Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card.  Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer.  Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys.  Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him.\n\nKim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial.  In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together.  Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M and Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms.  Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM.\n\nChuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto ([[Brandon K. Hampton]]) calls Jimmy for help.  While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house.  As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay.  Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it.\n\nKnowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk.  Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk.  Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives.  Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head.  Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents.  Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital.  He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch.\n\nErnesto lies to Chuck that he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store, out of concern for Chuck's health.  Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are [[psychosomatic]].  Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\n\nChuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it.  Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police.\n\nJimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case.  Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his EHS.  Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms.  The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience.  Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred.\n\nTo both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman.  He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting.\n\nJimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her.  When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on a hot mike, vindicating Irene and restoring her friendships, but costing him his share of the proposed settlement.  Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm.  Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment.\n\nJimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended.  Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, a calculated act to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that their insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney.\n\nChuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that will enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire.  Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him.  Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running.  Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates.  Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor.\n\nWhile job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable [[Hummel figurine]] from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do.  While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias.  Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying.  Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out.\n\nJimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation.  Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building.\n\nJimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death.  To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the [[University of New Mexico]]. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a [[doing business as|DBA]] application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's law license is reinstated and he tells Kim he realized that continuing to use the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business gives him an instant client base for a new criminal law practice. His relationship with Kim is strained when he encourages her to use a con to convince one of her ''pro bono'' clients to accept a favorable plea bargain. After refusing Jimmy's offer, Kim runs the con herself, but later tells Jimmy she does not want to lie to succeed, and he agrees not to engage in ethically questionable activities when her clients are involved. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo when Domingo is arrested, and they work out a plan to free Domingo by giving information about Gus's dead drops to give to Hank and Steve at the DEA and pretending that Domingo is willing to become Hank's confidential informant. Lalo is pleased with the result, and Jimmy realizes he will have to continue working for the Salamancas, because as Nacho tells him \"Once you're in, you're in.\" Jimmy meets Howard for lunch, where Howard apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy continues to be unnerved by Howard's reminders of his past and uses three bowling balls to damage Howard's car. After representing two prostitutes in court, Jimmy pays them to loudly disrupt Howard's lunch with Clifford Main.\n\nEverett Acker lives on land owned by Mesa Verde bank, which wants him to move so the bank can construct a new [[call center]]. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses to compromise, so Kim asks Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker against the bank. Jimmy engages in several tactics the delay construction, but Kevin still refuses to compromise, so Kim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could search for \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also advises against it. Kim decides to proceed, so Jimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his house. Kim sees something in Sobchak's photos of Kevin's house that can be used against Kevin. Rich suggests that Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\nKim later tells Jimmy she does not want to proceed with blackmailing Kevin and offers Acker $75,000 to settle, promising to personally make up the difference between that figure and the amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by demanding $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy' demand, and Jimmy pressures him with threats of an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting potential clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which show Kevin's father Don in an unfavorable light. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that includes payments to both Acker and the photographer. Kim returns home and an apprehensive Jimmy suggests they have cause to celebrate, but Kim is furious and vents her anger at Jimmy for making her the \"sucker\" in his con.  Kim suggests to Jimmy that they separate, but then proposes marriage. They marry the next day, attaching [[spousal privilege]] to their conversations, which means Jimmy will not have to lie to Kim about his activities. \n\nWhen Lalo is charged with the murder of Fred the money wire clerk, Lalo asks Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so that he does not go to trial, and promises Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\" if he succeeds. Gus also desires Lalo's release, so Mike provide Jimmy details on the investigative work he did under an assumed name to have Lalo arrested. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, and the judge grants bail but sets it at $7 million cash. Lalo stuns Jimmy by saying he can afford to pay it, but says Jimmy will have to pick up the money for him. Howard sees Jimmy at the courthouse and asks if he has decided whether to accept his offer to join HHM. Jimmy says he is still considering it, but Howard realizes Jimmy is toying with him. Howard confronts Jimmy over his recent harassment of Howard, and Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and says Jimmy/Saul has grown too big for the constraints of a job at HHM.\n\nLalo requests that Jimmy transport the cash for his bail. Jimmy is reluctant, but agrees after Lalo accepts his request of a $100,000 fee. Kim is unable to persuade Jimmy not to go, so he drives to a remote desert site. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash, then immediately depart. Jimmy is ambushed by several gunmen. They take the cash and are about to kill him when they are attacked. The unseen shooter is Mike, who tracked Jimmy at Gus's behest. He kills all but one gunman, who escapes in the only truck that is still drivable. Mike and Jimmy put the cash back in Jimmy's car and begin the trip back to Albuquerque. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of the road and begin to walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. They camp out overnight, and Jimmy reveals to Mike that Kim knows some details of his activities. Mike warns Jimmy that if Kim knows about the Salamancas, she is now \"in the game\". They resume their trek the next day, and an exhausted, dehydrated, and sunburned Jimmy gives up. Mike spots the surviving gunman and intends to hide and wait. Instead, Jimmy runs to the edge of the road to attract his attention and draw him in. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots him. The gunman's truck flips and is destroyed. Mike and Jimmy resume their walk, now on the road.\n\nJimmy and Mike make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. They agree on a cover story for Jimmy to tell Lalo. Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and Lalo is released. Jimmy tells Lalo he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked to avoid putting the money at risk. Lalo says he plans to return to Mexico to avoid the scrutiny of suspicious police and prosecutors. Jimmy tells Kim the same story, but she realizes he is lying and tells him she will be ready to listen when he is ready to talk. Jimmy tells Mike he is experiencing [[posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]]. Mike tells Jimmy it will pass with time. Nacho brings Lalo to the same pickup point where Jimmy received the money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, he searches for Jimmy's car. After he finds it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby roof, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim argues that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and departs. He tells Nacho they are going to Mexico, but not to the original pickup site.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n[[File:Bob Odenkirk and Emily Rios 2011 at Breaking Bad set.jpg|thumb|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of ''Breaking Bad'' during the filming of the fourth season, with [[Emily Rios]] ([[Andrea Cantillo]])]]\nBy the time of Saul's introduction in ''Breaking Bad'', he has fully adopted the name \"Saul Goodman\", and rarely mentions the name McGill.

Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses.\n\nWalt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul, initially worried that the two are from Lalo or Nacho, sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly (Jimmy Daniels), who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison.  Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg.  The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school.  He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity.\n\nCombo (Rodney Rush), Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nTo help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. ([[R.J. Mitte]]) set up for donors to contribute to Walt's [[chemotherapy]], making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's ([[Anna Gunn]]) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]), Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt.  Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus.  Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher ([[David Costabile]]) as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nWhen Walt's brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]] ([[Dean Norris]]), a [[DEA]] agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul.  Saul has his secretary Francesca ([[Tina Parker]]) pose as a [[Albuquerque Police Department]] dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank\u2019s wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it.  Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business.  Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's ([[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's ([[Emily Rios]]) brother Tom\u00e1s ([[Angelo Martinez]]). Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby ([[Bill Burr]]) pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.  Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\" ([[Robert Forster]]), a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered.  Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash.\n\nTo protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and his other employee Huell Babineaux ([[Lavell Crawford]]) to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marcos ([[Daniel Moncada]]) and Leonel Salamanca ([[Luis Moncada]]) to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the [[ricin]] cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock ([[Ian Posada]]) is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]) in a nursing home.  Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n===== Part 1 =====\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger ([[Chris Freihofer]]) is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey ([[Kerry Condon]]) and granddaughter Kaylee (Abigail Zoe Lewis). Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of [[methylamine]] and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]) killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul and Walt both contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.\n\n=== Post-''Breaking Bad'' ===\nThough Saul does not appear in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harding |first=Amanda |date=October 15, 2019 |title=Did 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' Just Predict a Tragic Ending for Saul Goodman In 'Better Call Saul'? |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/did-el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie-just-predict-a-tragic-ending-for-saul-goodman-in-better-call-saul.html/ |work=Showbiz Cheat Sheet}}</ref>  In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 12, 2019 |title=El Camino answers many burning Breaking Bad questions |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/el-camino-answers-many-burning-breaking-bad-questions/news-story/f6fb2d768803a3d15ff8d15b5dbe8728 |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe season premieres of ''Better Call Saul'' open with black-and-white [[Flashforward|flash forwards]] that take place after ''Breaking Bad'', showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.

His older brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] ([[Michael McKean]]) became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) general store in Cicero, and watched as con artists regularly scammed his weak, na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy became a con artist himself, and earned the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"[[slip and fall]]\" accidents to make quick cash. He also ran petty scams on drunk strangers with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak ([[Mel Rodriguez]]). He eventually [[embezzlement|embezzled]] $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father declaring bankruptcy. His father died six months later; Jimmy cried inconsolably at the funeral.\n\nJimmy ran into trouble with the Chicago police when he drunkenly defecated on a man's car in front of the man's children. Chuck returned from Albuquerque to negotiate for Jimmy to be cleared of the charges, but required that he work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Some years later, near the time of his divorce, Chuck developed symptoms of [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], unable to work directly at HHM  and became housebound without the use of electric power. Jimmy became his caregiver, bringing him groceries and running errands.\n\nWhile working in the HHM mail room, Jimmy befriended [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]), an HHM employee who was attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completed his college degree and attended a correspondence law school. He passed the [[bar exam]] and hoped to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) denied Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then started a solo practice out of the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon, which he still operates at the start of ''Better Call Saul''. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot. Jimmy still struggles with finances, and, at the start of the show, drives a signature [[Suzuki Esteem]] with mismatched panel doors, a visual pun reflecting on Jimmy's current poor esteem of himself at this stage of his life.<ref name=\"esquire car\">{{cite web | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32707/suzuki-esteem-better-call-saul-premiere/ | title = Meet the Suzuki Esteem, the Sad-Sack, Scene-Stealing Car From Better Call Saul | first = Kenny | last =Herzog | date = February 8, 2015 | accessdate = April 8, 2020 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> At some point prior to the start of the show, Jimmy had been married and divorced twice.\n\nJimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in TV ads he produces during the suspension of his law license,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/better-call-saul-season-3-premiere-breaking-bad-1202018973/|title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 3 Premiere: Jimmy McGill Gets Closer to \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019|last=Gordon|first=Diane|date=March 29, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street. \n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nUnhappy with working as a public defender for low pay, Jimmy attempts to represent Craig ([[Jeremy Shamos]]) and Betsy Kettleman ([[Julie Ann Emery]]), a couple accused of [[embezzling]] over a million dollars. They hire HHM to represent them and Jimmy attempts to persuade them to switch, leading to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), Tuco's subordinate in the Salamanca drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nFollowing Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding near their home.  When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him to keep silent. When HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, they use their payment to Jimmy to blackmail him into defending them.  Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place.  Mike steals their money and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing the Kettlemans to accept a guilty plea for Craig so that both Kettlemans will not go to prison and leave their children alone.\n\nJimmy produces wills for several elderly clients and seems to have great rapport with them, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients.  With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a [[class action lawsuit]] against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation.\n\nJimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past.  Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card.  Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer.  Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys.  Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him.\n\nKim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial.  In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together.  Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M and Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms.  Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM.\n\nChuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto ([[Brandon K. Hampton]]) calls Jimmy for help.  While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house.  As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay.  Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it.\n\nKnowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk.  Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk.  Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives.  Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head.  Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents.  Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital.  He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch.\n\nErnesto lies to Chuck that he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store, out of concern for Chuck's health.  Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are [[psychosomatic]].  Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\n\nChuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it.  Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police.\n\nJimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case.  Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his EHS.  Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms.  The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience.  Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred.\n\nTo both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman.  He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting.\n\nJimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her.  When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on a hot mike, vindicating Irene and restoring her friendships, but costing him his share of the proposed settlement.  Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm.  Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment.\n\nJimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended.  Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, a calculated act to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that their insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney.\n\nChuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that will enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire.  Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him.  Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running.  Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates.  Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor.\n\nWhile job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable [[Hummel figurine]] from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do.  While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias.  Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying.  Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out.\n\nJimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation.  Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building.\n\nJimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death.  To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the [[University of New Mexico]]. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a [[doing business as|DBA]] application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's law license is reinstated and he tells Kim he realized that continuing to use the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business gives him an instant client base for a new criminal law practice. His relationship with Kim is strained when he encourages her to use a con to convince one of her ''pro bono'' clients to accept a favorable plea bargain. After refusing Jimmy's offer, Kim runs the con herself, but later tells Jimmy she does not want to lie to succeed, and he agrees not to engage in ethically questionable activities when her clients are involved. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo when Domingo is arrested, and they work out a plan to free Domingo by giving information about Gus's dead drops to give to Hank and Steve at the DEA and pretending that Domingo is willing to become Hank's confidential informant. Lalo is pleased with the result, and Jimmy realizes he will have to continue working for the Salamancas, because as Nacho tells him \"Once you're in, you're in.\" Jimmy meets Howard for lunch, where Howard apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy continues to be unnerved by Howard's reminders of his past and uses three bowling balls to damage Howard's car. After representing two prostitutes in court, Jimmy pays them to loudly disrupt Howard's lunch with Clifford Main.\n\nEverett Acker lives on land owned by Mesa Verde bank, which wants him to move so the bank can construct a new [[call center]]. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses to compromise, so Kim asks Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker against the bank. Jimmy engages in several tactics the delay construction, but Kevin still refuses to compromise, so Kim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could search for \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also advises against it. Kim decides to proceed, so Jimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his house. Kim sees something in Sobchak's photos of Kevin's house that can be used against Kevin. Rich suggests that Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\nKim later tells Jimmy she does not want to proceed with blackmailing Kevin and offers Acker $75,000 to settle, promising to personally make up the difference between that figure and the amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by demanding $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy' demand, and Jimmy pressures him with threats of an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting potential clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which show Kevin's father Don in an unfavorable light. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that includes payments to both Acker and the photographer. Kim returns home and an apprehensive Jimmy suggests they have cause to celebrate, but Kim is furious and vents her anger at Jimmy for making her the \"sucker\" in his con.  Kim suggests to Jimmy that they separate, but then proposes marriage. They marry the next day, attaching [[spousal privilege]] to their conversations, which means Jimmy will not have to lie to Kim about his activities. \n\nWhen Lalo is charged with the murder of Fred the money wire clerk, Lalo asks Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so that he does not go to trial, and promises Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\" if he succeeds. Gus also desires Lalo's release, so Mike provide Jimmy details on the investigative work he did under an assumed name to have Lalo arrested. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, and the judge grants bail but sets it at $7 million cash. Lalo stuns Jimmy by saying he can afford to pay it, but says Jimmy will have to pick up the money for him. Howard sees Jimmy at the courthouse and asks if he has decided whether to accept his offer to join HHM. Jimmy says he is still considering it, but Howard realizes Jimmy is toying with him. Howard confronts Jimmy over his recent harassment of Howard, and Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and says Jimmy/Saul has grown too big for the constraints of a job at HHM.\n\nLalo requests that Jimmy transport the cash for his bail. Jimmy is reluctant, but agrees after Lalo accepts his request of a $100,000 fee. Kim is unable to persuade Jimmy not to go, so he drives to a remote desert site. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash, then immediately depart. Jimmy is ambushed by several gunmen. They take the cash and are about to kill him when they are attacked. The unseen shooter is Mike, who tracked Jimmy at Gus's behest. He kills all but one gunman, who escapes in the only truck that is still drivable. Mike and Jimmy put the cash back in Jimmy's car and begin the trip back to Albuquerque. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of the road and begin to walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. They camp out overnight, and Jimmy reveals to Mike that Kim knows some details of his activities. Mike warns Jimmy that if Kim knows about the Salamancas, she is now \"in the game\". They resume their trek the next day, and an exhausted, dehydrated, and sunburned Jimmy gives up. Mike spots the surviving gunman and intends to hide and wait. Instead, Jimmy runs to the edge of the road to attract his attention and draw him in. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots him. The gunman's truck flips and is destroyed. Mike and Jimmy resume their walk, now on the road.\n\nJimmy and Mike make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. They agree on a cover story for Jimmy to tell Lalo. Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and Lalo is released. Jimmy tells Lalo he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked to avoid putting the money at risk. Lalo says he plans to return to Mexico to avoid the scrutiny of suspicious police and prosecutors. Jimmy tells Kim the same story, but she realizes he is lying and tells him she will be ready to listen when he is ready to talk. Jimmy tells Mike he is experiencing [[posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]]. Mike tells Jimmy it will pass with time. Nacho brings Lalo to the same pickup point where Jimmy received the money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, he searches for Jimmy's car. After he finds it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby roof, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim argues that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and departs. He tells Nacho they are going to Mexico, but not to the original pickup site.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n[[File:Bob Odenkirk and Emily Rios 2011 at Breaking Bad set.jpg|thumb|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of ''Breaking Bad'' during the filming of the fourth season, with [[Emily Rios]] ([[Andrea Cantillo]])]]\nBy the time of Saul's introduction in ''Breaking Bad'', he has fully adopted the name \"Saul Goodman\", and rarely mentions the name McGill.

Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses.\n\nWalt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul, initially worried that the two are from Lalo or Nacho, sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly (Jimmy Daniels), who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison.  Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg.  The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school.  He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity.\n\nCombo (Rodney Rush), Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nTo help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. ([[R.J. Mitte]]) set up for donors to contribute to Walt's [[chemotherapy]], making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's ([[Anna Gunn]]) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]), Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt.  Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus.  Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher ([[David Costabile]]) as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nWhen Walt's brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]] ([[Dean Norris]]), a [[DEA]] agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul.  Saul has his secretary Francesca ([[Tina Parker]]) pose as a [[Albuquerque Police Department]] dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank\u2019s wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it.  Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business.  Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's ([[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's ([[Emily Rios]]) brother Tom\u00e1s ([[Angelo Martinez]]). Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby ([[Bill Burr]]) pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.  Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\" ([[Robert Forster]]), a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered.  Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash.\n\nTo protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and his other employee Huell Babineaux ([[Lavell Crawford]]) to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marcos ([[Daniel Moncada]]) and Leonel Salamanca ([[Luis Moncada]]) to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the [[ricin]] cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock ([[Ian Posada]]) is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]) in a nursing home.  Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n===== Part 1 =====\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger ([[Chris Freihofer]]) is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey ([[Kerry Condon]]) and granddaughter Kaylee (Abigail Zoe Lewis). Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of [[methylamine]] and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]) killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul and Walt both contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.\n\n=== Post-''Breaking Bad'' ===\nThough Saul does not appear in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harding |first=Amanda |date=October 15, 2019 |title=Did 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' Just Predict a Tragic Ending for Saul Goodman In 'Better Call Saul'? |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/did-el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie-just-predict-a-tragic-ending-for-saul-goodman-in-better-call-saul.html/ |work=Showbiz Cheat Sheet}}</ref>  In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 12, 2019 |title=El Camino answers many burning Breaking Bad questions |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/el-camino-answers-many-burning-breaking-bad-questions/news-story/f6fb2d768803a3d15ff8d15b5dbe8728 |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe season premieres of ''Better Call Saul'' open with black-and-white [[Flashforward|flash forwards]] that take place after ''Breaking Bad'', showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

Banneker was employed directly by Ellicott and did not at any time, as far as can be determined, work with or for L'Enfant.\"</ref> In late February 1792, [[Presidency of George Washington|President George Washington]] dismissed L'Enfant, who had failed to have his plan published and who was experiencing frequent conflicts with the three Commissioners that Washington had appointed to supervise the planning and survey of the federal district and city.<ref name=planning/><ref name=\"Bowling\">Bowling</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/details/centennialhisto00woolgoog/page/n112 Crew, pp. 101-102] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111093014/https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA101&id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ |date=November 11, 2015}}<br/>(2) {{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~docktor/wmslogo.htm |title=Plan of the City of Washington|publisher=Washington Map Society|date=1997-03-22|accessdate=2012-06-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623142642/http://home.earthlink.net/~docktor/wmslogo.htm |archivedate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Silvio Bedini with bust of Thomas Jefferson 1981.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><sup>[[Smithsonian Institution]]</sup><br />Silvio Bedini (1981)</div>]]\nA number of undocumented stories connecting Benjamin Banneker with the planning and survey of the federal capital city have appeared over the years.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

Graham's notes on her sources stated that she had constructed the book's story \"within the framework of little known true facts\". Her notes further stated that \"all dates and main events can be documented\" and that she had filled in all gaps with incidents of whose probability she was convinced.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/yourmosthumblese00dubo/page/227/mode/1up Graham, 1946, ''Notes on Sources'', p. 227.] \"This story of Benjamin Banneker has been constructed within the framework of little known true facts. All dates and main events can be documented. All gaps have been filled in with incidents of whose probablity I am convinced\".</ref> However, when describing Graham's book in a 1972 biography of Banneker, Silvio Bedini stated that her work had been written for children, was highly fictionalized and, having become popular, had \"resulted in yet more confusion concerning Banneker's achievements and their importance\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/300/mode/1up/search/Graham Bedini, 1972, p. 300.]</ref>\n\nGraham's account of Banneker's involvement in the origins of the District of Columbia stated that Banneker worked with L'Enfant during the planning and survey of the federal district. Her story told that in early 1792, L'Enfant \"packed everything and departed --- taking the plans with him.\" When Banneker learned of this, he took an adventurous trip to his home in [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]], Maryland. While at home, Banneker reconstructed L'Enfant's plan from memory within a three-day period. The redrawn plan provided the framework for the later development of the city of Washington.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/yourmosthumblese00dubo/page/170/mode/1up Graham, 1946, Chapter XI: ----- ''Sir, I Have the Plans in My Head'', pp. 170-178.]</ref>\n\nA number of books, reports and [[websites]] have repeated or extended Graham's fable before and after the publication of Bedini's 1972 biography.<ref>The following websites and publications relate parts or all of various versions of this myth:\n*{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=C.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126/mode/1up Bedini, 1972, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

''The Book of the Laws of Countries: Dialogue on Fate of Bardaisan of Edessa'', Assen: Van Gorcum, 1965. pp 43-45</ref>\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest use of the word Xwedodah in Middle Persian in the inscription Kordir on the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] is in the role of [[Naqsh-e Rostam]]. New Avestan texts are x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8a (male) and x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuadai\u03b8\u012b (female) and the adjectives x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8a and x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8\u0101 (female). The nineteenth-century qa\u00eatvadatha style (with q instead of Avesta x) and similar writings reappear in modern literature.\n\nThe first part of the compound seems to be a \"family\" (or similar) of Khito (x\u1d5ba\u0113tu), which is generally thought to derive from the \"self\" (x\u1d5ba\u0113-) with the suffix -you (-tu-), although this is not entirely straightforward . The second part, vada\u03b8a, is nowadays generally regarded as a derivative of the verb (From * Wad-) 'resulting in marriage', related to other Iranian and Hindu European languages which refer to marriage or marriage partner (compare with ancient Indik). \"Wife\" Av. Va\u03b4\u016b; Pahlavi way\u016bg (Pers. Bayu) \"bride\"; Avestan va\u03b4ut \"one who has reached the age of marriage\"; Pahlavi way\u016bdag \"bride's room\"; \n\nThis etymology was suggested by Carl Goldner, and accepted by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and Christian Bartholomae, and became a popular opinion among Western scholars. However, there is no * vadha- to Vedic or * vada- root in the Avesta of the vadh root; in Avesta the v\u0101\u03b4aya and upa.v\u0101\u03b4aiia- 'lead (to marry)' and uzuu\u0101\u03b4aiia are 'leaving the father's house'. vadh-Vedic, vad-Avestan should not be confused with vah-Avestan \"to take\", vaz-Avestan with the uhy\u00e1-unknown form.\n\n== Zoroastrian religious views ==\nMost of Pahlavi's texts are self-contained by [[Edward William West]]'s comments. Brief evaluations and references include Friedrich Spiegel and standard books on Zoroastrianism (such as Boyce).\n\n=== Mythology ===\nAccording to the Pahlavi texts, Ahura Mazda began his quest at the time of creation and linked human beings to each other, going through a period of mixing in which [[good and evil]] compete for supremacy, reaching the epicenter of a period in which the world Once again it will be the way that Ahura Mazda had created it.In Isna 1.6, [[Spenta Armaiti]] is said to have been the daughter of Ahura Mazda, but no details on how [[Ahura Mazda]] was her father can be found. On the other hand, it is said that Ahura Mazda was both his father and mother of creation; his mother when he was brought up in the world of thought and his father when he brought it into the world of being. Denig has said of the first manuscripts (the first humans) that the creator enjoyed the action from which all creatures were made, in which it is a word that can refer to sexual activity but is not unambiguous. Denkard says people should do it because it is clear that the creator did it when he made such creations.\n\n=== Nuclear family incest ===\nXwedodah is considered the highest act of worship. A man could marry his sister, daughter, or mother in this system.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Forrest, Satnam Mendoza.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/703621262|title=Witches, whores, and sorcerers : the concept of evil in early Iran|date=2011|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8, Prods O.|isbn=978-0-292-72687-1|edition=1st ed|location=Austin|oclc=703621262}}</ref> Zoroastrian religious text provide unequivocal evidence for the desirability and occurrence of nuclear family incest in order to \"preserve the purity of the race, to increase the compatibility of husband and wife, and to increase affection for children\"<ref name=\":1\">de Menasce, J.

So wonderful is khw\u0113d\u014ddah.<ref name=\":3\">Pahlavi riv\u0101yat 8c.1\u20136, d.1\u20132</ref></blockquote>The importance of brother-sister incest is emphasized in Zoroastrianism as part of important family bonds.<ref name=\":2\" /> Zoroastrians also believed that a woman's virginity belonged to her brother or her father first, and they had the right to take it first before she got married, assuming she got married to someone outside the family. The hymen is suppose to be broken by either a woman's brother or her father, as this is property of the family, and it would be considered shameful if it was broken by or her virginity was in possession of a stranger or a foreign enemy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ebrahimnejad|first=Hormoz|date=2015-11-02|title=A Social History of Sexual Relations in Iran|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00210862.2014.993533|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=48|issue=6|pages=967\u2013970|doi=10.1080/00210862.2014.993533|issn=0021-0862}}</ref> A family would therefore never have to see their daughter being married off to other tribes.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the Zoroastrian version of Dante's Inferno, Book of Arda Wiraz 49, where a visitor to hell esquires about the sin committed by a woman entangled in a serpent that crawls into her mouth is given the explanation, \"This is the soul of that wicked woman who violated the next-of-kin marriage\" (who, in other words, refused to have sex with her father, brother, or son and therefore wound up in hell) <ref>Vahman, F.

These should make urine with which these corpse- cutters can wash their hair and bodies.<ref>Videvdad 8.13</ref></blockquote>Nuclear family incest was more than a mere religious ideal or rare ritual. Unlike incest in Egypt, or Rome, or Medieval European royalty, this form of nuclear family incest was not relegated to just royalty but was widely popular among all facets of society from slaves, to free men, to the middle class, aristocrats and royalty. Nuclear family incest resulting in progeny was a far cry from an exclusively or even predominantly royal custom.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Non-Persian Sources==\nPersians who immigrated from their homeland in Persia and live across various nations practiced brother-sister incest marriages, and in historical sources are refereed to as Magians, or Majoosi as called by the Arab dialects.<ref name=\":0\" /> There are 60 outside sources referencing Zoroastrian Persian brother-sister incest marriages come from the Greeks, Romans, Armenians, Arabians, Indians, Tibetans, and Chinese, ranging from the 5th century B.C. into the 15th century A.D, roughly 2000 years.<ref name=\":0\" /> Due to the method of Islamic conquests, where newly conquered territory would be allowed to keep their customs and practices as long as they submitted and paid their taxes<ref name=\":4\">Choksy, J.K.

''Syrische Rechtsbiicher'', 3, Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1914.</ref>\n\n=== Islamic ===\nMuslim writers have cited this tradition. For example, [[Al-Tha'alibi]] writes that Zoroastrian legalized marriage between brothers and sisters and fathers and daughters because Adam had married his sons to his daughters. [[Al-Masudi]] cites Zoroastrian incest and reports that [[Ardashir I]] told his people to marry close relatives to strengthen family ties. [[Ferdowsi]] mentions incest between Bahman and his sister Homa.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/marriage-next-of-kin</ref>\n\n=== Jewish ===\nJewish philosopher [[Philo]] has mentioned the marriage of high-ranking Iranians to their mothers and the high status of the children of these links.\n\n=== Christian ===\nThe most comprehensive reports come from [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] who lived under Persian rule, they wrote down that these were not just fictitious stories of far away people, but were indeed very real and widely practiced. Iso'bokht, the [[Church of the East|Nestorian]] patriarch of the [[Persis]] writes many books on this topic urging Christians and other peoples to not practice this custom.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Greek===\nThe common feature of non-Iranian sources is that they rarely mention the Iranians themselves, even if they do occasionally mention the [[majus]] clerics.

''The Book of the Laws of Countries: Dialogue on Fate of Bardaisan of Edessa'', Assen: Van Gorcum, 1965. pp 43-45</ref>\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest use of the word Xwedodah in Middle Persian in the inscription Kordir on the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] is in the role of [[Naqsh-e Rostam]]. New Avestan texts are x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8a (male) and x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuadai\u03b8\u012b (female) and the adjectives x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8a and x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8\u0101 (female). The nineteenth-century qa\u00eatvadatha style (with q instead of Avesta x) and similar writings reappear in modern literature.\n\nThe first part of the compound seems to be a \"family\" (or similar) of Khito (x\u1d5ba\u0113tu), which is generally thought to derive from the \"self\" (x\u1d5ba\u0113-) with the suffix -you (-tu-), although this is not entirely straightforward . The second part, vada\u03b8a, is nowadays generally regarded as a derivative of the verb (From * Wad-) 'resulting in marriage', related to other Iranian and Hindu European languages which refer to marriage or marriage partner (compare with ancient Indik). \"Wife\" Av. Va\u03b4\u016b; Pahlavi way\u016bg (Pers. Bayu) \"bride\"; Avestan va\u03b4ut \"one who has reached the age of marriage\"; Pahlavi way\u016bdag \"bride's room\"; \n\nThis etymology was suggested by Carl Goldner, and accepted by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and Christian Bartholomae, and became a popular opinion among Western scholars. However, there is no * vadha- to Vedic or * vada- root in the Avesta of the vadh root; in Avesta the v\u0101\u03b4aya and upa.v\u0101\u03b4aiia- 'lead (to marry)' and uzuu\u0101\u03b4aiia are 'leaving the father's house'. vadh-Vedic, vad-Avestan should not be confused with vah-Avestan \"to take\", vaz-Avestan with the uhy\u00e1-unknown form.\n\n== Zoroastrian religious views ==\nMost of Pahlavi's texts are self-contained by [[Edward William West]]'s comments. Brief evaluations and references include Friedrich Spiegel and standard books on Zoroastrianism (such as Boyce).\n\n=== Mythology ===\nAccording to the Pahlavi texts, Ahura Mazda began his quest at the time of creation and linked human beings to each other, going through a period of mixing in which [[good and evil]] compete for supremacy, reaching the epicenter of a period in which the world Once again it will be the way that Ahura Mazda had created it.In Isna 1.6, [[Spenta Armaiti]] is said to have been the daughter of Ahura Mazda, but no details on how [[Ahura Mazda]] was her father can be found. On the other hand, it is said that Ahura Mazda was both his father and mother of creation; his mother when he was brought up in the world of thought and his father when he brought it into the world of being. Denig has said of the first manuscripts (the first humans) that the creator enjoyed the action from which all creatures were made, in which it is a word that can refer to sexual activity but is not unambiguous. Denkard says people should do it because it is clear that the creator did it when he made such creations.\n\n=== Nuclear family incest ===\nXwedodah is considered the highest act of worship. A man could marry his sister, daughter, or mother in this system.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Forrest, Satnam Mendoza.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/703621262|title=Witches, whores, and sorcerers : the concept of evil in early Iran|date=2011|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8, Prods O.|isbn=978-0-292-72687-1|edition=1st ed|location=Austin|oclc=703621262}}</ref> Zoroastrian religious text provide unequivocal evidence for the desirability and occurrence of nuclear family incest in order to \"preserve the purity of the race, to increase the compatibility of husband and wife, and to increase affection for children\"<ref name=\":1\">de Menasce, J.

The hymen is suppose to be broken by either a woman's brother or her father, as this is property of the family, and it would be considered shameful if it was broken by or her virginity was in possession of a stranger or a foreign enemy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ebrahimnejad|first=Hormoz|date=2015-11-02|title=A Social History of Sexual Relations in Iran|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00210862.2014.993533|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=48|issue=6|pages=967\u2013970|doi=10.1080/00210862.2014.993533|issn=0021-0862}}</ref> A family would therefore never have to see their daughter being married off to other tribes.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the Zoroastrian version of Dante's Inferno, Book of Arda Wiraz 49, where a visitor to hell esquires about the sin committed by a woman entangled in a serpent that crawls into her mouth is given the explanation, \"This is the soul of that wicked woman who violated the next-of-kin marriage\" (who, in other words, refused to have sex with her father, brother, or son and therefore wound up in hell) <ref>Vahman, F.

Unlike incest in Egypt, or Rome, or Medieval European royalty, this form of nuclear family incest was not relegated to just royalty but was widely popular among all facets of society from slaves, to free men, to the middle class, aristocrats and royalty. Nuclear family incest resulting in progeny was a far cry from an exclusively or even predominantly royal custom.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Non-Persian Sources==\nPersians who immigrated from their homeland in Persia and live across various nations practiced brother-sister incest marriages, and in historical sources are refereed to as Magians, or Majoosi as called by the Arab dialects.<ref name=\":0\" /> There are 60 outside sources referencing Zoroastrian Persian brother-sister incest marriages come from the Greeks, Romans, Armenians, Arabians, Indians, Tibetans, and Chinese, ranging from the 5th century B.C. into the 15th century A.D, roughly 2000 years.<ref name=\":0\" /> Due to the method of Islamic conquests, where newly conquered territory would be allowed to keep their customs and practices as long as they submitted and paid their taxes<ref name=\":4\">Choksy, J.K.

''Syrische Rechtsbiicher'', 3, Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1914.</ref>\n\n=== Islamic ===\nMuslim writers have cited this tradition. For example, [[Al-Tha'alibi]] writes that Zoroastrian legalized marriage between brothers and sisters and fathers and daughters because Adam had married his sons to his daughters. [[Al-Masudi]] cites Zoroastrian incest and reports that [[Ardashir I]] told his people to marry close relatives to strengthen family ties. [[Ferdowsi]] mentions incest between Bahman and his sister Homa.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/marriage-next-of-kin</ref>\n\n=== Jewish ===\nJewish philosopher [[Philo]] has mentioned the marriage of high-ranking Iranians to their mothers and the high status of the children of these links.\n\n=== Christian ===\nThe most comprehensive reports come from [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] who lived under Persian rule, they wrote down that these were not just fictitious stories of far away people, but were indeed very real and widely practiced. Iso'bokht, the [[Church of the East|Nestorian]] patriarch of the [[Persis]] writes many books on this topic urging Christians and other peoples to not practice this custom.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Greek===\nThe common feature of non-Iranian sources is that they rarely mention the Iranians themselves, even if they do occasionally mention the [[majus]] clerics.
