The MAT-49 used a [[Stamping (metalworking)|machine stamping process]] which allowed the economical production of large numbers of submachine guns, then urgently required by the French Government for use by Army, [[French Foreign Legion]] as well as airborne and colonial forces.\n\nProduction continued at Tulle until the mid-1960s, then switched to the [[Manufacture d'armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne]] plant (MAS), where the weapon was produced until 1979. In that same year, the French armed forces adopted the [[FAMAS]] [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56 mm NATO]] [[assault rifle]], and the MAT-49 was gradually phased out of service in favor of the bullpup FAMAS\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Mortier2.jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers of the [[2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment|2e REP]] storming [[Kolwezi]] in 1978]]\nThe MAT-49 saw widespread combat use during the [[First Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]], as well as the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name=\"SA\">http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2508</ref><ref name=\"LEU\">Leulliette, Pierre, ''St. Michael and the dragon;: Memoirs of a paratrooper'', New York:Houghton, Mifflin & Co. (1964), p. 29</ref> The weapon found considerable favor with airborne and mechanized troops, who prized it for its simplicity, ruggedness, firepower and compactness.<ref name=\"LEU\"/>\n\nAfter French forces left [[Indochina]], the [[Vietnam People's Army|People's Army of Vietnam]] and [[Viet Minh]] converted many captured MAT-49s to the Soviet [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev|7.62 mm Tokarev]] pistol cartridge, then available in large quantities from the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. These converted versions could be distinguished by a longer barrel and a higher rate of fire at 900 rpm.<ref name=\"5RAR\">http://www.5rar.asn.au/weapons/mat49.htm</ref><ref>http://www.virginia1774.org/DIA-ST-HB-07-03-74.pdf</ref>\n\nNorth Vietnam covertly provided MAT-49s to anti-French occupation groups during the Algerian War after the French left Indochina.<ref>https://www.forgottenweapons.com/vietnamese-guns-for-algeria/</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe MAT-49 had a short, retractable wire stock, which when extended gave the weapon a length of {{convert|720|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the magazine well and magazine could be folded forward parallel to the barrel for parachute jump or with a 45\u00b0 angle hence allowing a safe carry until the magazine well is brought back to vertical position before opening fire. Barrel length is {{convert|230|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with some police-issue weapons manufactured with extended barrels and non-retractable wooden stocks. As issued, the MAT-49 fires a [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge, using a single-column 20-round magazine for desert use or 32-round similar to the [[Sten]] magazine.\n\nThe MAT-49 is [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]]-operated and box magazine-fed, with a rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute on full auto. The MAT 49/54, a modified MAT-49s manufactured for police forces, had two triggers, allowing use of full-auto fire or single shots, but most were manufactured as full-auto only. Minus magazine, the MAT-49 weighs about {{convert|3.5|kg|lb|abbr=off}}, which renders it somewhat heavy for a submachine gun. The weapon incorporates a [[grip safety]] which is located on the backside of the pistol grip. The rear sights are flip-up and \"L\"-shaped, and marked for a range of {{convert|50|and|100|m|yds|sp=us}}. Production ceased after the introduction of the [[FAMAS]] assault rifle in 1979.\n\n==Variants==\n*[[MAS-48]] - prototype variant.\n*MAT-49 - main variant.\n*MAT-49/54 - gendarme variant with extended barrel and fixed stock.\n*MAT-49 silenced - variant fitted with a [[suppressor]].<ref name=\"SA\"/>\n*K-43 (or MAT-49 M) - variant modified by the [[Viet Minh]], firing in [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev]]. It had a longer barrel and a higher rate of fire (900 rpm). Spare parts were still produced in the 1970s, the gun being used by the guerilla [[Viet Cong]].<ref name=\"Vietnam\">{{cite book|title=Personal firepower|first=Edward Clinton|last= Ezell|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1988|series=The Illustrated history of the Vietnam War 15|oclc=1036801376|url=https://archive.org/details/personalfirepowe00ezel|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/personalfirepowe00ezel/page/18 18], 35, 42}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:MAT-49.svg|MAT-49: left and right views; view with stock retracted and magazine in safe position\nFile:MAT-49 54.svg|Police MAT-49/54 model\n</gallery>\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

(1964), p. 29</ref> The weapon found considerable favor with airborne and mechanized troops, who prized it for its simplicity, ruggedness, firepower and compactness.<ref name=\"LEU\"/>\n\nAfter French forces left [[Indochina]], the [[Vietnam People's Army|People's Army of Vietnam]] and [[Viet Minh]] converted many captured MAT-49s to the Soviet [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev|7.62 mm Tokarev]] pistol cartridge, then available in large quantities from the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. These converted versions could be distinguished by a longer barrel and a higher rate of fire at 900 rpm.<ref name=\"5RAR\">http://www.5rar.asn.au/weapons/mat49.htm</ref><ref>http://www.virginia1774.org/DIA-ST-HB-07-03-74.pdf</ref>\n\nNorth Vietnam covertly provided MAT-49s to anti-French occupation groups during the Algerian War after the French left Indochina.<ref>https://www.forgottenweapons.com/vietnamese-guns-for-algeria/</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe MAT-49 had a short, retractable wire stock, which when extended gave the weapon a length of {{convert|720|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the magazine well and magazine could be folded forward parallel to the barrel for parachute jump or with a 45\u00b0 angle hence allowing a safe carry until the magazine well is brought back to vertical position before opening fire. Barrel length is {{convert|230|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with some police-issue weapons manufactured with extended barrels and non-retractable wooden stocks. As issued, the MAT-49 fires a [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge, using a single-column 20-round magazine for desert use or 32-round similar to the [[Sten]] magazine.\n\nThe MAT-49 is [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]]-operated and box magazine-fed, with a rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute on full auto. The MAT 49/54, a modified MAT-49s manufactured for police forces, had two triggers, allowing use of full-auto fire or single shots, but most were manufactured as full-auto only. Minus magazine, the MAT-49 weighs about {{convert|3.5|kg|lb|abbr=off}}, which renders it somewhat heavy for a submachine gun. The weapon incorporates a [[grip safety]] which is located on the backside of the pistol grip. The rear sights are flip-up and \"L\"-shaped, and marked for a range of {{convert|50|and|100|m|yds|sp=us}}. Production ceased after the introduction of the [[FAMAS]] assault rifle in 1979.\n\n==Variants==\n*[[MAS-48]] - prototype variant.\n*MAT-49 - main variant.\n*MAT-49/54 - gendarme variant with extended barrel and fixed stock.\n*MAT-49 silenced - variant fitted with a [[suppressor]].<ref name=\"SA\"/>\n*K-43 (or MAT-49 M) - variant modified by the [[Viet Minh]], firing in [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev]]. It had a longer barrel and a higher rate of fire (900 rpm). Spare parts were still produced in the 1970s, the gun being used by the [[Viet Cong]].<ref name=\"Vietnam\">{{cite book|title=Personal firepower|first=Edward Clinton|last= Ezell|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1988|series=The Illustrated history of the Vietnam War 15|oclc=1036801376|url=https://archive.org/details/personalfirepowe00ezel|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/personalfirepowe00ezel/page/18 18], 35, 42}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:MAT-49.svg|MAT-49: left and right views; view with stock retracted and magazine in safe position\nFile:MAT-49 54.svg|Police MAT-49/54 model\n</gallery>\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

While ongoing disagreement about exact stages exists, many economists have posited the following general states. These states are not mutually exclusive and do not represent a fixed order of historical change, but do represent a broadly chronological trend.\n* ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' capitalism, a social system in which there is no government intervention in the economy.\n* Agrarian capitalism, sometimes known as market feudalism. This was a transitional form between feudalism and capitalism, whereby market relations replaced some but not all feudal relations in a society.\n* [[Mercantilism]], where national governments sought to maintain positive balances of trade and acquire gold bullion.\n* [[Industrial capitalism]], characterized by its use of heavy machinery and a much more pronounced division of labor.\n* [[Monopoly capitalism]], marked by the rise of monopolies and trusts dominating industry and other aspects of society. Often used to describe the economy of the late 19th and early 20th century.\n* [[Colonialism]], where governments sought to colonize other areas to improve access to markets and raw materials and assist state-owned capitalist firms.\n* [[Welfare capitalism]], where mixed economies predominated and governments sought to provide a safety net to alleviate the worst abuses of capitalism. The heyday of welfare capitalism (in advanced economies) is widely seen to be from 1945 to 1973 as major social safety nets were put in place in most advanced capitalist economies.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Bookmarks| isbn = 978-1-898876-55-7| last = Harman| first = Chris| title = A People's History of the World| location = London| date = 1999| pages = 251\u2013397}}</ref>\n* [[Mass production]], post-World War II, saw the rising power of major corporations and a focus on mass production, mass consumption and (ideally) mass employment.

One is associated with [[economic liberalism]], with the eighteenth-century economist [[Adam Smith]] as a foundational figure. The other is associated with [[Marxism]], drawing particular inspiration from the nineteenth-century economist [[Karl Marx]]. Liberals tend to view capitalism as an expression of natural human behaviors that have been in evidence for millennia and the most beneficial way of promoting human well being. They tend to see capitalism as originating in trade and commerce, and freeing people to exercise their entrepreneurial natures. Marxists tend to view capitalism as a historically unusual system of relationships between classes, which could be replaced by other economic systems that would serve human well being better. They tend to see capitalism as originating in more powerful people taking control of the means of production, and compelling others to sell their labour as a commodity.<ref name=\"Ellen Meiksins Wood 2002\"/> For these reasons, much of the work on the history of capitalism has been [[Marxist historiography|broadly Marxist]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Origins of capitalism ===\nThe origins of capitalism have been much debated (and depend partly on how capitalism is defined). The traditional account, originating in classical eighteenth-century liberal economic thought and still often articulated, is the 'commercialization model.' This sees capitalism originating in trade. Since evidence for trade is found even in paleolithic culture, it can be seen as natural to human societies. In this reading, capitalism emerged from earlier trade once merchants had acquired sufficient wealth (referred to as '[[primitive capital]]') to begin investing in increasingly productive technology. This account tends to see capitalism as a continuation of trade, arising when people's natural entrepreneurialism was freed from the constraints of [[feudalism]], partly by urbanization.<ref>Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002.), pp. 11\u201321.</ref> Thus it traces capitalism to early forms of [[merchant capitalism]] practiced in Western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"Banaji\">Jairus Banaji (2007), \"Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism\", ''Journal Historical Materialism'' 15#1 pp. 47\u201374, Brill Publishers.</ref> \n\n====Role of Dutch-speaking regions in the rise of modern capitalism====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =  A 400-year history of global [[finance capitalism]]\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = MG 056-De Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Courtyard of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (or [[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser]] in Dutch), a powerhouse of [[Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch capitalism]] in the 17th century.

These operated in the interstices between the tributary states and empires, and though they were agents of commodification, they existed within larger systems in which the logic of state-based coercion remained dominant.

This notes that traditional mercantilism focused on moving goods from markets where they were cheap to markets where they were expensive rather than investing in production, and that many cultures (including the early modern [[Dutch Republic]]) saw urbanisation, and merchants amassing great wealth, without capitalist production emerging.<ref>Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), pp. 11\u201321.</ref><ref>Chris Harman, '[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj102/harman.htm The Rise of Capitalism]', ''International Socialism Journal'', 102 (Spring 2004).</ref> The 'agrarian model' instead argues that capitalism arose from unique circumstances in English agrarianism.\n\nThe agrarian argument developed particularly through [[Karl Polanyi]]'s ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'' (1944), [[Maurice Dobb]]'s ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism'' (1946), and [[Robert Brenner]]'s research in the 1970s, the discussion of which is known as the [[Brenner Debate]]. In the wake of the [[Norman Conquest]], the English state was unusually centralised. This gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means (not least the threat of violence). England's centralisation also meant that an unusual number of English farmers were not peasants (with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence) but [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] (renting their land). These circumstances produced a market in leases. Landlords, lacking other ways to extract wealth, were motivated to rent to tenants who could pay the most, while tenants, lacking security of tenure, were motivated to farm as productively as possible to win leases in a competitive market. This led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists; unsuccessful ones became wage-labourers, required to sell their labour in order to live; and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land, not least through the [[enclosures]]. In this reading, 'it was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism. The transformation of social property relations was firmly rooted in the countryside, and the transformation of England's trade and industry was result more than cause of England's transition to capitalism'.<ref>Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), quoting p. 129.</ref>\n\nThe present article includes both perspectives.\n\n=== Twenty-first-century developments ===\nThe twenty-first century has seen renewed interest in the history of capitalism, and \"History of Capitalism\" has become a field in its own right, with courses in history departments.

A creation story|oclc=984907212}}</ref>, the modern capitalist system originated in the \"[[crisis of the Late Middle Ages]]\", a conflict between the land-owning aristocracy and the agricultural producers, or [[Serfdom|serfs]]. [[Manorial]] arrangements inhibited the development of capitalism in a number of ways.  Serfs had obligations to produce for lords and therefore had no interest in technological innovation; they also had no interest in cooperating with one another because they produced to sustain their own families. The lords who owned the land{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} relied on force to guarantee that received sufficient food. Because lords were not producing to sell on the market, there was no competitive pressure for them to innovate. Finally, because lords expanded their power and wealth through military means, they spent their wealth on military equipment or on [[conspicuous consumption]] that helped foster alliances with other lords; they had no incentive to invest in developing new productive technologies.<ref>Brenner, Robert, 1977, \"The Origins of Capitalist Development: a Critique of Neo-Smithian Marxism,\" in ''New Left Review'' 104: 36\u201337, 46</ref>\n\nThe [[Medieval demography|demographic]] crisis of the fourteenth century upset this arrangement. This crisis had several causes: agricultural productivity reached its technological limitations and stopped growing, bad weather led to the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317|Great Famine]] of 1315\u20131317, and the [[Black Death]] of 1348\u20131350 led to a population crash. These factors led to a decline in agricultural production. In response, [[feudal lord]]s sought to expand agricultural production by extending their domains through warfare; they therefore demanded more tribute from their serfs to pay for military expenses. In England, many serfs rebelled. Some moved to towns, some purchased land, and some entered into favorable contracts to rent lands from lords who needed to repopulate their estates.<ref>Dobb, Maurice 1947  ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism.''  New York: International Publishers Co., Inc. 42\u201346, 48 ff.</ref>\n\nThe collapse of the ''[[Manorialism|manorial]]'' system in England enlarged the class of [[tenant farmer]]s with more freedom to market their goods and thus more incentive to invest in new technologies. Lords who did not want to rely on renters could buy out or evict tenant farmers, but then had to hire free labor to work their estates, giving them an incentive to invest in two very different kinds of commodity owners. One kind was those who had money, the means of production, and subsistence, who were eager to [[valorisation|valorize]] the sum of value they had appropriated by buying the labor power of others.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The other kind was free workers, who sold their own labor. The free workers were \"free workers\" in the double sense that they neither formed part of the means of production nor owned the means of production that transformed land and even money into what we now call \"capital\".<ref>Marx, Karl [1867] 1976 ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy Volume One'' trans.

Feudalism was mostly confined to Europe{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and lasted from the medieval period through the sixteenth century. Feudal manors were almost entirely self-sufficient, and therefore limited the role of the market. This stifled any incipient tendency towards capitalism. However, the relatively sudden emergence of new technologies and discoveries, particularly in agriculture<ref>James Fulcher, Capitalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004) 19</ref> and exploration, facilitated the growth of capitalism. The most important development at the end of feudalism{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} was the emergence of what Robert Degan calls \"the dichotomy between wage earners and capitalist merchants\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1=Degen\n| first1=Robert A.\n| title=The Triumph of Capitalism\n| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0YFlzAAUqv0C\n| publisher=Transaction Publishers\n| location= New Brunswick, New Jersey\n| publication-date = 2011\n| page=12\n| isbn=9781412809856\n| accessdate = 2016-01-13\n| quote= By the early 1400s, power came to be shared in an arrangement giving representation to various segments of the social order, but the dichotomy between wage earners and capitalist merchants remained.\n| date=2011-12-31\n}}\n</ref> The competitive nature meant there are always winners and losers, and this became clear as feudalism evolved into mercantilism, an economic system characterized by the private or corporate ownership of capital goods, investments determined by private decisions, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods determined mainly by competition in a free market.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Enclosure===\n{{Main article|Enclosure}}\n[[File:Decaying hedge - geograph.org.uk - 1715089.jpg|thumb|300px|Decaying hedges mark the lines of the straight field boundaries created by a Parliamentary Act of Enclosure.]]\nEngland in the 16th century was already a centralized state, in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and a disproportionately large capital city, [[London]].<ref>Ellen Meikisins Wood, ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', 2nd edn (London: Verso, 2002), p. 99.</ref> The capital acted as a central market for the entire country, creating a large internal market for goods, in contrast to the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the [[Continental Europe|Continent]]. The economic foundations of the agricultural system were also beginning to diverge substantially; the manorial system had broken down by this time, and land began to be concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. The system put pressure on both the landlords and the tenants to increase agricultural productivity to create profit. The weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try out better methods. The tenants also had an incentive to improve their methods to succeed in an increasingly competitive [[labour market]]. Land rents had moved away from the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation, and were becoming directly subject to economic market forces.\n\nAn important aspect of this process of change was the [[enclosure of common land|enclosure]]<ref>\"Enclosure\" is the modern spelling, while \"inclosure\" is an older spelling still used in the United Kingdom in [[legal document]]s and [[place name]]s.</ref> of the [[common land]] previously held in the [[open field system]] where peasants had traditional rights, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] and [[grazing]] [[livestock]]. Once enclosed, these uses of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be land for commons. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands.\n\n[[Marxist historiography|Marxist and neo-Marxist historians]] argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit. This created a landless [[working class]] that provided the labour required in the new industries developing in the [[north of England]].

An early statement on national balance of trade appeared in ''Discourse of the Common Weal of this Realm of England'', 1549: \"We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them.\"<ref>Now attributed to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]; quoted in {{Harvtxt|Braudel|1979}}, p. 204.</ref> The period featured various but often disjointed efforts by the court of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] to develop a naval and merchant fleet capable of challenging the Spanish stranglehold on trade and of expanding the growth of bullion at home. Queen Elizabeth promoted the Trade and Navigation Acts in Parliament and issued orders to her navy for the protection and promotion of English shipping.\n\nThese efforts organized national resources sufficiently in the defense of England against the far larger and more powerful [[Spanish Empire]], and in turn paved the foundation for establishing a global empire in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The authors noted most for establishing the English mercantilist system include [[Gerard de Malynes]] and [[Thomas Mun]], who first articulated the [[Elizabethan System]]. The latter's  ''England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, or the Balance of our Forraign Trade is The Rule of Our Treasure'' gave a systematic and coherent explanation of the concept of [[balance of trade]]. It was written in the 1620s and published in 1664.<ref>{{cite book |author1=David Onnekink|author2=Gijs Rommelse|title=Ideology and Foreign Policy in Early Modern Europe (1650\u20131750)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1QdbzdTimsC&pg=PA257|year= 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=257|isbn=9781409419143}}</ref> Mercantile doctrines were further developed by [[Josiah Child]]. Numerous French authors helped to cement French policy around mercantilism in the 17th century. [[French mercantilism]] was best articulated by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (in office, 1665\u20131683), although his policies were greatly liberalised under [[Napoleon]].\n\n===Doctrines===\nUnder mercantilism, European merchants, backed by state controls, [[subsidy|subsidies]], and monopolies, made most of their profits from buying and selling goods. In the words of [[Francis Bacon]], the purpose of mercantilism was \"the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices...\"<ref>Quoted in Sir George Clark, ''The Seventeenth Century'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1961), p. 24.</ref> Similar practices of economic regimentation had begun earlier in medieval towns. However, under mercantilism, given the contemporaneous rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], the state superseded the local [[guild]]s as the regulator of the economy.\n[[File:De slag bij Terheide - The Battle of Schevening - August 10 1653 (Willem van de Velde I, 1657).jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] were fought between the English and the Dutch for control over the seas and trade routes.]]\nAmong the major tenets of mercantilist theory was [[bullionism]], a doctrine stressing the importance of accumulating [[precious metals]]. Mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals. Mercantilists asserted that only raw materials that could not be extracted at home should be imported. They promoted the idea that government subsidies, such as granting monopolies and protective [[tariff]]s, were necessary to encourage home production of manufactured goods.\n\nProponents of mercantilism emphasized state power and overseas conquest as the principal aim of economic policy. If a state could not supply its own raw materials, according to the mercantilists, it should acquire colonies from which they could be extracted. Colonies constituted not only sources of raw materials but also markets for finished products. Because it was not in the interests of the state to allow competition, to help the mercantilists, colonies should be prevented from engaging in manufacturing and trading with foreign powers.\n\nMercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods.<ref name=\"Scott 2005\" /> Noting the various pre-capitalist features of mercantilism, [[Karl Polanyi]] argued that \"mercantilism, with all its tendency toward commercialization, never attacked the safeguards which protected [the] two basic elements of production \u2013 labor and land \u2013 from becoming the elements of commerce.\" Thus mercantilist regulation was more akin to feudalism than capitalism. According to Polanyi, \"not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date.\"<ref>Polanyi, Karl. ''The Great Transformation''. Beacon Press, Boston. 1944. p. 87</ref>\n\n===Chartered trading companies===\n[[File:Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg|225px|thumb|right|150px|British East India Company 1801]]\nThe [[Muscovy Company]] was the first major [[chartered company|chartered]] [[Joint stock company|joint stock]] English [[trading company]]. It was established in 1555 with a [[monopoly]] on [[trade]] between England and [[Muscovy]]. It was an offshoot of the earlier ''[[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]'', founded in 1551 by [[Richard Chancellor]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] and Sir [[Hugh Willoughby (sea captain)|Hugh Willoughby]] to locate the [[Northeast Passage]] to China to allow trade. This was the precursor to a type of business that would soon flourish in England, the [[Dutch Republic]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe British [[East India Company]] (1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (1602) launched an era of large state chartered trading companies.<ref name=\"Banaji\" /><ref name=\"britannica2\">{{cite book|title=Economic system :: Market systems|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178493/economic-system/61117/Market-systems#toc242146|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|year=2006}}</ref> These companies were characterized by their monopoly on trade, granted by [[letters patent]] provided by the state.

However, in more undeveloped economies, such as [[Prussia]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], with their much younger manufacturing bases, mercantilism continued to find favor after other states had turned to newer doctrines.\n\nThe mid-18th century gave rise to industrial capitalism, made possible by (1) the accumulation of vast amounts of capital under the merchant phase of capitalism and its investment in machinery, and (2) the fact that the enclosures meant that Britain had a large population of people with no access to subsistence agriculture, who needed to buy basic commodities via the market, ensuring a mass consumer market.<ref>[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), pp. 142\u201346.</ref> Industrial capitalism, which Marx dated from the last third of the 18th century, marked the development of the factory system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex [[division of labor]] between and within work processes and the routinization of work tasks. Industrial capitalism finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production.<ref name=\"Burnham 2003\"/>\n\nDuring the resulting [[Industrial Revolution]], the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system, which led to the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of [[artisan]]s, [[guild]]s, and [[journeyman|journeymen]]. Also during this period, capitalism transformed relations between the British landowning gentry and peasants, giving rise to the production of [[cash crop]]s for the market rather than for subsistence on a [[feudal]] [[Manorialism|manor]]. The surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture.\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n{{main article|Industrial Revolution}}\nThe productivity gains of capitalist production began a sustained and unprecedented increase at the turn of the 19th century, in a process commonly referred to as the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Starting in about 1760 in England, there was a steady transition to new manufacturing processes in a variety of industries, including going from hand production methods to machine production, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of [[water wheel|water power]], the increasing use of steam power and the development of [[machine tool]]s. It also included the change from wood and other [[bio-fuels]] to coal.\n\n[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spinning mule]], built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].]]\nIn [[textile manufacturing]], mechanized cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of about 1000, due to the application of [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]], [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]], [[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[Spinning Mule]] and other inventions.

Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving wool and linen, although they were not as great as in cotton.\n\n===Finance===\n[[File:Frankfurt Taunusbahnhof 1850.jpg|thumb|The [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild family]] revolutionised international finance. The [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|Frankfurt terminus]] of the [[Taunus Railway]] was financed by the Rothschilds and opened in 1840 as one of Germany's first railways.]]\nThe growth of Britain's industry stimulated a concomitant growth in her system of [[finance]] and [[credit (finance)|credit]]. In the 18th century, services offered by banks increased. Clearing facilities, security investments, [[cheque]]s and [[overdraft]] protections were introduced. [[Cheque]]s had been invented in the 17th century in England, and banks settled payments by direct courier to the issuing bank.  Around 1770, they began meeting in a central location, and by the 19th century a dedicated space was established, known as a [[bankers' clearing house]].  The London clearing house used a method where each bank paid cash to and then was paid cash by an inspector at the end of each day. The first overdraft facility was set up in 1728 by [[The Royal Bank of Scotland]].\n\nThe end of the [[Napoleonic War]] and the subsequent rebound in trade led to an expansion in the [[bullion]] reserves held by the [[Bank of England]], from a low of under 4 million pounds in 1821 to 14&nbsp;million pounds by late 1824.\n\nOlder innovations became routine parts of financial life during the 19th century. The [[Bank of England]] first issued bank notes during the 17th century, but the notes were hand written and few in number. After 1725, they were partially printed, but cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to a named person. In 1844, parliament passed the [[Bank Charter Act]] tying these notes to [[gold reserves]], effectively creating the institution of [[central bank]]ing and [[monetary policy]]. The notes became fully printed and widely available from 1855.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nGrowing international trade increased the number of banks, especially in London. These new \"merchant banks\" facilitated trade growth, profiting from England's emerging dominance in seaborne shipping. Two immigrant families, [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and [[Barings Bank|Baring]], established merchant banking firms in London in the late 18th century and came to dominate world banking in the next century. The tremendous wealth amassed by these banking firms soon attracted much attention. The poet [[George Gordon Byron]] wrote in 1823: \"Who makes politics run glibber all?/ The shade of Bonaparte's noble daring?/ Jew [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and his fellow-Christian, Baring.\"\n\nThe operation of banks also shifted. At the beginning of the century, banking was still an elite preoccupation of a handful of very wealthy families. Within a few decades, however, a new sort of banking had emerged, owned by anonymous [[stockholder]]s, run by professional [[Management|managers]], and the recipient of the deposits of a growing body of small middle-class savers. Although this new breed of banks was new in prominence, it was not newly invented \u2013 the [[Quaker]] family [[Barclays Bank|Barclays]], had been banking in this manner since 1690.\n\n===Free trade and globalization===\nAt the height of the [[First French Empire]], [[Napoleon]] sought to introduce a \"[[continental system]]\" that would render Europe economically autonomous, thereby emasculating British trade and commerce. It involved such stratagems as the use of [[Sugar beet|beet sugar]] in preference to the cane sugar that had to be imported from the tropics. Although this caused businessmen in England to agitate for peace, the government was able to persevere, in part because the United Kingdom was well into the [[industrial revolution]]. The war had the opposite effect \u2013 it stimulated the growth of certain industries like [[pig iron|pig-iron]] output, which was just 68,000 tons in 1788 and soared to 244,000 tons by 1806.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|left|19th-century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] become the first global economic [[superpower]], because of superior manufacturing technology and improved global communications such as [[steamship]]s and [[railroad]]s.]]\nIn 1817, [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens, in the famous theory of]] [[comparative advantage]], showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong. In [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]], Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in [[economics]]:\n\n: ''When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.''\n\nBy the mid 19th century, Britain was firmly wedded to the notion of [[free trade]], and the first era of globalization began.<ref name=\"Burnham 2003\" /> In the 1840s, the [[Corn Laws]] and the [[Navigation Acts]] were repealed, ushering in a new age of free trade. In line with the teachings of the classical political economists, led by [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]], Britain embraced [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], encouraging competition and the development of a [[market economy]].\n\n[[Industrialization]] allowed cheap production of household items using [[economies of scale]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. Nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] decisively shaped globalization in this period. After the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s and the completion of the British conquest of India, vast populations of these regions became ready consumers of European exports. During this period, areas of [[Sub Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] Africa and the Pacific islands were incorporated into the world system. Meanwhile, the European conquest of new parts of the globe, notably sub-Saharan Africa, yielded valuable natural resources such as [[rubber]], [[diamonds]] and [[coal]] and helped fuel trade and investment between the European imperial powers, their colonies, and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/tr_show01.html |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date=1929-10-24 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref>\n\n[[File:McKinley Prosperity.jpg|thumb|200x200px|The [[gold standard]] formed the financial basis of the international economy from 1870 to 1914.]]\n{{cquote| The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea, the various products of the whole earth, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep.

The [[Suez canal]] opened in 1869, the same year in which the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] that spanned the North American continent was completed. Capitalism and the engine of profit were making the globe a smaller place.\n\n==Twentieth century==\nSeveral major challenges to capitalism appeared in the early part of the 20th century.  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]] in 1917 established the first socialist state in the world; a decade later, the [[Great Depression]] triggered increasing criticism of the existing capitalist system.

Today, these trends have bolstered the argument that capitalism should now be viewed as a truly [[world system]] (Burnham).  However, other thinkers argue that globalization, even in its quantitative degree, is no greater now than during earlier periods of capitalist trade.<ref>[[Doug Henwood]] is an economist who has argued that the heyday of globalization was during the mid-19th century.  For example, he writes in ''What Is Globalization Anyway?'':\n<blockquote>Not only is the novelty of \"globalization\" exaggerated, so is its extent. Capital flows were freer, and foreign holdings by British investors far larger, 100 years ago than anything we see today.

Clark argues that, in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production, and women played a vital role in running farms and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor, with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on women.<ref>Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).</ref> By contrast, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.<ref>Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).</ref> Tilly and Scott have emphasized the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history. In the preindustrial era, production was mostly for home use, and women produced many household needs. The second stage was the \"family wage economy\" of early industrialization. During this stage, the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife, and older children. The third, or modern, stage is the \"family consumer economy,\" in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.<ref>Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n* [[Brenner debate]]\n* [[ Capitalism and Islam ]]\n* [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|Capitalist mode of production]]\n*[[Enclosure]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution]]\n* [[Fernand Braudel]]\n* [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]]\n* [[History of capitalist theory]]\n* [[History of globalization]]\n* [[History of private equity and venture capital]]\n* [[Primitive accumulation of capital]]\n* [[Protestant work ethic]]\n* [[Simple commodity production]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- Items to be listed in alphabetical order of author's surname, followed by items without an author listed in order of title -->\n* Appleby, Joyce.

The heyday of welfare capitalism (in advanced economies) is widely seen to be from 1945 to 1973 as major social safety nets were put in place in most advanced capitalist economies.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Bookmarks| isbn = 978-1-898876-55-7| last = Harman| first = Chris| title = A People's History of the World| location = London| date = 1999| pages = 251\u2013397}}</ref>\n* [[Mass production]], post-World War II, saw the rising power of major corporations and a focus on mass production, mass consumption and (ideally) mass employment.

Debates sometimes circle around how to bring substantive historical data to bear on key questions.<ref>Richard Biernacki, review of Ellen Meiksins Wood (1999), ''[[The Origin of Capitalism]]'' (Monthly Review Press, 1999), in ''Contemporary Sociology,'' Vol. 29, No. 4 (Jul., 2000), pp. 638\u201339 {{JSTOR|2654574}}.</ref> Key parameters of debate include: how far capitalism is a natural human behavior and how far it arises from specific historical circumstances; whether its origins lie in towns and trade or in rural property relations; the role of class conflict; the role of the state; the extent to which capitalism is a distinctively European innovation; its relationship with European imperialism; whether technological change is a driver or merely an epiphenomenon of capitalism; and whether or not it is the most beneficial way to organize human societies.<ref name=\"Ellen Meiksins Wood 2002\">Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''[[The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View]]'' (London: Verso, 2002).</ref>\n\nThe historiography of capitalism can be divided into two broad schools. One is associated with [[economic liberalism]], with the eighteenth-century economist [[Adam Smith]] as a foundational figure. The other is associated with [[Marxism]], drawing particular inspiration from the nineteenth-century economist [[Karl Marx]]. Liberals tend to view capitalism as an expression of natural human behaviors that have been in evidence for millennia and the most beneficial way of promoting human well being. They tend to see capitalism as originating in trade and commerce, and freeing people to exercise their entrepreneurial natures. Marxists tend to view capitalism as a historically unusual system of relationships between classes, which could be replaced by other economic systems that would serve human well being better. They tend to see capitalism as originating in more powerful people taking control of the means of production, and compelling others to sell their labour as a commodity.<ref name=\"Ellen Meiksins Wood 2002\"/> For these reasons, much of the work on the history of capitalism has been [[Marxist historiography|broadly Marxist]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Origins of capitalism ===\nThe origins of capitalism have been much debated (and depend partly on how capitalism is defined). The traditional account, originating in classical eighteenth-century liberal economic thought and still often articulated, is the 'commercialization model.' This sees capitalism originating in trade.

These operated in the interstices between the tributary states and empires, and though they were agents of commodification, they existed within larger systems in which the logic of state-based coercion remained dominant.

This notes that traditional mercantilism focused on moving goods from markets where they were cheap to markets where they were expensive rather than investing in production, and that many cultures (including the early modern [[Dutch Republic]]) saw urbanisation, and merchants amassing great wealth, without capitalist production emerging.<ref>Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), pp. 11\u201321.</ref><ref>Chris Harman, '[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj102/harman.htm The Rise of Capitalism]', ''International Socialism Journal'', 102 (Spring 2004).</ref> The 'agrarian model' instead argues that capitalism arose from unique circumstances in English agrarianism.\n\nThe agrarian argument developed particularly through [[Karl Polanyi]]'s ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'' (1944), [[Maurice Dobb]]'s ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism'' (1946), and [[Robert Brenner]]'s research in the 1970s, the discussion of which is known as the [[Brenner Debate]]. In the wake of the [[Norman Conquest]], the English state was unusually centralised. This gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means (not least the threat of violence). England's centralisation also meant that an unusual number of English farmers were not peasants (with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence) but [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] (renting their land). These circumstances produced a market in leases. Landlords, lacking other ways to extract wealth, were motivated to rent to tenants who could pay the most, while tenants, lacking security of tenure, were motivated to farm as productively as possible to win leases in a competitive market. This led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists; unsuccessful ones became wage-labourers, required to sell their labour in order to live; and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land, not least through the [[enclosures]]. In this reading, 'it was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism. The transformation of social property relations was firmly rooted in the countryside, and the transformation of England's trade and industry was result more than cause of England's transition to capitalism'.<ref>Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), quoting p. 129.</ref>\n\nThe present article includes both perspectives.\n\n=== Twenty-first-century developments ===\nThe twenty-first century has seen renewed interest in the history of capitalism, and \"History of Capitalism\" has become a field in its own right, with courses in history departments.

[[Manorial]] arrangements inhibited the development of capitalism in a number of ways.  Serfs had obligations to produce for lords and therefore had no interest in technological innovation; they also had no interest in cooperating with one another because they produced to sustain their own families. The lords who owned the land{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} relied on force to guarantee that received sufficient food. Because lords were not producing to sell on the market, there was no competitive pressure for them to innovate. Finally, because lords expanded their power and wealth through military means, they spent their wealth on military equipment or on [[conspicuous consumption]] that helped foster alliances with other lords; they had no incentive to invest in developing new productive technologies.<ref>Brenner, Robert, 1977, \"The Origins of Capitalist Development: a Critique of Neo-Smithian Marxism,\" in ''New Left Review'' 104: 36\u201337, 46</ref>\n\nThe [[Medieval demography|demographic]] crisis of the fourteenth century upset this arrangement. This crisis had several causes: agricultural productivity reached its technological limitations and stopped growing, bad weather led to the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317|Great Famine]] of 1315\u20131317, and the [[Black Death]] of 1348\u20131350 led to a population crash. These factors led to a decline in agricultural production. In response, [[feudal lord]]s sought to expand agricultural production by extending their domains through warfare; they therefore demanded more tribute from their serfs to pay for military expenses. In England, many serfs rebelled. Some moved to towns, some purchased land, and some entered into favorable contracts to rent lands from lords who needed to repopulate their estates.<ref>Dobb, Maurice 1947  ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism.''  New York: International Publishers Co., Inc. 42\u201346, 48 ff.</ref>\n\nThe collapse of the ''[[Manorialism|manorial]]'' system in England enlarged the class of [[tenant farmer]]s with more freedom to market their goods and thus more incentive to invest in new technologies. Lords who did not want to rely on renters could buy out or evict tenant farmers, but then had to hire free labor to work their estates, giving them an incentive to invest in two very different kinds of commodity owners. One kind was those who had money, the means of production, and subsistence, who were eager to [[valorisation|valorize]] the sum of value they had appropriated by buying the labor power of others.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The other kind was free workers, who sold their own labor. The free workers were \"free workers\" in the double sense that they neither formed part of the means of production nor owned the means of production that transformed land and even money into what we now call \"capital\".<ref>Marx, Karl [1867] 1976 ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy Volume One'' trans.

Feudalism was mostly confined to Europe{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and lasted from the medieval period through the sixteenth century. Feudal manors were almost entirely self-sufficient, and therefore limited the role of the market. This stifled any incipient tendency towards capitalism. However, the relatively sudden emergence of new technologies and discoveries, particularly in agriculture<ref>James Fulcher, Capitalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004) 19</ref> and exploration, facilitated the growth of capitalism. The most important development at the end of feudalism{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} was the emergence of what Robert Degan calls \"the dichotomy between wage earners and capitalist merchants\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1=Degen\n| first1=Robert A.\n| title=The Triumph of Capitalism\n| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0YFlzAAUqv0C\n| publisher=Transaction Publishers\n| location= New Brunswick, New Jersey\n| publication-date = 2011\n| page=12\n| isbn=9781412809856\n| accessdate = 2016-01-13\n| quote= By the early 1400s, power came to be shared in an arrangement giving representation to various segments of the social order, but the dichotomy between wage earners and capitalist merchants remained.\n| date=2011-12-31\n}}\n</ref> The competitive nature meant there are always winners and losers, and this became clear as feudalism evolved into mercantilism, an economic system characterized by the private or corporate ownership of capital goods, investments determined by private decisions, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods determined mainly by competition in a free market.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Enclosure===\n{{Main article|Enclosure}}\n[[File:Decaying hedge - geograph.org.uk - 1715089.jpg|thumb|300px|Decaying hedges mark the lines of the straight field boundaries created by a Parliamentary Act of Enclosure.]]\nEngland in the 16th century was already a centralized state, in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and a disproportionately large capital city, [[London]].<ref>Ellen Meikisins Wood, ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', 2nd edn (London: Verso, 2002), p. 99.</ref> The capital acted as a central market for the entire country, creating a large internal market for goods, in contrast to the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the [[Continental Europe|Continent]]. The economic foundations of the agricultural system were also beginning to diverge substantially; the manorial system had broken down by this time, and land began to be concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. The system put pressure on both the landlords and the tenants to increase agricultural productivity to create profit. The weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try out better methods. The tenants also had an incentive to improve their methods to succeed in an increasingly competitive [[labour market]]. Land rents had moved away from the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation, and were becoming directly subject to economic market forces.\n\nAn important aspect of this process of change was the [[enclosure of common land|enclosure]]<ref>\"Enclosure\" is the modern spelling, while \"inclosure\" is an older spelling still used in the United Kingdom in [[legal document]]s and [[place name]]s.</ref> of the [[common land]] previously held in the [[open field system]] where peasants had traditional rights, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] and [[grazing]] [[livestock]]. Once enclosed, these uses of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be land for commons. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands.\n\n[[Marxist historiography|Marxist and neo-Marxist historians]] argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit. This created a landless [[working class]] that provided the labour required in the new industries developing in the [[north of England]].

An early statement on national balance of trade appeared in ''Discourse of the Common Weal of this Realm of England'', 1549: \"We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them.\"<ref>Now attributed to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]; quoted in {{Harvtxt|Braudel|1979}}, p. 204.</ref> The period featured various but often disjointed efforts by the court of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] to develop a naval and merchant fleet capable of challenging the Spanish stranglehold on trade and of expanding the growth of bullion at home. Queen Elizabeth promoted the Trade and Navigation Acts in Parliament and issued orders to her navy for the protection and promotion of English shipping.\n\nThese efforts organized national resources sufficiently in the defense of England against the far larger and more powerful [[Spanish Empire]], and in turn paved the foundation for establishing a global empire in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The authors noted most for establishing the English mercantilist system include [[Gerard de Malynes]] and [[Thomas Mun]], who first articulated the [[Elizabethan System]]. The latter's  ''England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, or the Balance of our Forraign Trade is The Rule of Our Treasure'' gave a systematic and coherent explanation of the concept of [[balance of trade]].

Numerous French authors helped to cement French policy around mercantilism in the 17th century. [[French mercantilism]] was best articulated by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (in office, 1665\u20131683), although his policies were greatly liberalised under [[Napoleon]].\n\n===Doctrines===\nUnder mercantilism, European merchants, backed by state controls, [[subsidy|subsidies]], and monopolies, made most of their profits from buying and selling goods. In the words of [[Francis Bacon]], the purpose of mercantilism was \"the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices...\"<ref>Quoted in Sir George Clark, ''The Seventeenth Century'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1961), p. 24.</ref> Similar practices of economic regimentation had begun earlier in medieval towns. However, under mercantilism, given the contemporaneous rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], the state superseded the local [[guild]]s as the regulator of the economy.\n[[File:De slag bij Terheide - The Battle of Schevening - August 10 1653 (Willem van de Velde I, 1657).jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] were fought between the English and the Dutch for control over the seas and trade routes.]]\nAmong the major tenets of mercantilist theory was [[bullionism]], a doctrine stressing the importance of accumulating [[precious metals]]. Mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals. Mercantilists asserted that only raw materials that could not be extracted at home should be imported. They promoted the idea that government subsidies, such as granting monopolies and protective [[tariff]]s, were necessary to encourage home production of manufactured goods.\n\nProponents of mercantilism emphasized state power and overseas conquest as the principal aim of economic policy. If a state could not supply its own raw materials, according to the mercantilists, it should acquire colonies from which they could be extracted. Colonies constituted not only sources of raw materials but also markets for finished products. Because it was not in the interests of the state to allow competition, to help the mercantilists, colonies should be prevented from engaging in manufacturing and trading with foreign powers.\n\nMercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods.<ref name=\"Scott 2005\" /> Noting the various pre-capitalist features of mercantilism, [[Karl Polanyi]] argued that \"mercantilism, with all its tendency toward commercialization, never attacked the safeguards which protected [the] two basic elements of production \u2013 labor and land \u2013 from becoming the elements of commerce.\" Thus mercantilist regulation was more akin to feudalism than capitalism. According to Polanyi, \"not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date.\"<ref>Polanyi, Karl. ''The Great Transformation''. Beacon Press, Boston. 1944. p. 87</ref>\n\n===Chartered trading companies===\n[[File:Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg|225px|thumb|right|150px|British East India Company 1801]]\nThe [[Muscovy Company]] was the first major [[chartered company|chartered]] [[Joint stock company|joint stock]] English [[trading company]]. It was established in 1555 with a [[monopoly]] on [[trade]] between England and [[Muscovy]]. It was an offshoot of the earlier ''[[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]'', founded in 1551 by [[Richard Chancellor]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] and Sir [[Hugh Willoughby (sea captain)|Hugh Willoughby]] to locate the [[Northeast Passage]] to China to allow trade. This was the precursor to a type of business that would soon flourish in England, the [[Dutch Republic]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe British [[East India Company]] (1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (1602) launched an era of large state chartered trading companies.<ref name=\"Banaji\" /><ref name=\"britannica2\">{{cite book|title=Economic system :: Market systems|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178493/economic-system/61117/Market-systems#toc242146|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|year=2006}}</ref> These companies were characterized by their monopoly on trade, granted by [[letters patent]] provided by the state.

However, in more undeveloped economies, such as [[Prussia]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], with their much younger manufacturing bases, mercantilism continued to find favor after other states had turned to newer doctrines.\n\nThe mid-18th century gave rise to industrial capitalism, made possible by (1) the accumulation of vast amounts of capital under the merchant phase of capitalism and its investment in machinery, and (2) the fact that the enclosures meant that Britain had a large population of people with no access to subsistence agriculture, who needed to buy basic commodities via the market, ensuring a mass consumer market.<ref>[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), pp. 142\u201346.</ref> Industrial capitalism, which Marx dated from the last third of the 18th century, marked the development of the factory system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex [[division of labor]] between and within work processes and the routinization of work tasks. Industrial capitalism finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production.<ref name=\"Burnham 2003\"/>\n\nDuring the resulting [[Industrial Revolution]], the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system, which led to the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of [[artisan]]s, [[guild]]s, and [[journeyman|journeymen]]. Also during this period, capitalism transformed relations between the British landowning gentry and peasants, giving rise to the production of [[cash crop]]s for the market rather than for subsistence on a [[feudal]] [[Manorialism|manor]]. The surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture.\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n{{main article|Industrial Revolution}}\nThe productivity gains of capitalist production began a sustained and unprecedented increase at the turn of the 19th century, in a process commonly referred to as the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Starting in about 1760 in England, there was a steady transition to new manufacturing processes in a variety of industries, including going from hand production methods to machine production, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of [[water wheel|water power]], the increasing use of steam power and the development of [[machine tool]]s. It also included the change from wood and other [[bio-fuels]] to coal.\n\n[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spinning mule]], built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].]]\nIn [[textile manufacturing]], mechanized cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of about 1000, due to the application of [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]], [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]], [[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[Spinning Mule]] and other inventions.

Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving wool and linen, although they were not as great as in cotton.\n\n===Finance===\n[[File:Frankfurt Taunusbahnhof 1850.jpg|thumb|The [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild family]] revolutionised international finance. The [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|Frankfurt terminus]] of the [[Taunus Railway]] was financed by the Rothschilds and opened in 1840 as one of Germany's first railways.]]\nThe growth of Britain's industry stimulated a concomitant growth in her system of [[finance]] and [[credit (finance)|credit]]. In the 18th century, services offered by banks increased. Clearing facilities, security investments, [[cheque]]s and [[overdraft]] protections were introduced. [[Cheque]]s had been invented in the 17th century in England, and banks settled payments by direct courier to the issuing bank.  Around 1770, they began meeting in a central location, and by the 19th century a dedicated space was established, known as a [[bankers' clearing house]].  The London clearing house used a method where each bank paid cash to and then was paid cash by an inspector at the end of each day. The first overdraft facility was set up in 1728 by [[The Royal Bank of Scotland]].\n\nThe end of the [[Napoleonic War]] and the subsequent rebound in trade led to an expansion in the [[bullion]] reserves held by the [[Bank of England]], from a low of under 4 million pounds in 1821 to 14&nbsp;million pounds by late 1824.\n\nOlder innovations became routine parts of financial life during the 19th century. The [[Bank of England]] first issued bank notes during the 17th century, but the notes were hand written and few in number. After 1725, they were partially printed, but cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to a named person. In 1844, parliament passed the [[Bank Charter Act]] tying these notes to [[gold reserves]], effectively creating the institution of [[central bank]]ing and [[monetary policy]]. The notes became fully printed and widely available from 1855.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nGrowing international trade increased the number of banks, especially in London. These new \"merchant banks\" facilitated trade growth, profiting from England's emerging dominance in seaborne shipping. Two immigrant families, [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and [[Barings Bank|Baring]], established merchant banking firms in London in the late 18th century and came to dominate world banking in the next century. The tremendous wealth amassed by these banking firms soon attracted much attention. The poet [[George Gordon Byron]] wrote in 1823: \"Who makes politics run glibber all?/ The shade of Bonaparte's noble daring?/ Jew [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and his fellow-Christian, Baring.\"\n\nThe operation of banks also shifted. At the beginning of the century, banking was still an elite preoccupation of a handful of very wealthy families. Within a few decades, however, a new sort of banking had emerged, owned by anonymous [[stockholder]]s, run by professional [[Management|managers]], and the recipient of the deposits of a growing body of small middle-class savers. Although this new breed of banks was new in prominence, it was not newly invented \u2013 the [[Quaker]] family [[Barclays Bank|Barclays]], had been banking in this manner since 1690.\n\n===Free trade and globalization===\nAt the height of the [[First French Empire]], [[Napoleon]] sought to introduce a \"[[continental system]]\" that would render Europe economically autonomous, thereby emasculating British trade and commerce. It involved such stratagems as the use of [[Sugar beet|beet sugar]] in preference to the cane sugar that had to be imported from the tropics. Although this caused businessmen in England to agitate for peace, the government was able to persevere, in part because the United Kingdom was well into the [[industrial revolution]]. The war had the opposite effect \u2013 it stimulated the growth of certain industries like [[pig iron|pig-iron]] output, which was just 68,000 tons in 1788 and soared to 244,000 tons by 1806.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|left|19th-century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] become the first global economic [[superpower]], because of superior manufacturing technology and improved global communications such as [[steamship]]s and [[railroad]]s.]]\nIn 1817, [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens, in the famous theory of]] [[comparative advantage]], showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong.

Nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] decisively shaped globalization in this period.

During this period, areas of [[Sub Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] Africa and the Pacific islands were incorporated into the world system. Meanwhile, the European conquest of new parts of the globe, notably sub-Saharan Africa, yielded valuable natural resources such as [[rubber]], [[diamonds]] and [[coal]] and helped fuel trade and investment between the European imperial powers, their colonies, and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/tr_show01.html |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date=1929-10-24 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref>\n\n[[File:McKinley Prosperity.jpg|thumb|200x200px|The [[gold standard]] formed the financial basis of the international economy from 1870 to 1914.]]\n{{cquote| The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea, the various products of the whole earth, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep.

The [[Suez canal]] opened in 1869, the same year in which the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] that spanned the North American continent was completed. Capitalism and the engine of profit were making the globe a smaller place.\n\n==Twentieth century==\nSeveral major challenges to capitalism appeared in the early part of the 20th century.  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]] in 1917 established the first socialist state in the world; a decade later, the [[Great Depression]] triggered increasing criticism of the existing capitalist system. One response to this crisis was a turn to [[fascism]], an ideology that advocated [[state capitalism]].<ref> {{Cite book| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-374-20364-1| last = Reich| first = Wilhelm| title = The Mass Psychology of Fascism| date = 1970| pages = [https://archive.org/details/masspsychologyof00reic/page/277 277\u2013281]| url = https://archive.org/details/masspsychologyof00reic/page/277}}</ref> Another response was to reject capitalism altogether in favor of communist or socialist ideologies.\n\n===Keynesianism and free markets===\n{{Main article|Keynesianism|Neoliberalism}}\n[[File:NY stock exchange traders floor LC-U9-10548-6.jpg|thumb|right|The New York [[stock exchange]] [[trading room|traders' floor]] (1963)]]\nThe economic recovery of the world's leading capitalist economies in the period following the end of the Great Depression and the [[Second World War]]\u2014a period of unusually rapid growth by historical standards\u2014eased discussion of capitalism's eventual decline or demise.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Stanley Engerman |author2=Seymour Drescher |author3=Robert Paquette |title=Slavery (Oxford Readers)|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001}}</ref> The state began to play an increasingly prominent role to moderate and regulate the capitalistic system throughout much of the world.\n\n[[Keynesian]] economics became a widely accepted method of government regulation and countries such as the United Kingdom experimented with [[mixed economies]] in which the state owned and operated certain major industries.\n\nThe state also expanded in the US; in 1929, total government expenditures amounted to less than one-tenth of [[GNP]]; from the 1970s they amounted to around one-third.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2006\"/> Similar increases were seen in all industrialized capitalist economies, some of which, such as France, have reached even higher ratios of government expenditures to GNP than the United States.\n\nA broad array of new analytical tools in the [[social sciences]] were developed to explain the social and economic trends of the period, including the concepts of [[post-industrial society]] and the [[welfare state]].<ref name=\"Burnham 2003\"/>\n\nThe long postwar boom ended in the 1970s, amid the economic crises experienced following the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Barnes, Trevor J.|title=Reading economic geography|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23554-X|page=127|year=2004}}</ref> The \"[[stagflation]]\" of the 1970s led many economic commentators and politicians to embrace [[neoliberalism|market-oriented]] policy prescriptions inspired by the laissez-faire capitalism and [[classical liberalism]] of the 19th century, particularly under the influence of [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. The theoretical alternative to [[Keynesianism]] was more compatible with laissez-faire and emphasized rapid expansion of the economy. Market-oriented solutions gained increasing support in the capitalist world, especially under leadership of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the U.S. and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK in the 1980s. Public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called [[collectivist]] concerns of Keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called \"remarketized capitalism.\"<ref name=\"Fulcher, James 2004\">Fulcher, James. Capitalism. 1st ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref>  In the eyes of many economic and political commentators, the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] brought further evidence of the superiority of market capitalism over planned economy.\n\n===Globalization===\n[[File:NYSESecurity.JPG|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]].]]\nAlthough overseas trade has been associated with the development of capitalism for over five hundred years, some thinkers argue that a number of trends associated with [[globalization]] have acted to increase the mobility of people and capital since the last quarter of the 20th century, combining to circumscribe the room to maneuver of states in choosing non-capitalist models of development. Today, these trends have bolstered the argument that capitalism should now be viewed as a truly [[world system]] (Burnham).  However, other thinkers argue that globalization, even in its quantitative degree, is no greater now than during earlier periods of capitalist trade.<ref>[[Doug Henwood]] is an economist who has argued that the heyday of globalization was during the mid-19th century.  For example, he writes in ''What Is Globalization Anyway?'':\n<blockquote>Not only is the novelty of \"globalization\" exaggerated, so is its extent. Capital flows were freer, and foreign holdings by British investors far larger, 100 years ago than anything we see today. Images of multinational corporations shuttling raw materials and parts around the world, as if the whole globe were an assembly line, are grossly overblown, accounting for only about a tenth of U.S. trade.[https://web.archive.org/web/20011130131557/http://www.zmag.org/sustainers/content/1999-11/26henwood.htm]</blockquote>\n(See also {{cite book | title=After the New Economy | last=Henwood | first=Doug | publisher=New Press | date=October 1, 2003 | isbn=1-56584-770-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/afterneweconomy00henw }})</ref>\n\nAfter the abandonment of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971, and the strict state control of foreign exchange rates, the total value of transactions in foreign exchange was estimated to be at least twenty times greater than that of all foreign movements of goods and services (EB). The internationalization of finance, which some see as beyond the reach of state control, combined with the growing ease with which large corporations have been able to relocate their operations to low-wage states, has posed the question of the 'eclipse' of state sovereignty, arising from the growing 'globalization' of capital.<ref>For an assessment of this question, see Peter Evans, \"The Eclipse of the State?

A review article.\" ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534\u201349. {{JSTOR|178999}}.</ref> [[Alice Clark]] argues that, when capitalism arrived in 17th-century England, it negatively impacted the status of women, who lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that, in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production, and women played a vital role in running farms and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor, with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on women.<ref>Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).</ref> By contrast, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.<ref>Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).</ref> Tilly and Scott have emphasized the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history. In the preindustrial era, production was mostly for home use, and women produced many household needs. The second stage was the \"family wage economy\" of early industrialization. During this stage, the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife, and older children. The third, or modern, stage is the \"family consumer economy,\" in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.<ref>Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n* [[Brenner debate]]\n* [[ Capitalism and Islam ]]\n* [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|Capitalist mode of production]]\n*[[Enclosure]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution]]\n* [[Fernand Braudel]]\n* [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]]\n* [[History of capitalist theory]]\n* [[History of globalization]]\n* [[History of private equity and venture capital]]\n* [[Primitive accumulation of capital]]\n* [[Protestant work ethic]]\n* [[Simple commodity production]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- Items to be listed in alphabetical order of author's surname, followed by items without an author listed in order of title -->\n* Appleby, Joyce.

In 1612 [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] organized an army for the liberation of [[Moscow]] from the [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u201318)|Poles]]. In 1817 Nizhny Novgorod became a [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|great trade center]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1896 at a [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|fair]], an [[All-Russia Exhibition 1896|All-Russia Exhibition]] was organized. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet period]], the city turned into an important industrial center. In particular, the [[Gorky Automobile Plant]] was constructed in this period. Then the city was given the nickname \"Russian [[Detroit]]\". During [[World War II]], Gorky became the biggest provider of military equipment to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Due to this, the [[Luftwaffe]] constantly [[Bombing of Gorky in World War II|bombed the city]] from the air. The majority of the German bombs fell in the area of the Gorky Automobile Plant. Although almost all the production sites of the plant were completely destroyed, the citizens of Gorky reconstructed the factory after 100 days.\n\nAfter the war, Gorky became a \"[[closed city]]\" and remained one until after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1990. At that time, the city was renamed Nizhny Novgorod once again. In 1985, the [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro]] was opened. In 2016, [[Vladimir Putin]] opened the new 70th Anniversary of Victory Plant which is part of the [[Almaz-Antey]] Air and Space Defence Corporation.\n\nThe [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]] \u2013 the [[Historic centre of Nizhny Novgorod|main center]] of the city \u2013 contains the main government agencies of the city and the Volga Federal District. The [[demonym]] for a Nizhny Novgorod resident is \"\u043d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446\" (''nizhegorodets'') for male or \"\u043d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430\" (''nizhegorodka'') for female, rendered in English as ''Nizhegorodian''. ''Novgorodian'' is inappropriate; it refers to a resident of [[Veliky Novgorod]], in [[Northwestern Federal District|northwestern Russia]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Nizhny Novgorod|Timeline of Nizhny Novgorod}}\n\n===Name===\nOriginally the name was just Novgorod (\"Newtown\"), but to distinguish it from the other, older and well-known [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] (Veliky Novgorod) to the west, the city was commonly called \"Novgorod of the Lower lands\", or  \"Lower Newtown\". This land was named \"lower\" ([[:wikt:\u043d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439|''nizhniy'' or ''ni\u017enij'' (\u043d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439)]]), even though it is actually higher in altitude than Veliky Novgorod, because it is situated downstream of other Russian cities such as Moscow, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and [[Murom]].\n\n===Seat of medieval princes===\n{{Main|Principality of Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal}}\nThe city traces its origin from a small Russian wooden hillfort that was founded by Grand Duke [[Yuri II of Vladimir|Yuri&nbsp;II]] in 1221 at the [[Spit of Nizhny Novgorod|confluence]] of two of the most important rivers in his principality, the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Oka River|Oka]] rivers. It marked the eastern extreme of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] settlement until the end of the medieval period, with Russian expansion eastward delayed until the \n[[Russo-Kazan Wars|capture of Kazan]] in 1552. \nIts independent existence of the medieval fort was threatened by the continuous [[Mordvins|Mordvin]] attacks against it; the major attempt made by forces under [[Purgaz]] in April 1229 was repulsed, but after the death of Yuri&nbsp;II on March&nbsp;4, 1238 at the [[Battle of the Sit River]], the Mongols occupied the fortress. Later a major stronghold for border protection, Nizhny Novgorod fortress took advantage of a natural moat formed by the two rivers.\n\nAlong with [[Moscow]] and [[Tver]], Nizhny Novgorod was among several newly founded towns that escaped [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol devastation]] on account of their insignificance, but grew into (great) centers in vassalic Russian political life during the period of the [[Tatar Yoke]]. With the agreement of the Mongol Khan, Nizhny Novgorod was incorporated into the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir-Suzdal Principality]] in 1264. After 86 years its importance further increased when the seat of the powerful [[Suzdal]] Principality was moved here from [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]] in 1350. Grand Duke [[Dmitry Konstantinovich]] (1323\u20131383) sought to make his capital a rival worthy of Moscow; he built a stone citadel and several churches and was a patron of historians. The earliest extant [[manuscript]] of the [[Russian Primary Chronicle]], the ''[[Laurentian Codex]]'', was written for him by the local monk Laurentius in 1377.\n\n===Strongest fortress of the Grand Duchy of Moscow===\n[[File:Appeal of Minin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kuzma Minin]] appeals to the people of Nizhny Novgorod to raise a volunteer army against the [[Polish People|Poles]] (painting by [[Konstantin Makovsky]], 1896).]]After the city's incorporation into the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] in 1392, the local princes took the name [[Shuisky]] and settled in Moscow, where they were prominent at the court and briefly ascended the throne in the person of [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasily&nbsp;IV]]. After being burnt by the powerful [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] chief [[Edigu]] in 1408, Nizhny Novgorod was restored and regarded by the Muscovites primarily as a great stronghold in [[Russo-Kazan Wars|their wars]] against the [[Khanate of Kazan|Tatars of Kazan]]. The enormous red-brick [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|kremlin]], one of the strongest and earliest preserved citadels in Russia, was built in 1508\u20131511 under the supervision of Peter the [[Italy|Italian]]. The fortress was strong enough to withstand Tatar sieges in 1520 and 1536.\n\nIn 1612, the so-called \"national militia\", gathered by a local merchant, [[Kuzma Minin]], and commanded by [[Knyaz]] [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] expelled the [[Poland|Polish]] troops from Moscow, thus putting an end to the \"[[Time of Troubles]]\" and establishing the rule of the [[Romanov]] dynasty. The main square in front of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]] is named after [[Kuzma Minin|Minin]] and [[Dmitry Pozharsky|Pozharsky]], although it is locally known simply as Minin Square. Minin's remains are buried in the citadel. (In commemoration of these events, on October 21, 2005, an exact copy of the [[Monument to Minin and Pozharsky|Red Square statue]] of Minin and Pozharsky was placed in front of St John the Baptist Church, which is believed to be the place from where the call to the people had been proclaimed.)\n\nIn the course of the following century, the city prospered commercially and was chosen by the [[Stroganov]]s (the wealthiest merchant family of Russia) as a base for their operations. A particular style of [[Russian architecture|architecture]] and icon painting, known as the [[Stroganov style]], developed there at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe historical [[coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod]] in 1781 was a red deer with black horns and hooves on a white field. The modern coat of arms from 2006 is the same, with a ribbon of [[order of Lenin]] and gold crown from above.\n\n===Great trade center===\n[[File:Nizhny Novgorod Fair 1903.jpg|thumb|Main building of the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|Great Russian Fair]], 19th-century postcard|alt=|left]]{{See also|Nizhny Novgorod Fair|All-Russia Exhibition 1896}}\nIn 1817, the [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|Makaryev Fair]], one of the liveliest in the world, was transferred to Nizhny Novgorod, and started to attract millions of visitors annually. By the mid-19th century, the city was firmly established as the [[trade]] capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. The world's first radio receiver by engineer [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]] and the world's first [[hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid tower]] and lattice shell-coverings by engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]] were demonstrated at the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia industrial and art exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod]] in 1896. According to official Imperial Russian statistics the population of Nizhny Novgorod as of 14 January 1913 was 97,000.\n\nThe largest industrial enterprise was the [[Sormovsky City District|Sormovo]] Iron Works which was connected by the company's own railway to Moscow station in the Lower Area of Nizhny Novgorod. The private Moscow to Kazan Railway Company's station was in the Upper Area of the city. Other industries gradually developed, and by the start of the 20th century the city was also a first-rank industrial hub. [[Henry Ford]] helped build a large truck and tractor plant ([[GAZ]]) in the late 1920s, sending engineers and mechanics, including future labour leader [[Walter Reuther]].\n\n===Soviet era===\n[[File:9th May. Day of the German surrender. Gorky 1.jpg|thumb|[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] on the [[Minin and Pozharsky Square]], 9 May 1945|alt=|left]]\n\nThere were no permanent bridges over the Volga or Oka before the [[October Revolution]] in 1917. Temporary bridges were built during the trade fair. The first bridge over the Volga was started by the Moscow\u2013Kazan Railway Company in 1914, but only finished in the [[Soviet Era]] when the railway to [[Kotelnich]] was opened for service in 1927.\n\n[[Maxim Gorky]] was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1868 as Alexey Maximovich Peshkov. In his novels he described the dismal life of the city [[proletariat]]. When he returned to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932 on the invitation of [[Joseph Stalin]], the city was renamed '''Gorky'''. The city bore Gorky's name until 1990. His childhood home is preserved as a museum, known as the Kashirin House, after Alexey's grandfather who owned the place.\n\n{{Main|Bombing of Gorky in World War II}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]], from 1941 to 1943, Gorky was subjected to air raids and bombardments by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The Germans tried to destroy the city industry because it was the main supplier of military equipment to the front. These attacks became the most powerful in the entire World War II in the rear of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring much of the Soviet era, the city was [[closed city|closed]] to foreigners to safeguard the security of Soviet military research and production facilities, even though it was a popular stopping point for Soviet tourists traveling up and down the Volga in tourist boats. Unusually for a Soviet city of that size, even street maps were not available for sale until the mid-1970s. In 1970, by the Decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]], the city was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]], communist leader of [[Hungary]], died there in 1971. November 20, 1985 in the city was launched the first section of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro|metro]]. The [[physicist]] and [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Andrei Sakharov]] was exiled there during 1980\u20131986 to limit his contacts with foreigners. An end to the \"closed\" status of the city accompanied the reinstatement of the city's original name in 1990.<ref name=\"PrevName2\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:NN Minin and Pozharsky Square view 08-2016.jpg|[[Dmitrievskaya Tower|Dmitrovskaya tower]] of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]]\nFile:NN Stroganov Church 08-2016 img2.jpg|[[Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Nizhny Novgorod|Church of the Nativity]]\nFile:NN Spit from Lower-Volga Embankment 12-2018.jpg 04.jpg|The [[Spit of Nizhny Novgorod|Spit]] (confluence of [[Oka River|Oka]] and [[Volga River|Volga Rivers]])\nFile:NN BolPokrovskaya view towards the Kremlin 08-2016.jpg|[[Bolshaya Pokrovskaya Street]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Administrative and municipal status==\nNizhny Novgorod is the [[administrative center]] (capital) of [[Volga Federal District]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]].<ref name=\"Ref818\">Law #184-Z</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with one [[urban-type settlement|resort settlement]] and twelve [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of oblast significance]] of Nizhny Novgorod'''\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|districts]].<ref name=\"Ref818\"/> As a [[Municipal divisions of Russia|municipal division]], the city of oblast significance of Nizhny Novgorod is incorporated as '''Nizhny Novgorod Urban Okrug'''.<ref name=\"Ref825\">Law #205-Z</ref>\nIn December 2011, [[Marat Safin]] was elected to the Russian Parliament as a member of [[Vladimir Putin]]'s [[United Russia]] Party, representing Nizhny Novgorod.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/79982|title=\u04141 (2 \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) \u0424\u0417 \u2116186614-6 \"\u041e \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0446, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d \u0420\u0424\" \u2013 \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u0443\u043c\u044b|publisher=Vote.duma.gov.ru|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==City layout and divisions==\n{{Further|Administrative divisions of Nizhny Novgorod}}\n[[File:Location Map of Rayons NN 2020.png|right|thumb|250px| Administrative divisions of Nizhny Novgorod]]\n\nNizhny Novgorod is divided by the [[Oka River]] into two distinct parts.

Average temperatures range from {{convert|+19|C}} in July to {{convert|-9|C}} in January. Average annual temperature is {{convert|+4.8|C}}, wind speed 2.8 m/s, air humidity 76%.\n\nNizhny receives on average 1 775 hours of sunshine a year. The maximum duration of daylight is in June (17 hours 44 minutes), the minimum - in December (6 hours 52 minutes). Overcast is often reported in winter: 75 to 80% of the time the sky is covered in clouds, while it's only 49 to 56% in April through to August. In autumn and winter the overcast is usually in the mornings, then the sky clears in the afternoon. In spring and summer, on the contrary, it is clear in the mornings, while towards midday clouds cluster ('[[cumulus cloud]]'), and disappear towards the evening.\n\nIn spring temperatures set above zero around April 5th and stay until the end of October. On average precipitation comes at 653 mm per year, mostly in July and least of all in March. Generally, 180 days out of 365 enjoy some form of precipitation. [[Snow]] first comes in October but the blanket of snow insulates the ground at November-end and melts mid-April. As a rule, the air temperature in winter ranges from {{convert|-10|C}} to {{convert|-20|C}}. A storm rarely takes place in winter here (a few dates to mention are 27 November 1940, 30 November 1951, 14 February 1960, and 3 December 1962). In [[spring (season)|spring]] there's less precipitation than in other seasons. Spring flies by as snow melts in the second half of March and is normally gone by the end of April. [[Summer]] comes at the beginning of June, when temperature sets around +15. Maximum heat can be observed towards the third decade of July. Average temperatures range from {{convert|+15|C}} to {{convert|+20|C}}. A maximum temperature of {{convert|+38.2|C}} was recorded during the [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves]]. Summer [[rain]] is short but intense, with strong [[wind]]. In September temperature starts to drop and gets below {{convert|+10|C}} in mid-20s of the month. It rains often and heavily in [[autumn]], the sky is overcast.\n\n{{Clear}}{{Weather box\n|location=Nizhny Novgorod\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high C=5.7\n|Feb record high C=7.0\n|Mar record high C=17.3\n|Apr record high C= 26.3\n|May record high C = 32.5\n|Jun record high C = 36.3\n|Jul record high C = 38.2\n|Aug record high C = 38.0\n|Sep record high C = 31.0\n|Oct record high C = 24.2\n|Nov record high C = 13.8\n|Dec record high C = 8.5\n|year record high C = 38.2\n|Jan high C = -5.9\n|Feb high C = -5.3\n|Mar high C = 1.1\n|Apr high C = 10.9\n|May high C = 18.7\n|Jun high C = 22.6\n|Jul high C = 24.7\n|Aug high C = 22.1\n|Sep high C = 15.6\n|Oct high C = 8.0\n|Nov high C = -0.5\n|Dec high C = -4.7\n|year high C = 8.9\n|Jan mean C = -8.9\n|Feb mean C = -8.7\n|Mar mean C = -2.6\n|Apr mean C = 6.1\n|May mean C = 12.9\n|Jun mean C = 17.2\n|Jul mean C = 19.4\n|Aug mean C = 16.9\n|Sep mean C = 11.1\n|Oct mean C = 4.7\n|Nov mean C = -2.8\n|Dec mean C = -7.4\n|year mean C = 4.8\n|Jan low C = -11.6\n|Feb low C = -11.7\n|Mar low C = -5.8\n|Apr low C = 2.1\n|May low C = 7.9\n|Jun low C = 12.6\n|Jul low C = 14.8\n|Aug low C = 12.6\n|Sep low C = 7.6\n|Oct low C = 2.1\n|Nov low C = -4.8\n|Dec low C = -9.9\n|year low C = 1.3\n|Jan record low C = -41.2\n|Feb record low C = -37.2\n|Mar record low C = -28.3\n|Apr record low C = -19.7\n|May record low C = -6.9\n|Jun record low C = -1.8\n|Jul record low C = 4.6\n|Aug record low C = 0.9\n|Sep record low C = -5.5\n|Oct record low C = -16.0\n|Nov record low C = -29.4\n|Dec record low C = -41.4\n|year record low C = -41.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 47\n|Feb precipitation mm = 38\n|Mar precipitation mm = 37\n|Apr precipitation mm = 36\n|May precipitation mm = 46\n|Jun precipitation mm = 76\n|Jul precipitation mm = 73\n|Aug precipitation mm = 69\n|Sep precipitation mm = 61\n|Oct precipitation mm = 64\n|Nov precipitation mm = 55\n|Dec precipitation mm = 55\n|year precipitation mm = 657\n|Jan humidity = 86\n|Feb humidity = 81\n|Mar humidity = 74\n|Apr humidity = 64\n|May humidity = 60\n|Jun humidity = 69\n|Jul humidity = 70\n|Aug humidity = 74\n|Sep humidity = 79\n|Oct humidity = 82\n|Nov humidity = 87\n|Dec humidity = 86\n|year humidity = 76\n|Jan rain days = 5\n|Feb rain days = 4\n|Mar rain days = 5\n|Apr rain days = 13\n|May rain days = 17\n|Jun rain days = 19\n|Jul rain days = 18\n|Aug rain days = 18\n|Sep rain days = 18\n|Oct rain days = 18\n|Nov rain days = 10\n|Dec rain days = 6\n|year rain days = 151\n|Jan snow days = 28\n|Feb snow days = 24\n|Mar snow days = 18\n|Apr snow days = 7\n|May snow days = 1\n|Jun snow days = 0.1\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 1\n|Oct snow days = 8\n|Nov snow days = 20\n|Dec snow days = 26\n|year snow days = 133\n|Jan sun = 43\n|Feb sun = 79\n|Mar sun = 145\n|Apr sun = 196\n|May sun = 275\n|Jun sun = 287\n|Jul sun = 280\n|Aug sun = 238\n|Sep sun = 152\n|Oct sun = 81\n|Nov sun = 38\n|Dec sun = 25\n|year sun = 1839\n|source 1 = Pogoda.ru.net<ref name=\"pogoda\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/27459.htm\n| title = Pogoda.ru.net\n| accessdate = December 10, 2015\n| publisher = Weather and Climate (\u041f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442)\n| language = Russian}}</ref>\n|source 2 = NOAA (sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n|url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_VI/RE/27553.TXT\n|title = Gorkij (Nizhny Novgorod) Climate Normals 1961-1990\n|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n|accessdate = April 8, 2015}}</ref>\n|date = August 2010}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:NN BolPokrovskaya Street 08-2016 img2.jpg|thumb|State Bank of Nizhny Novgorod, built in 1913]]\n[[File:Ankudinovka IT-Park-01.jpg|thumb|IT-Park]]\n\n===Information technology===\nNizhny Novgorod is one of the centers of the IT industry in Russia.

To protect from floods, a {{cvt|3.5|m|0}} high dam was built. On November 4, 2017, a new multimedia exhibition called \"Russia is My History\" was opened in the Main Fair Building. The main focus of the exhibition is the [[history of Nizhny Novgorod]], starting from [[Finno-Ugric peoples]]. On the territory of the complex there are departments in which they tell about the foundation of the city, the struggle for independence in the [[Time of Troubles]] and the [[Bombing of Gorky in World War II|bombing of the city]] during the [[World War II]]. On the first day of work, the entrance to the exhibition was free, because of which a long line lined up in front of the Main Fair Building.\n\n===Nizhny Novgorod art gallery===\n[[File:NN Kremlin 08-2016 img9.jpg|thumb|The State art gallery]]\nThe [[art gallery]] in Nizhny Novgorod is a large and important art gallery and [[museum]]s of human [[history]] and [[culture]].\n\nNizhny Novgorod has a great and extraordinary art gallery with more than 12,000 exhibits, an enormous collection of works by Russian artists such as [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Karl Briullov]], [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]], [[Isaak Iljitsch Lewitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], there are also greater collections of works by [[Boris Kustodiev]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]], not only Russian art is part of the exhibition it include also a vast accumulation of [[Western Europe]]an art like works by [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Bernardo Bellotto]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Pieter de Grebber]], [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]], [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], and lot more.\n\nFinally what makes this gallery extremely important is the amazing collection [[Russian avant-garde]] with works by [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Mikhail Larionov]] and so on.

The Annunciation monastery, likewise surrounded by strong walls, has another five-domed cathedral (1649) and the Assumption church (1678). The only private house preserved from that epoch formerly belonged to the merchant Pushnikov.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the most original and delightful churches in the city were built by the [[Stroganovs]] in the nascent [[Naryshkin Baroque|Baroque style]].

In 1612 [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] organized an army for the liberation of [[Moscow]] from the [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u201318)|Poles]]. In 1817 Nizhny Novgorod became a [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|great trade center]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1896 at a [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|fair]], an [[All-Russia Exhibition 1896|All-Russia Exhibition]] was organized. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet period]], the city turned into an important industrial center. In particular, the [[Gorky Automobile Plant]] was constructed in this period. Then the city was given the nickname \"Russian [[Detroit]]\". During [[World War II]], Gorky became the biggest provider of military equipment to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Due to this, the [[Luftwaffe]] constantly [[Bombing of Gorky in World War II|bombed the city]] from the air. The majority of the German bombs fell in the area of the Gorky Automobile Plant. Although almost all the production sites of the plant were completely destroyed, the citizens of Gorky reconstructed the factory after 100 days.\n\nAfter the war, Gorky became a \"[[closed city]]\" and remained one until after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1990. At that time, the city was renamed Nizhny Novgorod once again. In 1985, the [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro]] was opened. In 2016, [[Vladimir Putin]] opened the new 70th Anniversary of Victory Plant which is part of the [[Almaz-Antey]] Air and Space Defence Corporation.\n\nThe [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]] \u2013 the [[Historic centre of Nizhny Novgorod|main center]] of the city \u2013 contains the main government agencies of the city and the Volga Federal District. The [[demonym]] for a Nizhny Novgorod resident is \"\u043d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446\" (''nizhegorodets'') for male or \"\u043d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430\" (''nizhegorodka'') for female, rendered in English as ''Nizhegorodian''. ''Novgorodian'' is inappropriate; it refers to a resident of [[Veliky Novgorod]], in [[Northwestern Federal District|northwestern Russia]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Nizhny Novgorod|Timeline of Nizhny Novgorod}}\n\n===Name===\nOriginally the name was just Novgorod (\"Newtown\"), but to distinguish it from the other, older and well-known [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] (Veliky Novgorod) to the west, the city was commonly called \"Novgorod of the Lower lands\", or  \"Lower Newtown\". This land was named \"lower\" ([[:wikt:\u043d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439|''nizhniy'' or ''ni\u017enij'' (\u043d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439)]]), even though it is actually higher in altitude than Veliky Novgorod, because it is situated downstream of other Russian cities such as Moscow, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and [[Murom]].\n\n===Seat of medieval princes===\n{{Main|Principality of Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal}}\nThe city traces its origin from a small Russian wooden hillfort that was founded by Grand Duke [[Yuri II of Vladimir|Yuri&nbsp;II]] in 1221 at the [[Spit of Nizhny Novgorod|confluence]] of two of the most important rivers in his principality, the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Oka River|Oka]] rivers. It marked the eastern extreme of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] settlement until the end of the medieval period, with Russian expansion eastward delayed until the \n[[Russo-Kazan Wars|capture of Kazan]] in 1552. \nIts independent existence of the medieval fort was threatened by the continuous [[Mordvins|Mordvin]] attacks against it; the major attempt made by forces under [[Purgaz]] in April 1229 was repulsed, but after the death of Yuri&nbsp;II on March&nbsp;4, 1238 at the [[Battle of the Sit River]], the Mongols occupied the fortress. Later a major stronghold for border protection, Nizhny Novgorod fortress took advantage of a natural moat formed by the two rivers.\n\nAlong with [[Moscow]] and [[Tver]], Nizhny Novgorod was among several newly founded towns that escaped [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol devastation]] on account of their insignificance, but grew into (great) centers in vassalic Russian political life during the period of the [[Tatar Yoke]]. With the agreement of the Mongol Khan, Nizhny Novgorod was incorporated into the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir-Suzdal Principality]] in 1264. After 86 years its importance further increased when the seat of the powerful [[Suzdal]] Principality was moved here from [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]] in 1350. Grand Duke [[Dmitry Konstantinovich]] (1323\u20131383) sought to make his capital a rival worthy of Moscow; he built a stone citadel and several churches and was a patron of historians. The earliest extant [[manuscript]] of the [[Russian Primary Chronicle]], the ''[[Laurentian Codex]]'', was written for him by the local monk Laurentius in 1377.\n\n===Strongest fortress of the Grand Duchy of Moscow===\n[[File:Appeal of Minin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kuzma Minin]] appeals to the people of Nizhny Novgorod to raise a volunteer army against the [[Polish People|Poles]] (painting by [[Konstantin Makovsky]], 1896).]]After the city's incorporation into the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] in 1392, the local princes took the name [[Shuisky]] and settled in Moscow, where they were prominent at the court and briefly ascended the throne in the person of [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasily&nbsp;IV]]. After being burnt by the powerful [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] chief [[Edigu]] in 1408, Nizhny Novgorod was restored and regarded by the Muscovites primarily as a great stronghold in [[Russo-Kazan Wars|their wars]] against the [[Khanate of Kazan|Tatars of Kazan]]. The enormous red-brick [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|kremlin]], one of the strongest and earliest preserved citadels in Russia, was built in 1508\u20131511 under the supervision of Peter the [[Italy|Italian]]. The fortress was strong enough to withstand Tatar sieges in 1520 and 1536.\n\nIn 1612, the so-called \"national militia\", gathered by a local merchant, [[Kuzma Minin]], and commanded by [[Knyaz]] [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] expelled the [[Poland|Polish]] troops from Moscow, thus putting an end to the \"[[Time of Troubles]]\" and establishing the rule of the [[Romanov]] dynasty. The main square in front of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]] is named after [[Kuzma Minin|Minin]] and [[Dmitry Pozharsky|Pozharsky]], although it is locally known simply as Minin Square. Minin's remains are buried in the citadel. (In commemoration of these events, on October 21, 2005, an exact copy of the [[Monument to Minin and Pozharsky|Red Square statue]] of Minin and Pozharsky was placed in front of St John the Baptist Church, which is believed to be the place from where the call to the people had been proclaimed.)\n\nIn the course of the following century, the city prospered commercially and was chosen by the [[Stroganov]]s (the wealthiest merchant family of Russia) as a base for their operations. A particular style of [[Russian architecture|architecture]] and icon painting, known as the [[Stroganov style]], developed there at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe historical [[coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod]] in 1781 was a red deer with black horns and hooves on a white field. The modern coat of arms from 2006 is the same, with a ribbon of [[order of Lenin]] and gold crown from above.\n\n===Great trade center===\n[[File:Nizhny Novgorod Fair 1903.jpg|thumb|Main building of the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|Great Russian Fair]], 19th-century postcard|alt=|left]]{{See also|Nizhny Novgorod Fair|All-Russia Exhibition 1896}}\nIn 1817, the [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|Makaryev Fair]], one of the liveliest in the world, was transferred to Nizhny Novgorod, and started to attract millions of visitors annually. By the mid-19th century, the city was firmly established as the [[trade]] capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. The world's first radio receiver by engineer [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]] and the world's first [[hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid tower]] and lattice shell-coverings by engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]] were demonstrated at the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia industrial and art exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod]] in 1896. According to official Imperial Russian statistics the population of Nizhny Novgorod as of 14 January 1913 was 97,000.\n\nThe largest industrial enterprise was the [[Sormovsky City District|Sormovo]] Iron Works which was connected by the company's own railway to Moscow station in the Lower Area of Nizhny Novgorod. The private Moscow to Kazan Railway Company's station was in the Upper Area of the city. Other industries gradually developed, and by the start of the 20th century the city was also a first-rank industrial hub. [[Henry Ford]] helped build a large truck and tractor plant ([[GAZ]]) in the late 1920s, sending engineers and mechanics, including future labour leader [[Walter Reuther]].\n\n===Soviet era===\n[[File:9th May. Day of the German surrender. Gorky 1.jpg|thumb|[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] on the [[Minin and Pozharsky Square]], 9 May 1945|alt=|left]]\n\nThere were no permanent bridges over the Volga or Oka before the [[October Revolution]] in 1917. Temporary bridges were built during the trade fair. The first bridge over the Volga was started by the Moscow\u2013Kazan Railway Company in 1914, but only finished in the [[Soviet Era]] when the railway to [[Kotelnich]] was opened for service in 1927.\n\n[[Maxim Gorky]] was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1868 as Alexey Maximovich Peshkov. In his novels he described the dismal life of the city [[proletariat]]. When he returned to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932 on the invitation of [[Joseph Stalin]], the city was renamed '''Gorky'''. The city bore Gorky's name until 1990. His childhood home is preserved as a museum, known as the Kashirin House, after Alexey's grandfather who owned the place.\n\n{{Main|Bombing of Gorky in World War II}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]], from 1941 to 1943, Gorky was subjected to air raids and bombardments by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The Germans tried to destroy the city industry because it was the main supplier of military equipment to the front. These attacks became the most powerful in the entire World War II in the rear of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring much of the Soviet era, the city was [[closed city|closed]] to foreigners to safeguard the security of Soviet military research and production facilities, even though it was a popular stopping point for Soviet tourists traveling up and down the Volga in tourist boats. Unusually for a Soviet city of that size, even street maps were not available for sale until the mid-1970s. In 1970, by the Decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]], the city was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]], communist leader of [[Hungary]], died there in 1971. November 20, 1985 in the city was launched the first section of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro|metro]]. The [[physicist]] and [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Andrei Sakharov]] was exiled there during 1980\u20131986 to limit his contacts with foreigners.

For a long time it was the third-largest city after Moscow and St Petersburg.\n\n==Geograph\u0443 and climate==\n[[File:Central Nizhny Novgorod.png|thumb|Historic city center|alt=]]\n===Time===\nThe area operates in what is referred to in international standards as [[Moscow Standard Time]] (MSK), which is 3 hours ahead of [[UTC]], or [[UTC+3]]. [[Daylight saving time]] is no longer observed.\n\n===Climate===\nIn 1834 the first weather station was opened in Nizhny Novgorod. A century later it transformed into Gorky Hydrometeorological service, then since 1978 it is known as the Higher Volga hydrometeorology and natural habitat control department.\n\nThe [[climate]] in the region is continental, specifically [[humid continental]] (''Dfb''), and it is similar to the [[climate of Moscow|climate in Moscow]], although colder in winter, which lasts from late November until late March with a permanent snow cover. Average temperatures range from {{convert|+19|C}} in July to {{convert|-9|C}} in January. Average annual temperature is {{convert|+4.8|C}}, wind speed 2.8 m/s, air humidity 76%.\n\nNizhny receives on average 1 775 hours of sunshine a year. The maximum duration of daylight is in June (17 hours 44 minutes), the minimum - in December (6 hours 52 minutes). Overcast is often reported in winter: 75 to 80% of the time the sky is covered in clouds, while it's only 49 to 56% in April through to August. In autumn and winter the overcast is usually in the mornings, then the sky clears in the afternoon. In spring and summer, on the contrary, it is clear in the mornings, while towards midday clouds cluster ('[[cumulus cloud]]'), and disappear towards the evening.\n\nIn spring temperatures set above zero around April 5th and stay until the end of October. On average precipitation comes at 653 mm per year, mostly in July and least of all in March. Generally, 180 days out of 365 enjoy some form of precipitation. [[Snow]] first comes in October but the blanket of snow insulates the ground at November-end and melts mid-April. As a rule, the air temperature in winter ranges from {{convert|-10|C}} to {{convert|-20|C}}. A storm rarely takes place in winter here (a few dates to mention are 27 November 1940, 30 November 1951, 14 February 1960, and 3 December 1962). In [[spring (season)|spring]] there's less precipitation than in other seasons. Spring flies by as snow melts in the second half of March and is normally gone by the end of April. [[Summer]] comes at the beginning of June, when temperature sets around +15. Maximum heat can be observed towards the third decade of July. Average temperatures range from {{convert|+15|C}} to {{convert|+20|C}}. A maximum temperature of {{convert|+38.2|C}} was recorded during the [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves]]. Summer [[rain]] is short but intense, with strong [[wind]]. In September temperature starts to drop and gets below {{convert|+10|C}} in mid-20s of the month. It rains often and heavily in [[autumn]], the sky is overcast.\n\n{{Clear}}{{Weather box\n|location=Nizhny Novgorod\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high C=5.7\n|Feb record high C=7.0\n|Mar record high C=17.3\n|Apr record high C= 26.3\n|May record high C = 32.5\n|Jun record high C = 36.3\n|Jul record high C = 38.2\n|Aug record high C = 38.0\n|Sep record high C = 31.0\n|Oct record high C = 24.2\n|Nov record high C = 13.8\n|Dec record high C = 8.5\n|year record high C = 38.2\n|Jan high C = -5.9\n|Feb high C = -5.3\n|Mar high C = 1.1\n|Apr high C = 10.9\n|May high C = 18.7\n|Jun high C = 22.6\n|Jul high C = 24.7\n|Aug high C = 22.1\n|Sep high C = 15.6\n|Oct high C = 8.0\n|Nov high C = -0.5\n|Dec high C = -4.7\n|year high C = 8.9\n|Jan mean C = -8.9\n|Feb mean C = -8.7\n|Mar mean C = -2.6\n|Apr mean C = 6.1\n|May mean C = 12.9\n|Jun mean C = 17.2\n|Jul mean C = 19.4\n|Aug mean C = 16.9\n|Sep mean C = 11.1\n|Oct mean C = 4.7\n|Nov mean C = -2.8\n|Dec mean C = -7.4\n|year mean C = 4.8\n|Jan low C = -11.6\n|Feb low C = -11.7\n|Mar low C = -5.8\n|Apr low C = 2.1\n|May low C = 7.9\n|Jun low C = 12.6\n|Jul low C = 14.8\n|Aug low C = 12.6\n|Sep low C = 7.6\n|Oct low C = 2.1\n|Nov low C = -4.8\n|Dec low C = -9.9\n|year low C = 1.3\n|Jan record low C = -41.2\n|Feb record low C = -37.2\n|Mar record low C = -28.3\n|Apr record low C = -19.7\n|May record low C = -6.9\n|Jun record low C = -1.8\n|Jul record low C = 4.6\n|Aug record low C = 0.9\n|Sep record low C = -5.5\n|Oct record low C = -16.0\n|Nov record low C = -29.4\n|Dec record low C = -41.4\n|year record low C = -41.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 47\n|Feb precipitation mm = 38\n|Mar precipitation mm = 37\n|Apr precipitation mm = 36\n|May precipitation mm = 46\n|Jun precipitation mm = 76\n|Jul precipitation mm = 73\n|Aug precipitation mm = 69\n|Sep precipitation mm = 61\n|Oct precipitation mm = 64\n|Nov precipitation mm = 55\n|Dec precipitation mm = 55\n|year precipitation mm = 657\n|Jan humidity = 86\n|Feb humidity = 81\n|Mar humidity = 74\n|Apr humidity = 64\n|May humidity = 60\n|Jun humidity = 69\n|Jul humidity = 70\n|Aug humidity = 74\n|Sep humidity = 79\n|Oct humidity = 82\n|Nov humidity = 87\n|Dec humidity = 86\n|year humidity = 76\n|Jan rain days = 5\n|Feb rain days = 4\n|Mar rain days = 5\n|Apr rain days = 13\n|May rain days = 17\n|Jun rain days = 19\n|Jul rain days = 18\n|Aug rain days = 18\n|Sep rain days = 18\n|Oct rain days = 18\n|Nov rain days = 10\n|Dec rain days = 6\n|year rain days = 151\n|Jan snow days = 28\n|Feb snow days = 24\n|Mar snow days = 18\n|Apr snow days = 7\n|May snow days = 1\n|Jun snow days = 0.1\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 1\n|Oct snow days = 8\n|Nov snow days = 20\n|Dec snow days = 26\n|year snow days = 133\n|Jan sun = 43\n|Feb sun = 79\n|Mar sun = 145\n|Apr sun = 196\n|May sun = 275\n|Jun sun = 287\n|Jul sun = 280\n|Aug sun = 238\n|Sep sun = 152\n|Oct sun = 81\n|Nov sun = 38\n|Dec sun = 25\n|year sun = 1839\n|source 1 = Pogoda.ru.net<ref name=\"pogoda\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/27459.htm\n| title = Pogoda.ru.net\n| accessdate = December 10, 2015\n| publisher = Weather and Climate (\u041f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442)\n| language = Russian}}</ref>\n|source 2 = NOAA (sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n|url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_VI/RE/27553.TXT\n|title = Gorkij (Nizhny Novgorod) Climate Normals 1961-1990\n|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n|accessdate = April 8, 2015}}</ref>\n|date = August 2010}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:NN BolPokrovskaya Street 08-2016 img2.jpg|thumb|State Bank of Nizhny Novgorod, built in 1913]]\n[[File:Ankudinovka IT-Park-01.jpg|thumb|IT-Park]]\n\n===Information technology===\nNizhny Novgorod is one of the centers of the IT industry in Russia.

[[S7 Airlines]] and [[UTair Aviation]] fly to Moscow's [[Domodedovo International Airport|Domodedovo]] and [[Vnukovo International Airport|Vnukovo Airports]] daily.\n\nIt is unknown when the first [[aerodrome]] in Nizhny Novgorod was built, but its location was {{cvt|0.5|km|0}} north from where the \"Moscow\" movie theater stands today. This aerodrome was named Nizhny Novgorod Airport. In 2011 HC Airports of Regions won their bid on the investment project into Nizhny Novgorod International Airport. In 2012, certain renovations were made in order to more efficiently exploit the existing facility whilst the new one is being built.\n\nIn June 2014, the construction of new terminal started. It is supposed to be opened by December 2015 and be able to handle around 300 passengers per hour. The second terminal will be built after the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], hosted by Nizhny Novgorod among others, and the aforementioned railway station is planned to be constructed during that time as well. The new terminal was opened on December 29, 2015 as the first flight, from Moscow, was directed there. Airport authority plans to redirect all the domestic flights to the new terminal by February 2016 and all the international flights by April 2016.\n\n==Main sights==\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2018}}\nMuch of the [[Historic centre of Nizhny Novgorod|city downtown]] is built in the [[Russian Revival]] and [[Stalin Empire style]]s. The dominating feature of the city skyline is the grand [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]] (1500\u20131511), with its red-brick towers. After Bolshevik devastation, the only ancient edifice left within the Kremlin walls is the tent-like Archangel Cathedral (1624\u20131631), first built in stone in the 13th century.\n{{Panorama |image=File:Nizhny Novgorod banner.jpg |fullwidth=2100 |fullheight=600 |caption=<center>The [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin]] (swipe left or right)</center> |alt=Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin |height=175}}\n\nThere are more than 600 unique historic, architectural, and cultural monuments in the city. There are about 200 municipal and regional art and cultural institutions within Nizhny Novgorod. Among these institutions there are eight theaters, five concert halls, 97 libraries (with branches), 17 movie theaters (including five for children), 25 institutions of children's optional education, eight museums (16 including branches), and seven parks.\n\n=== The Fair ===\n[[File:NN Trade Fair 08-2016 img1.jpg|thumb|The Main Fair Building]]\nThe center of the fair was the main building in the spirit of classicism and the side administrative buildings that formed the central square. To protect from floods, a {{cvt|3.5|m|0}} high dam was built. On November 4, 2017, a new multimedia exhibition called \"Russia is My History\" was opened in the Main Fair Building. The main focus of the exhibition is the [[history of Nizhny Novgorod]], starting from [[Finno-Ugric peoples]]. On the territory of the complex there are departments in which they tell about the foundation of the city, the struggle for independence in the [[Time of Troubles]] and the [[Bombing of Gorky in World War II|bombing of the city]] during the [[World War II]]. On the first day of work, the entrance to the exhibition was free, because of which a long line lined up in front of the Main Fair Building.\n\n===Nizhny Novgorod art gallery===\n[[File:NN Kremlin 08-2016 img9.jpg|thumb|The State art gallery]]\nThe [[art gallery]] in Nizhny Novgorod is a large and important art gallery and [[museum]]s of human [[history]] and [[culture]].\n\nNizhny Novgorod has a great and extraordinary art gallery with more than 12,000 exhibits, an enormous collection of works by Russian artists such as [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Karl Briullov]], [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]], [[Isaak Iljitsch Lewitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], there are also greater collections of works by [[Boris Kustodiev]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]], not only Russian art is part of the exhibition it include also a vast accumulation of [[Western Europe]]an art like works by [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Bernardo Bellotto]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Pieter de Grebber]], [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]], [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], and lot more.\n\nFinally what makes this gallery extremely important is the amazing collection [[Russian avant-garde]] with works by [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Mikhail Larionov]] and so on.

The [[Pechersky Ascension Monastery]] features the austere five-domed cathedral (1632) and two rare churches surmounted by tent roofs, dating from the 1640s. The Annunciation monastery, likewise surrounded by strong walls, has another five-domed cathedral (1649) and the Assumption church (1678). The only private house preserved from that epoch formerly belonged to the merchant Pushnikov.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the most original and delightful churches in the city were built by the [[Stroganovs]] in the nascent [[Naryshkin Baroque|Baroque style]].

It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).\n\n=== International Development Association (IDA) ===\n{{Main|International Development Association}}\nThe IDA's mandate is close to that of IBRD, with the focus on the poorest countries. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).\n\n== World Health Organization (WHO) ==\n[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|WHO flag.]]\n{{Main|World Health Organization}}\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) acts as a coordinating authority on international [[public health]] and deals with health and sanitation and diseases and sends medical teams to help combat [[epidemics]]. Established on 7 April 1948, the agency inherited the mandate and resources of its predecessor, the Health Organization, which had been an agency of the League of Nations.  It was established in 7 April 1948 when 26 members of the United Nations ratified its Constitution.  7 April is celebrated as the World Health Day every year. The WHO is governed by 194 Member States through the World Health Assembly.  Its headquarters are at Geneva in Switzerland.\nFunctions of WHO \n1.It helps countries to improve their health system by building up infrastructure especially manpower, institutions and services for the individual community\n2.It aims at fighting diseases and preventing them from spreading\n\n== World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) ==\n{{Main|World Intellectual Property Organization}}\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations created in 1967 and headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Its purpose is to encourage creative activity and to promote the protection of [[intellectual property]] throughout the world. The organization administers several treaties concerning the protection of intellectual property rights.\n\n== World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ==\n[[File:Flag of the World Meteorological Organization.svg|thumb|WMO flag.]]\n{{Main|World Meteorological Organization}}\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), which was founded in 1873. Established in 1950, WMO became the specialized agency of the United Nations for modern meteorology (weather and climate), operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences. It has its headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].\n\n== World Tourism Organization (UNWTO or WTO) ==\n{{Main|World Tourism Organization}}\n\nThe World Tourism Organization (UNWTO or WTO) was established in 1974 in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], to replace the International Union of Official Tourist Publicity Organizations (IUOTPO). UNWTO has 160 member states and 350 affiliated members representing private organizations, educational institutions and others. It is headquartered in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The World Tourism Organization serves as a forum for tourism policies and acts as a practical source for tourism know-how.\n\n== Former specialized agencies ==\nThe only UN specialized agency to go out of existence is the [[International Refugee Organization]], which existed from 1946 to 1952. In 1952, it was replaced by the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]), which is a subsidiary organ of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].\n\n== Related organizations ==\nThere are other intergovernmental organizations that have concluded cooperation agreements with the United Nations. In terms of cooperation structures, some agreements come very close to the relationship agreements concluded under articles 57 and 63 of the UN Charter with the specialized agencies, but due to Charter requirements that the agencies deal with \"economic, social, cultural, educational, health, and related fields\", organizations with such agreements are not formally specialized agencies of the United Nations.<ref>[http://www.unsceb.org/ceb/about/agreements/list List of Agreements between Specialized Agencies and the United Nations]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"CEB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unsceb.org/ceb/about/un |title=The UN System, Chief Executives Board for Coordination |publisher=Unsceb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: \"The Executive Heads of IAEA and WTO are invited to meetings of the CEB like any other specialized agency head.\"</ref><ref>[http://www.unsceb.org/chart/index/chart_en.pdf The United Nations System chart]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Published by the United Nations Department of Public Information, December 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Organization Chart \u2013 United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination|url=https://www.unsystem.org/organizationchart|website=www.unsystem.org|language=en}}</ref><ref name=opcwdeal/><ref name=ICC/>  These organizations are termed Related Organizations by the UN.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.unsystem.org/members/related-organizations|title=DIRECTORY OF UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM ORGANIZATIONS \u2013 Related Organizations|accessdate=2018-10-08|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}</ref>\n\nThe IAEA established such an agreement with the UN in 1957, and the OPCW and the CTBTO used this model for agreements of their own with the UN.<ref name=opcwdeal>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9G6xaGx8fgC|title=The New Chemical Weapons Convention: Implementation and Prospects|editor1-last=Bothe|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Ronzitti|editor2-first=Natalino|editor3-last=Rosas|editor3-first=Allan|publisher=Kluwer Law International|date=1998|quote=The Organization is not a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN), but it will have a special relationship with it, to be organized on the basis of an agreement between the two organizations.

It submits annual reports to the UN General Assembly and to the Security Council, when necessary.  If any questions arise that fall within the purview of the Security Council, the IAEA notifies the SC accordingly.  The IAEA's special relationship with the UN and UN SC is also specified in an agreement between the IAEA and the UN in 1957.  Under this agreement the IAEA cooperates with the Security Council by furnishing it, at its request, with such information and assistance as may be required in the exercise of its responsibility for maintenance or restoration of international peace and security.  This agreement has since served as a model for UN agreements with nonproliferation organizations such as the OPCW and the CTBTO}}</ref>\n\n=== Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission ===\n{{Main|Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission}}\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission preparatory commission is tasked with preparing the activities of the nuclear non-proliferation organization.\n\n=== International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ===\n[[File:Flag of IAEA.svg|thumb|IAEA flag.]]\n{{Main|International Atomic Energy Agency}}\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an intergovernmental organization for scientific and technical cooperation in the field of [[nuclear power|nuclear]] technology.  It is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.  It seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for [[nuclear weapon|military purposes]]. The IAEA was set up as an autonomous organization on 29 July 1957. Prior to this, in 1953, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] envisioned the creation of this international body to control and develop the use of atomic energy, in his \"''[[Atoms for Peace]]''\" speech before the UN General Assembly.<ref>[http://www.iaea.org/About/history.html About IAEA: History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The organization and its former Director General, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] announced on 7 October 2005.

Instead, its relationship to the United Nations is governed by a special agreement as well as by its statute that commits the IAEA to report annually to the General Assembly and, when appropriate, to the Security Council.<ref>Johan Rautenbach: ''International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'', para.2.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.\n\n===Ether===\n{{Infobox cryptocurrency\n| currency_name = Ether (ETH)\n| image_1 = \n| image_2 = \n| image_background_1 = \n| image_background_2 = \n| image_width_1 = 120\n| alt1 =\n| image_width_2 = \n| alt2 = \n| image_title_1 = ETH Logo\n| image_title_2 = \n| superunit_name_1 = \n| subunit_name_1 = \n| superunit_ratio_1 =\n| subunit_ratio_3 = 10<sup>\u22129</sup>\n| subunit_name_3 = Gwei\n| subunit_ratio_5 = 10<sup>\u221218</sup>\n| subunit_name_5 = Wei\n| plural = Ether(s)\n| symbol = \u039e\n| alt_symbol_title_1 =\n| alt_symbol_1 =\n| ticker_symbol = ETH\n| previous_names =\n| nickname = Ether, Eth\n| precision = 18\n| white_paper = [https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper ethereum whitepaper]\n| implementations = EVM 1\n| initial_release_version = Frontier\n| initial_release_date = {{Start date and age|df=yes|2015|07|30}}\n| code_repository = {{URL|github.com/ethereum}}\n| status = Active\n| latest_release_version = Muir Glacier\n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2020|01|01|df=yes}}\n| project_fork_of = \n| programming_languages = [[C++]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]\n| operating_system = [[Cross-platform software|Cross-platform]]\n| author = [[Vitalik Buterin]], [[Gavin Wood]]\n| developer = Ethereum Foundation\n| source_model = [[Open-source model|Open-Source Model]]\n| license = [[open-source license|Open-Source Licenses]]\n| website = {{URL|ethereum.org}}\n| block_explorer = {{URL|etherchain.org}}, {{URL|etherscan.io}}, {{URL|ethplorer.io}}\n| ledger_start = {{Start date and age|2015|07|30|df=yes}}\n| split_height = 1,920,000\n| split_date = {{Start date and age|2016|07|20|df=yes}}\n| split_from = \n| split_ratio = 1:1\n| hash_function = [[SHA3|Keccack]]\n| issuance_schedule = Block and Uncle/Ommer reward.\n| timestamping = [[Proof-of-work system|Proof-of-Work]] - [[Ethash]]\n| merged_mining_parent = \n| block_time = 15 secs\n| block_reward = 2 ETH\n| circulating_supply = 109,712,230\n| supply_limit =\n| exchange_rate = $278 (Feb. 2020)\n| market_cap = $30.5 billion (Feb. 2020)\n| footnotes = {{notelist|group=infobox}}\n}}\n\n''Ether'' is a fundamental token for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public [[distributed ledger]] for transactions.

In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), which is a hybrid Proof of Work and Proof of Stake scheme, and Casper Correct-By-Construction (CBC), a separate Proof of Stake design of Casper, are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/06/11/ethereums-total-supply/|title=Ethereum's supply has crossed 100M, here's what that means|last=Varshney|first=Neer|date=11 June 2018|website=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web|language=en-us|access-date=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Markets and stores===\nEther can be traded by regular currency [[brokers]], [[cryptocurrency exchanges]], as well as many online [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fans-of-digital-currency-ether-can-now-buy-etns-in-sweden|title=Fans of Digital Currency Ether Can Now Buy ETNs\u2014In Sweden|author=Olga Kharif|date=11 October 2017|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n\n=== Virtual Machine ===\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account.
