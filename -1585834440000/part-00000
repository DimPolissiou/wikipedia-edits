offensive ways of describing [[COVID-19]]. These terms are linked to [[Wuhan]], where the virus was first detected, or China in general, via [[portmanteau]] with terms from traditional [[Chinese Martial Arts]], ''Wushu'' and ''Kung Fu''. Use of these terms (popularised in social media and [[alt-right]] sources) not only downplays the seriousness of the deadly disease but also misinforms by suggesting it is a strain of [[influenza]] (when it is ''not'' a [[flu]]), while simultaneously mocking Chinese culture. It also implies that the pandemic is China's aggressive gift to the world, when actually thousands of Chinese suffered and died from COVID-19, especially in Wuhan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|title=Trump doubles down on 'China virus', demands to know who in White House used phrase 'Kung Flu'|date=2020-03-18|website=Fox News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329102358/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|title=A last, desperate pivot: Trump and his allies go full racist on coronavirus|date=2020-03-19|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329202750/https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Misinformation===\n{{main|Misinformation related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\nThe disease does not spread by shop items that have the name of \"Corona\" on them and products from China are not necessarily at risk of giving the disease either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|title=Coronavirus Is Not The 'Corona Beer Virus', What People Are Googling|last=Lee|first=Bruce Y.|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316122432/https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|archive-date=16 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/can-i-get-coronavirus-from-a-package-being-delivered-from-china|title=Can I get coronavirus from a package delivered from China?|date=2020-02-26|website=Daily Breeze|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nBecause of its key role in the transmission and progression of SARS-CoV-2, [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2|ACE2]] has been the focus of a significant proportion of research and various [[Therapy|therapeutic]] approaches have been suggested.<ref name=\"Xu Zhong Deng Peng p.\"/> Personal hygiene, and a healthy lifestyle and [[Healthy diet|diet]] have been recommended to improve immunity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Li-sheng |last2=Wang |first2=Yi-ru |last3=Ye |first3=Da-wei |last4=Liu |first4=Qing-quan |title=A review of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) based on current evidence |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |date=19 March 2020 |page=105948 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105948 |pmid=32201353 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |language=en |issn=0924-8579 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327232545/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]], and awarded a lifetime pension.\n\nAlthough musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]], from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement embodied by the Russian composers of [[The Five (composers)|The Five]], with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style\u2014a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of [[Peter the Great]]. This resulted in uncertainty among the [[intelligentsia]] about the country's national identity\u2014an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.\n\nDespite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky's life was punctuated by personal crises and depression. Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by his mother's early death, the death of his close friend and colleague [[Nikolai Rubinstein]], and the collapse of the one enduring relationship of his adult life, which was his 13-year association with the wealthy widow [[Nadezhda von Meck]] who was his [[patron]] even though they never actually met each other. His homosexuality, which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor, though some musicologists now downplay its importance. Tchaikovsky's sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to [[cholera]]; there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the [[Death of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|cause of death]], and whether his death was accidental or [[suicide|self-inflicted]].\n\nWhile his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it was sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements. In an apparent reinforcement of the latter claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base [[exoticism]] and said he transcended stereotypes of Russian classical music. Others dismissed Tchaikovsky's music as \"lacking in elevated thought\"<ref>According to longtime ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]].</ref> and derided its formal workings as deficient because they did not stringently follow Western principles.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|image1=\u0414\u043e\u043c \u0427\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e.jpg |alt1=A peach-colored prune-tiled three-story house with single-story aisles surrounded by trees |caption1=Tchaikovsky's birthplace in Votkinsk, now [[Tchaikovsky Museum (Votkinsk)|a museum]] |image2=Tchaikovskys family in 1848 From left to right sitting Alexandra Andreevna Tchaikovska Alexandra Ippolit Ilya Petrovitch Tchai Family 2.jpg |caption2=The Tchaikovsky family in 1848.

Precocious, within three years he had become as adept at reading sheet music as his teacher. His parents, initially supportive, hired a tutor, bought an [[orchestrion]] (a form of barrel organ that could imitate elaborate orchestral effects), and encouraged his piano study for both aesthetic and practical reasons. However, they decided in 1850 to send Tchaikovsky to the [[Imperial School of Jurisprudence]] in Saint Petersburg.

It transformed him into a musical professional, with tools to help him thrive as a composer, and the in-depth exposure to European principles and musical forms gave him a sense that his art was not exclusively Russian or Western.<ref name=\"taruskin_go4663\">Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:663\u201364.</ref> This mindset became important in Tchaikovsky's reconciliation of Russian and European influences in his compositional style.

While the salary for his professorship was only 50 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky's morale and he accepted the post eagerly.

Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.<ref>Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:153\u201354.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1860s, Tchaikovsky began to compose operas. His first, ''[[The Voyevoda (opera)|The Voyevoda]]'', based on a play by [[Alexander Ostrovsky]], premiered in 1869. The composer became dissatisfied with it, however, and, having re-used parts of it in later works, destroyed the manuscript. ''[[Undina (Tchaikovsky)|Undina]]'' followed in 1870. Only excerpts were performed and it, too, was destroyed.<ref name=\"Taruskin 665\">Taruskin, 665.</ref> Between these projects, Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called ''Mandragora'', to a libretto by Sergei Rachinskii; the only music he completed was a short chorus of Flowers and Insects.<ref>Holden, 75\u201376; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nThe first Tchaikovsky opera to survive intact, ''[[The Oprichnik]]'', premiered in 1874. During its composition, he lost Ostrovsky's part-finished libretto. Tchaikovsky, too embarrassed to ask for another copy, decided to write the libretto himself, modelling his dramatic technique on that of [[Eug\u00e8ne Scribe]]. Cui wrote a \"characteristically savage press attack\" on the opera. Mussorgsky, writing to [[Vladimir Stasov]], disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public.

Courtesy of Musopen\n}}\n\n====Melody====\nAmerican music critic and journalist [[Harold C. Schonberg]] wrote of Tchaikovsky's \"sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous fund of [[melody]]\", a feature that has ensured his music's continued success with audiences.<ref name=\"schonberg366\">Schonberg, 366.</ref> Tchaikovsky's complete range of melodic styles was as wide as that of his compositions. Sometimes he used Western-style melodies, sometimes original melodies written in the style of Russian folk song; sometimes he used actual folk songs.<ref name=\"brown_ng18628\"/> According to ''The New Grove'', Tchaikovsky's melodic gift could also become his worst enemy in two ways. The first challenge arose from his ethnic heritage. Unlike Western themes, the melodies that Russian composers wrote tended to be self-contained; they functioned with a mindset of stasis and repetition rather than one of progress and ongoing development. On a technical level, it made [[modulation (music)|modulating]] to a new key to introduce a contrasting second theme exceedingly difficult, as this was literally a foreign concept that did not exist in Russian music.<ref name=\"brown_final424\">Brown, ''Final'', 424.</ref> The second way melody worked against Tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with the majority of Romantic-age composers. They did not write in the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with [[sonata form]], such as those favored by Classical composers such as Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven, but were complete and independent in themselves.<ref>Cooper, 26.</ref> This completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another. This challenge was why the Romantics \"were never natural symphonists\".<ref>Cooper, 24.</ref> All a composer like Tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them, even when he modified them to generate tension, maintain interest and satisfy listeners.<ref>Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Harmony====\nHarmony could be a potential trap for Tchaikovsky, according to Brown, since Russian creativity tended to focus on inertia and self-enclosed tableaux, while Western harmony worked against this to propel the music onward and, on a larger scale, shape it.<ref>Brown, ''Final'', 422, 432\u201334.</ref> [[modulation (music)|Modulation]], the shifting from one key to another, was a driving principle in both harmony and [[sonata form]], the primary Western large-scale [[musical form|musical structure]] since the middle of the 18th century. Modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time-scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other.<ref>Roberts, ''New Grove (1980)'', 12:454.</ref> One point in Tchaikovsky's favor was \"a flair for harmony\" that \"astonished\" Rudolph K\u00fcndinger, Tchaikovsky's music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence.<ref>As quoted in Polyansky, ''Eyes'', 18.</ref> Added to what he learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory studies, this talent allowed Tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music, from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to the use of the [[whole tone scale]] in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony, a practice more typically used by The Five.<ref name=\"brown_ng18628\"/>\n\n====Rhythm====\n[[Rhythm (music)|Rhythmically]], Tchaikovsky sometimes experimented with unusual [[Meter (music)|meters]]. More often, he used a firm, regular meter, a practice that served him well in dance music. At times, his rhythms became pronounced enough to become the main expressive agent of the music. They also became a means, found typically in Russian folk music, of simulating movement or progression in large-scale symphonic movements\u2014a \"synthetic propulsion\", as Brown phrases it, which substituted for the momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by the interaction of melodic or motivic elements. This interaction generally does not take place in Russian music.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; ''Final'', 424.</ref> (For more on this, please see '''[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky#Repetition|Repetition]]''' below.)\n\n====Structure====\nTchaikovsky struggled with sonata form. Its principle of organic growth through the interplay of musical themes was alien to Russian practice.<ref name=\"brown_final424\"/> The traditional argument that Tchaikovsky seemed unable to develop themes in this manner fails to consider this point; it also discounts the possibility that Tchaikovsky might have intended the development passages in his large-scale works to act as \"enforced hiatuses\" to build tension, rather than grow organically as smoothly progressive musical arguments.<ref>Zajaczkowski, 25</ref>\n\nAccording to Brown and musicologists [[Hans Keller]] and [[Daniel Zhitomirsky]], Tchaikovsky found his solution to large-scale structure while composing the Fourth Symphony. He essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an \"outline\", as Zhitomirsky phrases it.<ref name=\"zhitomirsky102\">Zhitomirsky, 102.</ref> Within this outline, the focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition. Tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another, with what Keller calls \"new and violent contrasts\" between [[Theme (music)|musical themes]], [[Key (music)|keys]], and harmonies.<ref>Brown, ''Final'', 426; Keller, 347.</ref> This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentum<ref name=\"brown_final426\">Brown, ''Final'', 426.</ref> and adds intense drama.<ref>Keller, 346\u201347.</ref> While the result, Warrack charges, is still \"an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them\" in the Germanic sense,<ref>Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 11.</ref> Brown counters that it took the listener of the period \"through a succession of often highly charged sections which ''added up'' to a radically new kind of symphonic experience\" (italics Brown), one that functioned not on the basis of summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation.<ref name=\"brown_final426\"/>\n\nPartly due to the melodic and structural intricacies involved in this accumulation and partly due to the composer's nature, Tchaikovsky's music became intensely expressive.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Keller, 346\u201347; Maes, 161.</ref> This intensity was entirely new to Russian music and prompted some Russians to place Tchaikovsky's name alongside that of Dostoyevsky.<ref>Volkov, 115</ref> German musicologist [[Hermann Kretzschmar]] credits Tchaikovsky in his later symphonies with offering \"full images of life, developed freely, sometimes even dramatically, around psychological contrasts ... This music has the mark of the truly lived and felt experience\".<ref>As quoted in Botstein, 101.</ref> Botstein, in elaborating on this comment, suggests that listening to Tchaikovsky's music \"became a psychological mirror connected to everyday experience, one that reflected on the dynamic nature of the listener's own emotional self\". This active engagement with the music \"opened for the listener a vista of emotional and psychological tension and an extremity of feeling that possessed relevance because it seemed reminiscent of one's own 'truly lived and felt experience' or one's search for intensity in a deeply personal sense\".<ref name=\"Botstein, 101\">Botstein, 101.</ref>\n\n====Repetition====\n[[File:Sequence ascending from C tonal.png|thumb|right|350px|Sequence ascending by step {{Audio|Sequence ascending from C tonal.mid|Play}}. Note that there are only four segments, continuously higher, and that the segments continue by the same distance (seconds: C\u2013D, D\u2013E, etc.).]]\n\nAs mentioned above, repetition was a natural part of Tchaikovsky's music, just as it is an integral part of Russian music.<ref>Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 9. Also see Brown, ''Final'', 422\u201323.</ref> His use of [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] within melodies ([[repetition (music)|repeating]] a tune at a higher or lower [[pitch (music)|pitch]] in the same voice)<ref>Benward and Saker, 111\u201312.</ref> could go on for extreme length.<ref name=\"brown_ng18628\"/> The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it.<ref>Brown, ''Final'', 423\u201324; Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 9.</ref> Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements.<ref name=\"Maes161\">Maes, 161.</ref> By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building \"into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity\", as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove'' (1980), 18:628. Also see Bostrick, 105.</ref> Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement.<ref>Cooper, 32.</ref> (For more on this practice, see the next section.)\n\n====Orchestration====\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies (ISRC USUAN1100270).oga|title=Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy|description=\"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" from ''The Nutcracker'' makes extensive use of the then newly invented and very rare [[celesta]]}}\nLike other late Romantic composers, Tchaikovsky relied heavily on [[orchestration]] for musical effects.<ref>Holoman, ''New Grove (2001)'', 12:413.</ref> Tchaikovsky, however, became noted for the \"sensual opulence\" and \"voluptuous timbrel virtuosity\" of his orchestration.<ref>Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:669.</ref> Like Glinka, Tchaikovsky tended toward bright primary [[timbre|colors]] and sharply delineated contrasts of [[texture (music)|texture]].<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Hopkins, ''New Grove (1980)'', 13:698.</ref> However, beginning with the [[Symphony No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Third Symphony]], Tchaikovsky experimented with an increased range of timbres<ref>Maes, 78.</ref> Tchaikovsky's scoring was noted and admired by some of his peers. Rimsky-Korsakov regularly referred his students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to it and called it \"devoid of all striving after effect, [to] give a healthy, beautiful sonority\".<ref>As quoted in Taruskin, ''Stravinsky'', 206.</ref> This sonority, musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] points out, is essentially Germanic in effect. Tchaikovsky's expert use of having two or more instruments play a melody simultaneously (a practice called [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]]) and his ear for uncanny combinations of instruments resulted in \"a generalized orchestral sonority in which the individual timbres of the instruments, being thoroughly mixed, would vanish\".<ref>Taruskin, ''Stravinsky'', 206</ref>\n\n====Pastiche (Pass\u00e9-ism)====\nIn works like the \"Serenade for Strings\" and the ''Variations on a Rococo Theme'', Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at writing in a style of 18th-century European [[pastiche]]. In the ballet ''The Sleeping Beauty'' and the opera ''The Queen of Spades'', Tchaikovsky graduated from imitation to full-scale evocation. This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls \"pass\u00e9-ism\", lends an air of timelessness and immediacy, making the past seem as though it were the present.<ref>Volkov, 124.</ref> On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them. His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn. (In this sense, Tchaikovsky operated in the opposite manner to [[Igor Stravinsky]], who turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] partly as a form of compositional self-discovery.) Tchaikovsky's attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:613, 615.</ref>\n\n===Antecedents and influences===\n[[File:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Robert Schumann]], lithograph by [[Josef Kriehuber]], in 1839]]\n\nOf Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann stands out as an influence in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist [[Roland John Wiley]].<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:613, 18:620; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 58.</ref> [[Boris Asafyev]] comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky not just as a formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression.<ref>Asafyev, 13\u201314.</ref> [[Leon Botstein]] claims the music of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]] also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style.<ref>Bostein, 103.</ref><ref group=a>As proof of Wagner's influence, Botstein cites a letter from Tchaikovsky to Taneyev, in which the composer \"readily admits the influence of the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Nibelungen]]'' on ''Francesca da Rimini''\".

What his listeners experienced on an emotional or visceral level became an end in itself.<ref>Maes, 138.</ref> Tchaikovsky's focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of Mendelssohn or Mozart. Considering that he lived and worked in what was probably the last 19th-century feudal nation, the statement is not actually that surprising.<ref>Figes, 274; Maes, 139\u201341.</ref> And yet, even when writing so-called 'programme music, for example his Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture, he cast it in sonata form.  His use of stylized 18th-century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward the values of Russian aristocracy.<ref name=\"maes137\">Maes, 137.</ref> He was aided in this by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who commissioned ''The Sleeping Beauty'' from Tchaikovsky and the libretto for ''The Queen of Spades'' from Modest with their use of 18th century settings stipulated firmly.<ref>Maes, 146, 152.</ref><ref group=a>Vsevolozhsky originally intended the libretto for a now-unknown composer named Nikolai Klenovsky, not Tchaikovsky (Maes, 152).</ref> Tchaikovsky also used the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]] frequently, the dance being a musical code for the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]] and a symbol of Russian patriotism. Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners.<ref>Figes, 274; Maes, 78\u201379, 137.</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Dedicatees and collaborators====\n[[File:Marius Ivanovich Petipa -Feb. 14 1898.JPG|180px|thumb|upright|Marius Petipa]]\n\nTchaikovsky's relationship with collaborators was mixed. Like Nikolai Rubinstein with the First Piano Concerto, virtuoso and pedagogue [[Leopold Auer]] rejected the Violin Concerto initially but changed his mind; he played it to great public success and taught it to his students, who included [[Jascha Heifetz]] and [[Nathan Milstein]].<ref>Steinberg</ref> [[Wilhelm Fitzenhagen]] \"intervened considerably in shaping what he considered 'his' piece\", the ''Variations on a Rococo Theme'', according to music critic [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]]. Tchaikovsky was angered by Fitzenhagen's license but did nothing; the Rococo Variations were published with the cellist's amendments.<ref>Brown, ''Crisis'', 122.</ref><ref group=a>The composer's original has since been published but most cellists still perform Fitzenhagen's version (Campbell, 77).</ref> His collaboration on the three ballets went better and in [[Marius Petipa]], who worked with him on the last two, he might have found an advocate.<ref group=a>Tchaikovsky's work with Julius Reisinger on ''Swan Lake'' was evidently also successful, since it left him with no qualms about working with Petipa, but very little is written about it (Maes, 146).</ref> When ''The Sleeping Beauty'' was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated, Petipa convinced them to put in the extra effort. Tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for the dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at the time. He responded with scores that minimized the rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody, with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in the average ballet score.<ref>Maes, 145\u201348.</ref>\n\n====Critics====\n[[File:Hanslick.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eduard Hanslick]]\nCritical reception to Tchaikovsky's music was also varied but also improved over time. Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect for not being nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason.<ref name=\"botstein99\">Botstein, 99.</ref> There might have been a grain of truth in the latter, according to musicologist and conductor Leon Botstein, as German critics especially wrote of the \"indeterminacy of [Tchaikovsky's] artistic character ... being truly at home in the non-Russian\".<ref>As quoted in Botstein, 100.</ref> Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music, [[Eduard Hanslick]] lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition \"whose stink one can hear\"<ref>[[Eduard Hanslick|Hanslick, Eduard]], ''Music Criticisms 1850\u20131900'', ed. and trans. [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1963). As quoted in Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 487.</ref> and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, \"The furious peroration sounds like nothing so much as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker. Pandemonium, [[delirium tremens]], raving, and above all, noise worse confounded!\"<ref>''Boston Evening Transcript'', 23 October 1892. As quoted in Steinberg, ''Symphony'', 631</ref>\n\nThe division between Russian and Western critics remained through much of the 20th century but for a different reason. According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovsky's music that appealed to audiences\u2014its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration\u2014added up to compositional shallowness.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:169.</ref> The music's use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their eyes still further.<ref name=\"brown_ng18628\"/> There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovsky's music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, \"spoke to the listener's imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality\". Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the \"violence and 'hysteria' \" they detected and felt such emotive displays \"attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation\u2014the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment\u2014and the polite engagement of art as an act of amusement\".<ref name=\"Botstein, 101\"/>\n\nThere has also been the fact that the composer did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality.<ref name=\"Maes161\"/> Even with what Schonberg termed \"a professional reevaluation\" of Tchaikovsky's work,<ref name=\"schonberg367\">Schonberg, 367.</ref> the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, ''New York Times'' critic [[Allan Kozinn]] writes, \"It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music\u2014entertaining and widely beloved though it is\u2014that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded in the context of the whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow\".{{sfn|Kozinn|1992}}\n\nIn the 21st century, however, critics are reacting more positively to Tchaikovsky's tunefulness, originality, and craftsmanship.<ref name=\"schonberg367\"/> \"Tchaikovsky is being viewed again as a composer of the first rank, writing music of depth, innovation and influence,\" according to [[Cultural history|cultural historian]] and author [[Joseph Horowitz]].<ref name=\"horowitz\"/> Important in this reevaluation is a shift in attitude away from the disdain for overt emotionalism that marked half of the 20th century.<ref name=\"wiley_ng25169\">Wiley, ''New Grove (2001), 25:169.</ref> \"We have acquired a different view of Romantic 'excess,'\" Horowitz says. \"Tchaikovsky is today more admired than deplored for his emotional frankness; if his music seems harried and insecure, so are we all\".<ref name=\"horowitz\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11030/1121245-388.stm |last=Druckenbrod|first=Andrew|title=Festival to explore Tchaikovsky's changing reputation|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Public====\n{{see also|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in popular media}}\n\nHorowitz maintains that, while the standing of Tchaikovsky's music has fluctuated among critics, for the public, \"it never went out of style, and his most popular works have yielded iconic [[Sound bite|sound-bytes]] {{sic}}, such as the love theme from ''Romeo and Juliet''\".<ref name=\"horowitz\"/> Along with those tunes, Botstein adds, \"Tchaikovsky appealed to audiences outside of Russia with an immediacy and directness that were startling even for music, an art form often associated with emotion\".<ref>Botstein, 100.</ref> Tchaikovsky's melodies, stated with eloquence and matched by his inventive use of harmony and orchestration, have always ensured audience appeal.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:606\u201307, 628.</ref> His popularity is considered secure, with his following in many countries, including Great Britain and the United States, second only to that of Beethoven.<ref name=\"wi25169\"/> His music has also been used frequently in popular music and film.<ref>Steinberg, ''The Symphony'', 611.</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:\u0421\u0438\u043c\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c. \u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041f. \u0418. \u0427\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443..JPG|thumb|Statue of Tchaikovsky in [[Simferopol]], Crimea]]\nAccording to Wiley, Tchaikovsky was a pioneer in several ways. \"Thanks in large part to Nadezhda von Meck\", Wiley writes, \"he became the first full-time professional Russian composer\". This, Wiley adds, allowed him the time and freedom to consolidate the Western compositional practices he had learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk song and other native musical elements to fulfill his own expressive goals and forge an original, deeply personal style. He made an impact in not only absolute works such as the symphony but also program music and, as Wiley phrases it, \"transformed Liszt's and Berlioz's achievements ... into matters of Shakespearean elevation and psychological import\".<ref>Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:144.</ref> Wiley and Holden both note that Tchaikovsky did all this without a native school of composition upon which to fall back. They point out that only Glinka had preceded him in combining Russian and Western practices and his teachers in Saint Petersburg had been thoroughly Germanic in their musical outlook. He was, they write, for all intents and purposes alone in his artistic quest.<ref>Holden, xxi; Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:144.</ref>\n\n[[File:Russia stamp Swan Lake 1993 25r.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Stamp of Russia, ''Swan Lake'', 1993]]\nMaes and Taruskin write that Tchaikovsky believed that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his contemporaries in The Five.<ref>Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:663.</ref> Maes adds that, like them, he wanted to produce music that reflected Russian national character but which did so to the highest European standards of quality.<ref>Maes, 73.</ref> Tchaikovsky, according to Maes, came along at a time when the nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was. Like his country, Maes writes, it took him time to discover how to express his Russianness in a way that was true to himself and what he had learned. Because of his professionalism, Maes says, he worked hard at this goal and succeeded. The composer's friend, music critic [[Hermann Laroche]], wrote of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' that the score contained \"an element deeper and more general than color, in the internal structure of the music, above all in the foundation of the element of melody. This basic element is undoubtedly Russian\".<ref>As quoted in Maes, 166.</ref>\n\nTchaikovsky was inspired to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin.<ref>Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 664.</ref> His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged to not just Russia but also the world at large.<ref name=\"taruskin_go4663\"/> Volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about Russia's place in European musical culture\u2014the first Russian composer to do so.<ref name=\"volkovsp126\"/> It steeled him to become the first Russian composer to acquaint foreign audiences personally with his own works, Warrack writes, as well as those of other Russian composers.<ref>Warrack, 209.</ref> In his biography of Tchaikovsky, [[Anthony Holden]] recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: \"Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into [[20th-century music]].

He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]], and awarded a lifetime pension.\n\nAlthough musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]], from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement embodied by the Russian composers of [[The Five (composers)|The Five]], with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style\u2014a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of [[Peter the Great]]. This resulted in uncertainty among the [[intelligentsia]] about the country's national identity\u2014an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.\n\nDespite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky's life was punctuated by personal crises and depression. Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by his mother's early death, the death of his close friend and colleague [[Nikolai Rubinstein]], and the collapse of the one enduring relationship of his adult life, which was his 13-year association with the wealthy widow [[Nadezhda von Meck]] who was his [[patron]] even though they never actually met each other. His homosexuality, which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor, though some musicologists now downplay its importance. Tchaikovsky's sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to [[cholera]]; there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the [[Death of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|cause of death]], and whether his death was accidental or [[suicide|self-inflicted]].\n\nWhile his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it was sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements. In an apparent reinforcement of the latter claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base [[exoticism]] and said he transcended stereotypes of Russian classical music. Others dismissed Tchaikovsky's music as \"lacking in elevated thought\"<ref>According to longtime ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]].</ref> and derided its formal workings as deficient because they did not stringently follow Western principles.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|image1=\u0414\u043e\u043c \u0427\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e.jpg |alt1=A peach-colored prune-tiled three-story house with single-story aisles surrounded by trees |caption1=Tchaikovsky's birthplace in Votkinsk, now [[Tchaikovsky Museum (Votkinsk)|a museum]] |image2=Tchaikovskys family in 1848 From left to right sitting Alexandra Andreevna Tchaikovska Alexandra Ippolit Ilya Petrovitch Tchai Family 2.jpg |caption2=The Tchaikovsky family in 1848.

Precocious, within three years he had become as adept at reading sheet music as his teacher. His parents, initially supportive, hired a tutor, bought an [[orchestrion]] (a form of barrel organ that could imitate elaborate orchestral effects), and encouraged his piano study for both aesthetic and practical reasons. However, they decided in 1850 to send Tchaikovsky to the [[Imperial School of Jurisprudence]] in Saint Petersburg. They had both graduated from institutes in Saint Petersburg and the School of Jurisprudence, which mainly served the lesser nobility, and thought that this education would prepare Tchaikovsky for a career as a civil servant.<ref>Brown, ''Early'', 31; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 8.</ref> Regardless of talent, the only musical careers available in Russia at that time\u2014except for the affluent aristocracy\u2014were as a teacher in an academy or as an instrumentalist in one of the Imperial Theaters.

It transformed him into a musical professional, with tools to help him thrive as a composer, and the in-depth exposure to European principles and musical forms gave him a sense that his art was not exclusively Russian or Western.<ref name=\"taruskin_go4663\">Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:663\u201364.</ref> This mindset became important in Tchaikovsky's reconciliation of Russian and European influences in his compositional style.

Nikolai Rubinstein's private fits of rage critiquing his music, such as attacking the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|First Piano Concerto]], did not help matters.<ref name=\"wiley25147\"/> His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions. [[Hans von B\u00fclow]] premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor.<ref>Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 474\u201376; Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:161.</ref> Other artists included [[Adele Aus der Ohe]], [[Max Erdmannsd\u00f6rfer]], [[Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk]] and [[Sergei Taneyev]].\n\n[[File:Hans von buelow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A middle-aged, balding man with a mustache and small beard, wearing a dark suit and holding a cigarette.|The conductor [[Hans von B\u00fclow]]]]\n\nAnother factor that helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was a shift in attitude among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.<ref>Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:153\u201354.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1860s, Tchaikovsky began to compose operas. His first, ''[[The Voyevoda (opera)|The Voyevoda]]'', based on a play by [[Alexander Ostrovsky]], premiered in 1869. The composer became dissatisfied with it, however, and, having re-used parts of it in later works, destroyed the manuscript. ''[[Undina (Tchaikovsky)|Undina]]'' followed in 1870. Only excerpts were performed and it, too, was destroyed.<ref name=\"Taruskin 665\">Taruskin, 665.</ref> Between these projects, Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called ''Mandragora'', to a libretto by Sergei Rachinskii; the only music he completed was a short chorus of Flowers and Insects.<ref>Holden, 75\u201376; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nThe first Tchaikovsky opera to survive intact, ''[[The Oprichnik]]'', premiered in 1874. During its composition, he lost Ostrovsky's part-finished libretto. Tchaikovsky, too embarrassed to ask for another copy, decided to write the libretto himself, modelling his dramatic technique on that of [[Eug\u00e8ne Scribe]]. Cui wrote a \"characteristically savage press attack\" on the opera. Mussorgsky, writing to [[Vladimir Stasov]], disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public. Nevertheless, ''The Oprichnik'' continues to be performed from time to time in Russia.<ref name=\"Taruskin 665\"/>\n\nThe last of the early operas, ''[[Vakula the Smith]]'' (Op.14), was composed in the second half of 1874. The libretto, based on [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]]'s ''[[Christmas Eve (Gogol)|Christmas Eve]]'', was to have been set to music by [[Alexander Serov]]. With Serov's death, the libretto was opened to a competition with a guarantee that the winning entry would be premiered by the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]]. Tchaikovsky was declared the winner, but at the 1876 premiere, the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception.<ref>Brown, ''Viking'', 1086.</ref> After Tchaikovsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the opera ''[[Christmas Eve (opera)|Christmas Eve]]'', based on the same story.<ref>Maes, 171.</ref>\n\nOther works of this period include the ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' for cello and orchestra, the [[Symphony No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)|Fourth Symphonies]], the ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and the opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''.\n\n===Personal life===\n\n[[File:Tchaikovsky with wife Antonina Miliukova.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A middle aged man with dark hair and a beard, wearing a dark suit and holding a book, sits next to a young woman in a black dress wearing her hair up on her head|Tchaikovsky and Antonina on their honeymoon, 1877]]\n[[File:Kotek iosif.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|[[Iosif Kotek]] (left) and Tchaikovsky (right), 1877]]\nDiscussion of Tchaikovsky's personal life, especially his sexuality, has perhaps been the most extensive of any composer in the 19th century and certainly of any Russian composer of his time.<ref>Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', xvi.</ref> It has also at times caused considerable confusion, from Soviet efforts to expunge all references to same-sex attraction and portray him as a heterosexual, to efforts at armchair analysis by Western biographers.<ref>Maes, 133\u201334; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', xvii.</ref> Biographers have generally agreed that Tchaikovsky was homosexual.<ref>Poznansky, ''Quest'', all.</ref> He sought the company of other men in his circle for extended periods, \"associating openly and establishing professional connections with them\".<ref name=\"wiley25147\">Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:147.</ref> His first love was reportedly Sergey Kireyev, a younger fellow student at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence. According to Modest Tchaikovsky, this was Pyotr Ilyich's \"strongest, longest and purest love\". The degree to which the composer might have felt comfortable with his sexual desires has, however, remained open to debate. It is still unknown whether Tchaikovsky, according to musicologist and biographer [[David Brown (musicologist)|David Brown]], \"felt tainted within himself, defiled by something from which he finally realized he could never escape\"<ref>Brown, ''Early'', 50.</ref> or whether, according to Alexander Poznansky, he experienced \"no unbearable guilt\" over his sexual desires<ref name=\"wiley25147\"/> and \"eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality&nbsp;... without experiencing any serious psychological damage\".<ref>Poznansky, as quoted in Holden, 394.</ref> Relevant portions of his brother Modest's autobiography, where he tells of the composer's same-sex attraction, have been published, as have letters previously suppressed by Soviet censors in which Tchaikovsky openly writes of it.<ref>Poznansky, ''Eyes'', 8, 24, 77, 82, 103\u201305, 165\u201368.

Rubinstein's actions, in turn, had been spurred by Tchaikovsky's withdrawal from the Russian delegation for the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris World's Fair]], a position for which Rubinstein had lobbied on the composer's behalf (Brown, ''Crisis'', 249\u201350; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 180, 188\u201389). Rubinstein had been scheduled to conduct four concerts there; the first featured Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto (Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 190).</ref> For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible.<ref name=\"brmm219\">Brown, ''Man and Music'', 219.</ref> During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s call for \"universal unity\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \"overly dependent on the West\".

He also performed in concerts as a conductor in [[Kiev]], [[Odessa]], and [[Kharkiv]].\n\n===Compositional style===\n{{listen|type=music|pos=left\n|filename=Tschikovsky Op 40.ogg|title=Valse in F-sharp minor|description=From ''Twelve Pieces for piano'', Op. 40, No. 9, a digital recording by [[Kevin MacLeod]]\n|filename2=Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - romeo and juliet- overture-fantasy.ogg|title2=Romeo and Juliet Overture|description2=Performed by the Skidmore College Orchestra, courtesy of [[Musopen]]\n | filename3    = Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - 1812 overture.ogg\n | title3       = 1812 Overture\n | description3 = Performed by the Skidmore College Orchestra. Courtesy of Musopen\n}}\n\n====Melody====\nAmerican music critic and journalist [[Harold C. Schonberg]] wrote of Tchaikovsky's \"sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous fund of [[melody]]\", a feature that has ensured his music's continued success with audiences.<ref name=\"schonberg366\">Schonberg, 366.</ref> Tchaikovsky's complete range of melodic styles was as wide as that of his compositions. Sometimes he used Western-style melodies, sometimes original melodies written in the style of Russian folk song; sometimes he used actual folk songs.<ref name=\"brown_ng18628\"/> According to ''The New Grove'', Tchaikovsky's melodic gift could also become his worst enemy in two ways. The first challenge arose from his ethnic heritage. Unlike Western themes, the melodies that Russian composers wrote tended to be self-contained; they functioned with a mindset of stasis and repetition rather than one of progress and ongoing development. On a technical level, it made [[modulation (music)|modulating]] to a new key to introduce a contrasting second theme exceedingly difficult, as this was literally a foreign concept that did not exist in Russian music.<ref name=\"brown_final424\">Brown, ''Final'', 424.</ref> The second way melody worked against Tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with the majority of Romantic-age composers. They did not write in the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with [[sonata form]], such as those favored by Classical composers such as Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven, but were complete and independent in themselves.<ref>Cooper, 26.</ref> This completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another. This challenge was why the Romantics \"were never natural symphonists\".<ref>Cooper, 24.</ref> All a composer like Tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them, even when he modified them to generate tension, maintain interest and satisfy listeners.<ref>Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Harmony====\nHarmony could be a potential trap for Tchaikovsky, according to Brown, since Russian creativity tended to focus on inertia and self-enclosed tableaux, while Western harmony worked against this to propel the music onward and, on a larger scale, shape it.<ref>Brown, ''Final'', 422, 432\u201334.</ref> [[modulation (music)|Modulation]], the shifting from one key to another, was a driving principle in both harmony and [[sonata form]], the primary Western large-scale [[musical form|musical structure]] since the middle of the 18th century. Modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time-scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other.<ref>Roberts, ''New Grove (1980)'', 12:454.</ref> One point in Tchaikovsky's favor was \"a flair for harmony\" that \"astonished\" Rudolph K\u00fcndinger, Tchaikovsky's music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence.<ref>As quoted in Polyansky, ''Eyes'', 18.</ref> Added to what he learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory studies, this talent allowed Tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music, from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to the use of the [[whole tone scale]] in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony, a practice more typically used by The Five.<ref name=\"brown_ng18628\"/>\n\n====Rhythm====\n[[Rhythm (music)|Rhythmically]], Tchaikovsky sometimes experimented with unusual [[Meter (music)|meters]]. More often, he used a firm, regular meter, a practice that served him well in dance music. At times, his rhythms became pronounced enough to become the main expressive agent of the music. They also became a means, found typically in Russian folk music, of simulating movement or progression in large-scale symphonic movements\u2014a \"synthetic propulsion\", as Brown phrases it, which substituted for the momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by the interaction of melodic or motivic elements. This interaction generally does not take place in Russian music.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; ''Final'', 424.</ref> (For more on this, please see '''[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky#Repetition|Repetition]]''' below.)\n\n====Structure====\nTchaikovsky struggled with sonata form. Its principle of organic growth through the interplay of musical themes was alien to Russian practice.<ref name=\"brown_final424\"/> The traditional argument that Tchaikovsky seemed unable to develop themes in this manner fails to consider this point; it also discounts the possibility that Tchaikovsky might have intended the development passages in his large-scale works to act as \"enforced hiatuses\" to build tension, rather than grow organically as smoothly progressive musical arguments.<ref>Zajaczkowski, 25</ref>\n\nAccording to Brown and musicologists [[Hans Keller]] and [[Daniel Zhitomirsky]], Tchaikovsky found his solution to large-scale structure while composing the Fourth Symphony. He essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an \"outline\", as Zhitomirsky phrases it.<ref name=\"zhitomirsky102\">Zhitomirsky, 102.</ref> Within this outline, the focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition. Tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another, with what Keller calls \"new and violent contrasts\" between [[Theme (music)|musical themes]], [[Key (music)|keys]], and harmonies.<ref>Brown, ''Final'', 426; Keller, 347.</ref> This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentum<ref name=\"brown_final426\">Brown, ''Final'', 426.</ref> and adds intense drama.<ref>Keller, 346\u201347.</ref> While the result, Warrack charges, is still \"an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them\" in the Germanic sense,<ref>Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 11.</ref> Brown counters that it took the listener of the period \"through a succession of often highly charged sections which ''added up'' to a radically new kind of symphonic experience\" (italics Brown), one that functioned not on the basis of summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation.<ref name=\"brown_final426\"/>\n\nPartly due to the melodic and structural intricacies involved in this accumulation and partly due to the composer's nature, Tchaikovsky's music became intensely expressive.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Keller, 346\u201347; Maes, 161.</ref> This intensity was entirely new to Russian music and prompted some Russians to place Tchaikovsky's name alongside that of Dostoyevsky.<ref>Volkov, 115</ref> German musicologist [[Hermann Kretzschmar]] credits Tchaikovsky in his later symphonies with offering \"full images of life, developed freely, sometimes even dramatically, around psychological contrasts ... This music has the mark of the truly lived and felt experience\".<ref>As quoted in Botstein, 101.</ref> Botstein, in elaborating on this comment, suggests that listening to Tchaikovsky's music \"became a psychological mirror connected to everyday experience, one that reflected on the dynamic nature of the listener's own emotional self\". This active engagement with the music \"opened for the listener a vista of emotional and psychological tension and an extremity of feeling that possessed relevance because it seemed reminiscent of one's own 'truly lived and felt experience' or one's search for intensity in a deeply personal sense\".<ref name=\"Botstein, 101\">Botstein, 101.</ref>\n\n====Repetition====\n[[File:Sequence ascending from C tonal.png|thumb|right|350px|Sequence ascending by step {{Audio|Sequence ascending from C tonal.mid|Play}}. Note that there are only four segments, continuously higher, and that the segments continue by the same distance (seconds: C\u2013D, D\u2013E, etc.).]]\n\nAs mentioned above, repetition was a natural part of Tchaikovsky's music, just as it is an integral part of Russian music.<ref>Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 9. Also see Brown, ''Final'', 422\u201323.</ref> His use of [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] within melodies ([[repetition (music)|repeating]] a tune at a higher or lower [[pitch (music)|pitch]] in the same voice)<ref>Benward and Saker, 111\u201312.</ref> could go on for extreme length.<ref name=\"brown_ng18628\"/> The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it.<ref>Brown, ''Final'', 423\u201324; Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 9.</ref> Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements.<ref name=\"Maes161\">Maes, 161.</ref> By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building \"into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity\", as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove'' (1980), 18:628. Also see Bostrick, 105.</ref> Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement.<ref>Cooper, 32.</ref> (For more on this practice, see the next section.)\n\n====Orchestration====\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies (ISRC USUAN1100270).oga|title=Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy|description=\"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" from ''The Nutcracker'' makes extensive use of the then newly invented and very rare [[celesta]]}}\nLike other late Romantic composers, Tchaikovsky relied heavily on [[orchestration]] for musical effects.<ref>Holoman, ''New Grove (2001)'', 12:413.</ref> Tchaikovsky, however, became noted for the \"sensual opulence\" and \"voluptuous timbrel virtuosity\" of his orchestration.<ref>Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:669.</ref> Like Glinka, Tchaikovsky tended toward bright primary [[timbre|colors]] and sharply delineated contrasts of [[texture (music)|texture]].<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Hopkins, ''New Grove (1980)'', 13:698.</ref> However, beginning with the [[Symphony No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Third Symphony]], Tchaikovsky experimented with an increased range of timbres<ref>Maes, 78.</ref> Tchaikovsky's scoring was noted and admired by some of his peers. Rimsky-Korsakov regularly referred his students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to it and called it \"devoid of all striving after effect, [to] give a healthy, beautiful sonority\".<ref>As quoted in Taruskin, ''Stravinsky'', 206.</ref> This sonority, musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] points out, is essentially Germanic in effect. Tchaikovsky's expert use of having two or more instruments play a melody simultaneously (a practice called [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]]) and his ear for uncanny combinations of instruments resulted in \"a generalized orchestral sonority in which the individual timbres of the instruments, being thoroughly mixed, would vanish\".<ref>Taruskin, ''Stravinsky'', 206</ref>\n\n====Pastiche (Pass\u00e9-ism)====\nIn works like the \"Serenade for Strings\" and the ''Variations on a Rococo Theme'', Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at writing in a style of 18th-century European [[pastiche]]. In the ballet ''The Sleeping Beauty'' and the opera ''The Queen of Spades'', Tchaikovsky graduated from imitation to full-scale evocation. This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls \"pass\u00e9-ism\", lends an air of timelessness and immediacy, making the past seem as though it were the present.<ref>Volkov, 124.</ref> On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them. His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn. (In this sense, Tchaikovsky operated in the opposite manner to [[Igor Stravinsky]], who turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] partly as a form of compositional self-discovery.) Tchaikovsky's attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:613, 615.</ref>\n\n===Antecedents and influences===\n[[File:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Robert Schumann]], lithograph by [[Josef Kriehuber]], in 1839]]\n\nOf Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann stands out as an influence in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist [[Roland John Wiley]].<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:613, 18:620; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 58.</ref> [[Boris Asafyev]] comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky not just as a formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression.<ref>Asafyev, 13\u201314.</ref> [[Leon Botstein]] claims the music of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]] also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style.<ref>Bostein, 103.</ref><ref group=a>As proof of Wagner's influence, Botstein cites a letter from Tchaikovsky to Taneyev, in which the composer \"readily admits the influence of the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Nibelungen]]'' on ''Francesca da Rimini''\".

What his listeners experienced on an emotional or visceral level became an end in itself.<ref>Maes, 138.</ref> Tchaikovsky's focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of Mendelssohn or Mozart. Considering that he lived and worked in what was probably the last 19th-century feudal nation, the statement is not actually that surprising.<ref>Figes, 274; Maes, 139\u201341.</ref> And yet, even when writing so-called 'programme music, for example his Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture, he cast it in sonata form.  His use of stylized 18th-century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward the values of Russian aristocracy.<ref name=\"maes137\">Maes, 137.</ref> He was aided in this by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who commissioned ''The Sleeping Beauty'' from Tchaikovsky and the libretto for ''The Queen of Spades'' from Modest with their use of 18th century settings stipulated firmly.<ref>Maes, 146, 152.</ref><ref group=a>Vsevolozhsky originally intended the libretto for a now-unknown composer named Nikolai Klenovsky, not Tchaikovsky (Maes, 152).</ref> Tchaikovsky also used the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]] frequently, the dance being a musical code for the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]] and a symbol of Russian patriotism. Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners.<ref>Figes, 274; Maes, 78\u201379, 137.</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Dedicatees and collaborators====\n[[File:Marius Ivanovich Petipa -Feb. 14 1898.JPG|180px|thumb|upright|Marius Petipa]]\n\nTchaikovsky's relationship with collaborators was mixed. Like Nikolai Rubinstein with the First Piano Concerto, virtuoso and pedagogue [[Leopold Auer]] rejected the Violin Concerto initially but changed his mind; he played it to great public success and taught it to his students, who included [[Jascha Heifetz]] and [[Nathan Milstein]].<ref>Steinberg</ref> [[Wilhelm Fitzenhagen]] \"intervened considerably in shaping what he considered 'his' piece\", the ''Variations on a Rococo Theme'', according to music critic [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]]. Tchaikovsky was angered by Fitzenhagen's license but did nothing; the Rococo Variations were published with the cellist's amendments.<ref>Brown, ''Crisis'', 122.</ref><ref group=a>The composer's original has since been published but most cellists still perform Fitzenhagen's version (Campbell, 77).</ref> His collaboration on the three ballets went better and in [[Marius Petipa]], who worked with him on the last two, he might have found an advocate.<ref group=a>Tchaikovsky's work with Julius Reisinger on ''Swan Lake'' was evidently also successful, since it left him with no qualms about working with Petipa, but very little is written about it (Maes, 146).</ref> When ''The Sleeping Beauty'' was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated, Petipa convinced them to put in the extra effort. Tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for the dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at the time. He responded with scores that minimized the rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody, with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in the average ballet score.<ref>Maes, 145\u201348.</ref>\n\n====Critics====\n[[File:Hanslick.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eduard Hanslick]]\nCritical reception to Tchaikovsky's music was also varied but also improved over time. Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect for not being nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason.<ref name=\"botstein99\">Botstein, 99.</ref> There might have been a grain of truth in the latter, according to musicologist and conductor Leon Botstein, as German critics especially wrote of the \"indeterminacy of [Tchaikovsky's] artistic character ... being truly at home in the non-Russian\".<ref>As quoted in Botstein, 100.</ref> Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music, [[Eduard Hanslick]] lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition \"whose stink one can hear\"<ref>[[Eduard Hanslick|Hanslick, Eduard]], ''Music Criticisms 1850\u20131900'', ed. and trans. [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1963). As quoted in Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 487.</ref> and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, \"The furious peroration sounds like nothing so much as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker. Pandemonium, [[delirium tremens]], raving, and above all, noise worse confounded!\"<ref>''Boston Evening Transcript'', 23 October 1892. As quoted in Steinberg, ''Symphony'', 631</ref>\n\nThe division between Russian and Western critics remained through much of the 20th century but for a different reason. According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovsky's music that appealed to audiences\u2014its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration\u2014added up to compositional shallowness.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:169.</ref> The music's use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their eyes still further.<ref name=\"brown_ng18628\"/> There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovsky's music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, \"spoke to the listener's imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality\". Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the \"violence and 'hysteria' \" they detected and felt such emotive displays \"attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation\u2014the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment\u2014and the polite engagement of art as an act of amusement\".<ref name=\"Botstein, 101\"/>\n\nThere has also been the fact that the composer did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality.<ref name=\"Maes161\"/> Even with what Schonberg termed \"a professional reevaluation\" of Tchaikovsky's work,<ref name=\"schonberg367\">Schonberg, 367.</ref> the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, ''New York Times'' critic [[Allan Kozinn]] writes, \"It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music\u2014entertaining and widely beloved though it is\u2014that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded in the context of the whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow\".{{sfn|Kozinn|1992}}\n\nIn the 21st century, however, critics are reacting more positively to Tchaikovsky's tunefulness, originality, and craftsmanship.<ref name=\"schonberg367\"/> \"Tchaikovsky is being viewed again as a composer of the first rank, writing music of depth, innovation and influence,\" according to [[Cultural history|cultural historian]] and author [[Joseph Horowitz]].<ref name=\"horowitz\"/> Important in this reevaluation is a shift in attitude away from the disdain for overt emotionalism that marked half of the 20th century.<ref name=\"wiley_ng25169\">Wiley, ''New Grove (2001), 25:169.</ref> \"We have acquired a different view of Romantic 'excess,'\" Horowitz says. \"Tchaikovsky is today more admired than deplored for his emotional frankness; if his music seems harried and insecure, so are we all\".<ref name=\"horowitz\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11030/1121245-388.stm |last=Druckenbrod|first=Andrew|title=Festival to explore Tchaikovsky's changing reputation|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Public====\n{{see also|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in popular media}}\n\nHorowitz maintains that, while the standing of Tchaikovsky's music has fluctuated among critics, for the public, \"it never went out of style, and his most popular works have yielded iconic [[Sound bite|sound-bytes]] {{sic}}, such as the love theme from ''Romeo and Juliet''\".<ref name=\"horowitz\"/> Along with those tunes, Botstein adds, \"Tchaikovsky appealed to audiences outside of Russia with an immediacy and directness that were startling even for music, an art form often associated with emotion\".<ref>Botstein, 100.</ref> Tchaikovsky's melodies, stated with eloquence and matched by his inventive use of harmony and orchestration, have always ensured audience appeal.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:606\u201307, 628.</ref> His popularity is considered secure, with his following in many countries, including Great Britain and the United States, second only to that of Beethoven.<ref name=\"wi25169\"/> His music has also been used frequently in popular music and film.<ref>Steinberg, ''The Symphony'', 611.</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:\u0421\u0438\u043c\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c. \u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041f. \u0418. \u0427\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443..JPG|thumb|Statue of Tchaikovsky in [[Simferopol]], Crimea]]\nAccording to Wiley, Tchaikovsky was a pioneer in several ways. \"Thanks in large part to Nadezhda von Meck\", Wiley writes, \"he became the first full-time professional Russian composer\". This, Wiley adds, allowed him the time and freedom to consolidate the Western compositional practices he had learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk song and other native musical elements to fulfill his own expressive goals and forge an original, deeply personal style. He made an impact in not only absolute works such as the symphony but also program music and, as Wiley phrases it, \"transformed Liszt's and Berlioz's achievements ... into matters of Shakespearean elevation and psychological import\".<ref>Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:144.</ref> Wiley and Holden both note that Tchaikovsky did all this without a native school of composition upon which to fall back. They point out that only Glinka had preceded him in combining Russian and Western practices and his teachers in Saint Petersburg had been thoroughly Germanic in their musical outlook. He was, they write, for all intents and purposes alone in his artistic quest.<ref>Holden, xxi; Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:144.</ref>\n\n[[File:Russia stamp Swan Lake 1993 25r.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Stamp of Russia, ''Swan Lake'', 1993]]\nMaes and Taruskin write that Tchaikovsky believed that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his contemporaries in The Five.<ref>Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:663.</ref> Maes adds that, like them, he wanted to produce music that reflected Russian national character but which did so to the highest European standards of quality.<ref>Maes, 73.</ref> Tchaikovsky, according to Maes, came along at a time when the nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was. Like his country, Maes writes, it took him time to discover how to express his Russianness in a way that was true to himself and what he had learned. Because of his professionalism, Maes says, he worked hard at this goal and succeeded. The composer's friend, music critic [[Hermann Laroche]], wrote of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' that the score contained \"an element deeper and more general than color, in the internal structure of the music, above all in the foundation of the element of melody. This basic element is undoubtedly Russian\".<ref>As quoted in Maes, 166.</ref>\n\nTchaikovsky was inspired to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin.<ref>Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 664.</ref> His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged to not just Russia but also the world at large.<ref name=\"taruskin_go4663\"/> Volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about Russia's place in European musical culture\u2014the first Russian composer to do so.<ref name=\"volkovsp126\"/> It steeled him to become the first Russian composer to acquaint foreign audiences personally with his own works, Warrack writes, as well as those of other Russian composers.<ref>Warrack, 209.</ref> In his biography of Tchaikovsky, [[Anthony Holden]] recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: \"Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into [[20th-century music]]. Between these two very different worlds, Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge\".<ref>Holden, xxi.</ref>\n\nOn 7 May 2010, Google celebrated his 170th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/pyotr-ilyich-tchaikovskys-170th-birthday|title=Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 170th Birthday|date=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Aeroflot]]'s first [[Airbus A350]] is named after Tchaikovsky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpleflying.com/aeroflot-first-airbus-a350-delivery/|title=Aeroflot Takes Delivery Of Its First Airbus A350 In Toulouse|date=28 February 2020|website=Simple Flying}}</ref>\n\n==Tchaikovsky's voice==\nThe following recording was made in Moscow in January 1890, by Julius Block on behalf of [[Thomas Edison]].<ref>[http://en.tchaikovsky-research.net/pages/Endorsement_of_Thomas_Edison%27s_%22Phonograph%22 \"Endorsement of Thomas Edison's 'Phonograph'&thinsp;\"], tchaikovsky-research.net</ref>\n{|\n|<poem>[[Anton Rubinstein]]: What a wonderful thing.\nJ.

Equipment and horses were moved from Snig's End to prepare the site that summer. 5,000 Midlands Chartists met at Dodford in July, where O'Connor assured them that the settlement would be completed, despite interference from a Parliamentary select committee and a \u201clying and slandering press\u201d.<ref>Fourth Report of the S.C.: H.C.503, 1847-8, XlX, p.75; Northern Star, 22 July 1848; quoted by  P Searby</ref>\n\nThe Select Committee ruled that allocating plots by ballot was a violation of the Lottery Acts, so allocation of plots at Dodford was made to those who paid the largest advance deposits:\n<blockquote>members would in effect have to outbid each other to gain plots. O'Connor proposed this system reluctantly and really wanted one that would be legal and at the same time would not rule out the acquisition of plots by the \"blistered hands, [[fustian jackets]], and un-shorn chins.\"<ref name=\"Searby\"/></blockquote>\n\n\u2018Location Day\u2019, when settlers were welcomed to their new plots, was 2 July 1849. Unlike other \u2018Location Days\u2019 it was not celebrated in the Chartist [[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]], which instead began to print the complaints of settlers. The settlement's 44 plots were ill-prepared, with open wells and no water pumps. Crops of wheat had not been planted:\n\n<blockquote>The first year at Dodford was very hard for the settlers: one of them, John Wallace, said that they had had only dry bread to eat. For some years afterwards they did badly too, growing cereals and potatoes. Many supported themselves at their old trades, at home or in Bromsgrove, and hired labourers to work their plots.<ref>Searby, p42</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe company \u2013 now known as the national Land Company \u2013 was dissolved, in part because no rents were paid from Dodford residents. The tenants were given the chance to buy out the ground and avoid rent, or to continue paying it to a new owner.\n\nChartists from the West Midlands lent practical help with tools and regular visits in the early, difficult years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gbpeopleslibrary.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20&Itemid=26&limitstart=1 |title=Socialism in Birmingham and the Black Country 1850\u20131939 Chapter 1 Working-class Politics 1850\u201369 \u2013 Chartism and Secularism, George Barnsby |access-date=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317110134/http://www.gbpeopleslibrary.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20&Itemid=26&limitstart=1 |archive-date=17 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A special 'Dodford digging fork' was made in Stourbridge to deal with heavy red soil.\n\nHowever, unlike other Chartists settlements, which continued to do badly, largely because the plots were too small,<ref>Searby, page 39</ref> Dodford could access the growing [[Birmingham]] and [[Black Country]] markets.\n<blockquote>John Wallace realized that with careful treatment the heavy soil was suitable for the cultivation of strawberries and other market-garden crops: early in the 1860s their growing was begun at his suggestion. From then until about 1920 strawberries were the staple crop at Dodford; '[[Joseph Paxton]]' was the favourite variety.<ref name=\"Searby\"/></blockquote>\nThe small holders sold [[market garden]] products, particularly strawberries, but also flowers, peas, beans and shallots. Orchards of pears and plums were planted.<ref name=\"nationaltrustarch\" /> An annual \u2018Strawberry Wake\u2019 was held on the second Sunday of July, where visitors could eat as many as they liked for 6d, until 1922. Garlic was also sold to [[Lea and Perrins]] in Worcester. The plot holders also continued with other trades to supplement their incomes, such as nailmaking, making gunlocks and running a grocers' shop. One of the plot holders, John Ward, a butcher from Bolton, ran a pub, now the Dodford Inn.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedodfordinn.org/about/about.htm |title=Dodford Inn history |access-date=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204195747/http://www.thedodfordinn.org/about/about.htm |archive-date=4 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBecause Dodford enjoyed success, it became used in 1880s campaigns by [[Jesse Collings]] and others, calling for land reform:\n\n<blockquote>these small cultivators are only acquainted with poor rates from the fact that they have to pay them. What I want to see, and what the working classes, if they are wise, will insist on securing, is that there should be three or four thousand Great Dodfords in England.<ref>Unknown, quoted in Searby, p44</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Dodford settlements remained prosperous, and retained their radical character, until the 1890s. Ironically, the advocates of land reform successfully established allotments at [[Catshill]] which grew strawberries earlier, on lighter soils, pushing prices down. Dodford experienced a brief moment of prosperity during the First World War as strawberries were sold to [[Cadbury's]] for jam, but the tradition died post war, for a number of reasons. Plots were bought as rural retreats. Strawberries suffered lower quality due to disease and the use of artificial fertilizers. Better wages could be found in the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] factory at [[Longbridge]], and the cheap labour force of pickers disappeared as the Bromsgrove [[nailmaking]] industry rapidly declined.<ref name=\"Searby\"/>\n\n==Modern Dodford==\n[[File:'Rosedene' Chartists Cottage, Dodford - geograph.org.uk - 1777279.jpg|thumb|Rosedene Dodford]]\nDodford is now a  [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]], with a number of [[listed building]]s, including a number of Chartist cottages<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bromsgrove.gov.uk/cms/PDF/Dodford.pdf |title=Bromsgrove District Council |access-date=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724163715/http://www.bromsgrove.gov.uk/cms/PDF/Dodford.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the Church of the Holy Trinity and St Mary.<ref name=\"stmarylisiting\">[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-156361-church-of-the-holy-trinity-and-st-mary-d BoE, p132, cited by British Listed Buildings]</ref> [[Rosedene, Chartist cottage|Rosedene]], an example of a Chartist cottage at Dodford, is owned and maintained by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and is open to visitors by appointment.<ref>[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rosedene Rosedene Cottage, National Trust]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the National Land Company]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* From Hamlet to Parish: the Story of Dodford, WL Bond 1972\n* The Last Chartist Land Settlement: Great Dodford, 1849 D Poole 1999\n* {{cite journal |last1=Searby |first1=P |title=Great Dodford and the later history of the Chartist Land Scheme|volume=16|issue=1 |journal=Agricultural History Review |date=1968 |pages=32\u201345|publisher=British Agricultural History Society |url=http://www.bahs.org.uk/16n1a3.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904221246/http://www.bahs.org.uk/16n1a3.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-09-04 |ref=harv}}\n* [http://www.bsoc.co.uk/pdf/Sept2000.pdf The Church of Holy Trinity and St. Mary Dodford, by Mark Thomas, Bromsgrove Society Newsletter September 2000]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728174926/http://www.bsoc.co.uk/pdf/June2003.pdf Where Did That Money Go?

Equipment and horses were moved from Snig\u2019s End to prepare the site that summer. 5,000 Midlands Chartists met at Dodford in July, where O'Connor assured them that the settlement would be completed, despite interference from a Parliamentary select committee and a \u201clying and slandering press\u201d.<ref>Fourth Report of the S.C.: H.C.503,1847-8,XlX, p.75; Northern Star, 22 July 1848; quoted by  P Searby</ref>\n\nThe Select Committee ruled that allocating plots by ballot was a violation of the Lottery Acts, so allocation of plots at Dodford was made to those who paid the largest advance deposits:\n<blockquote>members would in effect have to outbid each other to gain plots. O'Connor proposed this system reluctantly and really wanted one that would be legal and at the same time would not rule out the acquisition of plots by the \"blistered hands, [[fustian jackets]], and un-shorn chins.\"<ref name=\"Searby\"/></blockquote>\n\n\u2018Location Day\u2019, when settlers were welcomed to their new plots, was 2 July 1849. Unlike other \u2018Location Days\u2019 it was not celebrated in the Chartist [[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]], which instead began to print the complaints of settlers. The settlement\u2019s 44 plots were ill-prepared, with open wells and no water pumps. Crops of wheat had not been planted:\n\n<blockquote>The first year at Dodford was very hard for the settlers: one of them, John Wallace, said that they had had only dry bread to eat. For some years afterwards they did badly too, growing cereals and potatoes. Many supported themselves at their old trades, at home or in Bromsgrove, and hired labourers to work their plots.<ref>Searby, p42</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe company \u2013 now known as the national Land Company \u2013 was dissolved, in part because no rents were paid from Dodford residents. The tenants were given the chance to buy out the ground and avoid rent, or to continue paying it to a new owner.\n\nChartists from the West Midlands lent practical help with tools and regular visits in the early, difficult years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gbpeopleslibrary.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20&Itemid=26&limitstart=1 |title=Socialism in Birmingham and the Black Country 1850\u20131939 Chapter 1 Working-class Politics 1850\u201369 \u2013 Chartism and Secularism, George Barnsby |access-date=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317110134/http://www.gbpeopleslibrary.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20&Itemid=26&limitstart=1 |archive-date=17 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A special 'Dodford digging fork' was made in Stourbridge to deal with heavy red soil.\n\nHowever, unlike other Chartists settlements, which continued to do badly, largely because the plots were too small,<ref>Searby, page 39</ref> Dodford could access the growing [[Birmingham]] and [[Black Country]] markets.\n<blockquote>John Wallace realized that with careful treatment the heavy soil was suitable for the cultivation of strawberries and other market-garden crops: early in the 1860s their growing was begun at his suggestion. From then until about 1920 strawberries were the staple crop at Dodford; '[[Joseph Paxton]]' was the favourite variety.<ref name=\"Searby\"/></blockquote>\nThe small holders sold [[market garden]] products, particularly strawberries, but also flowers, peas, beans and shallots.

Garlic was also sold to [[Lea and Perrins]] in Worcester. The plot holders also continued with other trades to supplement their incomes, such as nailmaking, making gunlocks and running a grocers' shop. One of the plot holders, John Ward, a butcher from Bolton, ran a pub, now the Dodford Inn.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedodfordinn.org/about/about.htm |title=Dodford Inn history |access-date=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204195747/http://www.thedodfordinn.org/about/about.htm |archive-date=4 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBecause Dodford enjoyed success, it became used in 1880s campaigns by [[Jesse Collings]] and others, calling for land reform:\n\n<blockquote>these small cultivators are only acquainted with poor rates from the fact that they have to pay them. What I want to see, and what the working classes, if they are wise, will insist on securing, is that there should be three or four thousand Great Dodfords in England.<ref>Unknown, quoted in Searby, p44</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Dodford settlements remained prosperous, and retained their radical character, until the 1890s. Ironically, the advocates of land reform successfully established allotments at [[Catshill]] which grew strawberries earlier, on lighter soils, pushing prices down. Dodford experienced a brief moment of prosperity during the First World War as strawberries were sold to [[Cadbury's]] for jam, but the tradition died post war, for a number of reasons. Plots were bought as rural retreats. Strawberries suffered lower quality due to disease and the use of artificial fertilizers. Better wages could be found in the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] factory at [[Longbridge]], and the cheap labour force of pickers disappeared as the Bromsgrove [[nailmaking]] industry rapidly declined.<ref name=\"Searby\"/>\n\n==Modern Dodford==\n[[File:'Rosedene' Chartists Cottage, Dodford - geograph.org.uk - 1777279.jpg|thumb|Rosedene Dodford]]\nDodford is now a  [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]], with a number of [[listed building]]s, including a number of Chartist cottages<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bromsgrove.gov.uk/cms/PDF/Dodford.pdf |title=Bromsgrove District Council |access-date=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724163715/http://www.bromsgrove.gov.uk/cms/PDF/Dodford.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the Church of the Holy Trinity and St Mary.<ref name=\"stmarylisiting\">[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-156361-church-of-the-holy-trinity-and-st-mary-d BoE, p132, cited by British Listed Buildings]</ref> [[Rosedene, Chartist cottage|Rosedene]], an example of a Chartist cottage at Dodford, is owned and maintained by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and is open to visitors by appointment.<ref>[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rosedene Rosedene Cottage, National Trust]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the National Land Company]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* From Hamlet to Parish: the Story of Dodford, WL Bond 1972\n* The Last Chartist Land Settlement: Great Dodford, 1849 D Poole 1999\n* {{cite journal |last1=Searby |first1=P |title=Great Dodford and the later history of the Chartist Land Scheme|volume=16|issue=1 |journal=Agricultural History Review |date=1968 |pages=32\u201345|publisher=British Agricultural History Society |url=http://www.bahs.org.uk/16n1a3.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904221246/http://www.bahs.org.uk/16n1a3.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-09-04 |ref=harv}}\n* [http://www.bsoc.co.uk/pdf/Sept2000.pdf The Church of Holy Trinity and St. Mary Dodford, by Mark Thomas, Bromsgrove Society Newsletter September 2000]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728174926/http://www.bsoc.co.uk/pdf/June2003.pdf Where Did That Money Go?

{"title_page": "Blender", "text_new": "{{short description|Home appliance used to mix or crush food}}\n{{About|the kitchen and laboratory appliance; for the 3D graphics software see [[Blender (software)]]|}}\n[[File:ElectricBlender.jpg|thumb|An electric blender]]\n\nA '''blender''' (sometimes called a '''liquidiser''' in British English) is a [[kitchen appliance|kitchen]] and [[laboratory]] appliance used to mix, [[pur\u00e9e]], or [[emulsion|emulsify]] food and other substances. A stationary blender consists of a blender container with a rotating metal blade at the bottom, powered by an electric motor that is in the base. Some powerful models can also crush ice and other frozen foods. The newer [[immersion blender]] configuration has a motor on top connected by a shaft to a rotating blade at the bottom, which can be used with any container.\n\n==Characteristics==\nDifferent blenders have different functions and features but [[product testing]] indicates that many blenders, even the less expensive ones, are useful for meeting many consumer needs.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\">{{cite web |url= http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/blenders/buying-guide.htm |title=Top Blender Ratings - Blender Buying Guide |author=Consumer Reports |work=consumerreports.org |date=November 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> Features which consumers consider when purchasing a blender include the following:\n*large visible measurement marks<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*ease of use<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*low noise during usage<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*power usage (typically 300\u20131000 watts)<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*ease of cleaning<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*option for quick \"pulse\" blending<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\n===Countertop blenders===\n[[Countertop]] blenders use a 1\u20132 liters (4\u20138 cups) blending container made of [[glass]], [[plastic]], [[stainless steel]].<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Glass blenders are heavier and more stable.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Plastic is prone to scratching and absorbing the smell of blended food.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Stainless steel is preferred for its looks, but limits visibility of the food as it is blended.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nCountertop blenders typically offer 3\u201316 speed settings, but having more choices in speed settings is not an indication of increased utility for all users.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nIn cases where the blades are removable, the container should have an [[O-ring]] or [[gasket]] between the body of the container and the base to seal the container and prevent the contents from leaking. The blending container is generally shaped in a way that encourages material to circulate through the blades, rather than simply spinning around.\n\nThe container rests upon a base that contains a motor for turning the blade assembly and has controls on its surface. Most modern blenders offer a number of possible speeds. Low-powered blenders require the addition of some liquid to operate correctly. In these blenders, the liquid helps move the solids around the jar, bringing them in contact with the blades. The blades create a whirlpool effect which moves solids from top to bottom, ensuring even contact with the blade. This creates a homogeneous mixture. High-powered blenders are capable of milling grains and crushing ice without such assistance.\n\n===Immersion blenders===\n{{main article | Immersion blender}}\n[[File:Wand Blender.jpg|thumb|upright=.4|right|an immersion blender]]\nThe hand-held immersion blender or '''stick blender''' has no container of its own, but instead has a mixing head with rotating blades that can be immersed in a container.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Immersion blenders are convenient for homogenizing volumes that are too large to fit in the bowl of a stationary blender or as in the case of soups, are too hot to be safely poured into the bowl.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nThe operation of an immersion blender requires that the user hold down a switch for as long as the blades operate, which can be tiresome for the user.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nHandheld blenders are ideal for small and specific tasks but do not have as many uses as a countertop blender.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\n== Applications ==\nCountertop blenders are designed to mix, pur\u00e9e, and chop food.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Their strength is such that the ability to crush ice is an expected feature.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nBlenders are used both in home and commercial kitchens for various purposes, including to:\n* Grind semi-solid ingredients, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, into smooth [[pur\u00e9e]]s\n* Blend ice cream, milk, and sweet sauces to make [[milkshakes]]\n* Mix and crush ice in [[cocktail]]s such as the [[Zombie cocktail|Zombie]], [[pi\u00f1a colada]] and [[margarita|frozen margarita]]\n* Crush ice and other ingredients in non-alcoholic drinks such as [[frappuccino]]s and [[smoothie]]s\n* [[emulsion|Emulsify]] mixtures\n* Reduce small solids such as spices and seeds to smaller solids or completely powder or [[nut butter]]\n* Blend mixtures of powders, granules, and/or liquids thoroughly\n* Help dissolve solids into liquids\n\nBlenders also have a variety of applications in [[microbiology]] and [[food science]]. In addition to standard food-type blenders, there is a variety of other configurations of blender for laboratories.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== North America ===\nThe Polish-American chemist Stephen Poplawski, owner of the Stevens Electric Company, began designing drink mixers in 1919 under a contract with Arnold Electric Company, and patented the drink mixer in 1922<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1480914A/en|title=Beverage mixer|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref> which had been designed to make [[Horlicks]] malted [[milkshake]]s at [[soda fountain]]s.

Hamilton, Chester Beach and [[Fred Osius]], produced Loffredo's invention under the brand name [[Hamilton Beach Company]]. Fred Osius improved the appliance, making another kind of blender. He approached [[Fred Waring]], a popular musician, who financed and promoted the \"Miracle Mixer\", released in 1933. However the appliance had some problems to be solved about the seal of the jar and the knife axis, so Fred Waring redesigned the appliance and released his own blender in 1937, the ''Waring Blendor'' with which Waring popularized the [[smoothie]] in the 1940s.

After the World War II other companies released more blender in Europe; the first one was the popular Starmix Standmixer (1948), from the Germany company Electrostar, which had numerous accessories, like a coffee grinder, cake mixer, ice cream maker, food processor, thermic jar, milk centrifugue, juicer and meat grinder; and the Braun Multimix (1950) from Max Braun, which had an attachment with glass bowl to make batter bread and a juicer centrifuge like the one developed by Turmix.\n\n=== South America ===\nIn Brazil, Waldemar Clemente, ex-staffer of [[General Electric]] and owner of Walita electric appliance company since 1939, designed a blender based on the Turmix Standmixer and released in 1944 the ''Walita Neutron'' blender. Clemente also created the name ''liquidificador'', which ever since designated a blender in Brazil. Soon thereafter, Walita acquired the Turmix patents in Brazil and also released the Turmix juicer, calling it the ''Centr\u00edfuga Walita'' as well the others Turmix accessories for use with the blender motor, as fruit peelers, grinder, crusher and batter mixer. Using the same marketing strategy as Turmix in Europe, Walita passed the million-blenders-sold mark a few years later in the early 1950s. Walita were the first manufacturer to release a wide range of blenders in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Walita made blenders for [[Siemens]], Turmix, [[Philips]], and [[Sears]] ([[Kenmore (brand)|Kenmore]]), among others. In the 1960s Royal Philips Co. approached Walita, acquiring the company in 1971, becoming Royal Philips' kitchen appliances developer division specializing in blenders, which are sold under the Philips brand outside Brazil.\n\nThe Austrian immigrant Hanz Arno, owner of an electric motor manufacturer in Brazil since the 1940s, released a blender in 1947, based on the blenders made by Hamilton Beach and Oster. The ''Liquidificador Arno''  was exported to other South American countries. As Arno had stocks of [[Electrolux]], that brand was used on the blender in some countries. Later in 1997 Arno was bought by the [[Groupe SEB]], owner of [[Moulinex]], [[T-Fal]], [[Rowenta]], and other home appliance brands.\n\n=== Increased versatility ===\nWith the rising popularity of [[smoothie]]s, [[Frappucino]]s and other frozen drinks prepared in front of the customer, new models of commercial blenders often include a sound-reducing enclosures and computerized controls.\n\nSpecialized blenders for making smoothies are becoming popular, chiefly resembling an ordinary model with a [[spigot]] added for quick serving.  Some models also feature a gimballed stirring rod mounted on the lid, constructed so that mixtures can be stirred whilst the machine is running with no chance of the stirrer fouling the blades.\n\nIn 1996 Tom Dickson, founder and CEO of [[Blendtec]], introduced the WildSide blending jar&nbsp;\u2014 a unique design that eliminated the need for stir sticks and plungers to make thicker blends. The technology was so effective that Vita-Mix decided to use the design in the company's commercial blending containers. In 2010 the United States court system concluded that Vita-Mix had willfully infringed the patents, ultimately awarding Blendtec $24 million in damages.<ref>{{cite book|title=US Court of Appeals|year=2012|url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/11-1244-1484-1512.pdf|access-date=2013-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224000922/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/11-1244-1484-1512.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Mechanical operation ==\nA blender consists of a housing, motor, blades, and food container.  A fan-cooled [[electric motor]] is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the blade assembly.  Usually, a small [[gasket|rubber washer]] provides a seal around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds.  As a typical blender has no [[gearbox]], the multiple speeds are often implemented using a [[universal motor]] with multiple [[stator]] windings and/or multi-tapped stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof.  Each different combination of energized windings produces a different [[torque]] from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the blade assembly in contact with the material inside the food container.  A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the ''continuously variable'' higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a mechanical speed governor that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. With this arrangement, when not set to the Stir speed, motor speed is constant even with varying load up to the point where power demanded by the load is equal to the motor's power capability at a particular speed.  The more modern version of this arrangement is electronic speed control found on some units.\n\n==In culture==\nIn 1949 the company [[Vitamix]] advertised their blender in one of the first television [[infomercials]].<ref name=\"Price 2013\">{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/10/vitamix_a_history_of_the_company_and_analysis_of_the_blender_s_appeal.html |title=Vitamix: A history of the company and analysis of the blender's appeal. |first=Catherine |last=Price |work=slate.com |date=20 October 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> The sales pitch lasted for 25 minutes, suggesting that the blender be used to make bread crumbs, potato pancakes, laxative spinach drinks, and a dessert beverage featuring entire raw eggs and their shells, which the host announced would be enjoyed like [[malted milk]].<ref name=\"Price 2013\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Blade grinder]]\n* [[Food processor]]\n* [[Homogenization (chemistry)]]\n* [[Homogenizer]]\n* [[List of food preparation utensils]]\n* [[Mixer (cooking)]]\n* [[Will It Blend?]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Wiktionary|blender|liquidiser|liquidizer}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Home appliances}}\n{{Bartend}}\n\n[[Category:Food preparation appliances]]\n[[Category:Bartending equipment]]\n[[Category:Laboratory equipment]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1922]]\n[[Category:20th-century inventions]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n\n[https://kitchenaid.co.nz/collections/blenders Buy blender from kitchen Aid] visit: https://kitchenaid.co.nz/collections/blenders\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Home appliance used to mix or crush food}}\n{{About|the kitchen and laboratory appliance; for the 3D graphics software see [[Blender (software)]]|}}\n[[File:ElectricBlender.jpg|thumb|An electric blender]]\n\nA '''blender''' (sometimes called a '''liquidiser''' in British English) is a [[kitchen appliance|kitchen]] and [[laboratory]] appliance used to mix, [[pur\u00e9e]], or [[emulsion|emulsify]] food and other substances. A stationary blender consists of a blender container with a rotating metal blade at the bottom, powered by an electric motor that is in the base. Some powerful models can also crush ice and other frozen foods. The newer [[immersion blender]] configuration has a motor on top connected by a shaft to a rotating blade at the bottom, which can be used with any container.\n\n==Characteristics==\nDifferent blenders have different functions and features but [[product testing]] indicates that many blenders, even the less expensive ones, are useful for meeting many consumer needs.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\">{{cite web |url= http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/blenders/buying-guide.htm |title=Top Blender Ratings - Blender Buying Guide |author=Consumer Reports |work=consumerreports.org |date=November 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> Features which consumers consider when purchasing a blender include the following:\n*large visible measurement marks<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*ease of use<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*low noise during usage<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*power usage (typically 300\u20131000 watts)<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*ease of cleaning<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n*option for quick \"pulse\" blending<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\n===Countertop blenders===\n[[Countertop]] blenders use a 1\u20132 liters (4\u20138 cups) blending container made of [[glass]], [[plastic]], [[stainless steel]].<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Glass blenders are heavier and more stable.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Plastic is prone to scratching and absorbing the smell of blended food.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Stainless steel is preferred for its looks, but limits visibility of the food as it is blended.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nCountertop blenders typically offer 3\u201316 speed settings, but having more choices in speed settings is not an indication of increased utility for all users.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nIn cases where the blades are removable, the container should have an [[O-ring]] or [[gasket]] between the body of the container and the base to seal the container and prevent the contents from leaking. The blending container is generally shaped in a way that encourages material to circulate through the blades, rather than simply spinning around.\n\nThe container rests upon a base that contains a motor for turning the blade assembly and has controls on its surface. Most modern blenders offer a number of possible speeds. Low-powered blenders require the addition of some liquid to operate correctly. In these blenders, the liquid helps move the solids around the jar, bringing them in contact with the blades. The blades create a whirlpool effect which moves solids from top to bottom, ensuring even contact with the blade. This creates a homogeneous mixture. High-powered blenders are capable of milling grains and crushing ice without such assistance.\n\n===Immersion blenders===\n{{main article | Immersion blender}}\n[[File:Wand Blender.jpg|thumb|upright=.4|right|an immersion blender]]\nThe hand-held immersion blender or '''stick blender''' has no container of its own, but instead has a mixing head with rotating blades that can be immersed in a container.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Immersion blenders are convenient for homogenizing volumes that are too large to fit in the bowl of a stationary blender or as in the case of soups, are too hot to be safely poured into the bowl.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nThe operation of an immersion blender requires that the user hold down a switch for as long as the blades operate, which can be tiresome for the user.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nHandheld blenders are ideal for small and specific tasks but do not have as many uses as a countertop blender.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\n== Applications ==\nCountertop blenders are designed to mix, pur\u00e9e, and chop food.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/> Their strength is such that the ability to crush ice is an expected feature.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2013\"/>\n\nBlenders are used both in home and commercial kitchens for various purposes, including to:\n* Grind semi-solid ingredients, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, into smooth [[pur\u00e9e]]s\n* Blend ice cream, milk, and sweet sauces to make [[milkshakes]]\n* Mix and crush ice in [[cocktail]]s such as the [[Zombie cocktail|Zombie]], [[pi\u00f1a colada]] and [[margarita|frozen margarita]]\n* Crush ice and other ingredients in non-alcoholic drinks such as [[frappuccino]]s and [[smoothie]]s\n* [[emulsion|Emulsify]] mixtures\n* Reduce small solids such as spices and seeds to smaller solids or completely powder or [[nut butter]]\n* Blend mixtures of powders, granules, and/or liquids thoroughly\n* Help dissolve solids into liquids\n\nBlenders also have a variety of applications in [[microbiology]] and [[food science]]. In addition to standard food-type blenders, there is a variety of other configurations of blender for laboratories.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== North America ===\nThe Polish-American chemist Stephen Poplawski, owner of the Stevens Electric Company, began designing drink mixers in 1919 under a contract with Arnold Electric Company, and patented the drink mixer in 1922<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1480914A/en|title=Beverage mixer|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref> which had been designed to make [[Horlicks]] malted [[milkshake]]s at [[soda fountain]]s.

However the appliance had some problems to be solved about the seal of the jar and the knife axis, so Fred Waring redesigned the appliance and released his own blender in 1937, the ''Waring Blendor'' with which Waring popularized the [[smoothie]] in the 1940s.

During the 2015 [[San Francisco Film Festival]] on April 26, 2015, del Toro announced that he would no longer be involved in the project with Kojima, presumably due to Kojima's leaving of Konami.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Guillermo del Toro Touches On His Collaboration With Kojima|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/26/guillermo-del-toro-touches-on-his-collaboration-with-kojima|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref> Konami later released a statement confirming the departure of Reedus but clarified the series would continue to be developed, with no mention of the current status of ''Silent Hills''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami Responds to Silent Hills Cancellation Claims|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-responds-to-silent-hills-cancellation-claim/1100-6426908/|last=Crossley|first=Rob|date=April 27, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref> Day later, Konami confirmed that ''Silent Hills'' was cancelled, but was open to future collaborations with Reedus and del Toro.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silent Hills Cancelled, Konami Confirms|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hills-cancelled-konami-confirms/1100-6426919/|last=Crossley|first=Rob|date=April 27, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref> ''P.T.'' was also pulled from the PlayStation Store and is no longer available for download.<ref>{{cite web|title = Konami Pulling 'PT' From PlayStation Store, 'Silent Hills' Fate Uncertain [Updated]|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/04/26/konami-pulling-pt-from-playstation-store-silent-hills-fate-uncertain/|website = Forbes|accessdate = October 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Silent Hill series characters}}\n\n==Recurring elements==\n\n===Plot traits and symbolism===\nAll the plots of the installments in the ''Silent Hill'' series, except ''Shattered Memories'' and ''The Room'', share a common [[setting (narrative)|setting]]: the foggy rural American town of Silent Hill, which is a [[fictional town|fictional location]] set in the northeastern United States: some games specifically reference the town as being located in [[Maine]] whereas in the film, the town is set in [[West Virginia]]. The town in the first three games was inspired by concepts of a small town in America as depicted by various media from various countries of origin. While some of the development planning is more reminiscent of that of a Japanese village, indirect influence comes from perhaps two factual American towns in particular: [[Cushing, Maine]];{{efn|The hometown of horror novelist Stephen King, who based many of his novels' fictional Maine towns upon it.

While the first three installments received critical acclaim, with the fourth game also receiving general praise from critics, later games were less well-received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/880/880202p1.html|title=Fear 101: A Beginner's Guide to Survival Horror|page=1|date=June 9, 2008|first=Jim|last=Sterling|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first installment in the series, ''Silent Hill'', received a positive response from critics on its release and was commercially successful. It is considered a defining title in the survival horror genre, moving away from [[B movie]] horror elements, toward a psychological style of horror emphasizing atmosphere.<ref name=\"History of Survival Horror\"/>\n\n''Silent Hill 2'' received critical acclaim. It was named the fourteenth best game of the PS2 by [[IGN]], saying \"It preserved most of the original game's what-might-be-out-there fear, but with major advances to the graphics and sound, the game was able to deliver a far more immersive, frightful and compelling storyline.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=IGN Staff |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/772/772296p2.html |title=The Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time \u2013 PS2 Feature at IGN |publisher=IGN |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> ''Silent Hill 2'' is considered [[List of video games considered the best|one of the best horror games of all time]] by many, as it features on several \"best games ever\" lists by critics.

''Silent Hill 2'' is widely considered to be the best installment in the ''Silent Hill'' game series and is considered by many to be a modern-day horror masterpiece.\n\n''Silent Hill 3'' was well-received by critics, especially in its presentation, including its environments, graphics and audio, as well as the overall horror elements and themes that are continued from past installments.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/silent-hill-3 | title = Game Revolution Playstation 2 Review Page \u2013 Silent Hill 3 | work = Game Revolution | publisher = AtomicOnline, LLC | first = Chris | last = Hudak | date = August 3, 2003 | accessdate = August 30, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"review_gamezone_pc\">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20477.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080920153359/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20477.htm | archivedate = September 20, 2008 | title = Silent Hill 3 Review \u2013 PC | work = GameZone | publisher = GameZone Online | first = Tha | last = Wiz | date = December 18, 2003 | accessdate = August 30, 2008}}</ref> The game received praise for its story, which was a continuation of the first game's story.<ref>{{cite web|last=Winegarner |first=Tyler |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/silenthill3/review.html |title=Silent Hill 3 Review for PlayStation 2 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=August 6, 2003 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Douglass C. |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/432/432151p1.html |title=Silent Hill 3 \u2013 PlayStation 2 Review at IGN |publisher=IGN |date=August 3, 2003 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn comparison to the previous three installments, ''Silent Hill 4: The Room'' was met with a mostly positive reception, though lower than that of the game's predecessors; many reviewers disliked the increased emphasis on combat, lessening the focus on the horror aspect of gameplay, while praise was aimed at the atmospheric tone and direction, the sound design, graphics and the storyline, while the changes from the series' conventions were met with a range of responses, varying from positive to negative.

While certain critics praised the soundtrack and story elements, it has been let down by \"sluggish combat\" and \"occasional freezes\".\n\n''HD Collection'' has also received mixed reviews. Critics criticised towards many technical issues plaguing both games and artistic changes made to the games.\n\n''Book of Memories'', while receiving mixed reviews, has been the least well received game in the series, with most criticism regarding the game's shift in genre.\n\n[[The Duffer Brothers]] have cited ''Silent Hill'' as an influence on their 2016 television show ''[[Stranger Things]]''.

During the 2015 [[San Francisco Film Festival]] on April 26, 2015, del Toro announced that he would no longer be involved in the project with Kojima, presumably due to Kojima's leaving of Konami.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Guillermo del Toro Touches On His Collaboration With Kojima|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/26/guillermo-del-toro-touches-on-his-collaboration-with-kojima|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref> Konami later released a statement confirming the departure of Reedus but clarified the series would continue to be developed, with no mention of the current status of ''Silent Hills''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami Responds to Silent Hills Cancellation Claims|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-responds-to-silent-hills-cancellation-claim/1100-6426908/|last=Crossley|first=Rob|date=April 27, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref> Day later, Konami confirmed that ''Silent Hills'' was cancelled, but was open to future collaborations with Reedus and del Toro.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silent Hills Cancelled, Konami Confirms|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hills-cancelled-konami-confirms/1100-6426919/|last=Crossley|first=Rob|date=April 27, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref> ''P.T.'' was also pulled from the PlayStation Store and is no longer available for download.<ref>{{cite web|title = Konami Pulling 'PT' From PlayStation Store, 'Silent Hills' Fate Uncertain [Updated]|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/04/26/konami-pulling-pt-from-playstation-store-silent-hills-fate-uncertain/|website = Forbes|accessdate = October 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Silent Hill series characters}}\n\n==Recurring elements==\n\n===Plot traits and symbolism===\nAll the plots of the installments in the ''Silent Hill'' series, except ''Shattered Memories'' and ''The Room'', share a common [[setting (narrative)|setting]]: the foggy rural American town of Silent Hill, which is a [[fictional town|fictional location]] set in the northeastern United States: some games specifically reference the town as being located in [[Maine]], whereas in the film, the town is set in [[West Virginia]]. The town in the first three games was inspired by concepts of a small town in America as depicted by various media from various countries of origin. While some of the development planning is more reminiscent of that of a Japanese village, indirect influence comes from perhaps two factual American towns in particular: [[Cushing, Maine]];{{efn|The hometown of horror novelist Stephen King, who based many of his novels' fictional Maine towns upon it.

A. Andr\u00e9e]] and [[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]] with the balloon on the [[sea ice|pack ice]], photographed by the third expedition member, [[Nils Strindberg]]. The exposed film for this photograph and others from the failed 1897 expedition was recovered in 1930.]]\n'''Andr\u00e9e's Arctic balloon expedition''' of 1897 was an effort to reach the [[North Pole]] in which all three expedition members perished. [[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e|S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Andr\u00e9e]], the first Swedish [[balloon (aircraft)|balloonist]], proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from [[Svalbard]] to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind in the race for the North Pole.\n\nAndr\u00e9e ignored many early signs of the dangers associated with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey. But there was much evidence that the drag-rope steering technique Andr\u00e9e had invented was ineffective. Yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon {{lang|sv|\u00d6rnen}} (''The Eagle'') was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested. When measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andr\u00e9e refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andr\u00e9e's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions [[Nils Strindberg]] and [[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]].<ref>\nThis assessment is discussed in several contexts in ''V\u00e5r position \u00e4r ej synnerligen god ...'' by Andr\u00e9e specialist Sven Lundstr\u00f6m, curator of the [http://www.grennamuseum.se/grennamuseum/andreexpeditionen/ Andreexpedition Polarcenter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711183309/http://www.grennamuseum.se/grennamuseum/andreexpeditionen/ |date=11 July 2007 }} in [[Gr\u00e4nna]], Sweden. p. 131.\n</ref>\n\nAfter Andr\u00e9e, Strindberg, and Fr\u00e6nkel lifted off from Svalbard in July 1897, the balloon lost hydrogen quickly and crashed on the [[sea ice|pack ice]] after only two days. The explorers were unhurt but faced a grueling trek back south across the drifting icescape. Inadequately clothed, equipped, and prepared, and shocked by the difficulty of the terrain, they did not make it to safety. As the [[Arctic]] winter closed in on them in October, the group ended up exhausted on the deserted [[Kvit\u00f8ya]] (White Island) in Svalbard and died there. For 33&nbsp;years the fate of the Andr\u00e9e expedition remained one of the unsolved riddles of the Arctic. The chance discovery in 1930 of the expedition's last camp created a media sensation in Sweden, where the dead men had been mourned and idolized.\n\nAndr\u00e9e's motives have since been re-evaluated, along with assessing the role of the polar areas as the proving-ground of masculinity and patriotism. An early example is [[Per Olof Sundman]]'s fictionalized bestseller novel of 1967, [[Flight of the Eagle (novel)|''The Flight of the Eagle'']], which portrays Andr\u00e9e as weak and cynical, at the mercy of his sponsors and the media. The verdict on Andr\u00e9e by modern writers for virtually sacrificing the lives of his two younger companions varies in harshness, depending on whether he is seen as the manipulator or the victim of Swedish nationalist fervor around the turn of the 20th century.<ref>See Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 45, Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 131, Martinsson.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Andr\u00e9e's scheme ===\n[[File:SAAndree.png|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e]]]]\nThe second half of the 19th century has often been called the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]].<ref>''Safe Return Doubtful: The Heroic Age of Polar Exploration''</ref> The inhospitable and dangerous Arctic and [[Antarctic]] regions appealed powerfully to the imagination of the age, not as lands with their own [[ecology|ecologies]] and cultures, but as challenges to be conquered by technological ingenuity and manly daring.\n\n[[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e]] shared these enthusiasms, and proposed a plan for letting the wind propel a hydrogen balloon from [[Svalbard]] across the [[Arctic Sea]] to the [[Bering Strait]], to fetch up in Alaska, Canada, or Russia, and passing near or even right over the North Pole on the way. Andr\u00e9e was an engineer at the patent office in [[Stockholm]], with a passion for ballooning.\n\nHe bought his own balloon, the ''Svea'', in 1893 and made nine journeys with it, starting from [[Gothenburg]] or Stockholm and traveling a combined distance of {{convert|1,500|km|mi}}. In the prevailing westerly winds, the ''Svea'' flights had a strong tendency to carry him uncontrollably out to the [[Baltic Sea]] and drag his basket perilously along the surface of the water or slam it into one of the many rocky islets in the [[Stockholm archipelago]].\n\n[[File:Svea.png|thumb|upright|left|Andr\u00e9e's hydrogen balloon, ''Svea'']]\nOn one occasion he was blown clear across the Baltic to Finland. His longest trip was due east from Gothenburg, across the breadth of Sweden and out over the Baltic to [[Gotland]]. Even though he saw a lighthouse and heard breakers off [[\u00d6land]], he remained convinced that he was traveling over land and seeing lakes.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 12\u201316.</ref>\n\nDuring a couple of ''Svea'' flights, Andr\u00e9e tested and tried out the drag-rope steering technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of [[lighter-than-air]] craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon to the point where the sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andr\u00e9e reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction.\n\nThis notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andr\u00e9e's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken,<ref>[http://www.ballong.org/drupal/minnesmarken/andree \"Andr\u00e9es f\u00e4rder\"].

At a lecture in 1895 for the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], Andr\u00e9e thrilled the audience of geographers and meteorologists; a polar exploration balloon, he explained, would need to fulfill four conditions:\n\n# It must have enough lifting power to carry three people and all their scientific equipment, advanced cameras for [[aerial photography]], provisions for four months, and ballast, altogether about {{convert|3000|kg}}\n# It must retain the gas well enough to stay aloft for 30&nbsp;days\n# The hydrogen gas must be manufactured, and the balloon filled, at the Arctic launch site\n# It must be at least somewhat steerable\n\nAndr\u00e9e gave a glowingly optimistic account of the ease with which these requirements could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the ''Svea'', stating that a deviation of 27&nbsp;[[degree (angle)|degree]]s from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://claesjohnsonmathscience.wordpress.com/article/the-theory-of-the-disastrous-andree-yvfu3xg7d7wt-71/ |title=The Theory of the Disastrous Andr\u00e9e Arctic Expedition |author1=Claes Johnson |author2=Johan Jannson |date=4 May 2009 |work=Claes Johnson on Mathematics and Science |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Andree.boardgame.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Merchandising in 1896]]\nAndr\u00e9e assured the audience that Arctic summer weather was uniquely suitable for ballooning. The [[midnight sun]] would enable observations round the clock, halving the voyage time required, and do away with all need for anchoring at night, which might otherwise be a dangerous business.\n\nNeither would the balloon's buoyancy be adversely affected by the cold of the night. The drag-rope steering technique was particularly well adapted for a region where the ground, consisting of ice, was \"low in friction and free of vegetation\". He said that the minimal precipitation in the area posed no threat of weighing down the balloon. If some rain or snow did fall on the balloon, Andr\u00e9e argued, \"precipitation at above-zero temperatures will melt, and precipitation at below-zero temperatures will blow off, for the balloon will be traveling more slowly than the wind.\"\n\nThe audience was convinced by these arguments, so disconnected were they from the realities of the Arctic summer storms, fogs, high humidity, and the ever-present threat of ice formation. The academy approved Andr\u00e9e's expense calculation of 130,800&nbsp;[[Swedish krona|kronor]] in all, corresponding in today's money to just under a million U.S. dollars,<ref>\nSee this [http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____33838.aspx price level chart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113204630/http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____33838.aspx |date=13 January 2012 }} from [http://www.scb.se/default____2154.aspx Statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117152917/http://www.scb.se/default____2154.aspx |date=17 November 2011 }}, Sweden.\n</ref> of which the single largest sum, 36,000&nbsp;kronor, was for the balloon. With this endorsement, there was a rush to support his project, headed by King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]], who personally contributed 30,000&nbsp;kronor, and [[Alfred Nobel]], the dynamite magnate and founder of the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 21\u201327.</ref>\n\nThere was also considerable international interest, and the European and American newspaper-reading public was curious about a project that seemed as modern and scientific as the books of the contemporary author [[Jules Verne]]. The press fanned the interest with a wide range of predictions, from certain death for the explorers<ref>See for instance the [http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/Jan161896Albany.htm ''Albany Express''], Albany, NY, 16 January 1896.</ref> to a safe and comfortable \"guidance\" of the balloon (upgraded by the reporter to an \"[[airship]]\") to the North Pole in a manner planned by Parisian experts and Swedish scientists.\n\n\"In these days, the construction and guidance of airships have been improved greatly\", wrote ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', \"and it is supposed, both by the Parisian experts and by the Swedish scientists who have been assisting M. Andree, that the question of a sustained flight, in this case, will be very satisfactorily answered by the character of the balloon, by its careful guidance and, providing it gets into a Polar current of air, by the elements themselves.\"<ref>[http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/Jan211896Providence.htm ''Providence Journal''], 21 January 1896.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lachambre.balloon.factory.png|thumb|Andr\u00e9e's balloon was made at [[Henri Lachambre]]'s workshop in Paris]]\nFaith in the experts and in science was common in the popular press, but with international attention came also for the first time informed criticism. Andr\u00e9e being Sweden's first balloonist, no one had the requisite knowledge to second-guess him about buoyancy or drag ropes; but both Germany and France had long ballooning traditions and several of their more experienced balloonists expressed skepticism about Andr\u00e9e's methods and inventions.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 28\u201329 mentions, in particular, Gross in Germany, and the Renard brothers in France.</ref>\n\nHowever, just as with the ''Svea'' mishaps, all objections failed to dampen Andr\u00e9e's optimism. Eagerly followed by national and international media, he began negotiations with the well-known [[aeronaut]] and balloon builder [[Henri Lachambre]] in Paris, the world capital of ballooning, and ordered a varnished three-layer silk balloon, {{nowr|{{convert|20.5|m}}}} in diameter, from his workshop. The balloon, originally called {{lang|fr|Le P\u00f4le Nord}}, was to be renamed {{lang|sv|\u00d6rnen}} (The Eagle).\n\nSpecial technical solutions had to be designed for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30&nbsp;days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at the floor of the basket, along with some of the stores and provisions.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 49.</ref> The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified [[primus stove]]\u2014designed by a friend of Andr\u00e9e's\u2014that could be dangled {{convert|8|m|ft|spell=in}} below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 58.</ref>\n\n=== First expedition ===\n[[File:Swedenborg, Strindberg, Fraenkel and Andr\u00e9e.PNG|thumb|upright=1.1|The new crew of 1896, from left to right: [[Vilhelm Swedenborg]], [[Nils Strindberg]], [[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]], [[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e|S. A. Andr\u00e9e]]]]\nFor his 1896 attempt to launch the balloon, Andr\u00e9e had many eager volunteers to choose from. He picked [[Nils Gustaf Ekholm]], an experienced Arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882\u20131883 geophysical expedition to [[Spitsbergen]], and [[Nils Strindberg]], a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry. The main scientific purpose of the expedition was to map the area by means of aerial photography, and Strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThis was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills, but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three men were indoor types, and only one, Strindberg, was young. Andr\u00e9e expected a sedentary voyage in a balloon basket, and strength and survival skills were far down on his list.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 32.</ref>\n\nModern writers all agree that Andr\u00e9e's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing more or less in the direction he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30&nbsp;days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down.<ref>The account of Andr\u00e9e's and Ekholms computations and hypotheses in this section relies on Kjellstr\u00f6m, ''passim''.</ref>\n\nIn the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at [[Danes Island]], until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late-19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andr\u00e9e's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.\n\n[[File:Andree.railway.station.png|thumb|The three explorers' festive send-off from Stockholm in the spring of 1896]]\nOn the other hand, Ekholm was skeptical of the balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His buoyancy checks in the summer of 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 59.</ref>\n\nThe balloon was losing {{convert|68|kg}} of lift force per day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17&nbsp;days at most, not&nbsp;30. When it was time to go home, he warned Andr\u00e9e that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought. Andr\u00e9e resisted Ekholm's criticisms to the point of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andr\u00e9e had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andr\u00e9e's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known.\n\n[[File:Knut Fr\u00e6nkel.png|thumb|upright=1.1|left|[[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]]]]\nSeveral modern writers, following Sundman's Andr\u00e9e portrait in the semi-documentary novel, ''The Flight of the Eagle'' (1967), have speculated that Andr\u00e9e had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andr\u00e9e, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg, and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island.\n\nEspecially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship ''[[Fram]]'', and Andr\u00e9e's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andr\u00e9e could not face letting the press report that he did not know the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.<ref name=\"Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 45\">Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 45.</ref><ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 69\u201373.</ref>\n\nAfter the 1896 launch was called off, enthusiasm declined for joining the expedition for the second attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andr\u00e9e picked the 27-year-old engineer, [[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]], to replace Ekholm. Fr\u00e6nkel was a [[civil engineer]] from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct the movements of the three men during their last few months with considerable precision.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 39.</ref>\n\n== Expedition of 1897 ==\n\n=== Launch, flight, and landing ===\n[[File:Andrees Station3.jpg|thumb|The station at Spitsbergen, from a [[photochrom]] print at the end of the nineteenth century]]\nReturning to Danes Island in the summer of 1897, the expedition found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andr\u00e9e had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Fr\u00e6nkel.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 73\u2013114.</ref>\n\nOn 11 July, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andr\u00e9e dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper ''Aftonbladet'', holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes around, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andr\u00e9e had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.\n\nMost of them unscrewed at once and {{convert|530|kg}} of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump {{convert|210|kg}} of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. {{convert|740|kg|lb|spell=In}} of essential weight was thus lost in the first few minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the ''Eagle'' had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, at the mercy of the wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 84.</ref><ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Lightened, the balloon rose to {{convert|700|m}}, an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.\n\n[[File:Balloon.explorers.jpg|thumb|left|The explorers minutes before takeoff on 11 July]]\nThe balloon had two means of communication with the outside world, [[buoy]]s and [[homing pigeon]]s. The buoys, steel cylinders encased in [[cork (material)|cork]], were intended to be dropped from the balloon into the water or onto the ice, to be carried to civilization by the currents. Only two buoy messages have ever been found. One was dispatched by Andr\u00e9e on 11 July, a few hours after takeoff, and reads \"Our journey goes well so far. We sail at an altitude of about {{convert|250|m|abbr=on}}, at first N&nbsp;10\u00b0 east, but later N 45\u00b0&nbsp;east&nbsp;[...] Weather delightful. Spirits high.\"<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 92.</ref> The second was dropped an hour later and gave the height as {{convert|600|m}}.\n\nThe newspaper ''Aftonbladet'' had supplied the pigeons, bred in northern Norway with the optimistic hope that they would manage to return there, and their message cylinders contained pre-printed instructions in Norwegian asking the finder to pass the messages on to the newspaper's address in Stockholm. Andr\u00e9e released at least four pigeons, but only one was ever retrieved, by a Norwegian steamer where the pigeon had alighted and been promptly shot. Its message is dated 13 July and gives the travel direction at that point as East by 10\u00b0&nbsp;South. The message reads: \"The Andree Polar Expedition to the \"Aftonbladet\", Stockholm. 13 July, 12.30&nbsp;p.m., 82&nbsp;deg. north latitude, 15&nbsp;deg. 5&nbsp;min. east longitude. Good journey eastwards, 10&nbsp;deg. south. All goes well on board. This is the third message sent by pigeon. Andree.\"<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eagle.moving.north.png|thumb|The ''Eagle'' sailing north, photographed from [[Danes Island]]]]\nLundstr\u00f6m and others note that all three messages fail to mention the accident at takeoff, or the increasingly desperate situation, which Andr\u00e9e described fully in his main diary.<ref name=\"Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 81\">Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 81.</ref> The balloon was out of equilibrium, sailing much too high and thereby losing hydrogen faster than even Nils Ekholm had feared, then repeatedly threatening to crash on the ice.<ref name=\"Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 81\"/> It was weighed down by being rain-soaked (\"dripping wet\", writes Andr\u00e9e in the diary), and the men were throwing all the sand and some of the [[payload (air and space craft)|payload]] overboard to keep it airborne.\n\nFree flight lasted for 10&nbsp;hours and 29&nbsp;minutes and was followed by another 41&nbsp;hours of bumpy riding with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash.<ref name=\"Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 45\"/> The ''Eagle'' traveled for two days and three-and-a-half hours altogether, during which time, according to Andr\u00e9e, none of the three men got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 113.</ref>\n\n=== On foot on the ice ===\n[[File:Andreeexpedition.png|thumb|400px|The path followed by the 1897 expedition: north by balloon from [[Danes Island]], then south on foot to [[Kvit\u00f8ya]]]]\nFrom the moment the three were grounded on 14 July, Strindberg's highly specialized cartographic camera, which had been brought to map the region from the air, became instead a means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant danger and drudgery of the trek.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 90.</ref> Strindberg took about 200&nbsp;photos with his {{convert|7|kg|lb|spell=in|adj=on}} camera over the course of the three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andr\u00e9e and Fr\u00e6nkel contemplating the fallen ''Eagle''.<ref>The account in this section is based on the expedition's diaries and photos in ''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'' plus some of Sven Lundstr\u00f6m's commentary in ''\"V\u00e5r position \u00e4r ej synnerligen god ...\"''.</ref>\n\nAndr\u00e9e and Fr\u00e6nkel also kept meticulous records of their experiences and geographical positions, Andr\u00e9e in his \"main diary,\"<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', pp. 391\u2013461; the last four pages of Andr\u00e9e's diary were so damaged when recovered that only fragments could be deciphered.</ref> Fr\u00e6nkel in his meteorological journal. Strindberg's own stenographic diary was more personal in content, and included his general reflections on the expedition, as well as several messages to his fianc\u00e9e Anna Charlier.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', pp. 465\u2013485.</ref> All three manuscripts were eventually retrieved from the ice on [[Kvit\u00f8ya]] in 1930.\n\nThe ''Eagle'' had been stocked with safety equipment such as guns, snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat (in the form of a bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not in the basket but in the storage space arranged above the balloon ring. These items had not been put together with great care, or with any acknowledgment of adopting indigenous peoples' techniques for dealing with the extreme environment. In this, Andr\u00e9e contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers.\n\nSven Lundstr\u00f6m points to the agonizing extra efforts that became necessary for the team due to Andr\u00e9e's mistaken design of the sleds, with a rigid construction that borrowed nothing from the long proven [[Inuit]] sleds, and were so impractical for the difficult terrain. Andr\u00e9e called it \"dreadful terrain\", with channels separating the ice floes, high ridges, and partially iced-over [[melt pond]]s.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 93\u201396.</ref> The men's clothes included no furs but were woolen coats and trousers, plus [[oilskin]]s. They wore the oilskins but the explorers reported always seeming to be damp or wet from the half-frozen pools of water on the ice and the typically foggy, humid Arctic summer air, and preoccupied with drying their clothes, mainly by wearing them. It would have meant certain death to lose the provisions lashed to one of the inconvenient sleds into one of the many channels that had to be laboriously crossed.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 98.</ref>\n\n[[File:Polar.bear.jpg|thumb|left|Fr\u00e6nkel (left) and Strindberg with the first polar bear shot by the explorers]]\nBefore starting the march across the \"dreadful terrain,\" the three men spent a week in a tent at the crash site, packing up and making decisions about what and how much to bring and where to go. The far-off North Pole was not mentioned as an option; the choice lay between two depots of food and ammunition laid down for their safety, one at [[Cape Flora]] in [[Franz Josef Land]] and one at [[Sju\u00f8yane|Sju\u00f8yane (Seven Islands)]] in [[Svalbard]]. Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12&nbsp;frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.<ref>That the series of frames is designed as a panorama was only noticed in the 2004 study by Tyrone Martinsson, who has created an animated web version of it, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20120406121802/http://www.biad.bcu.ac.uk/research/rti/riadm/issue6/issue%206.pdf Martinsson 2004].

Andr\u00e9e had reasoned that they might as well throw excess food overboard as sand if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did, after all, become necessary. There was, therefore, less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, {{convert|767|kg}} altogether, including {{convert|200|l}} of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of [[pemmican]], meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk.\n\n[[File:Strindberg.sled.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Strindberg on snowshoes with heavily laden, impractical sled]]\nBy the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than {{convert|200|kg}}. This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to {{convert|130|kg}} per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\nStarting out for Franz Josef Land to the south-east on 22 July, the three soon found that their struggle across the ice, which had ridges two stories high, was hardly bringing the goal any nearer: the drift of the ice was in the opposite direction, moving them backward. On 4 August they decided, after a long discussion, to aim for Sju\u00f8yane in the southwest instead, hoping to reach the depot there after a six- to seven-week march, with the help of the current. The terrain in that direction was mostly extremely difficult, sometimes necessitating a crawl on all fours, but there was occasional relief in the form of open water\u2014the little boat (not designed by Andr\u00e9e) was apparently a functional and safe conveyance\u2014and smooth, flat ice floes.\n\n\"Paradise!\" wrote Andr\u00e9e. \"Large even ice floes with pools of sweet drinking water and here and there a tender-fleshed young polar bear!\"<ref>Andr\u00e9e's diary, 6 August, ''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 409.</ref> They made fair apparent headway, but the wind turned almost as soon as they did, and they were again being pushed backward, away from Sju\u00f8yane. The wind varied between southwest and northwest over the coming weeks; they tried in vain to overcome this by turning more and more westward, but it was becoming clear that Sju\u00f8yane was out of their reach.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 102.</ref>\n\n[[File:Boat.closeup.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Crossing a channel with the balloon-silk boat]]\nOn 12 September, the explorers resigned themselves to wintering on the ice and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, \"which\", writes Kjellstr\u00f6m, \"it had really been doing all along\". Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvit\u00f8ya, they hurriedly built a winter \"home\" on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design. Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andr\u00e9e recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 444.</ref>\n\nHowever, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on 2 October, from the stresses of pressing against Kvit\u00f8ya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. \"Morale remains good\", reports Andr\u00e9e at the very end of the coherent part of his diary, which ends: \"With such comrades one should be able to manage under, I may say, any circumstances\".<ref name=\"Bellows\">Bellows.</ref><ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 456.</ref> It is inferred from the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andr\u00e9e's diary that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', pp. 458\u2013461.</ref>\n\n== Speculation ==\n[[File:Andree.schoolchildren.png|thumb|Children at a 1930 exhibition of the Kvit\u00f8ya finds at [[Liljevalchs konsthall]], Stockholm]]\nFor the next 33 years, the fate of the expedition was shrouded in mystery and its disappearance became part of the cultural lore in Sweden and to a certain extent elsewhere. It was actively sought for a couple of years and remained the subject of myth and rumor, with frequent international newspaper reports of possible findings. An extensive archive of American newspaper reports from the first few years, 1896\u20131899, titled \"The Mystery of Andree\", shows a much richer media interest in the expedition after it disappeared than before. A great variety of fates are suggested for it, inspired by finds, or reported finds, of remnants of what might be a balloon basket or great amounts of balloon silk, or by stories of men falling from the sky, or visions by psychics, all of which would typically locate the stranded balloon far from Danes Island and Svalbard.<ref>See [http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/andreeindex.html \"The Mystery of Andree\"].</ref>\n\nLundstr\u00f6m points out that some of the international and national reports took on the features of urban legends. They reflected a prevailing disrespect for the [[indigenous peoples]] of the Arctic, who were portrayed in the newspapers as uncomprehending savages who had killed the three men or showed a deadly indifference to their plight. These speculations were refuted in 1930, upon the discovery of the expedition's final resting place on Kvit\u00f8ya by the crews of two ships, the ''Bratvaag'' and the ''Isbj\u00f8rn''.\n\n== Recovery ==\n[[File:Andreespolarexpeditiontowel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A recovered tea-towel in the [[Troms\u00f8]] polar museum]]\nThe Norwegian [[Bratvaag Expedition|''Bratvaag'' expedition]], studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian [[seal hunting|sealing]] vessel ''Bratvaag'' of [[\u00c5lesund]], found the remains of the Andr\u00e9e expedition on 5 August 1930. Kvit\u00f8ya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvit\u00f8ya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the ''Bratvaag'' took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \"inaccessible island\".<ref>{{cite web|editor-first=Jennifer |editor-last=Holvoet|year=2002\u20132003|url=http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/aug61930PRISM.html |title=The End of The Voyage \u2013 The Bratvaag Find|publisher=Polar Radar for Ice Sheet Measurements, University of Kansas Center for Research|access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andr\u00e9e's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \"Andr\u00e9e's Polar Expedition, 1896\".<ref name=\"Bellows\"/> Presented with this hook, the ''Bratvaag''{{'}}s captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andr\u00e9e's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.<ref name=\"Bellows\"/>\n\nThe ''Bratvaag'' left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K ''Isbj\u00f8rn'' of [[Troms\u00f8]], a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the ''Bratvaag''. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the ''Isbj\u00f8rn'' crew made instead for Kvit\u00f8ya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the ''Bratvaag'' had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Fr\u00e6nkel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook, and maps.<ref name=\"Bellows\"/> The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish and Norwegian governments in Troms\u00f8 on 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;16 September, respectively. The bodies of the three explorers were transported to Stockholm, arriving on 5 October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/Isbjorn.html |title=Further Discovery\u2014The Isbj\u00f8rn Expedition |publisher=Ku-prism.org |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Causes of death ===\n[[Image:Hut.sketch.jpg|thumb|Strindberg's plan for their winter home on the [[Drift ice|ice floe]], used only for a few days before the ice broke up under it. Shown from top to bottom are a bedroom with their triple sleeping bag, a room with a table, and a storeroom.]]\nThe bodies of the three men were cremated in 1930 without further examination upon being returned to Sweden. The question of what, exactly, caused their deaths has attracted both interest and controversy among scholars. Several medical practitioners and amateur historians have read the extensive diaries with a detective's eye, looking for clues in the diet, for telltale complaints of symptoms, and for suggestive details at the death site.<ref name=\"Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 114\u2013115\">Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 114\u2013115.</ref> They agree on many particulars. For instance, the explorers are known to have eaten mainly scanty amounts of canned and dry goods from the balloon stores, plus huge portions of half-cooked meat of polar bears and occasionally seals.\n\nThey frequently suffered from foot pains and diarrhea, and were always tired, cold, and wet. When they moved on to Kvit\u00f8ya from the ice, they left much of their valuable equipment and stores outside the tent, and even down by the water's edge, as if they were too exhausted, indifferent, or ill to carry it further. Strindberg, the youngest, died first and was \"buried\" (wedged into a cliff aperture) by the others. However, the interpretation of these observations is contested.\n\nThe best-known and most widely credited suggestion is that made by Ernst Tryde, a medical practitioner, in his book ''De d\u00f6da p\u00e5 Vit\u00f6n'' (''The Dead on Kvit\u00f8ya''&thinsp;) in 1952: that the men succumbed to [[trichinosis]], which they had contracted from eating undercooked polar bear meat. Larvae of ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at the site. Lundstr\u00f6m and Sundman both favor this explanation.<ref name=\"Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 114\u2013115\"/> Critics note that diarrhea, which Tryde cites as the main symptomatic evidence, hardly needs an explanation beyond the general poor diet and physical misery, but some more specific symptoms of trichinosis are missing. Also, [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and his companion [[Hjalmar Johansen]] had lived largely on polar bear meat in exactly the same area for 15 months without any ill effects.<ref>See Kjellstr\u00f6m, pp. 50\u201351, and Personne.</ref>\n\nOther suggestions have included [[Hypervitaminosis A|vitamin A poisoning]] from eating polar bear liver; however, the diary shows Andr\u00e9e to have been aware of this danger. [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] is a theory that has found a few adherents, such as the explorer [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]].<ref>Stefansson, \"Unsolved Mysteries of the Arctic\".</ref> The chief objection is that their [[primus stove]] had kerosene still in the tank when found. Stefansson argues that they were using a malfunctioning stove, something he has experienced in his own expeditions. [[Lead poisoning]] from the cans in which their food was stored is an alternative suggestion, as is scurvy, [[botulism]], suicide (they had plenty of opium), and polar bear attack. A combination favored by Kjellstr\u00f6m is that of cold and [[hypothermia]] as the Arctic winter closed in, with dehydration and general exhaustion, apathy, and disappointment.\n\nKjellstr\u00f6m argues that Tryde never takes the nature of their daily life into account, and especially the crowning blow of the ice breaking up under their promisingly mobile home, forcing them to move onto a glacier island. \"Posterity has expressed surprise that they died on Kvit\u00f8ya, surrounded by food,\" writes Kjellstr\u00f6m. \"The surprise is rather that they found the strength to live so long.\"<ref>Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 54. Mark Personne, a poison specialist who suggested [[botulism]] as the cause in his \"[http://ltarkiv.lakartidningen.se/2000/temp/pda20882.pdf Andr\u00e9e-expeditionens m\u00e4n dog troligen av botulism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326063556/http://ltarkiv.lakartidningen.se/2000/temp/pda20882.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }} \" in 2000, provides an overview of other theories (in Swedish).</ref>\n\nIn 2010, writer and researcher [[Bea Uusma]] at Karolinska institutet, Sweden, rejected the theory that larvae of ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' killed the expedition members.

The title of Engineer\u2014{{lang|sv|Ingenj\u00f6r Andr\u00e9e}}\u2014was generally and reverentially used in speaking of him, and expressed high esteem for the late 19th-century ideal of the engineer as a representative of social improvement through technological progress. The three explorers were f\u00eated when they departed and mourned by the nation when they disappeared.\n\nWhen they were found, they were celebrated for the heroism of their doomed two-month struggle to reach populated areas and were seen as having selflessly perished for the ideals of science and progress. The procession carrying their mortal remains from the ships into Stockholm on 5 October 1930, writes Swedish historian of ideas Sverker S\u00f6rlin, \"must be one of the most solemn and grandiose manifestations of national mourning that has ever occurred in Sweden. One of the rare comparable events is the national mourning that followed the ''[[M/S Estonia|Estonia]]'' disaster in the Baltic Sea in September&nbsp;1994.\"<ref>S\u00f6rlin, p. 100.</ref>\n\nMore recently, Andr\u00e9e's heroic motives have been questioned, beginning with [[Per Olof Sundman]]'s bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, ''The Flight of the Eagle.'' Sundman portrays Andr\u00e9e as the victim of the demands of the media and the Swedish scientific and political establishment, and as ultimately motivated by fear rather than courage.

The exposed film for this photograph and others from the failed 1897 expedition was recovered in 1930.]]\n'''Andr\u00e9e's Arctic balloon expedition''' of 1897 was an effort to reach the [[North Pole]] in which all three expedition members perished. [[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e|S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Andr\u00e9e]], the first Swedish [[balloon (aircraft)|balloonist]], proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from [[Svalbard]] to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind in the race for the North Pole.\n\nAndr\u00e9e ignored many early signs of the dangers associated with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey. But there was much evidence that the drag-rope steering technique Andr\u00e9e had invented was ineffective. Yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon {{lang|sv|\u00d6rnen}} (''The Eagle'') was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested. When measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andr\u00e9e refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andr\u00e9e's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions [[Nils Strindberg]] and [[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]].<ref>\nThis assessment is discussed in several contexts in ''V\u00e5r position \u00e4r ej synnerligen god ...'' by Andr\u00e9e specialist Sven Lundstr\u00f6m, curator of the [http://www.grennamuseum.se/grennamuseum/andreexpeditionen/ Andreexpedition Polarcenter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711183309/http://www.grennamuseum.se/grennamuseum/andreexpeditionen/ |date=11 July 2007 }} in [[Gr\u00e4nna]], Sweden. p. 131.\n</ref>\n\nAfter Andr\u00e9e, Strindberg, and Fr\u00e6nkel lifted off from Svalbard in July 1897, the balloon lost hydrogen quickly and crashed on the [[sea ice|pack ice]] after only two days. The explorers were unhurt but faced a grueling trek back south across the drifting icescape. Inadequately clothed, equipped, and prepared, and shocked by the difficulty of the terrain, they did not make it to safety. As the [[Arctic]] winter closed in on them in October, the group ended up exhausted on the deserted [[Kvit\u00f8ya]] (White Island) in Svalbard and died there. For 33&nbsp;years the fate of the Andr\u00e9e expedition remained one of the unsolved riddles of the Arctic. The chance discovery in 1930 of the expedition's last camp created a media sensation in Sweden, where the dead men had been mourned and idolized.\n\nAndr\u00e9e's motives have since been re-evaluated, along with assessing the role of the polar areas as the proving-ground of masculinity and patriotism. An early example is [[Per Olof Sundman]]'s fictionalized bestseller novel of 1967, [[Flight of the Eagle (novel)|''The Flight of the Eagle'']], which portrays Andr\u00e9e as weak and cynical, at the mercy of his sponsors and the media. The verdict on Andr\u00e9e by modern writers for virtually sacrificing the lives of his two younger companions varies in harshness, depending on whether he is seen as the manipulator or the victim of Swedish nationalist fervor around the turn of the 20th century.<ref>See Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 45, Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 131, Martinsson.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Andr\u00e9e's scheme ===\n[[File:SAAndree.png|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e]]]]\nThe second half of the 19th century has often been called the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]].<ref>''Safe Return Doubtful: The Heroic Age of Polar Exploration''</ref> The inhospitable and dangerous Arctic and [[Antarctic]] regions appealed powerfully to the imagination of the age, not as lands with their own [[ecology|ecologies]] and cultures, but as challenges to be conquered by technological ingenuity and manly daring.\n\n[[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e]] shared these enthusiasms, and proposed a plan for letting the wind propel a hydrogen balloon from [[Svalbard]] across the [[Arctic Sea]] to the [[Bering Strait]], to fetch up in Alaska, Canada, or Russia, and passing near or even right over the North Pole on the way. Andr\u00e9e was an engineer at the patent office in [[Stockholm]], with a passion for ballooning.\n\nHe bought his own balloon, the ''Svea'', in 1893 and made nine journeys with it, starting from [[Gothenburg]] or Stockholm and traveling a combined distance of {{convert|1,500|km|mi}}. In the prevailing westerly winds, the ''Svea'' flights had a strong tendency to carry him uncontrollably out to the [[Baltic Sea]] and drag his basket perilously along the surface of the water or slam it into one of the many rocky islets in the [[Stockholm archipelago]].\n\n[[File:Svea.png|thumb|upright|left|Andr\u00e9e's hydrogen balloon, ''Svea'']]\nOn one occasion he was blown clear across the Baltic to Finland. His longest trip was due east from Gothenburg, across the breadth of Sweden and out over the Baltic to [[Gotland]]. Even though he saw a lighthouse and heard breakers off [[\u00d6land]], he remained convinced that he was traveling over land and seeing lakes.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 12\u201316.</ref>\n\nDuring a couple of ''Svea'' flights, Andr\u00e9e tested and tried out the drag-rope steering technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of [[lighter-than-air]] craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon to the point where the sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andr\u00e9e reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction.\n\nThis notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andr\u00e9e's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken,<ref>[http://www.ballong.org/drupal/minnesmarken/andree \"Andr\u00e9es f\u00e4rder\"].

At a lecture in 1895 for the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], Andr\u00e9e thrilled the audience of geographers and meteorologists; a polar exploration balloon, he explained, would need to fulfill four conditions:\n\n# It must have enough lifting power to carry three people and all their scientific equipment, advanced cameras for [[aerial photography]], provisions for four months, and ballast, altogether about {{convert|3000|kg}}\n# It must retain the gas well enough to stay aloft for 30&nbsp;days\n# The hydrogen gas must be manufactured, and the balloon filled, at the Arctic launch site\n# It must be at least somewhat steerable\n\nAndr\u00e9e gave a glowingly optimistic account of the ease with which these requirements could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the ''Svea'', stating that a deviation of 27&nbsp;[[degree (angle)|degree]]s from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://claesjohnsonmathscience.wordpress.com/article/the-theory-of-the-disastrous-andree-yvfu3xg7d7wt-71/ |title=The Theory of the Disastrous Andr\u00e9e Arctic Expedition |author1=Claes Johnson |author2=Johan Jannson |date=4 May 2009 |work=Claes Johnson on Mathematics and Science |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Andree.boardgame.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Merchandising in 1896]]\nAndr\u00e9e assured the audience that Arctic summer weather was uniquely suitable for ballooning. The [[midnight sun]] would enable observations round the clock, halving the voyage time required, and do away with all need for anchoring at night, which might otherwise be a dangerous business.\n\nNeither would the balloon's buoyancy be adversely affected by the cold of the night. The drag-rope steering technique was particularly well adapted for a region where the ground, consisting of ice, was \"low in friction and free of vegetation\". He said that the minimal precipitation in the area posed no threat of weighing down the balloon. If some rain or snow did fall on the balloon, Andr\u00e9e argued, \"precipitation at above-zero temperatures will melt, and precipitation at below-zero temperatures will blow off, for the balloon will be traveling more slowly than the wind.\"\n\nThe audience was convinced by these arguments, so disconnected were they from the realities of the Arctic summer storms, fogs, high humidity, and the ever-present threat of ice formation. The academy approved Andr\u00e9e's expense calculation of 130,800&nbsp;[[Swedish krona|kronor]] in all, corresponding in today's money to just under a million U.S. dollars,<ref>\nSee this [http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____33838.aspx price level chart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113204630/http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____33838.aspx |date=13 January 2012 }} from [http://www.scb.se/default____2154.aspx Statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117152917/http://www.scb.se/default____2154.aspx |date=17 November 2011 }}, Sweden.\n</ref> of which the single largest sum, 36,000&nbsp;kronor, was for the balloon. With this endorsement, there was a rush to support his project, headed by King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]], who personally contributed 30,000&nbsp;kronor, and [[Alfred Nobel]], the dynamite magnate and founder of the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 21\u201327.</ref>\n\nThere was also considerable international interest, and the European and American newspaper-reading public was curious about a project that seemed as modern and scientific as the books of the contemporary author [[Jules Verne]]. The press fanned the interest with a wide range of predictions, from certain death for the explorers<ref>See for instance the [http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/Jan161896Albany.htm ''Albany Express''], Albany, NY, 16 January 1896.</ref> to a safe and comfortable \"guidance\" of the balloon (upgraded by the reporter to an \"[[airship]]\") to the North Pole in a manner planned by Parisian experts and Swedish scientists.\n\n\"In these days, the construction and guidance of airships have been improved greatly\", wrote ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', \"and it is supposed, both by the Parisian experts and by the Swedish scientists who have been assisting M. Andree, that the question of a sustained flight, in this case, will be very satisfactorily answered by the character of the balloon, by its careful guidance and, providing it gets into a Polar current of air, by the elements themselves.\"<ref>[http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/Jan211896Providence.htm ''Providence Journal''], 21 January 1896.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lachambre.balloon.factory.png|thumb|Andr\u00e9e's balloon was made at [[Henri Lachambre]]'s workshop in Paris]]\nFaith in the experts and in science was common in the popular press, but with international attention came also for the first time informed criticism. Andr\u00e9e being Sweden's first balloonist, no one had the requisite knowledge to second-guess him about buoyancy or drag ropes; but both Germany and France had long ballooning traditions and several of their more experienced balloonists expressed skepticism about Andr\u00e9e's methods and inventions.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 28\u201329 mentions, in particular, Gross in Germany, and the Renard brothers in France.</ref>\n\nHowever, just as with the ''Svea'' mishaps, all objections failed to dampen Andr\u00e9e's optimism. Eagerly followed by national and international media, he began negotiations with the well-known [[aeronaut]] and balloon builder [[Henri Lachambre]] in Paris, the world capital of ballooning, and ordered a varnished three-layer silk balloon, {{nowr|{{convert|20.5|m}}}} in diameter, from his workshop. The balloon, originally called {{lang|fr|Le P\u00f4le Nord}}, was to be renamed {{lang|sv|\u00d6rnen}} (The Eagle).\n\nSpecial technical solutions had to be designed for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30&nbsp;days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at the floor of the basket, along with some of the stores and provisions.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 49.</ref> The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified [[primus stove]]\u2014designed by a friend of Andr\u00e9e's\u2014that could be dangled {{convert|8|m|ft|spell=in}} below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 58.</ref>\n\n=== First expedition ===\n[[File:Swedenborg, Strindberg, Fraenkel and Andr\u00e9e.PNG|thumb|upright=1.1|The new crew of 1896, from left to right: [[Vilhelm Swedenborg]], [[Nils Strindberg]], [[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]], [[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e|S. A. Andr\u00e9e]]]]\nFor his 1896 attempt to launch the balloon, Andr\u00e9e had many eager volunteers to choose from. He picked [[Nils Gustaf Ekholm]], an experienced Arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882\u20131883 geophysical expedition to [[Spitsbergen]], and [[Nils Strindberg]], a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry. The main scientific purpose of the expedition was to map the area by means of aerial photography, and Strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThis was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills, but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three men were indoor types, and only one, Strindberg, was young. Andr\u00e9e expected a sedentary voyage in a balloon basket, and strength and survival skills were far down on his list.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 32.</ref>\n\nModern writers all agree that Andr\u00e9e's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing more or less in the direction he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30&nbsp;days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down.<ref>The account of Andr\u00e9e's and Ekholms computations and hypotheses in this section relies on Kjellstr\u00f6m, ''passim''.</ref>\n\nIn the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at [[Danes Island]], until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late-19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andr\u00e9e's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.\n\n[[File:Andree.railway.station.png|thumb|The three explorers' festive send-off from Stockholm in the spring of 1896]]\nOn the other hand, Ekholm was skeptical of the balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His buoyancy checks in the summer of 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 59.</ref>\n\nThe balloon was losing {{convert|68|kg}} of lift force per day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17&nbsp;days at most, not&nbsp;30. When it was time to go home, he warned Andr\u00e9e that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought. Andr\u00e9e resisted Ekholm's criticisms to the point of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andr\u00e9e had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andr\u00e9e's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known.\n\n[[File:Knut Fr\u00e6nkel.png|thumb|upright=1.1|left|[[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]]]]\nSeveral modern writers, following Sundman's Andr\u00e9e portrait in the semi-documentary novel, ''The Flight of the Eagle'' (1967), have speculated that Andr\u00e9e had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andr\u00e9e, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg, and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island.\n\nEspecially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship ''[[Fram]]'', and Andr\u00e9e's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andr\u00e9e could not face letting the press report that he did not know the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.<ref name=\"Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 45\">Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 45.</ref><ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 69\u201373.</ref>\n\nAfter the 1896 launch was called off, enthusiasm declined for joining the expedition for the second attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andr\u00e9e picked the 27-year-old engineer, [[Knut Fr\u00e6nkel]], to replace Ekholm. Fr\u00e6nkel was a [[civil engineer]] from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct the movements of the three men during their last few months with considerable precision.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 39.</ref>\n\n== Expedition of 1897 ==\n\n=== Launch, flight, and landing ===\n[[File:Andrees Station3.jpg|thumb|The station at Spitsbergen, from a [[photochrom]] print at the end of the nineteenth century]]\nReturning to Danes Island in the summer of 1897, the expedition found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andr\u00e9e had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Fr\u00e6nkel.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 73\u2013114.</ref>\n\nOn 11 July, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andr\u00e9e dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper ''Aftonbladet'', holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes around, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andr\u00e9e had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.\n\nMost of them unscrewed at once and {{convert|530|kg}} of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump {{convert|210|kg}} of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. {{convert|740|kg|lb|spell=In}} of essential weight was thus lost in the first few minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the ''Eagle'' had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, at the mercy of the wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 84.</ref><ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Lightened, the balloon rose to {{convert|700|m}}, an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.\n\n[[File:Balloon.explorers.jpg|thumb|left|The explorers minutes before takeoff on 11 July]]\nThe balloon had two means of communication with the outside world, [[buoy]]s and [[homing pigeon]]s. The buoys, steel cylinders encased in [[cork (material)|cork]], were intended to be dropped from the balloon into the water or onto the ice, to be carried to civilization by the currents. Only two buoy messages have ever been found. One was dispatched by Andr\u00e9e on 11 July, a few hours after takeoff, and reads \"Our journey goes well so far. We sail at an altitude of about {{convert|250|m|abbr=on}}, at first N&nbsp;10\u00b0 east, but later N 45\u00b0&nbsp;east&nbsp;[...] Weather delightful. Spirits high.\"<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 92.</ref> The second was dropped an hour later and gave the height as {{convert|600|m}}.\n\nThe newspaper ''Aftonbladet'' had supplied the pigeons, bred in northern Norway with the optimistic hope that they would manage to return there, and their message cylinders contained pre-printed instructions in Norwegian asking the finder to pass the messages on to the newspaper's address in Stockholm. Andr\u00e9e released at least four pigeons, but only one was ever retrieved, by a Norwegian steamer where the pigeon had alighted and been promptly shot. Its message is dated 13 July and gives the travel direction at that point as East by 10\u00b0&nbsp;South. The message reads: \"The Andree Polar Expedition to the \"Aftonbladet\", Stockholm. 13 July, 12.30&nbsp;p.m., 82&nbsp;deg. north latitude, 15&nbsp;deg. 5&nbsp;min. east longitude. Good journey eastwards, 10&nbsp;deg. south. All goes well on board. This is the third message sent by pigeon. Andree.\"<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eagle.moving.north.png|thumb|The ''Eagle'' sailing north, photographed from [[Danes Island]]]]\nLundstr\u00f6m and others note that all three messages fail to mention the accident at takeoff, or the increasingly desperate situation, which Andr\u00e9e described fully in his main diary.<ref name=\"Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 81\">Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 81.</ref> The balloon was out of equilibrium, sailing much too high and thereby losing hydrogen faster than even Nils Ekholm had feared, then repeatedly threatening to crash on the ice.<ref name=\"Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 81\"/> It was weighed down by being rain-soaked (\"dripping wet\", writes Andr\u00e9e in the diary), and the men were throwing all the sand and some of the [[payload (air and space craft)|payload]] overboard to keep it airborne.\n\nFree flight lasted for 10&nbsp;hours and 29&nbsp;minutes and was followed by another 41&nbsp;hours of bumpy riding with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash.<ref name=\"Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 45\"/> The ''Eagle'' traveled for two days and three-and-a-half hours altogether, during which time, according to Andr\u00e9e, none of the three men got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 113.</ref>\n\n=== On foot on the ice ===\n[[File:Andreeexpedition.png|thumb|400px|The path followed by the 1897 expedition: north by balloon from [[Danes Island]], then south on foot to [[Kvit\u00f8ya]]]]\nFrom the moment the three were grounded on 14 July, Strindberg's highly specialized cartographic camera, which had been brought to map the region from the air, became instead a means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant danger and drudgery of the trek.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 90.</ref> Strindberg took about 200&nbsp;photos with his {{convert|7|kg|lb|spell=in|adj=on}} camera over the course of the three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andr\u00e9e and Fr\u00e6nkel contemplating the fallen ''Eagle''.<ref>The account in this section is based on the expedition's diaries and photos in ''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'' plus some of Sven Lundstr\u00f6m's commentary in ''\"V\u00e5r position \u00e4r ej synnerligen god ...\"''.</ref>\n\nAndr\u00e9e and Fr\u00e6nkel also kept meticulous records of their experiences and geographical positions, Andr\u00e9e in his \"main diary,\"<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', pp. 391\u2013461; the last four pages of Andr\u00e9e's diary were so damaged when recovered that only fragments could be deciphered.</ref> Fr\u00e6nkel in his meteorological journal. Strindberg's own stenographic diary was more personal in content, and included his general reflections on the expedition, as well as several messages to his fianc\u00e9e Anna Charlier.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', pp. 465\u2013485.</ref> All three manuscripts were eventually retrieved from the ice on [[Kvit\u00f8ya]] in 1930.\n\nThe ''Eagle'' had been stocked with safety equipment such as guns, snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat (in the form of a bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not in the basket but in the storage space arranged above the balloon ring. These items had not been put together with great care, or with any acknowledgment of adopting indigenous peoples' techniques for dealing with the extreme environment. In this, Andr\u00e9e contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers.\n\nSven Lundstr\u00f6m points to the agonizing extra efforts that became necessary for the team due to Andr\u00e9e's mistaken design of the sleds, with a rigid construction that borrowed nothing from the long proven [[Inuit]] sleds, and were so impractical for the difficult terrain. Andr\u00e9e called it \"dreadful terrain\", with channels separating the ice floes, high ridges, and partially iced-over [[melt pond]]s.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 93\u201396.</ref> The men's clothes included no furs but were woolen coats and trousers, plus [[oilskin]]s. They wore the oilskins but the explorers reported always seeming to be damp or wet from the half-frozen pools of water on the ice and the typically foggy, humid Arctic summer air, and preoccupied with drying their clothes, mainly by wearing them. It would have meant certain death to lose the provisions lashed to one of the inconvenient sleds into one of the many channels that had to be laboriously crossed.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 98.</ref>\n\n[[File:Polar.bear.jpg|thumb|left|Fr\u00e6nkel (left) and Strindberg with the first polar bear shot by the explorers]]\nBefore starting the march across the \"dreadful terrain,\" the three men spent a week in a tent at the crash site, packing up and making decisions about what and how much to bring and where to go. The far-off North Pole was not mentioned as an option; the choice lay between two depots of food and ammunition laid down for their safety, one at [[Cape Flora]] in [[Franz Josef Land]] and one at [[Sju\u00f8yane|Sju\u00f8yane (Seven Islands)]] in [[Svalbard]]. Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12&nbsp;frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.<ref>That the series of frames is designed as a panorama was only noticed in the 2004 study by Tyrone Martinsson, who has created an animated web version of it, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20120406121802/http://www.biad.bcu.ac.uk/research/rti/riadm/issue6/issue%206.pdf Martinsson 2004].

Andr\u00e9e had reasoned that they might as well throw excess food overboard as sand if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did, after all, become necessary. There was, therefore, less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, {{convert|767|kg}} altogether, including {{convert|200|l}} of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of [[pemmican]], meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk.\n\n[[File:Strindberg.sled.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Strindberg on snowshoes with heavily laden, impractical sled]]\nBy the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than {{convert|200|kg}}. This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to {{convert|130|kg}} per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\nStarting out for Franz Josef Land to the south-east on 22 July, the three soon found that their struggle across the ice, which had ridges two stories high, was hardly bringing the goal any nearer: the drift of the ice was in the opposite direction, moving them backward. On 4 August they decided, after a long discussion, to aim for Sju\u00f8yane in the southwest instead, hoping to reach the depot there after a six- to seven-week march, with the help of the current. The terrain in that direction was mostly extremely difficult, sometimes necessitating a crawl on all fours, but there was occasional relief in the form of open water\u2014the little boat (not designed by Andr\u00e9e) was apparently a functional and safe conveyance\u2014and smooth, flat ice floes.\n\n\"Paradise!\" wrote Andr\u00e9e. \"Large even ice floes with pools of sweet drinking water and here and there a tender-fleshed young polar bear!\"<ref>Andr\u00e9e's diary, 6 August, ''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 409.</ref> They made fair apparent headway, but the wind turned almost as soon as they did, and they were again being pushed backward, away from Sju\u00f8yane. The wind varied between southwest and northwest over the coming weeks; they tried in vain to overcome this by turning more and more westward, but it was becoming clear that Sju\u00f8yane was out of their reach.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, p. 102.</ref>\n\n[[File:Boat.closeup.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Crossing a channel with the balloon-silk boat]]\nOn 12 September, the explorers resigned themselves to wintering on the ice and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, \"which\", writes Kjellstr\u00f6m, \"it had really been doing all along\". Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvit\u00f8ya, they hurriedly built a winter \"home\" on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design. Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andr\u00e9e recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 444.</ref>\n\nHowever, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on 2 October, from the stresses of pressing against Kvit\u00f8ya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. \"Morale remains good\", reports Andr\u00e9e at the very end of the coherent part of his diary, which ends: \"With such comrades one should be able to manage under, I may say, any circumstances\".<ref name=\"Bellows\">Bellows.</ref><ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', p. 456.</ref> It is inferred from the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andr\u00e9e's diary that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.<ref>''Med \u00d6rnen mot polen'', pp. 458\u2013461.</ref>\n\n== Speculation ==\n[[File:Andree.schoolchildren.png|thumb|Children at a 1930 exhibition of the Kvit\u00f8ya finds at [[Liljevalchs konsthall]], Stockholm]]\nFor the next 33 years, the fate of the expedition was shrouded in mystery and its disappearance became part of the cultural lore in Sweden and to a certain extent elsewhere. It was actively sought for a couple of years and remained the subject of myth and rumor, with frequent international newspaper reports of possible findings. An extensive archive of American newspaper reports from the first few years, 1896\u20131899, titled \"The Mystery of Andree\", shows a much richer media interest in the expedition after it disappeared than before. A great variety of fates are suggested for it, inspired by finds, or reported finds, of remnants of what might be a balloon basket or great amounts of balloon silk, or by stories of men falling from the sky, or visions by psychics, all of which would typically locate the stranded balloon far from Danes Island and Svalbard.<ref>See [http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/andreeindex.html \"The Mystery of Andree\"].</ref>\n\nLundstr\u00f6m points out that some of the international and national reports took on the features of urban legends. They reflected a prevailing disrespect for the [[indigenous peoples]] of the Arctic, who were portrayed in the newspapers as uncomprehending savages who had killed the three men or showed a deadly indifference to their plight. These speculations were refuted in 1930, upon the discovery of the expedition's final resting place on Kvit\u00f8ya by the crews of two ships, the ''Bratvaag'' and the ''Isbj\u00f8rn''.\n\n== Recovery ==\n[[File:Andreespolarexpeditiontowel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A recovered tea-towel in the [[Troms\u00f8]] polar museum]]\nThe Norwegian [[Bratvaag Expedition|''Bratvaag'' expedition]], studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian [[seal hunting|sealing]] vessel ''Bratvaag'' of [[\u00c5lesund]], found the remains of the Andr\u00e9e expedition on 5 August 1930. Kvit\u00f8ya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvit\u00f8ya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the ''Bratvaag'' took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \"inaccessible island\".<ref>{{cite web|editor-first=Jennifer |editor-last=Holvoet|year=2002\u20132003|url=http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/aug61930PRISM.html |title=The End of The Voyage \u2013 The Bratvaag Find|publisher=Polar Radar for Ice Sheet Measurements, University of Kansas Center for Research|access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andr\u00e9e's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \"Andr\u00e9e's Polar Expedition, 1896\".<ref name=\"Bellows\"/> Presented with this hook, the ''Bratvaag''{{'}}s captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andr\u00e9e's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.<ref name=\"Bellows\"/>\n\nThe ''Bratvaag'' left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K ''Isbj\u00f8rn'' of [[Troms\u00f8]], a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the ''Bratvaag''. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the ''Isbj\u00f8rn'' crew made instead for Kvit\u00f8ya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the ''Bratvaag'' had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Fr\u00e6nkel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook, and maps.<ref name=\"Bellows\"/> The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish and Norwegian governments in Troms\u00f8 on 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;16 September, respectively. The bodies of the three explorers were transported to Stockholm, arriving on 5 October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ku-prism.org/polarscientist/andreemystery/Isbjorn.html |title=Further Discovery\u2014The Isbj\u00f8rn Expedition |publisher=Ku-prism.org |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Causes of death ===\n[[Image:Hut.sketch.jpg|thumb|Strindberg's plan for their winter home on the [[Drift ice|ice floe]], used only for a few days before the ice broke up under it. Shown from top to bottom are a bedroom with their triple sleeping bag, a room with a table, and a storeroom.]]\nThe bodies of the three men were cremated in 1930 without further examination upon being returned to Sweden. The question of what, exactly, caused their deaths has attracted both interest and controversy among scholars. Several medical practitioners and amateur historians have read the extensive diaries with a detective's eye, looking for clues in the diet, for telltale complaints of symptoms, and for suggestive details at the death site.<ref name=\"Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 114\u2013115\">Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 114\u2013115.</ref> They agree on many particulars. For instance, the explorers are known to have eaten mainly scanty amounts of canned and dry goods from the balloon stores, plus huge portions of half-cooked meat of polar bears and occasionally seals.\n\nThey frequently suffered from foot pains and diarrhea, and were always tired, cold, and wet. When they moved on to Kvit\u00f8ya from the ice, they left much of their valuable equipment and stores outside the tent, and even down by the water's edge, as if they were too exhausted, indifferent, or ill to carry it further. Strindberg, the youngest, died first and was \"buried\" (wedged into a cliff aperture) by the others. However, the interpretation of these observations is contested.\n\nThe best-known and most widely credited suggestion is that made by Ernst Tryde, a medical practitioner, in his book ''De d\u00f6da p\u00e5 Vit\u00f6n'' (''The Dead on Kvit\u00f8ya''&thinsp;) in 1952: that the men succumbed to [[trichinosis]], which they had contracted from eating undercooked polar bear meat. Larvae of ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at the site. Lundstr\u00f6m and Sundman both favor this explanation.<ref name=\"Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 114\u2013115\"/> Critics note that diarrhea, which Tryde cites as the main symptomatic evidence, hardly needs an explanation beyond the general poor diet and physical misery, but some more specific symptoms of trichinosis are missing. Also, [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and his companion [[Hjalmar Johansen]] had lived largely on polar bear meat in exactly the same area for 15 months without any ill effects.<ref>See Kjellstr\u00f6m, pp. 50\u201351, and Personne.</ref>\n\nOther suggestions have included [[Hypervitaminosis A|vitamin A poisoning]] from eating polar bear liver; however, the diary shows Andr\u00e9e to have been aware of this danger. [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] is a theory that has found a few adherents, such as the explorer [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]].<ref>Stefansson, \"Unsolved Mysteries of the Arctic\".</ref> The chief objection is that their [[primus stove]] had kerosene still in the tank when found. Stefansson argues that they were using a malfunctioning stove, something he has experienced in his own expeditions. [[Lead poisoning]] from the cans in which their food was stored is an alternative suggestion, as is scurvy, [[botulism]], suicide (they had plenty of opium), and polar bear attack. A combination favored by Kjellstr\u00f6m is that of cold and [[hypothermia]] as the Arctic winter closed in, with dehydration and general exhaustion, apathy, and disappointment.\n\nKjellstr\u00f6m argues that Tryde never takes the nature of their daily life into account, and especially the crowning blow of the ice breaking up under their promisingly mobile home, forcing them to move onto a glacier island. \"Posterity has expressed surprise that they died on Kvit\u00f8ya, surrounded by food,\" writes Kjellstr\u00f6m. \"The surprise is rather that they found the strength to live so long.\"<ref>Kjellstr\u00f6m, p. 54.

The title of Engineer\u2014{{lang|sv|Ingenj\u00f6r Andr\u00e9e}}\u2014was generally and reverentially used in speaking of him, and expressed high esteem for the late 19th-century ideal of the engineer as a representative of social improvement through technological progress. The three explorers were f\u00eated when they departed and mourned by the nation when they disappeared.\n\nWhen they were found, they were celebrated for the heroism of their doomed two-month struggle to reach populated areas and were seen as having selflessly perished for the ideals of science and progress. The procession carrying their mortal remains from the ships into Stockholm on 5 October 1930, writes Swedish historian of ideas Sverker S\u00f6rlin, \"must be one of the most solemn and grandiose manifestations of national mourning that has ever occurred in Sweden. One of the rare comparable events is the national mourning that followed the ''[[M/S Estonia|Estonia]]'' disaster in the Baltic Sea in September&nbsp;1994.\"<ref>S\u00f6rlin, p. 100.</ref>\n\nMore recently, Andr\u00e9e's heroic motives have been questioned, beginning with [[Per Olof Sundman]]'s bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, ''The Flight of the Eagle.'' Sundman portrays Andr\u00e9e as the victim of the demands of the media and the Swedish scientific and political establishment, and as ultimately motivated by fear rather than courage. Sundman's interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind spots of the Swedish national culture, and the role of the press are reflected in the film adaptation, ''[[Flight of the Eagle]]'' (1982), based on his novel and directed by [[Jan Troell]]. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award]].\n\nAppreciation of Nils Strindberg's role seems to be growing, both for the fortitude with which the untrained and unprepared student kept photographing, in what must have been a more or less permanent state of near-collapse from exhaustion and exposure, and for the artistic quality of the result.<ref>Lundstr\u00f6m, pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Out of the 240 exposed frames that were found on Kvit\u00f8ya in waterlogged containers, 93 were saved by John Hertzberg at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm, Strindberg's former workplace. In his article, \"Recovering the visual history of the Andr\u00e9e expedition\" (2004), Tyrone Martinsson has lamented the traditional focus by previous researchers on the written records\u2014the diaries\u2014as primary sources of information; he renewed his claim for the historical significance of the photographs.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.grennamuseum.se/grennamuseum/andreexpeditionen |publisher=Grenna Museum |title=Andr\u00e9expeditionen Polar Centre |location=Gr\u00e4nna, Sweden |access-date=5 February 2009 |language=Swedish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209195057/http://www.grennamuseum.se/grennamuseum/andreexpeditionen/ |archivedate=9 February 2009 }}\n* {{cite book |url=http://runeberg.org/medornen/ |last1=Andr\u00e9e |first1=Salomon August |author-link1=Salomon August Andr\u00e9e |last2=Fr\u00e6nkel |first2=Knut |author-link2=Knut Fr\u00e6nkel |last3=Strindberg |first3=Nils |author-link3=Nils Strindberg |title=Med \u00d6rnen mot polen: Andr\u00e9es polarexpedition \u00e5r 1897 |year=1930 |publisher=Bonnier |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|1313686}}}} [http://runeberg.org/medornen/ A digital version] is available at [[Project Runeberg]] (accessed on 16April 2014).

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |language=de |date=2020-03-24 |work=ZDF Frontal 21}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

restrictive RKI testing criteria, Germans without any or unspecific symptoms could not be tested until late March. On 25 March 2020, the Robert Koch Institute announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be allowed to get tested, and prioritized loosened restrictions to test health care workers.<ref name=\"Focus2503\">{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Paula |title=Statistikerin fordert Tests, die endlich das wahre Corona-Ausma\u00df in Deutschland zeigen |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/es-grassiert-ungewissheit-repraesentative-tests-sollen-wahres-ausmass-in-deutschland-zeigen_id_11813688.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Focus |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> RKI criticised that too many people without symptoms were tested.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI kassiert Kriterium f\u00fcr Corona-Tests |url=https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/RKI-kassiert-Kriterium-fuer-Corona-Tests-article21667740.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=ntv |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> On 26 March, virologist Streeck said that testing labs were at the limit of their capacity.<ref name=\"Focus2703\">{{cite news |last1=Obermeier |first1=Ludwig |title=Zahlen-Chaos: Bonner Virologe zeigt mit 3 Beispielen, warum wir im Corona-Dilemma stecken |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/covid-19-pandemie-top-virologe-wir-stecken-in-einem-dilemma-weil-uns-entscheidende-daten-fehlen_id_11811994.html |accessdate=27 March 2020 |publisher=Focus |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\nThe more a pandemic has spread, the harder it becomes to increase the number of tests because the healthcare system becomes overburdened.<ref name=\"Focus2403\"/>\n\n====Reporting lag====\nIncubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of up to five and ten days.<ref name=\"Focus2503\"/>\n\nBecause of the federal health care system in Germany, states vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public. Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Welt |date=25 March 2020 |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\".

restrictive RKI testing criteria, Germans without any or unspecific symptoms could not be tested until late March.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Welt |date=25 March 2020 |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.
