Along with [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], [[Francisco T\u00e1rrega]], and [[Enrique Granados]], he was one of Spain's most important musicians of the first half of the 20th century. His image appeared on Spain's 1970 [[Spanish peseta|100-pesetas]] banknote.\n\n==Biography==\nFalla was born Manuel Mar\u00eda de los Dolores Falla y Matheu in [[Cadiz|C\u00e1diz]]. He was the son of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Falla, a Valencian, and Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Matheu, from Catalonia {{harv|Hess|2001a}}.\n\nIn 1889 he continued his piano lessons with Alejandro Odero and learned the techniques of [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]] from Enrique Broca. At age 15 he became interested in literature and journalism and founded the literary magazines ''El Burl\u00f3n'' and ''El Cascabel''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Madrid===\n[[File:Calle de Serrano n\u00ba 72 (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Housing building where Falla lived in Madrid from 1901 to 1907]]\nBy 1900 he was living with his family in the capital, where he attended the Real Conservatorio de M\u00fasica y Declamaci\u00f3n. He studied piano with Jos\u00e9 Trag\u00f3, a colleague of [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], and composition with [[Felipe Pedrell]]. In 1897 he composed ''Melod\u00eda'' for cello and piano and dedicated it to [[Salvador Viniegra]], who hosted evenings of [[chamber music]] that Falla attended. In 1899, by unanimous vote, he was awarded the first prize at the piano competition at his school of music. He premiered his first works: ''Romanza para violonchelo y piano'', ''Nocturno para piano'', ''Melod\u00eda para violonchelo y piano'', ''Serenata andaluza para viol\u00edn y piano'', and ''Cuarteto en Sol y Mireya''. That same year he started to use ''de'' with his first surname, making ''Manuel de Falla'' the name he became known as from that time on. When only the surname is used, however, the ''de'' is omitted.\n\nIn 1900 he composed his ''Canci\u00f3n para piano'' and various other vocal and piano pieces. He premiered his ''Serenata andaluza y Vals-Capricho para piano'' in the Ateneo de Madrid. Due to the precarious financial position of his family, he began to teach piano classes.\n\nIt was from Pedrell, during the Madrid period, that Falla became interested in native Andalusian music, particularly [[Andalusia]]n [[flamenco]] (specifically ''[[cante jondo]]''), the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works {{harv|Mercurio|2014|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--It does not take an entire 15-page article to establish this simple statement.-->}}. Among his early pieces are a number of [[zarzuela]]s like ''La Juana y la Petra'' and ''La casa de t\u00f3came Roque''. On 12 April 1902 he premiered ''Los amores de la In\u00e9s'' in the Teatro C\u00f3mico de Madrid. The same year he met the composer [[Joaqu\u00edn Turina]] and saw his ''Vals-Capricho'' y ''Serenata andaluza'' published by the Society of Authors.\n\nThe following year he composed and performed ''Allegro de concierto'' for the [[Madrid Royal Conservatory]] competition. [[Enrique Granados]] took first prize with his composition of the same title, but the Society of Authors published Falla's works ''Tus ojillos negros'' and ''Nocturno''. Falla then began his collaboration with composer [[Amadeo Vives]] on the zarzuelas ''Prisionero de guerra'', ''El cornet\u00edn de \u00f3rdenes'' and ''La cruz de Malta'' (only fragments of these works survive).\n\nHis first important work was the one-act [[opera]] ''[[La vida breve]]'' (''Life is Short'', or ''The Brief Life'', written in 1905, though revised before its premiere in 1913). With a libretto by [[Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]], ''La vida breve'' won Falla first prize in the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] musical competition, with a prize of 2500 pesetas and a promise of a production at the Teatro Royal in Madrid\u2014a pledge which unfortunately was not fulfilled {{harv|Harper|1998|loc=17}}.  In April 1905 he won the first prize in a piano competition sponsored by the firm of Ortiz and Cuss\u00f3. On 15 May his work ''Allegro de concierto'' premiered at the [[Ateneo de Madrid]] and on 13 November the Real Academia presented him with his prize for ''La vida breve''.\n\n===Paris===\nFalla moved to Paris in 1907, where he remained for seven years. There he met a number of composers who had an influence on his style, including  [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Paul Dukas]], as well as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Florent Schmitt]], [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]] and the impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]] {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. In 1908 [[King Alfonso XIII]] awarded him a royal grant that enabled him to remain in Paris while he finished his ''Cuatro piezas espa\u00f1olas''. In 1910 Falla met Stravinsky and in 1911\u201312 traveled to London, Brussels and Milan to give concerts and investigate possible venues for ''La vida breve'', which he had composed shortly after his arrival in Paris in 1907 but which, despite the support of Dukas and Falla's own best efforts, was not finally performed until 1 April 1913 at the Municipal Casino in [[Nice]], with the libretto translated into French by the dramatist [[Paul Milliet]]. A second production was given the following year at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, to acclaim from critics such as [[Pierre Lalo]] and Andr\u00e9 Coeuroy {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. He wrote ''Siete canciones populares espa\u00f1olas'', which he finished in mid-1914. Shortly after, [[World War I]] began, forcing Falla to return to Madrid {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. While at no stage was he a prolific composer, it was then that he entered into his mature creative period.\n\n===Return to Madrid===\nIn Madrid he composed several of his best-known pieces, including:\n* The [[nocturne]] for piano and orchestra ''[[Noches en los jardines de Espa\u00f1a]]'' (1916)\n* The [[ballet (music)|ballet]] ''[[El amor brujo]]'' (1915) which includes the much excerpted and arranged ''[[Danza ritual del fuego]]''\n* The ballet ''The Magistrate and the Miller's Wife'' (''El corregidor y la molinera'') which, after revision, became ''[[El sombrero de tres picos]]'' (1917) and was produced by [[Sergei Diaghilev|Serge Diaghilev]] with set design and costumes by [[Pablo Picasso]]. It derives from ''[[The Three-Cornered Hat (novel)|The Three-Cornered Hat]]'' (1874), a novel written by [[Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n]] {{harv|Bedmar Estrada|n.d.}}.\n\n===Granada period===\n[[File:Manuel de Falla con bast\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|150px|Manuel de Falla with walking stick (date unknown)]]\nFrom 1921 to 1939 Manuel de Falla lived in [[Granada]], where he organized the [[Concurso de Cante Jondo]] in 1922. In Granada he wrote the puppet opera ''[[El retablo de maese Pedro]]'' (''Master Peter's Puppet Show'', 1923) and a [[concerto]] for [[harpsichord]] and [[chamber music|chamber]] ensemble (''[[Harpsichord Concerto (De Falla)|Harpsichord Concerto]]'', 1926). The puppet opera marked the first time Falla included the harpsichord in  his orchestra. Both of these works were written with [[Wanda Landowska]] in mind. In these works, the Spanish folk influence is somewhat less apparent than a kind of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinskian]] [[neoclassicism]] ({{harvnb|Hess|2001a}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2001b|loc=234, 239}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2004|loc=139, 146, 151}}).\n\nAlso in Granada, Falla began work on the large-scale orchestral cantata ''[[Atl\u00e1ntida (opera)|Atl\u00e1ntida]]'' (''Atlantis''), based on the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] text ''[[L'Atl\u00e0ntida]]'' by [[Jacint Verdaguer]].\n\n===Argentina===\nFalla continued work on ''Atl\u00e1ntida'' after moving to [[Argentina]] in 1939, following [[Francisco Franco]]'s victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. (The orchestration of the piece remained incomplete at his death and was completed posthumously by [[Ernesto Halffter]].) He also premiered his ''Suite Homenajes'' in [[Buenos Aires]] in November 1939. In 1940, he was named a Knight of the Order of King [[Alfonso X of Castile]]. Franco's government offered him a large pension if he would return to Spain, but he refused.\n\nFalla did spend some time teaching in exile. Among his notable pupils was composer [[Rosa Garc\u00eda Ascot]]. His health began to decline and he moved to a house in the mountains where he was tended by his sister Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Falla (1882\u20131971). He died of [[cardiac arrest]] on 14 November 1946 in [[Alta Gracia]], in the Argentine province of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He had left in writing that he wanted to be buried in the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina. The Spanish Embassy of Francisco Franco decided to bring him back to Spain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In 1947 his remains were brought back to Spain and entombed in the cathedral at C\u00e1diz. One of the lasting honors to his memory is the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. His image appeared on Spanish currency notes for some years. Manuel de Falla never married and had no children.{{Citation needed|ydate=May 2016|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Works===\n{{For|listings of Falla's compositions|List of compositions by Manuel de Falla|List of works for the stage by Manuel de Falla}}\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1935''': Associate of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]] ({{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|[2006]|loc=73}}).\n* '''1940''': Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Alfonso X the Wise]].\n* Member of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]\n* Member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias.\n\n==Recordings by Falla==\n*Manuel de Falla 1876\u20131946 Grabaciones hist\u00f3ricas; [[Centro de Documentaci\u00f3n Musical de Andaluc\u00eda]].

Franco's government offered him a large pension if he would return to Spain, but he refused.\n\nFalla did spend some time teaching in exile. Among his notable pupils was composer [[Rosa Garc\u00eda Ascot]]. His health began to decline and he moved to a house in the mountains where he was tended by his sister Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Falla (1882\u20131971). He died of [[cardiac arrest]] on 14 November 1946 in [[Alta Gracia]], in the Argentine province of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He had left in writing that he wanted to be buried in the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina. The Spanish Embassy of Francisco Franco decided to bring him back to Spain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In 1947 his remains were brought back to Spain and entombed in the cathedral at C\u00e1diz. One of the lasting honors to his memory is the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. His image appeared on Spanish currency notes for some years. Manuel de Falla never married and had no children.{{Citation needed|ydate=May 2016|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Works===\n{{For|listings of Falla's compositions|List of compositions by Manuel de Falla|List of works for the stage by Manuel de Falla}}\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1935''': Associate of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]] ({{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|[2006]|loc=73}}).\n* '''1940''': Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Alfonso X the Wise]].\n* Member of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]\n* Member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias.\n\n==Recordings by Falla==\n*Manuel de Falla 1876\u20131946 Grabaciones hist\u00f3ricas; [[Centro de Documentaci\u00f3n Musical de Andaluc\u00eda]].
