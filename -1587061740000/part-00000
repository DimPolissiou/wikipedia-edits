The game has spawned two series, known as the ''Bhaalspawn Saga'' and the ''Dark Alliance'', both taking place mostly within the [[Western Heartlands]], but the Bhaalspawn Saga extends to [[Amn (Forgotten Realms)|Amn]] and [[Tethyr]]. The ''Dark Alliance'' series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The ''Bhaalspawn Saga'' was critically acclaimed for using [[Time-keeping systems in games#Pausable real-time|pausable realtime]] gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.\n\nThe ''Bhaalspawn Saga'' was originally developed by [[BioWare]] for [[personal computer]]s.

BioWare's [[Infinity Engine]] offers a pre-rendered [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric worldview]], with [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]-based characters. ''Baldur's Gate'' was the third computer game to make use of the [[Lua programming language|Lua]] scripting language. The engine was used for ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' and the [[Icewind Dale (series)|''Icewind Dale'' series]].\n\nThe games are based on a real-time modification of the second edition ''AD&D'' (''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'') ruleset. The player's party can have up to six members, either created by the player according to the ''AD&D'' rules or [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) recruited by the protagonist from the game world. Numerous side quests and plot twists are associated with particular NPCs and can be activated if they are found in the player's party. Through extensive, context-dependent dialogue, many characters inside and outside the player's party are fleshed out and given an added level of complexity.\n\n===Original series===\n{{Main|Baldur's Gate|Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast|Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn|Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal|Baldur's Gate III}}\n\nThe first game in the series was ''Baldur's Gate'' and introduces the player character as a powerless orphan raised in the monastery of [[Candlekeep]], south of [[Baldur's Gate (city)|Baldur's Gate]] and north of the kingdom of [[Amn (Forgotten Realms)|Amn]]. The main character searches for the killer of their foster father Gorion, and becomes involved with the region's iron crisis which causes metal to crumble, while battling to stay alive. An expansion pack for Baldur's Gate called ''Tales of the Sword Coast'' did not add to the primary storyline, but presented the protagonist with more areas to explore along the [[Sword Coast]], more powerful enemies, more spells, and better equipment. It also allows the player character to reach higher levels of experience, made some general changes to gameplay, and altered the original game's final battle.\n\nThe sequel to ''Baldur's Gate'' was ''Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn''. The main character is captured by [[#Jon Irenicus|Jon Irenicus]] and must escape into the city of [[Athkatla]], the capital of Amn. Here the protagonist faces several different ways to figure out the reason behind the capture, as they journey through the region of Amn and the [[Underdark]]. The game presents a number of innovations over the first ''Baldur's Gate'' game, including further specialization of character classes, better graphics, and higher power levels. It also allowed more interaction with the game's joinable NPCs, including friendships, romances, and your own party members' interactions with one another. ''Throne of Bhaal'' is an expansion pack for ''Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn'', and includes both an expansion of the original game, such as new areas to explore, and a conclusion to the [[Bhaalspawn]] story arc started in the first Baldur's Gate game.\n\nThe third main title, ''Baldur's Gate III'', will be developed by [[Larian Studios]] in partnership with [[Wizards of the Coast]], which holds the license for the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' IP. It is expected to be released at a yet undisclosed date for Windows systems and as a title for the [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] service.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/6/18655160/baldurs-gate-3-trailer-release-date-google-stadia-larian-studios | title = Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 announced for Stadia launch, watch the trailer here | first=  Christopher | last =Grant | date = June 6, 2019 | accessdate = June 6, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n===''Dark Alliance''===\n{{Main|Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance|Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II|Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance}}\nThe [[action role-playing game]] ''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance'' was developed by [[Snowblind Studios]] and others, and released in 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]] console, and later [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[GameCube]] video game consoles. The game takes place in the city of ''Baldur's Gate'' and surrounding area and is set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' setting, with a ruleset derived from the [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition|3rd edition of Dungeon & Dragons]]; the plot is unrelated to previous PC games. The console version used an overhead third person view, and hack-and-slash [[dungeon crawl]] style gameplay. A [[Game Boy Advance]] version was released in 2004, with reduced graphics quality using an [[2.5D]] isometric type perspective. While all ports were very well received, the original for the PlayStation 2 was the only one that gained universal acclaim.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II]]'' was developed by [[Black Isle Studios]] and released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox; the game used the same gameplay style as the original, and was also positively reviewed. The gameplay style was expanded to make the game more like a role-playing game, the ability to craft weapons, armor and amulets was added, ''Baldur's Gate'' became a hub city with the addition of a world map and being able to travel back to areas, making the game open world and many more side-quests were added as well as the ability to level up one's class.\n\nIn March 2019, [[Tuque Games]] announced that it was developing a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' game in partnership with [[Wizards of the Coast]].

With protagonists progressing to around level four at the end of [[Black Isle Studios]]' typically large campaign and a hard cap at level eight, gameplay was refocussed to adventure, with emphasizing quests over combat. The game was only titled ''Baldur's Gate'' due to [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] having lost the general ''D&D'' license to [[Atari]], but still retaining the right to make ''Baldur's Gate'' and ''Icewind Dale'' branded ''D&D'' games (the same reason as for ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance (series)|Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]''{{'}}s title).<ref name=\"banshee\" />\nThe game was not going to be connected to the previous ''Baldur's Gate'' series in any way and would start a new series, the ''Black Hound'' series. It was to be a sequel in terms of gameplay and not story, although it would continue some aspects of the ''Icewind Dale II'' story.\n\nThe game was announced in 2002 and was said to have used the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons ruleset, the gameplay of the previous ''Baldur's Gate'' games would have been updated to fit the ruleset. Many new gameplay features were also going to be added to fit the 3rd Edition Ruleset better, elements from the ''Dark Alliance'' series would have also been borrowed. The game used the Jefferson Engine which featured 3D effects such as casting dynamic shadows. The game was 75% finished before it was canceled. Its cancellation happened due to Interplay losing the right to publish ''Baldur's Gate'' games on the PC yet retaining the ''Baldur's Gate'' name for consoles, the result of this was ''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II''.\n\nThe game appeared to be canceled in 2003, just before its engine was re-purposed for Black Isle's ill-fated ''[[Van Buren (Fallout 3)|Van Buren]]'' project, the working title for the eventual ''[[Fallout 3]]''. Subsequently, [[Josh Sawyer]], one of the designers of the canceled game, resumed development of ''The Black Hound'' as a module for ''[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]''.<ref name=\"banshee\" /> As of 2009, this remains a side project for Sawyer, who works at [[Obsidian Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://the-black-hound.com/blog/?p=36 | title=regular work interferes | author=Josh Sawyer | publisher=The Herald of Archenbridge: The Black Hound Blog | date=January 25, 2009| accessdate=September 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Winterwind Productions, ''Black Hound'' developer Damien Foletto revealed the story and setting of the game, which would have been in the Dalelands.

Accusing the player character of being in league with the dog, she is about to kill the player character as well, but the Riders of Archendale arrive and scare her off before questioning the player character. After a brief inquisition, the local magistrates tell the player character not to wander far because they may have more questions. The player's quest would involve finding out who the mad cleric was, what this has to do with them, why a black spirit hound follows them around, and why people can not leave the player character alone and do things for themselves instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winterwind-productions.com/gaming/foletto_pt2/ |title=Damien Foletto on Baldur's Gate 3, The Black Hound, Fallout 3, Van Buren, Black Isle Studios |publisher=Winterwind-productions.com |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Characters==\nThe ''Baldur's Gate'' series features a wide array of characters which the player character could interact with. Some characters could be recruited as [[Party (role-playing games)|party members]] and accompany the player character in their adventures. Other major characters influence the plot of the game but are [[non-player characters|not playable characters]], serving as either antagonists or supporting characters.\n\n''PC Gamer's'' Paul Dean noted that the series \"has always been as much about who these characters were as what they could do\". He considered ''Baldur\u2019s Gate's'' characters as the cornerstone of the series, and that some of them were the best RPG companions ever written.<ref name=\"Cornerstone\"/>\n\n* '''Aerie''' is an [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)#Forgotten Realms|avariel]], an elven subspecies that possess wings, but she lost hers as a child when she was imprisoned in a circus by slavers.<ref name=\"TheGamer\"/> She was eventually rescued and restored to health by Quayle, a [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnome]] and potential companion in ''Baldur's Gate''.

''PC Gamer'' likened her to a medieval version of [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]], a \"do-gooder bound to protect the innocent and serving the public\", and who \"has a neat range of magical attacks at her disposal\".<ref name=\"History\"/>\n*'''Anomen Delryn''' is a warrior priest of Helm, and an acolyte of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. Deeply insecure due to his father's treatment of him, Anomen presents himself as a vain and arrogant character, frequently bragging about battles he most likely never fought. He is a potential companion, as well as love interest in ''Shadows Of Amn'' if the player character is female. [[David Gaider]] noted that Anomen's [[Romantic fantasy|romance]] [[subplot]] was his very first attempt as a writer employed by Bioware.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> Depending on the player's actions, he may succeed or fail at his knighthood quest to ascend as a full member of his Order, the outcome of which changes his personality and in-game alignment.<ref name=\"Romance\"/>\n*'''Edwin Odesseiron''' is a haughty member of the [[List of Forgotten Realms characters#Red Wizards|Red Wizards of Thay]] who seeks the player character's cooperation to kill a potential companion, the witch Dynaheir, and will join the party if the player character agrees to help him. He may also be recruited in ''Shadows of Amn'', where he may be encountered as an agent employed by the [[List of Forgotten Realms characters#Shadow Thieves|Shadow Thieves of Amn]]. Progressing Edwin's personal side quest to pursue the Nether Scrolls will result in him changing sex after he attempts to invoke the scroll's power; while the episode itself may have been treated as purely comic relief with no connection whatsoever to a [[transphobia|real-world issue]], it nevertheless represents an early example of a [[Queer theory|LGBT narrative]] being included in a Bioware-made RPG.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=_cNJDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT200&lpg=PT200&dq=edwina+bogost&source=bl&ots=ZAkFiOb83X&sig=ACfU3U3Jqj60n7_opNDOdvork5XZn79Z5w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwidj-uX04foAhWkwzgGHS2pBZAQ6AEwCnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=edwina%20bogost&f=false|title=Gender and Sexuality in Contemporary Popular Fantasy: Beyond boy wizards and kick-ass chicks|authors=Jude Roberts, Esther MacCallum-Stewart|date=June 3, 2016|publisher=Routledge, 2016|isbn=97813-1713-053-6|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Imoen''' is the player character's childhood friend and fellow ward of their foster father Gorion, living in [[Candlekeep]] where they were raised.<ref name=carr_burn06>{{Cite book|author1=Carr, Diane |author2=Burn, Andrew | title=Computer games: text, narrative and play | chapter=Baldur's Gate | pages=31\u201333 | publisher=Polity | year=2006 | isbn=0-7456-3400-1 }}</ref> She is a loyal companion throughout the original ''Baldur's Gate'' series, and her skills as an expert thief may be put to use throughout the ''Baldur\u2019s Gate'' series.<ref name=\"History\"/> Childlike and naive by nature, she is forced to endure a series of traumatic experiences during ''Shadows Of Amn''; she is tortured along with the rest of her companions, and is later arrested and incarcerated by an organisation of magic-users known as the Cowled Wizards for unlicensed magic use.<ref name=\"Gamezone\"/> Imoen's popularity with the ''Baldur Gate'' series fandom was not anticipated by Bioware; the original purpose of her inclusion in ''Baldur's Gate'' was to \"fill a non-psychotic-thief gap in the early levels\" late in the development cycle.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff |date=December 23, 2008 |url=http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/940/940545p1.html |title=Baldur's Gate Memories |website=IGN |accessdate=January 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113111959/http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/940/940545p1.html |archivedate=January 13, 2009 }}</ref> \n*'''Jaheira''' is a [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elf]] [[Druid (Dungeons & Dragons)|warrior druid]] and member of the Harpers, a semi-secret organization dedicated to promoting good and maintaining a balance between civilization and nature. Gorion leaves instructions for the player character to meet her and her husband Khalid after he is killed, although it is optional to recruit the couple into the party. Jaheira is available as a companion in the beginning of ''Shadows Of Amn'', and is revealed to be widowed soon afterwards. She is a potential love interest for a male player character if certain conditions are met; Gaider noted the romantic subplot itself was lengthy in terms of content, but riddled with [[Software bug|bugs]].<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> Jaheira is one of the most popular and well-regarded characters in the ''Baldur's Gate'' series.<ref name=\"TheGamer\"/><ref name=\"Gameinformer\"/>\n*'''Jan Jansen''' is an eccentric gnome who is an inventor of multiple gadgets which only he knows how to use, and tends to ramble on with lengthy stories that never get to the point.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> He is a recruitable companion in ''Shadows of Amn''; he is encountered peddling his wares in the city of Amn, which in actuality are dangerous weapons in their own right.

He is a cold and calculating mage who was first encountered torturing the player character with powerful magic, as part of his experiments in order to divulge the mysteries of their divine ancestry.

As a child he was the would-be victim of a sacrificial ritual which was stopped by Gorion and the Harpers, and was later adopted by a member of a mercantile organization known as the Iron Throne, Rieltar Anchev. Sarevok's foster father is a central figure in fomenting the iron crisis in ''Baldur's Gate'' to gain power for the Iron Throne, as well as the doppelganger infiltration of merchant rivals. His goal is to take advantage of the ensuring chaos orchestrated by the Iron Throne to kill his fellow Bhaalspawn and ascend into divinity himself.<ref name=\"History\"/> Sarevok reappears in ''Throne of Bhaal'' where the player character may restore him to life and recruit him as a party member.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gamespot.com/articles/throne-of-bhaal-nears-completion/1100-2702916/|title=Throne of Bhaal Nears Completion|last=Casavin|first=Greg|date=May 17, 2006|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Vahn''' is one of the protagonists of ''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance''.

The game has spawned two series, known as the ''Bhaalspawn Saga'' and the ''Dark Alliance'', both taking place mostly within the [[Western Heartlands]], but the Bhaalspawn Saga extends to [[Amn (Forgotten Realms)|Amn]] and [[Tethyr]]. The ''Dark Alliance'' series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The ''Bhaalspawn Saga'' was critically acclaimed for using [[Time-keeping systems in games#Pausable real-time|pausable realtime]] gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.\n\nThe ''Bhaalspawn Saga'' was originally developed by [[BioWare]] for [[personal computer]]s.

BioWare's [[Infinity Engine]] offers a pre-rendered [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric worldview]], with [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]-based characters. ''Baldur's Gate'' was the third computer game to make use of the [[Lua programming language|Lua]] scripting language. The engine was used for ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' and the [[Icewind Dale (series)|''Icewind Dale'' series]].\n\nThe games are based on a real-time modification of the second edition ''AD&D'' (''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'') ruleset. The player's party can have up to six members, either created by the player according to the ''AD&D'' rules or [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) recruited by the protagonist from the game world. Numerous side quests and plot twists are associated with particular NPCs and can be activated if they are found in the player's party. Through extensive, context-dependent dialogue, many characters inside and outside the player's party are fleshed out and given an added level of complexity.\n\n===Original series===\n{{Main|Baldur's Gate|Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast|Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn|Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal|Baldur's Gate III}}\n\nThe first game in the series was ''Baldur's Gate'' and introduces the player character as a powerless orphan raised in the monastery of [[Candlekeep]], south of [[Baldur's Gate (city)|Baldur's Gate]] and north of the kingdom of [[Amn (Forgotten Realms)|Amn]]. The main character searches for the killer of their foster father Gorion, and becomes involved with the region's iron crisis which causes metal to crumble, while battling to stay alive. An expansion pack for Baldur's Gate called ''Tales of the Sword Coast'' did not add to the primary storyline, but presented the protagonist with more areas to explore along the [[Sword Coast]], more powerful enemies, more spells, and better equipment. It also allows the player character to reach higher levels of experience, made some general changes to gameplay, and altered the original game's final battle.\n\nThe sequel to ''Baldur's Gate'' was ''Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn''. The main character is captured by [[#Jon Irenicus|Jon Irenicus]] and must escape into the city of [[Athkatla]], the capital of Amn. Here the protagonist faces several different ways to figure out the reason behind the capture, as they journey through the region of Amn and the [[Underdark]]. The game presents a number of innovations over the first ''Baldur's Gate'' game, including further specialization of character classes, better graphics, and higher power levels. It also allowed more interaction with the game's joinable NPCs, including friendships, romances, and your own party members' interactions with one another. ''Throne of Bhaal'' is an expansion pack for ''Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn'', and includes both an expansion of the original game, such as new areas to explore, and a conclusion to the [[Bhaalspawn]] story arc started in the first Baldur's Gate game.\n\nThe third main title, ''Baldur's Gate III'', will be developed by [[Larian Studios]] in partnership with [[Wizards of the Coast]], which holds the license for the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' IP. It is expected to be released at a yet undisclosed date for Windows systems and as a title for the [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] service.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/6/18655160/baldurs-gate-3-trailer-release-date-google-stadia-larian-studios | title = Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 announced for Stadia launch, watch the trailer here | first=  Christopher | last =Grant | date = June 6, 2019 | accessdate = June 6, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n===''Dark Alliance''===\n{{Main|Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance|Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II|Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance}}\nThe [[action role-playing game]] ''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance'' was developed by [[Snowblind Studios]] and others, and released in 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]] console, and later [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[GameCube]] video game consoles. The game takes place in the city of ''Baldur's Gate'' and surrounding area and is set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' setting, with a ruleset derived from the [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition|3rd edition of Dungeon & Dragons]]; the plot is unrelated to previous PC games. The console version used an overhead third person view, and hack-and-slash [[dungeon crawl]] style gameplay. A [[Game Boy Advance]] version was released in 2004, with reduced graphics quality using an [[2.5D]] isometric type perspective. While all ports were very well received, the original for the PlayStation 2 was the only one that gained universal acclaim.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II]]'' was developed by [[Black Isle Studios]] and released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox; the game used the same gameplay style as the original, and was also positively reviewed. The gameplay style was expanded to make the game more like a role-playing game, the ability to craft weapons, armor and amulets was added, ''Baldur's Gate'' became a hub city with the addition of a world map and being able to travel back to areas, making the game open world and many more side-quests were added as well as the ability to level up one's class.\n\nIn March 2019, [[Tuque Games]] announced that it was developing a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' game in partnership with [[Wizards of the Coast]].

With protagonists progressing to around level four at the end of [[Black Isle Studios]]' typically large campaign and a hard cap at level eight, gameplay was refocussed to adventure, with emphasizing quests over combat. The game was only titled ''Baldur's Gate'' due to [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] having lost the general ''D&D'' license to [[Atari]], but still retaining the right to make ''Baldur's Gate'' and ''Icewind Dale'' branded ''D&D'' games (the same reason as for ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance (series)|Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]''{{'}}s title).<ref name=\"banshee\" />\nThe game was not going to be connected to the previous ''Baldur's Gate'' series in any way and would start a new series, the ''Black Hound'' series. It was to be a sequel in terms of gameplay and not story, although it would continue some aspects of the ''Icewind Dale II'' story.\n\nThe game was announced in 2002 and was said to have used the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons ruleset, the gameplay of the previous ''Baldur's Gate'' games would have been updated to fit the ruleset. Many new gameplay features were also going to be added to fit the 3rd Edition Ruleset better, elements from the ''Dark Alliance'' series would have also been borrowed. The game used the Jefferson Engine which featured 3D effects such as casting dynamic shadows. The game was 75% finished before it was canceled. Its cancellation happened due to Interplay losing the right to publish ''Baldur's Gate'' games on the PC yet retaining the ''Baldur's Gate'' name for consoles, the result of this was ''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II''.\n\nThe game appeared to be canceled in 2003, just before its engine was re-purposed for Black Isle's ill-fated ''[[Van Buren (Fallout 3)|Van Buren]]'' project, the working title for the eventual ''[[Fallout 3]]''. Subsequently, [[Josh Sawyer]], one of the designers of the canceled game, resumed development of ''The Black Hound'' as a module for ''[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]''.<ref name=\"banshee\" /> As of 2009, this remains a side project for Sawyer, who works at [[Obsidian Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://the-black-hound.com/blog/?p=36 | title=regular work interferes | author=Josh Sawyer | publisher=The Herald of Archenbridge: The Black Hound Blog | date=January 25, 2009| accessdate=September 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Winterwind Productions, ''Black Hound'' developer Damien Foletto revealed the story and setting of the game, which would have been in the Dalelands. The player character would have been resting at their campsite when a woman chasing a Black Hound crashes in; she kills the hound, which dies on the player character 's lap. Accusing the player character of being in league with the dog, she is about to kill the player character as well, but the Riders of Archendale arrive and scare her off before questioning the player character. After a brief inquisition, the local magistrates tell the player character not to wander far because they may have more questions. The player's quest would involve finding out who the mad cleric was, what this has to do with them, why a black spirit hound follows them around, and why people can not leave the player character alone and do things for themselves instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winterwind-productions.com/gaming/foletto_pt2/ |title=Damien Foletto on Baldur's Gate 3, The Black Hound, Fallout 3, Van Buren, Black Isle Studios |publisher=Winterwind-productions.com |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Characters==\nThe ''Baldur's Gate'' series features a wide array of characters which the player character could interact with. Some characters could be recruited as [[Party (role-playing games)|party members]] and accompany the player character in their adventures. Other major characters influence the plot of the game but are [[non-player characters|not playable characters]], serving as either antagonists or supporting characters.\n\n''PC Gamer's'' Paul Dean noted that the series \"has always been as much about who these characters were as what they could do\". He considered ''Baldur\u2019s Gate's'' characters as the cornerstone of the series, and that some of them were the best RPG companions ever written.<ref name=\"Cornerstone\"/>\n\n* '''Aerie''' is an [[Elf_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Forgotten_Realms|avariel]], an elven subspecies that possess wings, but she lost hers as a child when she was imprisoned in a circus by slavers.<ref name=\"TheGamer\"/> She was eventually rescued and restored to health by Quayle, a [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnome]] and potential companion in ''Baldur's Gate''. Aerie is relatively young and inexperienced during the events of ''Baldur's Gate II'', and embodies the [[damsel in distress]] archetype.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> She is a recruitable companion, and potential love interest for a male player character in ''Shadows of Amn''; if the romance continues into the ''Throne of Bhaal'', she will eventually bear the player character's child.<ref name=\"Romance\"/>\n* '''Allessia Faithhammer''' is one of the protagonists of ''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II''. She is a [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]] of [[Helm (Forgotten Realms)|Helm]], the god of guardians, protection and protectors. She travels to Baldur's Gate during the events of ''Dark Alliance II'' after hearing of the troubles in the city. ''PC Gamer'' likened her to a medieval version of [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]], a \"do-gooder bound to protect the innocent and serving the public\", and who \"has a neat range of magical attacks at her disposal\".<ref name=\"History\"/>\n*'''Anomen Delryn''' is a warrior priest of Helm, and an acolyte of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. Deeply insecure due to his father's treatment of him, Anomen presents himself as a vain and arrogant character, frequently bragging about battles he most likely never fought. He is a potential companion, as well as love interest in ''Shadows Of Amn'' if the player character is female. [[David Gaider]] noted that Anomen's [[Romantic fantasy|romance]] [[subplot]] was his very first attempt as a writer employed by Bioware.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> Depending on the player's actions, he may succeed or fail at his knighthood quest to ascend as a full member of his Order, the outcome of which changes his personality and in-game alignment.<ref name=\"Romance\"/>\n*'''Edwin Odesseiron''' is a haughty member of the [[List_of_Forgotten_Realms_characters#Red_Wizards|Red Wizards of Thay]] who seeks the player character's cooperation to kill a potential companion, the witch Dynaheir, and will join the party if the player character agrees to help him. He may also be recruited in ''Shadows of Amn'', where he may be encountered as an agent employed by the [[List_of_Forgotten_Realms_characters#Shadow_Thieves|Shadow Thieves of Amn]]. Progressing Edwin's personal side quest to pursue the Nether Scrolls will result in him changing sex after he attempts to invoke the scroll's power; while the episode itself may have been treated as purely comic relief with no connection whatsoever to a [[transphobia|real-world issue]], it nevertheless represents an early example of a [[Queer theory|LGBT narrative]] being included in a Bioware-made RPG.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=_cNJDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT200&lpg=PT200&dq=edwina+bogost&source=bl&ots=ZAkFiOb83X&sig=ACfU3U3Jqj60n7_opNDOdvork5XZn79Z5w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwidj-uX04foAhWkwzgGHS2pBZAQ6AEwCnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=edwina%20bogost&f=false|title=Gender and Sexuality in Contemporary Popular Fantasy: Beyond boy wizards and kick-ass chicks|authors=Jude Roberts, Esther MacCallum-Stewart|date=June 3, 2016|publisher=Routledge, 2016|isbn=97813-1713-053-6|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Imoen''' is the player character\u2019s childhood friend and fellow ward of their foster father Gorion, living in [[Candlekeep]] where they were raised.<ref name=carr_burn06>{{Cite book|author1=Carr, Diane |author2=Burn, Andrew | title=Computer games: text, narrative and play | chapter=Baldur's Gate | pages=31\u201333 | publisher=Polity | year=2006 | isbn=0-7456-3400-1 }}</ref> She is a loyal companion throughout the original ''Baldur's Gate'' series, and her skills as an expert thief may be put to use throughout the ''Baldur\u2019s Gate'' series<ref name=\"History\"/>.

Gorion leaves instructions for the player character to meet her and her husband Khalid after he is killed, although it is optional to recruit the couple into the party. Jaheira is available as a companion in the beginning of ''Shadows Of Amn'', and is revealed to be widowed soon afterwards. She is a potential love interest for a male player character if certain conditions are met; Gaider noted the romantic subplot itself was lengthy in terms of content, but riddled with [[Software bug|bugs]].<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> Jaheira is one of the most popular and well-regarded characters in the ''Baldur's Gate'' series.<ref name=\"TheGamer\"/><ref name=\"Gameinformer\"/>\n*'''Jan Jansen''' is an eccentric gnome who is an inventor of multiple gadgets which only he knows how to use, and tends to ramble on with lengthy stories that never get to the point.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> He is a recruitable companion in ''Shadows of Amn''; he is encountered peddling his wares in the city of Amn, which in actuality are dangerous weapons in their own right. Scott Baird of ''TheGamer.com'' notes that Jan's inventions could easily fit into the world of ''Baldur's Gate III'', which takes place a century after the original games, especially as gnomes can easily live for over 350 years.<ref name=\"TheGamer\"/>\n*'''Jon Irenicus''' is the chief antagonist of ''Shadows Of Amn''. He is a cold and calculating mage who was first encountered torturing the player character with powerful magic, as part of his experiments in order to divulge the mysteries of their divine ancestry. Originally an [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elf]] known as \"Joneleth\", he was exiled from his home city of Suldanessellar by its ruler Queen Ellesime as a result of his hubris to attain godhood.\n*'''Khalid''' is an effette half-elf [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|fighter]], member of the Harpers and husband of Jaheira. He is a nervous, peace-loving warrior with a pronounced stutter.<ref name=\"History\"/> Khalid, like certain other companions, comes with Jaheira as an inseparable pair; if one leaves or is removed the party, the other will follow suit.<ref name=\"Best and Worst\"/> Khalid is murdered by Irenicus in ''Shadows Of Amn'', widowing Jaheira and leaving her with [[survivor's guilt]].<ref name=\"Romance\"/> \n*'''Korgan Bloodaxe''' is an evil-aligned [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarven]] [[berserker]], who could be found at the Copper Coronet Inn. He is highly rated as a worthy companion, not only for his combat skills which would prove invaluable for an evil-aligned party, but also for the quality of the banter between him and any good-aligned characters in the party.<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"TheGamer\"/>\n*'''[[Minsc]]''' is a berserker [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|ranger]] from the human nation of Rashemen, with a strong though somewhat unhinged desire to uphold good and be heroic. His animal companion is a hamster named Boo, who he believes is a \"miniature giant space hamster\" and consults for advice.<ref name=\"Gameinformer\"/> Minsc is originally tasked with serving as a bodyguard to the Rashemi witch Dynaheir as part of his rite of passage, and is inseparable from her once she is rescued. He is a potentially recruitable companion throughout the original ''Baldur's Gate'' series, outliving Dynaheir who is murdered by Irenicus prior to the events of ''Shadows of Amn''.\n*'''Sarevok Anchev''' is the chief antagonist of ''Baldur\u2019s Gate'', and as a mortal spawn of the dead God of Murder Bhaal, the half-brother of the player character. As a child he was the would-be victim of a sacrificial ritual which was stopped by Gorion and the Harpers, and was later adopted by a member of a mercantile organization known as the Iron Throne, Rieltar Anchev. Sarevok's foster father is a central figure in fomenting the iron crisis in ''Baldur's Gate'' to gain power for the Iron Throne, as well as the doppelganger infiltration of merchant rivals. His goal is to take advantage of the ensuring chaos orchestrated by the Iron Throne to kill his fellow Bhaalspawn and ascend into divinity himself.<ref name=\"History\"/> Sarevok reappears in ''Throne of Bhaal'' where the player character may restore him to life and recruit him as a party member.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gamespot.com/articles/throne-of-bhaal-nears-completion/1100-2702916/|title=Throne of Bhaal Nears Completion|last=Casavin|first=Greg|date=May 17, 2006|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Vahn''' is one of the protagonists of ''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance''.

She is a recruitable companion throughout the original ''Baldur's Gate'' series, and a potential love interest for a male player character in ''Shadows Of Amn'', embodying the [[femme fatale]] archetype<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/>; if her relationship with the player chaaracter continues into ''Throne of Bhaal'', a possible ending in the game's epilogue would reveal that Viconia is murdered by agents of the drow goddess [[Lolth]].<ref name=\"TheGamer\"/>\n*'''Yoshimo''' is a [[bounty hunter]] [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|rogue]] from [[Kara-Tur]] who is encountered in Irenicus' complex early in ''Shadows of Amn'', and offers to join the party in order to increase their odds of escape and survival.

The novels follow the bare basics of the original stories, but eschew several of the games' numerous subplots and include only a few of the NPCs.
