It opened in 1969, and had the largest multi-purpose hall in the city of [[Dresden]] [[Germany]]. The hall was used for concerts, dance and entertainment events, as well as conferences and congresses. After several years of reconstruction, including the installation of a new concert hall, it reopened in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last=J\u00fcrgen Tietz|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/dresdens-neuer-konzertsaal-spaete-harmonien-ld.1289905|title=Sp\u00e4te Harmonien {{!}} NZZ|work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung|access-date=2020-03-14|language=de}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the other buildings in the unadorned [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] on the Old Market square, the stand-alone building with a floor area of around 100 by 70 meters, completes the enclosure Altmarkt on the north side, as well as facing the Wilsdruffer Strasse. Located east of Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and southwest of nearby [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt]], it lies in the centre of the historic old town, which was largely destroyed during the firebombing of Dresden on [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|13 February 1945]]. The reconstruction of the baroque Neumarkt, underway since 2005, neighbors the Kulturpalast to the north.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:19670211 Baustelle Kulturpalast, Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|Foundations of the Kulturpalast (1967)]]\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0918-026, Dresden, Kulturpalast.jpg|thumb|Kulturpalast (1985)]]\nOriginally, the [[Palace of Culture|Kulturpalast]] was planned as a socialist-classicist ensemble building. After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were now to be implemented in the GDR. An important principle was: central square - central, cityscape-forming high-rise building and wide main roads. The Palace of Culture was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially there was aplanned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe but they were not built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure of the Palace of Culture from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", popularly known as ''Kulti'', fulfills the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture. Afterward the house was closed and completely cleared out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnn.de|title=Letzte Vorstellung im Dresdner Kulturpalast \u2013 Proteste gegen Umbau halten an.|last=|first=|date=2012-07-23|website=|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Building ==\n[[File:Weg der Roten Fahne.jpg|thumb|Wall painting ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag)]]\n\n=== Till 2012 ===\nThe multi-functional ballroom with up to 2435 seats (formerly 2740) could have been transformed into an auditorium completely furnished with fixed rows of seats and elevation or into a banquet hall with a flat floor in the area of the parquet in front of the stage thanks to the special \"tilting parquet\".\n\nThe banquet hall was optimized for multi-functionality in its room acoustics and had been adapted for use as a concert hall or for electronically amplified music or speech events through variable absorption or reflection surfaces.\n\nIn addition to the large hall, the Kulturpalast had a studio theatre with 192 seats, seminar, rehearsal and performance rooms, foyer levels, office wings and a restaurant with conference facilities.\n\nOutwardly, the ballroom is distinguished by the roof, which protrudes from the cuboid base structure and has the base area of a symmetrical trapezoid.\n\n=== Wall Painting ===\n[[File:Der Weg der roten Fahne-Inschriften.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the wall painting]]\nThe 30 meter by 10.5 meter mural ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|Roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag) on the west side of the building has been designated a cultural monument since 2001. In 1968 Gerhard Bondzin was commissioned to develop the designs. The mural was realized until 1969 by a working group of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. The working title was: \u201e1849 - 1969: 120 Jahre Kampf der revolution\u00e4ren Kr\u00e4fte der Stadt f\u00fcr Fortschritt und Sozialismus\u201c (1849 - 1969: 120 years of struggle of the revolutionary forces of the city for progress and socialism).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saechsische.de/der-weg-der-roten-fahne-haelt-fuer-die-ewigkeit-2658892.html|title=\"Der Weg der roten Fahne\" h\u00e4lt f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit|website=www.saechsische.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> In addition to Bondzin (artistic director), the artists' collective included Alfred Hesse (participation in transmission work), Gerhard Stengel (artistic technology), Gerhard Pr\u00e4kelt (architect), Emil Spiess (study organization), Martin H\u00e4nisch (type design), Wolfgang Richter (specialist instructor) and students in the 3rd and 4th year of the mural design course.

The bronze casting of the doors was carried out by the foundry Pirner & Franz in Dresden.\n\n=== Well ===\nIn front of the building, three [[water feature]]s were created in 1969 at Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe. The fountains were removed in the course of the construction work for the underground car park at Altmarkt. These were [[terrazzo]] pools measuring 7.90 by 8.55 metres. In each basin there was a jet fountain on an area of 3 by 3 meters, 24 small heap fountains were installed at the edge of the basin.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Kunst im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum|publisher=Kulturamt Dresden|year=1996|isbn=|location=Dresden, Germany|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\nDresden Altmarkt Sicht auf Kulturpalast 1 Panorama.jpg|Panorama of the Palace of Culture from the Altmarkt (February 2017)\nAltmarkt dresden kulturpalast2.JPG|View over the Altmarkt to the Kulturpalast, behind it the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], which was rebuilt until 2005 \nAltmarkt (Dresden)2009 06.jpg|Close-up with Frauenkirche and row building at Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe, 2009\n20121008160DR DD Blick v d Frauenkirche Richtung Altmarkt.jpg|View from the Frauenkirche over the reborn Neumarkt, Kulturpalast and Altmarkt, 2012\nDD-Kulturpalast-Foyer.jpg|Foyer of the Kulturpalast\nDD-Kulturpalast-Obergeschoss-1.jpg|First floor with the wall frieze 'Unser sozialistisches Leben' ''Our socialist life''\nDD-Kulturpalast-Bibo-1.jpg|Central Library of the Municipal Libraries\n</gallery>\n\n== Conversion ==\n[[File:DD-Kulturpalast-Saal-04.jpg|thumb|The new concert hall]]\n\n=== Conversion planning ===\n[[File:Dresdner Philharmonie im Kulturpalast 2.jpg|thumb|The Dresden Philharmonic and the organ in the renovated Kulturpalast]]\nIn October 2013 the reconstruction work on the Palace of Culture began.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2013/10/pm_050.php|title=Baustart im Dresdner Kulturpalast|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The festival hall was to be converted into a pure concert hall with a reduced capacity as a venue for the Dresden Philharmonic. The studio stage, seminar rooms and other used areas of the Kulturpalast were to be redesigned as the venue for the Herkuleskeule (Leg of Hercules) and the library operations of the Municipal Library, to be able to abandon the old locations. In addition to cost savings, this was intended to achieve an all-day opening and use of the building and a use by different age and interest groups.\n\n=== Architecture competition ===\nTo this end, the state capital announced an architectural competition in which the office of [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|Gerkan, Marg and Partner]] won the first prize unanimously and with recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2009/06/pm_110.php|title=Jury ermittelte Siegerentwurf zum Kulturpalastumbau|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The design envisaged a pure concert hall in the shape of a [[vineyard]] (similar to the hall of the [[Gewandhaus]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany), which should offer good conditions for the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n=== Reopening 2017 ===\nAfter reconstruction and renovation, the Palace of Culture was reopened on April 28, 2017 with a festive concert by the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-05-03|title=Ein zauberischer Dunst|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|volume=|pages=12|via=}}</ref> The old festival hall was converted into the new concert hall with a reduced capacity of up to 1800 seats. Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at the time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose. However, this mobility and the shortage of money set clear limits to the size of the organ, which at that time had a very modest capacity for a hall with well over 2000 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jehmlich-orgelbau.de/orgelprojekte/cottbus-propsteikirche/|title=Cottbus, Kath.

After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were now to be implemented in the GDR. An important principle was: central square - central, cityscape-forming high-rise building and wide main roads. The Palace of Culture was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially there was aplanned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe but they were not built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure of the Palace of Culture from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", popularly known as ''Kulti'', fulfills the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture.

The studio stage, seminar rooms and other used areas of the Kulturpalast were to be redesigned as the venue for the Herkuleskeule (Leg of Hercules) and the library operations of the Municipal Library, to be able to abandon the old locations. In addition to cost savings, this was intended to achieve an all-day opening and use of the building and a use by different age and interest groups.\n\n=== Architecture competition ===\nTo this end, the state capital announced an architectural competition in which the office of [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|Gerkan, Marg and Partner]] won the first prize unanimously and with recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2009/06/pm_110.php|title=Jury ermittelte Siegerentwurf zum Kulturpalastumbau|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The design envisaged a pure concert hall in the shape of a [[vineyard]] (similar to the hall of the [[Gewandhaus]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany), which should offer good conditions for the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n=== Reopening 2017 ===\nAfter reconstruction and renovation, the Palace of Culture was reopened on April 28, 2017 with a festive concert by the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-05-03|title=Ein zauberischer Dunst|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|volume=|pages=12|via=}}</ref> The old festival hall was converted into the new concert hall with a reduced capacity of up to 1800 seats. Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context, but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at the time when socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose. However, this mobility and the shortage of money set clear limits to the size of the organ, which at that time had a very modest capacity for a hall with well over 2000 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jehmlich-orgelbau.de/orgelprojekte/cottbus-propsteikirche/|title=Cottbus, Kath.

On March 28, 1976, Bowman performed the first euphonium recital at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref name=\"Bio Index\" /><ref name=\"Meckna\" /><ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBowman was born in [[Fort dodge,iowa\n\n== Career ==\nBowman served as a member of three [[United States military bands]], two of which were premier ensembles for their respective services. Bowman served as solo euphonium in the [[United States Navy Band]] from 1970 to 1974. This was followed by a two-year period serving with a joint ensemble, the [[United States Armed Forces Bicentennial Band]]. He completed his career with the [[United States Air Force Band]], serving from 1976 to 1991.\n\nBowman was first to perform a recital on [[euphonium]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York.<ref name=\"Vol63\" /> He also was the first guest euphonium artist at the [[Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival]] at [[Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp]] in [[Twin Lake, Michigan]].<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n\nBowman has recorded dozens of ensemble performances in addition to six solo albums on euphonium.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> He has recorded many new works for euphonium, many of which were written specifically for the instrument. One of the albums, reviewed in ''The New Records'' in 1979 was described as containing all music that seemed to \"exist just to have something for the euphonium to play\". While going on to describe Bowman as \"a master of his instrument\", the review of the compositions was not favorable.<ref name=\"Vol46\" />\n\n==Professional career==\nBowman broke new ground in the American understanding of the euphonium and has been called \"The most famous euphonium soloist in the world today\".<ref name=\"Morin\" /> He became known for a \"warm, velvet tone\" <ref name=\"Bio\" /> and promoted a style of playing described as \"traditional vibrato... balanced by... clean and impressive technique, from-the-heart expressiveness, and a sense of calm assurance\".<ref name=\"Morin\" /> He advanced this new image of the instrument through his performances of new literature, premiering 4 of the 7 such works commissioned by the former Tubists Universal Brotherhood Association (TUBA) now known as the [[International Tuba Euphonium Association]]. He served as its president, and was the first euphonium player to do so.<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n\nBowman has been involved in the evolution of the instrument. He has served as a consultant for the design of euphonium mouthpieces to the Swiss-based Willson Musical Instrument Company, whose products are distributed in North America by [[Getzen]].

On March 28, 1976, Bowman performed the first euphonium recital at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref name=\"Bio Index\" /><ref name=\"Meckna\" /><ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBowman was born in [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]]. He earned a [[bachelor of music]] degree (June 1970) and [[master of music]] degree (August 1970) from the [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. He earned a [[doctor of musical arts]] from the [[Catholic University of America]] School of Music (1975).<ref name=\"Bowman's DMA thesis\" />\n\n== Career ==\nBowman served as a member of three [[United States military bands]], two of which were premier ensembles for their respective services. Bowman served as solo euphonium in the [[United States Navy Band]] from 1970 to 1974. This was followed by a two-year period serving with a joint ensemble, the [[United States Armed Forces Bicentennial Band]]. He completed his career with the [[United States Air Force Band]], serving from 1976 to 1991.\n\nBowman was first to perform a recital on [[euphonium]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York.<ref name=\"Vol63\" /> He also was the first guest euphonium artist at the [[Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival]] at [[Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp]] in [[Twin Lake, Michigan]].<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n\nBowman has recorded dozens of ensemble performances in addition to six solo albums on euphonium.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> He has recorded many new works for euphonium, many of which were written specifically for the instrument. One of the albums, reviewed in ''The New Records'' in 1979 was described as containing all music that seemed to \"exist just to have something for the euphonium to play\". While going on to describe Bowman as \"a master of his instrument\", the review of the compositions was not favorable.<ref name=\"Vol46\" />\n\n==Professional career==\nBowman broke new ground in the American understanding of the euphonium and has been called \"The most famous euphonium soloist in the world today\".<ref name=\"Morin\" /> He became known for a \"warm, velvet tone\" <ref name=\"Bio\" /> and promoted a style of playing described as \"traditional vibrato... balanced by... clean and impressive technique, from-the-heart expressiveness, and a sense of calm assurance\".<ref name=\"Morin\" /> He advanced this new image of the instrument through his performances of new literature, premiering 4 of the 7 such works commissioned by the former Tubists Universal Brotherhood Association (TUBA) now known as the [[International Tuba Euphonium Association]]. He served as its president, and was the first euphonium player to do so.<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n\nBowman has been involved in the evolution of the instrument. He has served as a consultant for the design of euphonium mouthpieces to the Swiss-based Willson Musical Instrument Company, whose products are distributed in North America by [[Getzen]]. He has been instrumental in DEG Music Products, which released a line of [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpieces]] bearing Bowman's name.<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n\nBowman has been on the music faculty at the [[University of North Texas College of Music]] for {{cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1999|08|23}}}} years (since August 1999), where he is a Regents Professor.

Las Vegas, NM is located {{convert|110|mi}} south of [[Raton, New Mexico]], {{convert|65|mi}} east of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], {{convert|122|mi}} northeast of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], {{convert|257|mi}} south of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], and {{convert|326|mi}} south of [[Denver, Colorado]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Plaza Hotel LasVegasNM.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Plaza Hotel (Las Vegas, New Mexico)|Plaza Hotel]], built in 1881, on the Plaza of West Las Vegas]]\n[[File:New Mexico Insane Asylum, Las Vegas, New Mexico (1904).jpg|thumb|right|New Mexico Insane Asylum in Las Vegas, 1904]]\nLas Vegas was established in 1835 after a group of settlers received a land grant from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] government. The town was laid out in the traditional Spanish Colonial style, with a central plaza surrounded by buildings which could serve as fortifications in case of attack. Las Vegas soon prospered as a stop on the [[Santa Fe Trail]]. During the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, [[Stephen W. Kearny]] delivered an address at the Plaza of Las Vegas claiming New Mexico for the United States. In 1877 Las Vegas College, the precursor to [[Regis University]], was founded in Las Vegas by a group of exiled Italian Jesuits. In 1887, Las Vegas College moved to [[Denver]] whereupon the name was changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeprofiles.com/regis.html |title=Regis University |publisher=College Profiles |date=1991-07-01 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>\n\nA railroad was constructed to the town in 1880. To maintain control of development rights, it established a station and related development one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) east of the Plaza, creating a separate, rival New Town, as occurred elsewhere in the Old West. The same competing development occurred in [[Albuquerque]], for instance. During the railroad era Las Vegas boomed, quickly becoming one of the largest cities in the American Southwest. Turn-of-the-century Las Vegas featured all the modern amenities, including an electric street railway, the \"Duncan Opera House\" at the northeast corner of 6th Street and Douglas Avenue, a [[Carnegie library]], the Hotel Castaneda (a major [[Fred Harvey Company|Harvey House]]), and the New Mexico Normal School (now [[New Mexico Highlands University]]). Since the decline and restructuring of the railroad industry began in the 1950s, the city's population has remained relatively constant. Although the two towns have been combined, separate school districts have been maintained ([[Las Vegas City Schools]] and [[West Las Vegas Schools|West Las Vegas School District]]).\n\nThe anti-colonist organization [[Las Gorras Blancas]] was active in the area in the 1890s.\n\n===Rough Rider Reunions===\nBeginning in 1899, a reunion was held at the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas for the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, one of three such regiments raised in 1898 for the Spanish\u2013American War and the only one of the three to see action. The 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry is more famously known as the [[Rough Riders]]. The reunion was attended by the then Governor of New York, [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Two years later, in 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became the 26th President of the United States when President William McKinley died while Roosevelt was serving as vice-president.\n\nThe last surviving Rough Rider, Jesse Langdon, died in 1975 at the age of 94.\n\nIn 2005, a group of local motorcycle riders gathered to organize and hold a rally focused on the area's history and special environment. The \"Rough Rider\" name was chosen because Rough Riders had a long tradition in Las Vegas. Now in its {{years ago|2005}}th year, the rally attracts motorcyclists from throughout the southwest for three days of charitable activities and motorcycle related events.\n\n===Cowboy Reunions===\nBeginning in 1915, the Las Vegas Cowboys' Reunions were held annually until 1931; then in 1939, the Cowboys' Reunions were re-established. Their slogan was, \"Git Fer Vegas, Cowboy!\" These reunions were organized by a group of ranching families and cowboys which soon became the Las Vegas Cowboys' Reunion Association. The Reunions celebrated ranching life, which began in northern New Mexico in the early 1800s and continues into the 21st Century. The annual affair included pie eating contests, barbecues, parades, banquets, balls, and \"ranch rodeos.\" In the early years, celebrities\u2014cowhands as well as big-name bands, movie stars like Tom Mix, and artists such as Randall Davey\u2014came to Las Vegas for this event. In later years, famous cowhands participated in the Cowboys' Reunion Rodeos. The Cowboys' Reunions reflected the occupations of the area and attracted huge crowds for their 4 days of events. In 1952, the Cowboys' Reunion Association invited the Rough Riders Association to join them at the annual rodeo.<ref>Romero Pat,\"Cowboy Reunions of Las Vegas New Mexico,\" (The history press 2012)</ref>\n\n===Outlaws===\nThe arrival of the railroad on July 4, 1879 brought with it businesses, development and new residents, both respectable and dubious.

Built from a $10,000 donation from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, its Neo-Classical Revival architecture resembles Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. The library sits in the middle of a park that occupies an entire city block, bordered by Victorian-style homes and buildings.\n\nThe City of Las Vegas Museum & Rough Rider Memorial on Grand Avenue, dedicated in 1940, was first established by the decision of Theodore Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders]] regiment (the first Volunteer Cavalry Regiment of the Spanish\u2013American War), who named Las Vegas its official reunion home. Their first reunion was held in Las Vegas, June 1899.\n\nThe museum, free and open to the public, houses a memorial collection of artifacts, archives and photographs from the Rough Riders and mementos in relation to the 1898 Cuban Campaign of the Spanish\u2013American War, with information on over 200 members of the original regiment, RRR Association documents, etc. The museum illuminates the history of Las Vegas, its connection to the Rough Riders, the Santa Fe Trail and the development of New Mexico.

The town was laid out in the traditional Spanish Colonial style, with a central plaza surrounded by buildings which could serve as fortifications in case of attack. Las Vegas soon prospered as a stop on the [[Santa Fe Trail]]. During the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, [[Stephen W. Kearny]] delivered an address at the Plaza of Las Vegas claiming New Mexico for the United States. In 1877 Las Vegas College, the precursor to [[Regis University]], was founded in Las Vegas by a group of exiled Italian Jesuits. In 1887, Las Vegas College moved to [[Denver]] whereupon the name was changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeprofiles.com/regis.html |title=Regis University |publisher=College Profiles |date=1991-07-01 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>\n\nA railroad was constructed to the town in 1880. To maintain control of development rights, it established a station and related development one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) east of the Plaza, creating a separate, rival New Town, as occurred elsewhere in the Old West. The same competing development occurred in [[Albuquerque]], for instance. During the railroad era Las Vegas boomed, quickly becoming one of the largest cities in the American Southwest. Turn-of-the-century Las Vegas featured all the modern amenities, including an electric street railway, the \"Duncan Opera House\" at the northeast corner of 6th Street and Douglas Avenue, a [[Carnegie library]], the Hotel Castaneda (a major [[Fred Harvey Company|Harvey House]]), and the New Mexico Normal School (now [[New Mexico Highlands University]]). Since the decline and restructuring of the railroad industry began in the 1950s, the city's population has remained relatively constant. Although the two towns have been combined, separate school districts have been maintained ([[Las Vegas City Schools]] and [[West Las Vegas Schools|West Las Vegas School District]]).\n\nThe anti-colonist organization [[Las Gorras Blancas]] was active in the area in the 1890s.\n\n===Rough Rider Reunions===\nBeginning in 1899, a reunion was held at the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas for the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, one of three such regiments raised in 1898 for the Spanish\u2013American War and the only one of the three to see action. The 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry is more famously known as the [[Rough Riders]]. The reunion was attended by the then Governor of New York, [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Two years later, in 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became the 26th President of the United States when President William McKinley died while Roosevelt was serving as vice-president.\n\nThe last surviving Rough Rider, Jesse Langdon, died in 1975 at the age of 94.\n\nIn 2005, a group of local motorcycle riders gathered to organize and hold a rally focused on the area's history and special environment. The \"Rough Rider\" name was chosen because Rough Riders had a long tradition in Las Vegas. Now in its {{years ago|2005}}th year, the rally attracts motorcyclists from throughout the southwest for three days of charitable activities and motorcycle related events.\n\n===Cowboy Reunions===\nBeginning in 1915, the Las Vegas Cowboys' Reunions were held annually until 1931; then in 1939, the Cowboys' Reunions were re-established. Their slogan was, \"Git Fer Vegas, Cowboy!\" These reunions were organized by a group of ranching families and cowboys which soon became the Las Vegas Cowboys' Reunion Association. The Reunions celebrated ranching life, which began in northern New Mexico in the early 1800s and continues into the 21st Century. The annual affair included pie eating contests, barbecues, parades, banquets, balls, and \"ranch rodeos.\" In the early years, celebrities\u2014cowhands as well as big-name bands, movie stars like Tom Mix, and artists such as Randall Davey\u2014came to Las Vegas for this event. In later years, famous cowhands participated in the Cowboys' Reunion Rodeos. The Cowboys' Reunions reflected the occupations of the area and attracted huge crowds for their 4 days of events. In 1952, the Cowboys' Reunion Association invited the Rough Riders Association to join them at the annual rodeo.<ref>Romero Pat,\"Cowboy Reunions of Las Vegas New Mexico,\" (The history press 2012)</ref>\n\n===Outlaws===\nThe arrival of the railroad on July 4, 1879 brought with it businesses, development and new residents, both respectable and dubious. Murderers, robbers, thieves, gamblers, gunmen, swindlers, [[vagrants]], and [[tramp]]s poured in, transforming the eastern side of the settlement into a virtually lawless brawl. Among the notorious characters were such legends of the Old West as: dentist [[Doc Holliday]] and his girlfriend [[Big Nose Kate]], [[Jesse James]], [[Billy the Kid]], [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Mysterious Dave Mather]], [[Hoodoo Brown]], and Handsome Harry the Dancehall Rustler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/NM-LasVegas.html |title=New Mexico Legends - Las Vegas - As Wicked as Dodge City |publisher=Legends of America |accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Ralph Emerson Twitchell]] once claimed regarding the Old West, \"Without exception there was no town which harbored a more disreputable gang of desperadoes and outlaws than did Las Vegas.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.net/~dphillip/Outlaw.html |title=LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO - The Outlaw and a Politician |publisher=Edge.net |date=1974-08-22 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010214141/http://www.edge.net/~dphillip/Outlaw.html |archive-date=2016-10-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{wide image|Panorama of Las Vegas, New Mexico (circa 1910-1920) .jpg|900px|Circa 1910-1920}}\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.5|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Climate==\nLas Vegas has a [[cold semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''BSk''').\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Las Vegas, New Mexico.

Built from a $10,000 donation from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, its Neo-Classical Revival architecture resembles Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. The library sits in the middle of a park that occupies an entire city block, bordered by Victorian-style homes and buildings.\n\nThe City of Las Vegas Museum & Rough Rider Memorial on Grand Avenue, dedicated in 1940, was first established by the decision of Theodore Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders]] regiment (the first Volunteer Cavalry Regiment of the Spanish\u2013American War), who named Las Vegas its official reunion home. Their first reunion was held in Las Vegas, June 1899.\n\nThe museum, free and open to the public, houses a memorial collection of artifacts, archives and photographs from the Rough Riders and mementos in relation to the 1898 Cuban Campaign of the Spanish\u2013American War, with information on over 200 members of the original regiment, RRR Association documents, etc. The museum illuminates the history of Las Vegas, its connection to the Rough Riders, the Santa Fe Trail and the development of New Mexico. It features collections of local Native American pottery, household items, costumes, ranching and farming equipment, agricultural and mercantile operations, and home life.\n\nHoused in a 1940 [[Works Progress Administration]]-funded building, the museum is built of stone, with Pueblo Revival nuances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org |title=City of Las Vegas Museum & Rough Rider Memorial Collection |publisher=Lasvegasmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[Image:Rail Station in Las Vegas, New Mexico.JPG|thumb|right|Historic Castaneda railway hotel as seen from [[I-25]]]]\nLas Vegas has numerous historic structures (mostly railroad-era houses and commercial buildings), with over 900 listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The city had a population of 820,000 as at the 2015 [[Census]].\n\nVientiane is noted as the home of the most significant national monument in Laos: [[That Luang]], which is a known symbol of Laos and an icon of [[Buddhism in Laos]]. Other significant Buddhist temples in Laos can be found there as well, such as [[Haw Phra Kaew]], which formerly housed the [[Emerald Buddha]].\n\nThe city hosted the [[2009 Southeast Asian Games|25th Southeast Asian Games]] in December 2009, celebrating 50 years of the [[Southeast Asian Games]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\nThe name of the city is derived from [[P\u0101li|Pali]], the [[liturgical language]] of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. Although the original meaning of the name of the city is \"city of [[Santalum album|sandalwood]]\", as shown by ancient Lao inscriptions (written [[Chinese character classification#Pictograms|pictogrammatically]], unlike modern Lao, which is written phonetically), in modern [[Lao Language|Lao]] the meaning of the name Vientiane is not a mystery. Vientiane is a compound word Vieng(valley) and Chan \u0e88\u0eb1\u0e99\u0e97\u0e99\u0ecc sandlewood. Vientiane means valley of sandlewood.  Similarly Vang Vieng means open valley.\n\nMany, if not most, Lao people claim that the city's name means \"city of the moon\",{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} while many also claim correctly that the city's name means \"city of sandalwood\" because the words for \"moon\" ({{lang|lo|\u0e88\u0eb1\u0e99\u0e97\u0ea3\u0ecc}}, from [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930}} ''candra'') and \"sandalwood\" ({{lang|lo|\u0e88\u0eb1\u0e99\u0e97\u0e99\u0ecc}}, from Sanskrit {{lang|sa|\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928}} ''candana'') are written and pronounced identically as {{lang|lo|\u0e88\u0eb1\u0e99}} ''chan'' in modern Lao. Most academic and historic Lao sources do in fact support this claim, reinforced by the city's [[Thai language|Thai]] ({{lang|th|\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e19\u0e4c}}) and Khmer ({{lang|km|\u179c\u17c0\u1784\u1785\u1793\u17d2\u1791\u1793\u17cd}}) names both retaining the etymological spelling, which indicates \"city of sandalwood\".\n\nThe [[Roman alphabet|Romanised]] spelling ''Vientiane'' is of [[French language|French]] origin, and reflects the difficulty the French had in pronouncing the {{IPAslink|t\u0255}} sound in the Lao language.{{Original research inline|date=June 2019}} A common English-based spelling is 'Viangchan',<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|encyclopedia=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|title=Definition of 'Viangchan'|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/viangchan|access-date=11 June 2019|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=[[Glasgow]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611151032/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/viangchan|archive-date=11 June 2016|url-status=live|quote=Viangchan in British.

Thattaradtha founded a city called ''Maha Thani Si Phan Phao'' on the western banks of the [[Mekong|Mekong River]]; this city was said to have later become today's [[Udon Thani]], [[Thailand]]. One day, a seven-headed [[Naga (mythology)|Naga]] told Thattaradtha to start a new city on the east bank of the river opposite ''Maha Thani Si Phan Phao''. The prince called this city ''Chanthabuly Si Sattanakhanahud''; which was said to be the predecessor of modern Vientiane.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nContrary to the Phra Lak Phra Lam, most historians believe Vientiane was an early [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] settlement centered around a [[Hindu]] temple, which the Pha That Luang would later replace. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the time when the [[Lao people|Lao]] and [[Thai people]] are believed to have entered [[Southeast Asia]] from [[Southern China]], the few remaining Khmers in the area were either killed, removed, or assimilated into the Lao civilization, which would soon overtake the area.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn 1354, when [[Fa Ngum]] founded the kingdom of [[Lan Xang]].<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coed\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George Coed\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

In 1779, it was conquered by the Siamese general Phraya [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Chakri]] and made a vassal of [[Thailand|Siam]].\n\nWhen King [[Anouvong]] raised an unsuccessful rebellion, it was obliterated by [[Thai people|Siamese]] armies in 1827. The city was burned to the ground and was looted of nearly all Laotian artifacts, including Buddha statues and people. Vientiane was in great disrepair, depopulated and disappearing into the forest, when the French arrived. It eventually passed to [[France|French]] rule in 1893. It became the capital of the French protectorate of Laos in 1899. The French rebuilt the city and rebuilt or repaired Buddhist temples such as [[Pha That Luang]], [[Haw Phra Kaew]], and left many colonial buildings behind. During French rule, the Vietnamese were encouraged to migrate to Laos, which resulted in 53% of the population of Vientiane being Vietnamese in the year of 1943.<ref name=\"MartinStuart-FoxA\">Stuart-Fox, Martin (1997).

In August 1960, [[Kong Le]] seized the capital and insisted that [[Souvanna Phouma]] become prime minister. In mid-December, [[Phoumi Nosavan]] then seized the capital, overthrew the Phouma Government, and installed [[Boun Oum]] as prime minister. In mid-1975, Pathet Lao troops moved towards the city and Americans began evacuating the capital. On 23 August 1975, a contingent of 50 Pathet Lao women symbolically liberated the city.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> On 2 December 1975, the [[communist party]] of the [[Pathet Lao]] took over Vientiane, defeated the [[Kingdom of Laos]], and renamed the country the Lao People's Democratic Republic, which ended the [[Laotian Civil War]]. The next day, an [[Insurgency in Laos]] began in the jungle, with the Pathet Lao fighting factions of Hmong and royalists.\n\nVientiane was the host of the incident-free [[2009 Southeast Asian Games]].

The city contains many temples and Buddhist monuments. A popular attraction for foreign visitors is [[Pha That Luang]], an important national cultural monument of Laos and one of its best known [[stupa]]s. It was originally built in 1566 by King [[Setthathirath]], and was restored in 1953. The golden stupa is 45&nbsp;metres tall and is believed to contain a relic of the Lord Buddha.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://www.tourismlaos.org/web/show_content.php?contID=328 Lao National Tourism Administration - Tourist Sites in Vientiane Capital] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080908/http://www.tourismlaos.org/web/show_content.php?contID=328 |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAnother site that is also popular amongst tourists is [[Wat Si Muang]].

Legend tells that Nang Si, who was pregnant at the time, leapt to her death as a sacrifice, just as the pillar was being lowered into the hole. In front of the temple stands a statue of King [[Sisavang Vong]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThe memorial monument, [[Patuxai]], built between 1957 and 1968, is perhaps the most prominent landmark in the city.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> While the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]] inspired the architecture, the design incorporates typical Lao motifs including Kinnari, a mythical bird woman. Energetic visitors can climb to the top of the monument for a panoramic view of the city.\n\n[[Buddha Park]] was built in 1958 by [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat]] and contains a collection of Buddhist and Hindu sculptures, scattered amongst gardens and trees.

The city had a population of 820,000 as at the 2015 [[Census]].\n\nVientiane is noted as the home of the most significant national monument in Laos: [[That Luang]], which is a known symbol of Laos and an icon of [[Buddhism in Laos]]. Other significant Buddhist temples in Laos can be found there as well, such as [[Haw Phra Kaew]], which formerly housed the [[Emerald Buddha]].\n\nThe city hosted the [[2009 Southeast Asian Games|25th Southeast Asian Games]] in December 2009, celebrating 50 years of the [[Southeast Asian Games]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\nThe name of the city is derived from [[P\u0101li|Pali]], the [[liturgical language]] of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. Although the original meaning of the name of the city is \"city of [[Santalum album|sandalwood]]\", as shown by ancient Lao inscriptions (written [[Chinese character classification#Pictograms|pictogrammatically]], unlike modern Lao, which is written phonetically), in modern [[Lao Language|Lao]] the meaning of the name Vientiane is not a mystery. Vientiane is a compound word Vieng(valley) and Chan \u0e88\u0eb1\u0e99\u0e97\u0e99\u0ecc sandlewood. Vientiane means valley of sandlewood.  Similarly Vang Vieng means open valley.\n\nMany, if not most, Lao people claim that the city's name means \"city of the moon\",{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} while many also claim correctly that the city's name means \"city of sandalwood\" because the words for \"moon\" ({{lang|lo|\u0e88\u0eb1\u0e99\u0e97\u0ea3\u0ecc}}, from [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930}} ''candra'') and \"sandalwood\" ({{lang|lo|\u0e88\u0eb1\u0e99\u0e97\u0e99\u0ecc}}, from Sanskrit {{lang|sa|\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928}} ''candana'') are written and pronounced identically as {{lang|lo|\u0e88\u0eb1\u0e99}} ''chan'' in modern Lao. Most academic and historic Lao sources do in fact support this claim, reinforced by the city's [[Thai language|Thai]] ({{lang|th|\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e19\u0e4c}}) and Khmer ({{lang|km|\u179c\u17c0\u1784\u1785\u1793\u17d2\u1791\u1793\u17cd}}) names both retaining the etymological spelling, which indicates \"city of sandalwood\".\n\nThe [[Roman alphabet|Romanised]] spelling ''Vientiane'' is of [[French language|French]] origin, and reflects the difficulty the French had in pronouncing the {{IPAslink|t\u0255}} sound in the Lao language.{{Original research inline|date=June 2019}} A common English-based spelling is 'Viangchan',<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|encyclopedia=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|title=Definition of 'Viangchan'|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/viangchan|access-date=11 June 2019|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=[[Glasgow]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611151032/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/viangchan|archive-date=11 June 2016|url-status=live|quote=Viangchan in British.

Thattaradtha founded a city called ''Maha Thani Si Phan Phao'' on the western banks of the [[Mekong|Mekong River]]; this city was said to have later become today's [[Udon Thani]], [[Thailand]]. One day, a seven-headed [[Naga (mythology)|Naga]] told Thattaradtha to start a new city on the east bank of the river opposite ''Maha Thani Si Phan Phao''. The prince called this city ''Chanthabuly Si Sattanakhanahud''; which was said to be the predecessor of modern Vientiane.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nContrary to the Phra Lak Phra Lam, most historians believe Vientiane was an early [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] settlement centered around a [[Hindu]] temple, which the Pha That Luang would later replace. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the time when the [[Lao people|Lao]] and [[Thai people]] are believed to have entered [[Southeast Asia]] from [[Southern China]], the few remaining Khmers in the area were either killed, removed, or assimilated into the Lao civilization, which would soon overtake the area.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn 1354, when [[Fa Ngum]] founded the kingdom of [[Lan Xang]].<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coed\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George Coed\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

In 1779, it was conquered by the Siamese general Phraya [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Chakri]] and made a vassal of [[Thailand|Siam]].\n\nWhen King [[Anouvong]] raised an unsuccessful rebellion, it was obliterated by [[Thai people|Siamese]] armies in 1827. The city was burned to the ground and was looted of nearly all Laotian artifacts, including Buddha statues and people. Vientiane was in great disrepair, depopulated and disappearing into the forest, when the French arrived. It eventually passed to [[France|French]] rule in 1893. It became the capital of the French protectorate of Laos in 1899. The French rebuilt the city and rebuilt or repaired Buddhist temples such as [[Pha That Luang]], [[Haw Phra Kaew]], and left many colonial buildings behind. During French rule, the Vietnamese were encouraged to migrate to Laos, which resulted in 53% of the population of Vientiane being Vietnamese in the year of 1943.<ref name=\"MartinStuart-FoxA\">Stuart-Fox, Martin (1997).

In August 1960, [[Kong Le]] seized the capital and insisted that [[Souvanna Phouma]] become prime minister. In mid-December, [[Phoumi Nosavan]] then seized the capital, overthrew the Phouma Government, and installed [[Boun Oum]] as prime minister. In mid-1975, Pathet Lao troops moved towards the city and Americans began evacuating the capital. On 23 August 1975, a contingent of 50 Pathet Lao women symbolically liberated the city.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> On 2 December 1975, the [[communist party]] of the [[Pathet Lao]] took over Vientiane, defeated the [[Kingdom of Laos]], and renamed the country the Lao People's Democratic Republic, which ended the [[Laotian Civil War]]. The next day, an [[Insurgency in Laos]] began in the jungle, with the Pathet Lao fighting factions of Hmong and royalists.\n\nVientiane was the host of the incident-free [[2009 Southeast Asian Games]]. Eighteen competitions were dropped from the previous games held in Thailand, due to Laos' landlocked borders and the lack of adequate facilities in Vientiane.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Geography and climate==\n===Geography===\nVientiane is on a bend of the [[Mekong]] River, at which point it forms the border with [[Thailand]].\n\n===Climate===\nVientiane features a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'') with a distinct [[wet season]] and a [[dry season]].
