Barter was a system of trading commonly practiced throughout the world and adopted by the Philippines.  The inconvenience of the barter system led to the adoption of a specific medium of exchange \u2013 the cowry shells.  Cowries produced in gold, jade, quartz and wood became the most common and acceptable form of money through many centuries.\n\nThe Philippines is naturally rich in gold, making possible the availability of local gold coinage called [[piloncitos]]. The original silver currency unit was the rupee or rupiah (known locally as salapi), brought over by trade with India and Indonesia. The salapi continued under Spanish rule as a teston worth four reales or half a Spanish peso.\n\n==Archaic period (c .900 AD-1521)==\n===Piloncitos===\n[[Image:Manila Mint Museum, PI Piloncitos.jpg|thumb|A collection of [[Piloncitos]] in Manila Mint Museum.]]\n[[Piloncitos]] were used in [[Kingdom of Tondo]], [[Namayan]] and [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] in present-day [[Philippines]]. Piloncitos are tiny engraved bead-like [[gold]] bits unearthed in the Philippines. They are the first recognized coinage in the Philippines circulated between the 9th and 12th centuries. They emerged when increasing trade made barter inconvenient.\n\nPiloncitos are so small\u2014some are of the size of a corn kernel\u2014and weigh from 0.09 to 2.65 grams of fine gold. Large Piloncitos weigh almost 1 [[mace (unit)|mace]], or 1/10th of a [[tael]]. Piloncitos have been excavated from [[Mandaluyong]], [[Bataan]], the banks of the [[Pasig River]], [[Batangas]], [[Marinduque]], [[Samar]], [[Leyte]] and some areas in [[Mindanao]]. They have been found in large numbers in [[Indonesia]]n archeological sites leading to questions of origin. Were Piloncitos made in the [[Philippines]] or imported? That gold was mined and worked here is evidenced by many [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] accounts, like one in 1586 that said:\n\n{{Quote|\u201cThe people of this island ([[Luzon]]) are Hindu and very skillful in their handling of gold. They weigh it with the greatest skill and delicacy that have ever been seen. The first thing they teach their children is the knowledge of gold and the weights with which they weigh it, for there is no other money among them.\u201d<ref>http://opinion.inquirer.net/10991/%E2%80%98piloncitos%E2%80%99-and-the-%E2%80%98philippine-golden-age%E2%80%99</ref>}}\n\n===Barter rings===\n[[File:Piloncitos ang gold rings.jpg|thumb|The gold currencies: (upper part) the Piloncitos and the [[Barter rings]] (lower part).]]\nThe early Filipinos also traded  along with the [[Barter rings]], which is gold ring-like [[ingot]]s. These barter rings are bigger than a doughnut in size and are made of nearly pure gold.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.ph/permanenttraveling.php?page=classicalgoldwork |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215062936/http://www.metmuseum.ph/permanenttraveling.php?page=classicalgoldwork |archive-date=2012-12-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Spanish era (1521-1898) ==\n[[Image:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|thumb|Silver [[Columnarios|columnario]] peso imported from Spanish Latin America 1726\u20131770.]]\n[[File:doubloon.jpg|thumb|right|Spanish gold onza or 8 [[escudo]] coin imported from Spanish Latin America and valued at 16 silver pesos.]]\n[[Image:PHL - 50 centimos alfonso xii.jpg|thumb| Silver 50-centimo coin issued 1864 until the 1890s]]\n\nThe Spanish silver peso worth eight reales was first introduced by the [[Ferdinand Magellan#Voyage of circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] of 1521 and brought in large quantities by the [[Manila galleon|Manila galleons]] after the 1565 conquest of the Philippines. See [[Spanish dollar]]. The local salapi continued under Spanish rule as a half-peso coin. Additionally, Spanish gold onzas or eight-[[escudo]] coins were also introduced with identical weight to the [[Spanish dollar]] but valued at 16 silver pesos.\n\n=== Silver Cobs and Columnarios ===\n\nThe earliest silver coins brought in by the galleons from Mexico and other Spanish colonies were in the form of roughly-cut cobs or macuquinas. These coins usually bore a cross on one side and the Spanish royal coat-of-arms on the other. Locals called these crudely-made coins \"hilis-[[kalamay]]\" due to its resemblance to flattened rice cakes. These were replaced starting 1726 by machine-minted coins called [[Columnarios]] (pillar dollars) or dos mundos (two worlds) containing 27.07 grams of 0.917 fine silver (revised to 0.903 fine in 1771).\n\nThese pillar dollars circulated extensively not only in the Philippines but all over the world in the 18th and 19th centuries due to its beauty of design, consistency of weight and fineness, universal recognition among merchants worldwide, and a serrated edge which prevented the clipping away of the precious metal. From the same Spanish peso or dollar is derived the various pesos of Latin America, the dollars of the US and Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen.\n\n=== Fractional currency and Cuartos ===\n\nSilver coins were minted in denominations of 8 real ($1) and 4, 2, 1 and 1/2 real. Gold coins came in denominations of 8 escudos ($16) and 4, 2, 1 and 1/2 escudos. Small change was also made by cutting a whole $1 coin, most commonly into eight wedges each worth one [[Spanish real]].\n\nLocally produced crude copper or bronze coins called cuartos or barrillas were also struck in the Philippines by order of the Spanish government. From this came the Filipino words \u201ckwarta\u201d (synonymous to money in general) and \u201cbarya\u201d (small change). In 1837 an order was issued that 20 such cuartos be counted as one real (hence, 160 cuartos to a peso).\n\nThe discontinuation in the 19th century of officially minted copper cuartos was alleviated in part by counterfeit two-cuarto coins (worth 80 to a peso) made by Igorot copper miners in the Cordilleras and accepted in circulation by the rest of the country. <ref>{{cite web|title=US Philippine Coins|url= http://www.bohol.ph/article111.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Stamped Philippine Currency ===\n\nIn the early part of the 19th century, most of the Spanish colonies in Central and South America revolted and declared independence from Spain.  They issued silver coins bearing revolutionary slogans and symbols which reached the Philippines.  The Spanish government officials in the islands were fearful that the seditious markings would incite Filipinos to rebellion.  Thus they removed the inscriptions by counter stamping the coins with the word F7 or YII. <ref>{{cite web|title=Spanish Philippine Coins|url= http://www.bohol.ph/article110.html}}</ref>\n\nA currency system derived from coins imported from Spain, China and neighboring countries was fraught with various difficulties. Money came in different coinages, and fractional currency in addition to the real and the cuarto also existed. Peso coins with Spanish or Mexican designs are also easily imported and exported overseas, occasionally emptying government and private coffers. Money has nearly always been scarce in Manila, and when it was abundant it was shipped to the provinces. An 1857 decree requiring the keeping of accounts in pesos and centimos (worth 1/100th of a peso) was of little help to the situation given the existence of copper cuartos worth 160 to a peso.\n\n=== Philippine Gold / Silver Bimetallic Standard in the 19th Century ===\n\nThe Spanish gold onza (or 8-[[escudo]] coin) was of identical weight to the [[Spanish dollar]] but was officially valued at 16 silver pesos, thus putting the peso on a [[Bimetallism|bimetallic]] standard with a gold/silver ratio of 16. Its divergence with the value of gold in international trade featured prominently in the continued monetary crises of the 19th century.\n\nThe [[California gold rush]] of 1848-1855 meant the gold onza, officially valued at 16 pesos, fetched only about 15 pesos internationally, and it in fact suffered as much as a 33% discount when paid to Chinese merchants who consistently count in silver pesos. As the Spanish government continued to receive these gold onzas as 16 pesos, there eventually came a time when silver pesos became scarce and only gold 16-peso coins remained in circulation.\n\nIn order to remedy this damage in the monetary situation, Queen Isabella II issued a decree in 1857 ordering the founding of the Casa de Moneda de Manila in the Philippines in order to coin gold 1, 2 and 4 peso coins according to Spanish standards (the 4-peso coin being 6.766 grams of 0.875 gold). The first gold coins were minted in 1861. In the same year a royal decree ordered the minting of 50, 20 and 10 centimo silver coins out of Latin American coins also according to Spanish standards (with 100 centimos containing 25.98 grams of 0.900 silver). The price of silver has since gone down and the first silver coins were minted in 1864.\n\nThe relative abundance of gold in the Philippines then came to an end with the adoption of the gold standard in most of Europe after 1871 and the subsequent climb in the international gold/silver ratio above 16.<ref>{{cite web|title= Destabilizing the Global Monetary System: Germany\u2019s Adoption of the Gold Standard |url= https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/02/15/Destabilizing-the-Global-Monetary-System-Germanys-Adoption-of-the-Gold-Standard-in-the-Early-46548}}</ref> It was further aggravated by an 1876 decree confirming the [[Mexican peso]] as legal tender in the Philippines and exchangeable with the gold onza for 16 pesos. The climb in the gold onza's overseas value above 16 pesos soon made importing Mexican dollars in exchange for gold coins a profitable venture. While the Governor General attempted in 1877 to stem the outflow of gold by limiting the legal tender status of Mexican silver, by 1884 gold coin had entirely disappeared.\n\nThe 19th century therefore ended with the [[Philippine peso]] still officially on a bimetallic standard equal to either the silver [[Mexican peso]] (weighing 27.07 grams 0.903 fine, or 0.786 troy ounce XAG) or 1/16th the gold onza (weighing 1.6915 gram 0.875 fine, or 0.0476 troy ounce XAU). The gold peso, however, has since increased in value to approx. two silver pesos. Furthermore, the fineness of Philippine fractional silver coins was reduced from 0.900 to 0.835 and worsened the quality of the local currency, and the introduction of Alfonsino silver coins in 1897 did little to improve the peso's exchange value. Such Mexican and Spanish-Filipino coins remained in circulation until they were demonetized after the introduction of the new US-Philippine peso in 1903.\n\n=== Peso Fuerte Banknotes ===\n\nThe first paper money circulated in the Philippines was the [[Philippine peso fuerte]] issued in 1851 by the country's first bank, the El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino de Isabel II. Being bimetallic and convertible to either silver pesos or gold onzas, its volume of 1,800,000 pesos was small relative to about 40,000,000 silver pesos in circulation at the end of the 19th century.\n\n===Sulu coins===\nThe [[Sultanate of Sulu]] in the southernmost islands engaged actively in barter trade with the Arabs, [[Han people|Han Chinese]], [[Borneo|Bornean]], [[Molucas|Moluccan]], and British traders. The Sultans issued coins of their own as early as the 5th century. Coins of Sultan Azimud Din  that exist today are of base metal Tin, [[Silver]] and [[alloy]] bearing [[Jawi script|Arabic]] inscriptions and dated 1148 AH corresponding to the year 1735 in the Christian era.\n\n==First Philippine Republic (Revolutionary period 1898-1901)==\n[[File:Un Peso Republica Filipina.jpg|thumb|The one [[Philippine Peso|Peso]] note of the [[First Philippine Republic]].]]\nAsserting its independence after the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] on June 12, 1898, the ''Rep\u00fablica Filipina'' (Philippine Republic) under General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] issued its own coins and paper currency backed by the country's natural resources. The coins were the first to use the name ''centavo'' for the subdivision of the peso. The island of [[Panay]] also issued revolutionary coinage. After Aguinaldo's capture by American forces in [[Palanan, Isabela]] on March 23, 1901, the revolutionary peso ceased to exist.\n\n==American colonial Period (1901-1945)==\n[[File:Filipinas (PI) 50 Centavos Silver Coin 1918 (s).jpg|thumb|US Administration 50 centavos silver coin minted in San Francisco in 1918.]]\nAfter the United States took control of the Philippines, the [[United States Congress]] passed the Philippine Coinage Act of 1903, established the unit of currency to be a theoretical gold peso (not coined) consisting of 12.9 grains of gold 0.900 fine (0.0241875 XAU), equivalent to \u20b12,640 as of 22 December 2010.<ref>[http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?Amount=0.0476&From=XAU&To=PHP&image.x=39&image.y=8 0.0241875 XAU = 2,640 PHP], [http://www.xe.com xe.com].</ref> This unit was equivalent to exactly half the value of a U.S. dollar.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edwin Walter Kemmerer|title=Modern Currency Reforms; A History and Discussion of Recent Currency Reforms in India, Porto Rico, Philippine Islands, Straits Settlements and Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04rsmTi52nQC|year=2008|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4086-8800-7|chapter=V.

The act also provided for the coinage of subsidiary and minor coins and for the issuance of silver certificates in denominations of not less than 2 nor more than 10 pesos (maximum denomination increased to 500 pesos in 1906).\n\nIt also provided for the creation of a gold-standard fund to maintain the parity of the coins so authorized to be issued and authorized the insular government to issue temporary certificates of indebtedness bearing interest at a rate not to exceed 4 per cent per annum, payable not more than one year from date of issue, to an amount which should not at any one time exceed 10 million dollars or 20 million pesos.\n\n==Commonwealth Period (1935-1946)==\n[[File:Phil1944fivecent.JPG|thumb|1944 Philippines five Centavo coin]]\nWhen the Philippines became a [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|United States Commonwealth]] in 1935, the [[Coat of arms of the Philippines|coat of arms of the Philippine Commonwealth]] were adopted and replaced the arms of the US Territories on the reverse  of coins while the obverse remained unchanged.

Barter was a system of trading commonly practiced throughout the world and adopted by the Philippines.  The inconvenience of the barter system led to the adoption of a specific medium of exchange \u2013 the cowry shells.  Cowries produced in gold, jade, quartz and wood became the most common and acceptable form of money through many centuries.\n\nThe Philippines is naturally rich in gold, making possible the availability of local gold coinage called [[piloncitos]]. The original silver currency unit was the rupee or rupiah (known locally as salapi), brought over by trade with India and Indonesia. The salapi continued under Spanish rule as a teston worth four reales or half a Spanish peso.\n\n==Archaic period (c .900 AD-1521)==\n===Piloncitos===\n[[Image:Manila Mint Museum, PI Piloncitos.jpg|thumb|A collection of [[Piloncitos]] in Manila Mint Museum.]]\n[[Piloncitos]] were used in [[Kingdom of Tondo]], [[Namayan]] and [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] in present-day [[Philippines]]. Piloncitos are tiny engraved bead-like [[gold]] bits unearthed in the Philippines. They are the first recognized coinage in the Philippines circulated between the 9th and 12th centuries. They emerged when increasing trade made barter inconvenient.\n\nPiloncitos are so small\u2014some are of the size of a corn kernel\u2014and weigh from 0.09 to 2.65 grams of fine gold. Large Piloncitos weigh almost 1 [[mace (unit)|mace]], or 1/10th of a [[tael]]. Piloncitos have been excavated from [[Mandaluyong]], [[Bataan]], the banks of the [[Pasig River]], [[Batangas]], [[Marinduque]], [[Samar]], [[Leyte]] and some areas in [[Mindanao]]. They have been found in large numbers in [[Indonesia]]n archeological sites leading to questions of origin. Were Piloncitos made in the [[Philippines]] or imported? That gold was mined and worked here is evidenced by many [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] accounts, like one in 1586 that said:\n\n{{Quote|\u201cThe people of this island ([[Luzon]]) are Hindu and very skillful in their handling of gold. They weigh it with the greatest skill and delicacy that have ever been seen. The first thing they teach their children is the knowledge of gold and the weights with which they weigh it, for there is no other money among them.\u201d<ref>http://opinion.inquirer.net/10991/%E2%80%98piloncitos%E2%80%99-and-the-%E2%80%98philippine-golden-age%E2%80%99</ref>}}\n\n===Barter rings===\n[[File:Piloncitos ang gold rings.jpg|thumb|The gold currencies: (upper part) the Piloncitos and the [[Barter rings]] (lower part).]]\nThe early Filipinos also traded  along with the [[Barter rings]], which is gold ring-like [[ingot]]s.

See [[Spanish dollar]]. The local salapi continued under Spanish rule as a half-peso coin. Additionally, Spanish gold onzas or eight-[[escudo]] coins were also introduced with identical weight to the [[Spanish dollar]] but valued at 16 silver pesos.\n\n=== Silver Cobs and Columnarios ===\n\nThe earliest silver coins brought in by the galleons from Mexico and other Spanish colonies were in the form of roughly-cut cobs or macuquinas. These coins usually bore a cross on one side and the Spanish royal coat-of-arms on the other. Locals called these crudely-made coins \"hilis-[[kalamay]]\" due to its resemblance to flattened rice cakes. These were replaced starting 1726 by machine-minted coins called [[Columnarios]] (pillar dollars) or dos mundos (two worlds) containing 27.07 grams of 0.917 fine silver (revised to 0.903 fine in 1771).\n\nThese pillar dollars circulated extensively not only in the Philippines but all over the world in the 18th and 19th centuries due to its beauty of design, consistency of weight and fineness, universal recognition among merchants worldwide, and a serrated edge which prevented the clipping away of the precious metal. From the same Spanish peso or dollar is derived the various pesos of Latin America, the dollars of the US and Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen.\n\n=== Fractional currency and Cuartos ===\n\nSilver coins were minted in denominations of 8 real ($1) and 4, 2, 1 and 1/2 real. Gold coins came in denominations of 8 escudos ($16) and 4, 2, 1 and 1/2 escudos. Small change was also made by cutting a whole $1 coin, most commonly into eight wedges each worth one [[Spanish real]].\n\nLocally produced crude copper or bronze coins called cuartos or barrillas were also struck in the Philippines by order of the Spanish government. From this came the Filipino words \u201ckwarta\u201d (synonymous to money in general) and \u201cbarya\u201d (small change). In 1837 an order was issued that 20 such cuartos be counted as one real (hence, 160 cuartos to a peso).\n\nThe discontinuation in the 19th century of officially minted copper cuartos was alleviated in part by counterfeit two-cuarto coins (worth 80 to a peso) made by Igorot copper miners in the Cordilleras and accepted in circulation by the rest of the country. <ref>{{cite web|title=US Philippine Coins|url= http://www.bohol.ph/article111.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Stamped Philippine Currency ===\n\nIn the early part of the 19th century, most of the Spanish colonies in Central and South America revolted and declared independence from Spain.  They issued silver coins bearing revolutionary slogans and symbols which reached the Philippines.  The Spanish government officials in the islands were fearful that the seditious markings would incite Filipinos to rebellion.  Thus they removed the inscriptions by counter stamping the coins with the word F7 or YII. <ref>{{cite web|title=Spanish Philippine Coins|url= http://www.bohol.ph/article110.html}}</ref>\n\nA currency system derived from coins imported from Spain, China and neighboring countries was fraught with various difficulties. Money came in different coinages, and fractional currency in addition to the real and the cuarto also existed. Peso coins with Spanish or Mexican designs are also easily imported and exported overseas, occasionally emptying government and private coffers. Money has nearly always been scarce in Manila, and when it was abundant it was shipped to the provinces. An 1857 decree requiring the keeping of accounts in pesos and centimos (worth 1/100th of a peso) was of little help to the situation given the existence of copper cuartos worth 160 to a peso.\n\n=== Philippine Gold / Silver Bimetallic Standard in the 19th Century ===\n\nThe Spanish gold onza (or 8-[[escudo]] coin) was of identical weight to the [[Spanish dollar]] but was officially valued at 16 silver pesos, thus putting the peso on a [[Bimetallism|bimetallic]] standard with a gold/silver ratio of 16. Its divergence with the value of gold in international trade featured prominently in the continued monetary crises of the 19th century.\n\nThe [[California gold rush]] of 1848-1855 meant the gold onza, officially valued at 16 pesos, fetched only about 15 pesos internationally, and it in fact suffered as much as a 33% discount when paid to Chinese merchants who consistently count in silver pesos. As the Spanish government continued to receive these gold onzas as 16 pesos, there eventually came a time when silver pesos became scarce and only gold 16-peso coins remained in circulation.\n\nIn order to remedy this damage in the monetary situation, Queen Isabella II issued a decree in 1857 ordering the founding of the Casa de Moneda de Manila in the Philippines in order to coin gold 1, 2 and 4 peso coins according to Spanish standards (the 4-peso coin being 6.766 grams of 0.875 gold). The first gold coins were minted in 1861. In the same year a royal decree ordered the minting of 50, 20 and 10 centimo silver coins out of Latin American coins also according to Spanish standards (with 100 centimos containing 25.98 grams of 0.900 silver). The price of silver has since gone down and the first silver coins were minted in 1864.\n\nThe relative abundance of gold in the Philippines then came to an end with the adoption of the gold standard in most of Europe after 1871 and the subsequent climb in the international gold/silver ratio above 16.<ref>{{cite web|title= Destabilizing the Global Monetary System: Germany\u2019s Adoption of the Gold Standard |url= https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/02/15/Destabilizing-the-Global-Monetary-System-Germanys-Adoption-of-the-Gold-Standard-in-the-Early-46548}}</ref> It was further aggravated by an 1876 decree confirming the [[Mexican peso]] as legal tender in the Philippines and exchangeable with the gold onza for 16 pesos. The climb in the gold onza\u2019s overseas value above 16 pesos soon made importing Mexican dollars in exchange for gold coins a profitable venture. While the Governor General attempted in 1877 to stem the outflow of gold by limiting the legal tender status of Mexican silver, by 1884 gold coin had entirely disappeared.\n\nThe 19th century therefore ended with the [[Philippine peso]] still officially on a bimetallic standard equal to either the silver [[Mexican peso]] (weighing 27.07 grams 0.903 fine, or 0.786 troy ounce XAG) or 1/16th the gold onza (weighing 1.6915 gram 0.875 fine, or 0.0476 troy ounce XAU). The gold peso, however, has since increased in value to approx. two silver pesos. Furthermore, the fineness of Philippine fractional silver coins was reduced from 0.900 to 0.835 and worsened the quality of the local currency, and the introduction of Alfonsino silver coins in 1897 did little to improve the peso\u2019s exchange value. Such Mexican and Spanish-Filipino coins remained in circulation until they were demonetized after the introduction of the new US-Philippine peso in 1903.\n\n=== Peso Fuerte Banknotes ===\n\nThe first paper money circulated in the Philippines was the [[Philippine peso fuerte]] issued in 1851 by the country\u2019s first bank, the El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino de Isabel II. Being bimetallic and convertible to either silver pesos or gold onzas, its volume of 1,800,000 pesos was small relative to about 40,000,000 silver pesos in circulation at the end of the 19th century.\n\n===Sulu coins===\nThe [[Sultanate of Sulu]] in the southernmost islands engaged actively in barter trade with the Arabs, [[Han people|Han Chinese]], [[Borneo|Bornean]], [[Molucas|Moluccan]], and British traders. The Sultans issued coins of their own as early as the 5th century. Coins of Sultan Azimud Din  that exist today are of base metal Tin, [[Silver]] and [[alloy]] bearing [[Jawi script|Arabic]] inscriptions and dated 1148 AH corresponding to the year 1735 in the Christian era.\n\n==First Philippine Republic (Revolutionary period 1898-1901)==\n[[File:Un Peso Republica Filipina.jpg|thumb|The one [[Philippine Peso|Peso]] note of the [[First Philippine Republic]].]]\nAsserting its independence after the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] on June 12, 1898, the ''Rep\u00fablica Filipina'' (Philippine Republic) under General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] issued its own coins and paper currency backed by the country\u2019s natural resources. The coins were the first to use the name ''centavo'' for the subdivision of the peso. The island of [[Panay]] also issued revolutionary coinage. After Aguinaldo's capture by American forces in [[Palanan, Isabela]] on March 23, 1901, the revolutionary peso ceased to exist.\n\n==American colonial Period (1901-1945)==\n[[File:Filipinas (PI) 50 Centavos Silver Coin 1918 (s).jpg|thumb|US Administration 50 centavos silver coin minted in San Francisco in 1918.]]\nAfter the United States took control of the Philippines, the [[United States Congress]] passed the Philippine Coinage Act of 1903, established the unit of currency to be a theoretical gold peso (not coined) consisting of 12.9 grains of gold 0.900 fine (0.0241875 XAU), equivalent to \u20b12,640 as of 22 December 2010.<ref>[http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?Amount=0.0476&From=XAU&To=PHP&image.x=39&image.y=8 0.0241875 XAU = 2,640 PHP], [http://www.xe.com xe.com].</ref> This unit was equivalent to exactly half the value of a U.S. dollar.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edwin Walter Kemmerer|title=Modern Currency Reforms; A History and Discussion of Recent Currency Reforms in India, Porto Rico, Philippine Islands, Straits Settlements and Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04rsmTi52nQC|year=2008|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4086-8800-7|chapter=V.

Its peg of \u20b12 to the US dollar was maintained until independence in 1946.\n\nThe act provided for the coinage and issuance of Philippine silver pesos substantially of the weight and fineness as the Mexican peso, which should be of the value of 50 cents gold and redeemable in gold at the insular treasury, and which was intended to be the sole circulating medium among the people. The act also provided for the coinage of subsidiary and minor coins and for the issuance of silver certificates in denominations of not less than 2 nor more than 10 pesos (maximum denomination increased to 500 pesos in 1906).\n\nIt also provided for the creation of a gold-standard fund to maintain the parity of the coins so authorized to be issued and authorized the insular government to issue temporary certificates of indebtedness bearing interest at a rate not to exceed 4 per cent per annum, payable not more than one year from date of issue, to an amount which should not at any one time exceed 10 million dollars or 20 million pesos.\n\n==Commonwealth Period (1935-1946)==\n[[File:Phil1944fivecent.JPG|thumb|1944 Philippines five Centavo coin]]\nWhen the Philippines became a [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|United States Commonwealth]] in 1935, the [[Coat of arms of the Philippines|coat of arms of the Philippine Commonwealth]] were adopted and replaced the arms of the US Territories on the reverse  of coins while the obverse remained unchanged. This seal is composed of a much smaller eagle with its wings pointed up, perched over a shield with peaked corners, above a scroll reading \"Commonwealth of the Philippines\". It is a much busier pattern, and widely considered less attractive.\n\n===The \"Mickey Mouse money\" (Fiat peso)===\n[[File:PHI-114-Japanese Government (Philippines)-500 Pesos (1944).jpg|thumb|The peso issued by the Japanese government nicknamed as \"The [[Mickey Mouse]] money]].\nDuring [[World War II]] in the [[Philippines]], the occupying Japanese government-issued [[fiat currency]] in several denominations; this is known as the ''Japanese government-issued Philippine fiat peso'' (see also [[Japanese invasion money]]).

Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of [[regional lockout]] prevent the different cartridges from being compatible with one another.\n\nThe SNES is Nintendo's second programmable home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|a variety of enhancement chips]] integrated in [[ROM cartridge|game cartridges]] to be competitive into the next generation.\n\nThe SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in North America and Europe. Overlapping the NES's 61.9 million unit sales, the SNES remained popular well into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|32-bit era]], with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003. It continues to be popular among collectors and [[Retrogaming|retro gamers]], with new [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] games and Nintendo's emulated rereleases, such as on the [[Virtual Console]], the [[Super NES Classic Edition]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Super NES designs.png|thumb|Early concept designs for the SNES, referred to as the \"Nintendo Entertainment System 2\"]]\nTo compete with the popular [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan, [[NEC Corporation|NEC Home Electronics]] launched the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] in 1987, and [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the [[Third generation of video game consoles\n|8-bit]] NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful.<ref>[[#CITEREFSheff1993|Sheff (1993)]], pp. 353\u2013356. \"The Genesis continued to flounder through its first couple of years on the market, although Sega showed Sisyphean resolve....

North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref name=\"palconverter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/07/soapbox_why_region_locking_is_a_total_non_issue|title=Soapbox: Why Region Locking Is A Total Non-Issue|author=Nintendo Life|work=Nintendo Life}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-the-ultimate-console-collectors-guide|title=The Ultimate Retro Console Collectors' Guide|date=May 6, 2012|work=Eurogamer.net}}</ref>\n\nInternally, a regional [[lockout chip]] ([[CIC (Nintendo)|CIC]]) within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip. This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console; hardware in later games can detect this situation, so it later became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the SNES/Super Famicom \"Lockout Chip\"|accessdate= April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=December 27, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121165526/http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |archivedate=January 21, 2003}}</ref>\n\nPAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges: the [[NTSC]] video standard specifies video at 60&nbsp;Hz while [[PAL]] operates at 50&nbsp;Hz, resulting in approximately 16.7% slower framerate. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in [[letterbox]]ing of the output image.<ref name=\"palconverter\" /> Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and, therefore, can be played in NTSC systems without issue, while other games will face a 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60&nbsp;Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions. Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run, requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes.<ref name=\"SNES-pal-switch\">{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt\n|title=Super NES/Super Famicom 50/60\u00a0Hz Switch Modification |accessdate=April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=January 25, 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010502190046/http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt |archivedate=May 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\n=== Casing ===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|[[File:Nintendo-Super-Famicom-Set-FL.jpg|none|135px|Original Japanese SFC]]\n|[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|none|145px|Original U.S. SNES]]\n|[[File:Wikipedia SNES PAL.jpg|none|120px|Original PAL SNES]]\n|[[File:SNES-Model-2-Set.jpg|none|135px|New-Style Super NES]]\n|[[File:SuperFamicom jr.jpg|none|110px|Super Famicom Jr.]]\n|[[File:Hyundai Super Comboy - Main Body.jpg|none|110px|Super Comboy]]\n|[[File:Nintendo Super System controller.jpg|none|110px|Nintendo Super System controller]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-001 model<br />(1990\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>North American SNS-001 model<br />(1991\u20131997)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>PAL-region SNSP-001A model<br />(1992\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>[[New-Style Super NES]] SNS-101<br />(1997\u20131999)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-101 model<br />(1998\u20132003)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>South Korean SNSN-001 model</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Nintendo Super System controller</small>\n|}</center>\nAll versions of the Super NES are predominantly gray, of slightly different shades.

Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of [[regional lockout]] prevent the different cartridges from being compatible with one another.\n\nThe SNES is Nintendo's second programmable home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|a variety of enhancement chips]] integrated in [[ROM cartridge|game cartridges]] to be competitive into the next generation.\n\nThe SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in North America and Europe. Overlapping the NES's 61.9 million unit sales, the SNES remained popular well into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|32-bit era]], with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003. It continues to be popular among collectors and [[Retrogaming|retro gamers]], with new [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] games and Nintendo's emulated rereleases, such as on the [[Virtual Console]], the [[Super NES Classic Edition]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Super NES designs.png|thumb|Early concept designs for the SNES, referred to as the \"Nintendo Entertainment System 2\"]]\nTo compete with the popular [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan, [[NEC Corporation|NEC Home Electronics]] launched the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] in 1987, and [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the [[Third generation of video game consoles\n|8-bit]] NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful.<ref>[[#CITEREFSheff1993|Sheff (1993)]], pp. 353\u2013356. \"The Genesis continued to flounder through its first couple of years on the market, although Sega showed Sisyphean resolve....

North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref name=\"palconverter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/07/soapbox_why_region_locking_is_a_total_non_issue|title=Soapbox: Why Region Locking Is A Total Non-Issue|author=Nintendo Life|work=Nintendo Life}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-the-ultimate-console-collectors-guide|title=The Ultimate Retro Console Collectors' Guide|date=May 6, 2012|work=Eurogamer.net}}</ref>\n\nInternally, a regional [[lockout chip]] ([[CIC (Nintendo)|CIC]]) within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip. This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console; hardware in later games can detect this situation, so it later became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the SNES/Super Famicom \"Lockout Chip\"|accessdate= April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=December 27, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121165526/http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |archivedate=January 21, 2003}}</ref>\n\nPAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges: the [[NTSC]] video standard specifies video at 60&nbsp;Hz while [[PAL]] operates at 50&nbsp;Hz, resulting in approximately 16.7% slower framerate. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in [[letterbox]]ing of the output image.<ref name=\"palconverter\" /> Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and, therefore, can be played in NTSC systems without issue, while other games will face a 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60&nbsp;Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions. Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run, requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes.<ref name=\"SNES-pal-switch\">{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt\n|title=Super NES/Super Famicom 50/60\u00a0Hz Switch Modification |accessdate=April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=January 25, 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010502190046/http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt |archivedate=May 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\n=== Casing ===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|[[File:Nintendo-Super-Famicom-Set-FL.jpg|none|135px|Original Japanese SFC]]\n|[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|none|145px|Original U.S. SNES]]\n|[[File:Wikipedia SNES PAL.jpg|none|120px|Original PAL SNES]]\n|[[File:SNES-Model-2-Set.jpg|none|135px|New-Style Super NES]]\n|[[File:SuperFamicom jr.jpg|none|110px|Super Famicom Jr.]]\n|[[File:Hyundai Super Comboy - Main Body.jpg|none|110px|Super Comboy]]\n|[[File:Nintendo Super System controller.jpg|none|110px|Nintendo Super System controller]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-001 model<br />(1990\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>North American SNS-001 model<br />(1991\u20131997)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>PAL-region SNSP-001A model<br />(1992\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>[[New-Style Super NES]] SNS-101<br />(1997\u20131999)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-101 model<br />(1998\u20132003)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>South Korean SNSN-001 model</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Nintendo Super System controller</small>\n|}</center>\nAll versions of the Super NES are predominantly gray, of slightly different shades.

{"title_page": "List of Sony A-mount lenses", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nSony has released the following ''SAL'' (for: ''S''ony ''A''-mount ''L''ens) lenses for [[Sony A-mount]] cameras since 2006. 18 of the original designs are based on [[Minolta A-mount]] technology it acquired from [[Konica Minolta]]. Of those, most lenses are optically, mechanically and electrically identical to their Minolta predecessors and differ only in their outer appearance. However, three of them have also seen subtle changes in the optics<!-- SAL-35F14G, SAL-50F14 --> and electro-mechanics<!-- SAL-35F14G, SAL-50F14, SAL-135F28 --> (as indicated). Some of the new lenses introduced into the line have been developed in cooperation with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]] (as indicated).\n\nAll Sony A-mount lenses are fully compatible with [[Konica Minolta A-mount]] cameras. All full-frame Sony A-mount lenses are also compatible with Minolta A-mount cameras, with the exception that SSM and SAM lenses can only be used with manual focusing (with [[electronic focus assist]]) on camera bodies not supporting SSM already. All Minolta A-mount lenses are also compatible with all Sony A-mount cameras, but features like [[electronic first curtain shutter]] (EFCS) and AF-D provided by newer cameras are not officially supported in conjunction with these lenses and may work unreliable or not at all. The same holds true for Konica Minolta A-mount lenses, however, they can be used on [[APS-C]]/[[Super-35mm]] format Sony A-mount cameras only (using them on Sony full-frame cameras will cause the image to be auto-cropped).\n\nUsing the Sony lens adapters [[Sony LA-EA1|LA-EA1]], [[Sony LA-EA2|LA-EA2]], [[Sony LA-EA3|LA-EA3]] or [[Sony LA-EA4|LA-EA4]], A-mount lenses can also be used seamlessly on [[Sony E-mount|E-mount]] cameras, however, various format and autofocus restrictions apply depending on the adapter and camera used. LA-EA1 and LA-EA2 only support APS-C/Super-35mm format cameras, if you use them on full-frame cameras they will switch to APS-C mode by default. LA-EA1 and LA-EA3 support autofocus only with SSM and SAM lenses, whereas LA-EA2 and LA-EA4 utilize [[Single Lens Translucent|SLT]] technology to support autofocus with the other lenses as well.\n\nList of [[Sony A-mount]] lenses:\n<!-- Please don't change order \"primes\", \"zooms\", \"rear (tele) converters\", (\"front converters\", \"mount converters\") as there are unsortable

Of those, most lenses are optically, mechanically and electrically identical to their Minolta predecessors and differ only in their outer appearance. However, three of them have also seen subtle changes in the optics<!-- SAL-35F14G, SAL-50F14 --> and electro-mechanics<!-- SAL-35F14G, SAL-50F14, SAL-135F28 --> (as indicated). Some of the new lenses introduced into the line have been developed in cooperation with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]] (as indicated).\n\nAll Sony A-mount lenses are fully compatible with [[Konica Minolta A-mount]] cameras. All full-frame Sony A-mount lenses are also compatible with Minolta A-mount cameras, with the exception that SSM and SAM lenses can only be used with manual focusing (with [[electronic focus assist]]) on camera bodies not supporting SSM already. All Minolta A-mount lenses are also compatible with all Sony A-mount cameras, but features like [[electronic first curtain shutter]] (EFCS) and AF-D provided by newer cameras are not officially supported in conjunction with these lenses and may work unreliable or not at all. The same holds true for Konica Minolta A-mount lenses, however, they can be used on [[APS-C]]/[[Super-35mm]] format Sony A-mount cameras only (using them on Sony full-frame cameras will cause the image to be auto-cropped).\n\nUsing the Sony lens adapters [[Sony LA-EA1|LA-EA1]], [[Sony LA-EA2|LA-EA2]], [[Sony LA-EA3|LA-EA3]] or [[Sony LA-EA4|LA-EA4]], A-mount lenses can also be used seamlessly on [[Sony E-mount|E-mount]] cameras, however, various format and autofocus restrictions apply depending on the adapter and camera used. LA-EA1 and LA-EA2 only support APS-C/Super-35mm format cameras, if you use them on full-frame cameras they will switch to APS-C mode by default. LA-EA1 and LA-EA3 support autofocus only with SSM and SAM lenses, whereas LA-EA2 and LA-EA4 utilize [[Single Lens Translucent|SLT]] technology to support autofocus with the other lenses as well.\n\nList of [[Sony A-mount]] lenses:\n<!-- Please don't change order \"primes\", \"zooms\", \"rear (tele) converters\", (\"front converters\", \"mount converters\") as there are unsortable

For example, various [[Microsoft Office]] applications add shortcuts of their own:\n* {{keypress|Win|S}} to take a [[screenshot]] for OneNote; conflicts with {{keypress|Win|Shift|S}} on Windows 8.1.\n* {{keypress|Win|E}} to open a new side note in OneNote.\n* {{keypress|Win|Shift|N}} to open OneNote.\n* {{keypress|Win|Y}} to open [[Skype for Business]].  This shortcut also places the cursor directly on the search bar.  (Disabled in Skype for Business 2016)\n\n== Use with non-Microsoft operating systems ==\nThe Windows key can also be used on other operating systems.\n\nOn [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems, the key is usually given the [[X window system|X]] [[keysym]] \"[[Super key (keyboard button)|Super]]\" (on earlier versions \"[[Meta key|Meta]]\" was often used), and turns on the shift bit called '''MOD4'''. Most desktop environments use it much like Windows, with press+release popping up a primary menu similar to the Windows [[start menu]] ([[GNOME Shell]] bringing up the Activities Overview, [[Cinnamon (software)|Cinnamon]] pops up its main system menu), and with combinations with letters performing actions such as run-command, often with the shortcuts and actions copied from Windows. A common action that is not shared with Windows is for the key to allow dragging a window around from any location without raising it, and in the [[Compiz]] window manager it causes the scroll wheel to zoom in or out of any part of the desktop.\n\n[[macOS]] uses the Windows key as a replacement for the [[Command key|{{keypress|Command}}]]. This sometimes leads to placement issues for users used to Apple keyboards however, as Apple keyboards place the Command key where the Alt is on most keyboards (next to the Space bar). If Windows is installed on an Apple desktop or laptop then in Windows the Command key will function as the Windows key.\n\nOn [[Xbox 360]], pressing the Windows key performs the same action as the Guide button on [[Xbox 360 Controller]] or remote controls, opening the Xbox Guide. Holding down the Windows key and pressing M opens a pop up conversation window over gameplay, if an [[instant message]] conversation is in progress. On a [[PlayStation 3]] console, pressing the Windows key performs the same action as the PS Button on the [[Sixaxis|Sixaxis Controller]], opening the [[XrossMediaBar]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Windows key}}\n\n'''Microsoft Support page'''\n* [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts Keyboard shortcuts in Windows 7 and above]\n* [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/216893/how-to-enable-or-disable-the-keyboard-windows-key How to enable or disable the keyboard Windows key]\n\n{{Keyboard}}\n{{keyboard keys}}\n{{Microsoft Windows components}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Windows Key}}\n[[Category:Computer keys]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||the Windows product key|Microsoft Product Activation|the same [[keyboard key]] in [[macOS]]|Command key}}\n[[File:Touche Windows 8 10.jpg|thumb|The current Windows key (center) shipping with [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 8.1]], and [[Windows 10]].]]\n[[File:CtrlWindowsAlt.jpg|thumb|The previous Windows key (center) with an orb surrounding the center-anchored Windows logo used for [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]].

This shortcut also places the cursor directly on the search bar.  (Disabled in Skype for Business 2016)\n\n== Use with non-Microsoft operating systems ==\nThe Windows key can also be used on other operating systems.\n\nOn [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems, the key is usually given the [[X window system|X]] [[keysym]] \"[[Super key (keyboard button)|Super]]\" (on earlier versions \"[[Meta key|Meta]]\" was often used), and turns on the shift bit called '''MOD4'''. Most desktop environments use it much like Windows, with press+release popping up a primary menu similar to the Windows [[start menu]] ([[GNOME Shell]] bringing up the Activities Overview, [[Cinnamon (software)|Cinnamon]] pops up its main system menu), and with combinations with letters performing actions such as run-command, often with the shortcuts and actions copied from Windows. A common action that is not shared with Windows is for the key to allow dragging a window around from any location without raising it, and in the [[Compiz]] window manager it causes the scroll wheel to zoom in or out of any part of the desktop.\n\n[[macOS]] uses the Windows key as a replacement for the [[Command key|{{keypress|Command}}]]. This sometimes leads to placement issues for users used to Apple keyboards however, as Apple keyboards place the Command key where the Alt is on most keyboards (next to the Space bar). If Windows is installed on an Apple desktop or laptop then in Windows the Command key will function as the Windows key.\n\nOn [[Xbox 360]], pressing the Windows key performs the same action as the Guide button on [[Xbox 360 Controller]] or remote controls, opening the Xbox Guide. Holding down the Windows key and pressing M opens a pop up conversation window over gameplay, if an [[instant message]] conversation is in progress. On a [[PlayStation 3]] console, pressing the Windows key performs the same action as the PS Button on the [[Sixaxis|Sixaxis Controller]], opening the [[XrossMediaBar]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Windows key}}\n\n'''Microsoft Support page'''\n* [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts Keyboard shortcuts in Windows 7 and above]\n* [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/216893/how-to-enable-or-disable-the-keyboard-windows-key How to enable or disable the keyboard Windows key]\n\n{{Keyboard}}\n{{keyboard keys}}\n{{Microsoft Windows components}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Windows Key}}\n[[Category:Computer keys]]\n", "name_user": "Komsomolec 1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added Windows key press", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key"}

Most precipitation occurs in the warm season, with the least precipitation distinctly occurring in the cooler winter. As September is the peak of the north [[Atlantic hurricane season]] and tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally drop copious amounts of rainfall on the region, this month tends to be by far the wettest, averaging {{convert|3.6|in}} of precipitation. The driest month is March, with {{convert|0.7|in}} of precipitation.\n\nDespite frequent temperatures above {{convert|100|F}}, occasionally as early as February and as late as the end of October, the highest temperature ever recorded in Pharr is {{convert|110|F}}, once in 1998 and once in 1999. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Pharr is {{convert|13|F}}, on January 12, 1962, which is far lower than would be expected at the same latitude in Florida or on the west coast of North America, due to Pharr's location closer to the middle of the continent.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 1565\n|1930= 3225\n|1940= 4784\n|1950= 8690\n|1960= 14106\n|1970= 15829\n|1980= 21381\n|1990= 32921\n|2000= 46660\n|2010= 70400\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=79707\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there are 46,660 people, 12,798 households, and 10,878 families residing in the city.

The subject is thus built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and decision theory, and derives several key results for the application of [[decision making]] under uncertainty to the [[financial market]]s. The underlying economic logic distills to a \u201dfundamental valuation result\u201d,<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> as aside, which is developed in the following sections.\n\n===Present value, expectation and utility===\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of [[present value]] and [[Expected value|expectation]].<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>\n\nCalculating their present value allows the decision maker to aggregate the [[cashflow]]s (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future, to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is therefore the starting point for financial decision making. (Its history is correspondingly early: [[Richard Witt]] discusses [[compound interest]] in depth already in 1613, in his book \"Arithmeticall Questions\";<ref>C. Lewin (1970). [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf An early book on compound interest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163926/https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf |date=2016-12-21 }}, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</ref> further developed by [[Johan de Witt]] and [[Edmond Halley]].)\n\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the [[Expected value|expected value criterion]] which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, <math>X_{s}</math> and <math>p_{s}</math> respectively. (These ideas originate with [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1654.)\n\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider [[risk aversion]] (\"as any student of finance knows\"<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>). In other words, since individuals receive greater [[Utility#Economic definitions|utility]] from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is to therefore \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes (\"states\") correspondingly, <math>Y_{s}</math>. See [[Indifference price]]. (Some investors may in fact be [[risk seeking]] as opposed to [[Risk aversion|risk averse]], but the same logic would apply).\n\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]]. More formally, the resulting [[expected utility hypothesis]] states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective]] value associated with a gamble by an individual is ''that individual''{{'}}s [[Expected value|statistical expectation]] of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\n\nThe impetus for these ideas arise from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]; see also [[Ellsberg paradox]]. (The development here is originally due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, and later formalized by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1947.)\n\n===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|JEL classification codes\n|-\n|In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]], Financial Economics is one of the 19 primary classifications, at JEL: G.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\n\n[[Economic equilibrium]] is, in general, a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\n\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and are therefore not in equilibrium.<ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\"/> An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\nThe immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]], shows that where markets are as described \u2014and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) [[complete market|complete]]\u2014one may then make financial decisions by constructing a [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] corresponding to the market.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, <math>s</math>, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming [[Frictionless market|no friction]]): essentially [[System of linear equations|solving simultaneously]] for ''n'' (risk-neutral) probabilities, <math>q_{s}</math>, given ''n'' prices. The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\">Freddy Delbaen and Walter Schachermayer. (2004).

Notices of the AMS 51 (5): 526\u2013528</ref> For a simplified example see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}}, where the economy has only two possible states\u2014up and down\u2014and where <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math> (=<math>1-q_{up}</math>) are the two corresponding (i.e. implied) probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or [[probability measure|\"measure\"]].\n\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the riskless return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\",<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> i.e. a security-specific [[risk premium]], compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions and/or conditions.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> This approach is consistent with [[#Present value, expectation and utility|the above]], but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\n\nThus, continuing the example, in pricing a [[derivative (finance)|derivative instrument]] its forecasted cashflows in the up- and down-states, <math>X_{up}</math> and <math>X_{down}</math>, are multiplied through by <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math>, and are then [[present value|discounted]] at the risk-free interest rate; per equation above.  In pricing a \u201cfundamental\u201d, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with <math>Y</math> and <math>r</math> combined. In general, this may be derived by the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] (or extensions) as will be seen under [[#Uncertainty]]. \n\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the instrument as a combination of the [[underlying]] and a risk free \u201cbond\u201d; see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Delta hedging}} (and [[#Uncertainty]] below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such construction is of course not possible - the instrument being \"fundamental\" - and a premium is then required for risk.\n\n===State prices===\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model]] may be derived. This important result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a ''[[representative agent]]''.<ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/>\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally [[complete market]]s, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods. \n\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a [[state price]] security (also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security), a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a [[numeraire]] (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price <math>\\pi_{s}</math> of this particular state of the world.\n\nIn the above example, the state prices, <math>\\pi_{up}</math>,  <math>\\pi_{down}</math>would equate to the present values of <math>$q_{up}</math> and <math>$q_{down}</math>: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the [[state price vector]] is the vector of state prices for all states.\nApplied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [<math>\\pi_{up}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{up}</math> + <math>\\pi_{down}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{down}</math>]; the second formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a [[continuous random variable]] indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by [[integration (mathematics)|integrating]] over the state price \"density\". These concepts are extended to [[martingale pricing]] and the related [[risk-neutral measure]]. See also [[Stochastic discount factor]].\n\nState prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (\"[[contingent claim analysis]]\");<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> but can also be applied to valuation problems.<ref name=\"corp fin state prices\">See de Matos, as well as Bossaerts and \u00d8degaard, under bibliography.</ref> Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value \u2014 true in fact for \"every security\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/> \u2014  as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices.<ref name=\"Chance2\"/><ref name=\"corp fin state prices\"/> These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself. (Breeden and Litzenberger's work in 1978<ref>{{cite journal |title=Prices of State-Contingent Claims Implicit in Option Prices |first=Douglas T. |last=Breeden |first2=Robert H. |last2=Litzenberger |author2-link=Robert Litzenberger |journal=[[Journal of Business]] |volume=51 |issue=4 |year=1978 |pages=621\u2013651 |jstor=2352653 |doi=10.1086/296025}}</ref> established the use of state prices in financial economics.)\n\n==Resultant models==\n[[Image:MM2.png|thumb|right|Modigliani\u2013Miller Proposition II with risky debt.

As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\",<ref name=\"stanford1\"/><ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/> as will be seen below.\n* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.\n* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.\n* [[Option (finance)|Options]]: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.\n* [[Perfect information|Information]]: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with [[Future value|future monetary value]] (FMV).\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"[[deterministic]]\" and \"random\",<ref name=\"Luenberger\"/> or \"[[stochastic]]\".)\n\n===Certainty===\nThe starting point here is \u201cInvestment under certainty\". The [[Fisher separation theorem]], asserts that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. Related is the [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]], which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\n\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'', which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the intrinsic, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of [[dividend]]s. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. [[Net present value]] (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning.

In many treatments bond valuation precedes [[equity valuation]], under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" ''per se''.

As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see [[asset pricing]].\n\nBriefly, and intuitively\u2014and consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above\u2014the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows.<ref>\nFor a more formal treatment, see, for example: Eugene F. Fama. 1965. [http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/faj/1965/21/5 Random Walks in Stock Market Prices]. ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'', September/October 1965, Vol. 21, No. 5: 55\u201359.</ref> \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. ''efficient'', prices: the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See [[Earnings response coefficient]].)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information, are identical to the ''best guess of the future'': the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, but what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a [[normal distribution]]\u2014so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news:<ref name=\"Shiller\"/> the [[random walk hypothesis]]. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \n(The EMH was presented by [[Eugene Fama]] in a 1970 review paper,<ref>Fama, Eugene (1970). \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\".

The CAPM was derived by [[Jack L. Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962), [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently. )\n\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of [[option style|European-styled options]].\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a [[partial differential equation]] describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, [[geometric Brownian motion]] (see [[Brownian model of financial markets]]).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (<math>V</math>, the value, or price, of the option, grows at <math>r</math>, the risk-free rate).<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/>\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price\u2014in an arbitrage-free sense\u2014for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is [[Partial differential equation#Analytical solutions|the solution]] to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above.

As regards [[asset pricing]], developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under \"Portfolio theory\" below, while \"Derivative pricing\" relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing.  As regards the use of capital, \"Corporate finance theory\" relates, mainly, to the application of these models.\n\n===Portfolio theory===\n[[Image:Pareto Efficient Frontier for the Markowitz Portfolio selection problem..png|thumb|right|200px|Plot of two criteria when maximizing return and minimizing risk in financial portfolios (Pareto-optimal points in red)]]\n[[File:Four Correlations.png|thumb|right|alt=Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.|Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.]]\n:''See also: [[Post-modern portfolio theory]] and {{sectionlink|Mathematical finance|Risk and portfolio management: the P world}}.''\nThe majority of developments here relate to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]] and the [[Carhart four-factor model]], propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The [[intertemporal CAPM]] and [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|consumption-based CAPM]] similarly extend the model. With [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption (in the economic sense)]] then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\n\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the [[single-index model]] is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT; [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], 1976) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\"<ref>''The Arbitrage Pricing Theory,'' Chapter VI in Goetzmann, under External links.</ref> It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\n\nAs regards [[portfolio optimization]], the [[Black\u2013Litterman model]] departs from the original [[Markowitz model]] - i.e. of constructing portfolios via an [[efficient frontier]]. Black\u2013Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] can be applied; here deriving a [[Pareto efficient]] portfolio. The [[universal portfolio algorithm]] ([[Thomas M. Cover]], 1991) applies [[machine learning]] to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data. [[Behavioral portfolio theory]] recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals.  Copulas have [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|lately been applied here]]; recently this is the case also [[List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications#Finance_and_Economics|for genetic algorithms]] and [[Machine learning #Applications|Machine learning, more generally]].

Various [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|other numeric techniques]] have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that [[martingale pricing]] is now the standard approach.\n\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based off the same logic (using \"[[contingent claim analysis]]\"). [[Real options valuation]] allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock option valuation]] explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; [[Credit derivative]]s allow that payment obligations and / or delivery requirements might not be honored. [[Exotic derivative]]s are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|copula based analysis]].\n\nSimilarly, the various [[short rate model]]s allow for an extension of these techniques to [[Fixed income#Derivatives|fixed income-]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s.

(The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2014 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2014 are discussed [[#Departures from normality|in the next section]].\n\nAfter the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], a further development: ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]]) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2014 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as [[counterparty credit risk]], funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing,<ref>[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf \"Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917015231/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf |date=2016-09-17 }}, Christian Kj\u00f8lhede & Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]</ref> and a [[Credit Valuation Adjustment]], or CVA\u2014and potentially other ''valuation adjustments'', collectively [[xVA]]\u2014is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\n\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) curve, as opposed to [[LIBOR]] as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]]  is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting Dilemma |first=John |last=Hull |first2=Alan |last2=White |journal=[[Journal of Investment Management]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=14\u201327}}</ref> (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]] discounting\".)

Wide departures from these are commonly observed, and there are thus, respectively, two main sets of challenges.\n\n===Departures from normality===\n[[Image:Ivsrf.gif|thumb|right|Implied volatility surface. The Z-axis represents implied volatility in percent, and X and Y axes represent the option delta, and the days to maturity.]]\n{{See also|Capital asset pricing model#Problems|Modern portfolio theory#Criticisms|Black\u2013Scholes model#Criticism and comments}}\nAs discussed, the assumptions that market prices follow a [[random walk]] and / or that asset returns are normally distributed are fundamental. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold (see [[Kurtosis risk]], [[Skewness risk]], [[Long tail]]) and that in practice, traders, analysts and [[financial risk management|risk managers]] frequently modify the \"standard models\" (see [[Model risk]]). In fact, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] had discovered already in the 1960s that changes in financial prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\n\n[[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]] have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while [[Jump diffusion#In economics and finance|jump diffusion models]] allow for (option) pricing incorporating [[jump process|\"jumps\"]] in the [[spot price]].<ref name=\"holes\">{{cite journal |title=  How to use the holes in Black-Scholes |first= Fischer |last=Black|author-link1=Fischer Black |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=1|issue=Jan|year=1989|pages=67\u201373|jstor=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6622.1989.tb00175.x}}</ref> \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard [[value at risk]] models with [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulations]], [[Mixture model#A financial model|mixture models]], [[principal component analysis]], [[extreme value theory]], as well as models for [[volatility clustering]].<ref>See for example III.A.3, in Carol Alexander, ed.

PRMIA Publications. {{ISBN|978-0976609704}}</ref> \nFor further discussion see {{sectionlink|Fat-tailed distribution|Applications in economics}}, and {{sectionlink|Value at risk|Criticism}}.\nPortfolio managers, likewise, have modified their optimization criteria and algorithms; see [[#Portfolio theory]] above. \n\nClosely related is the [[volatility smile]], where, as above, [[implied volatility]] \u2014 the volatility corresponding to the BSM price \u2014 is observed to ''differ'' as a function of [[strike price]] (i.e. [[moneyness]]), true only if the price-change distribution is non-normal, unlike that assumed by BSM. \nThe term structure of volatility describes how (implied) volatility differs for related options with different maturities. \nAn implied volatility surface is then a three-dimensional surface plot of volatility smile and term structure. \nThese empirical phenomena negate the assumption of constant volatility\u2014and [[log-normal]]ity\u2014upon which Black\u2013Scholes is built.<ref name=\"Haug Taleb\"/><ref name=\"holes\"/>  \nWithin institutions, the function of Black-Scholes is now, largely, to ''communicate'' prices via implied volatilities, much like bond prices are communicated via [[yield to maturity|YTM]]; see {{sectionlink|Black\u2013Scholes model|The volatility smile}}.\n\nIn consequence traders (and risk managers) now, instead, use \"smile-consistent\" models, firstly, when valuing derivatives not directly mapped to the surface, facilitating the pricing of other, i.e. non-quoted, strike/maturity combinations, or of non-European derivatives, and generally for hedging purposes.  \nThe two main approaches are [[local volatility]] and [[stochastic volatility]]. \nThe first returns the volatility which is \u201clocal\u201d to each spot-time point of the [[Finite difference methods for option pricing|finite difference-]] or [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing|simulation-based valuation]]; i.e. as opposed to implied volatility, which holds overall.  In this way calculated prices \u2014 and numeric structures \u2014 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense.  The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first [[Stochastic volatility#Calibration and estimation|calibrated to observed prices]], and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are [[Heston model|Heston]], [[SABR volatility model|SABR]] and [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]]. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |title=  Managing smile risk |first= Patrick |last=Hagan |display-authors=etal|journal=[[Wilmott Magazine]] |volume=|issue=Sep|year=2002 |pages=84\u2013108|jstor=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nRelated to local volatility are the [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice]]-based [[Implied binomial tree|implied-binomial]] and [[Implied trinomial tree|-trinomial trees]] \u2014 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2014 which are similarly (but less commonly) used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. \n[[Edgeworth binomial tree]]s allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required.<ref>See for example Pg 217 of: Jackson, Mary; Mike Staunton (2001).

Working paper, [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].</ref>\n\nAs discussed, additional to assuming log-normality in returns, \"classical\" BSM-type models also (implicitly) assume the existence of a credit-risk-free environment, where one can perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge, and then discount at \"the\" risk-free-rate.  \nAnd therefore, post crisis, the various x-value adjustments must be employed, effectively correcting the risk-neutral value for [[counterparty credit risk|counterparty-]] and [[XVA#Valuation_adjustments|funding-related]] risk.\nThese xVA are ''additional'' to any smile or surface effect. This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no \"[[double counting (accounting)|double counting]]\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...) \n\nAs mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly [[financial engineering]]) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above \"extreme event\" approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. \nRecognizing this, [[James Rickards]], amongst other critics of financial economics, suggests that, instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely: \n:\"The  current  system,  based  on  the  idea  that  risk  is  distributed  in  the  shape  of  a  bell  curve,  is  flawed...

Recently, however, researchers in [[experimental economics]] and [[experimental finance]] have challenged this assumption [[Empirical evidence|empirically]]. These assumptions are also challenged [[Theory|theoretically]], by [[behavioral finance]], a discipline primarily concerned with the limits to rationality of economic agents.\n\nConsistent with, and complementary to these findings, various persistent [[Market anomaly|market anomalies]] have been documented, these being price and/or return distortions\u2014e.g. [[size premium]]s\u2014which appear to contradict the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]; [[calendar effect]]s are the best known group here. Related to these are various of the [[economic puzzle]]s, concerning phenomena similarly contradicting the theory. The ''[[equity premium puzzle]]'', as one example, arises in that the difference between the observed returns on stocks as compared to government bonds is consistently higher than the [[risk premium]] rational equity investors should demand, an \"[[abnormal return]]\".

The subject is thus built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and decision theory, and derives several key results for the application of [[decision making]] under uncertainty to the [[financial market]]s. The underlying economic logic distills to a \u201dfundamental valuation result\u201d,<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> as aside, which is developed in the following sections.\n\n===Present value, expectation and utility===\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of [[present value]] and [[Expected value|expectation]].<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>\n\nCalculating their present value allows the decision maker to aggregate the [[cashflow]]s (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future, to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is therefore the starting point for financial decision making. (Its history is correspondingly early: [[Richard Witt]] discusses [[compound interest]] in depth already in 1613, in his book \"Arithmeticall Questions\";<ref>C. Lewin (1970). [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf An early book on compound interest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163926/https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf |date=2016-12-21 }}, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</ref> further developed by [[Johan de Witt]] and [[Edmond Halley]].)\n\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the [[Expected value|expected value criterion]] which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, <math>X_{s}</math> and <math>p_{s}</math> respectively. (These ideas originate with [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1654.)\n\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider [[risk aversion]] (\"as any student of finance knows\"<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>). In other words, since individuals receive greater [[Utility#Economic definitions|utility]] from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is to therefore \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes (\"states\") correspondingly, <math>Y_{s}</math>. See [[Indifference price]]. (Some investors may in fact be [[risk seeking]] as opposed to [[Risk aversion|risk averse]], but the same logic would apply).\n\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]]. More formally, the resulting [[expected utility hypothesis]] states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective]] value associated with a gamble by an individual is ''that individual''{{'}}s [[Expected value|statistical expectation]] of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\n\nThe impetus for these ideas arise from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]; see also [[Ellsberg paradox]]. (The development here is originally due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, and later formalized by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1947.)\n\n===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|JEL classification codes\n|-\n|In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]], Financial Economics is one of the 19 primary classifications, at JEL: G.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\n\n[[Economic equilibrium]] is, in general, a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\n\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and are therefore not in equilibrium.<ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\"/> An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\nThe immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]], shows that where markets are as described \u2014and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) [[complete market|complete]]\u2014one may then make financial decisions by constructing a [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] corresponding to the market.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, <math>s</math>, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming [[Frictionless market|no friction]]): essentially [[System of linear equations|solving simultaneously]] for ''n'' (risk-neutral) probabilities, <math>q_{s}</math>, given ''n'' prices. The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\">Freddy Delbaen and Walter Schachermayer. (2004). [http://www.ams.org/notices/200405/what-is.pdf \"What is... a Free Lunch?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061252/http://www.ams.org/notices/200405/what-is.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }} (pdf). Notices of the AMS 51 (5): 526\u2013528</ref> For a simplified example see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}}, where the economy has only two possible states\u2014up and down\u2014and where <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math> (=<math>1-q_{up}</math>) are the two corresponding (i.e. implied) probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or [[probability measure|\"measure\"]].\n\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the riskless return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\",<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> i.e. a security-specific [[risk premium]], compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions and/or conditions.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> This approach is consistent with [[#Present value, expectation and utility|the above]], but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\n\nThus, continuing the example, in pricing a [[derivative (finance)|derivative instrument]] its forecasted cashflows in the up- and down-states, <math>X_{up}</math> and <math>X_{down}</math>, are multiplied through by <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math>, and are then [[present value|discounted]] at the risk-free interest rate; the second equation above.  In pricing a \u201cfundamental\u201d, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with <math>Y</math> and <math>r</math> combined. In general, this may be derived by the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] (or extensions) as will be seen under [[#Uncertainty]]. \n\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the instrument as a combination of the [[underlying]] and a risk free \u201cbond\u201d; see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Delta hedging}} (and [[#Uncertainty]] below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such construction is of course not possible - the instrument being \"fundamental\" - and a premium is then required for risk.\n\n===State prices===\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model]] may be derived. This important result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a ''[[representative agent]]''.<ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/>\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally [[complete market]]s, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods. \n\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a [[state price]] security (also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security), a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a [[numeraire]] (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price <math>\\pi_{s}</math> of this particular state of the world.\n\nIn the above example, the state prices, <math>\\pi_{up}</math>,  <math>\\pi_{down}</math>would equate to the present values of <math>$q_{up}</math> and <math>$q_{down}</math>: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the [[state price vector]] is the vector of state prices for all states.\nApplied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [<math>\\pi_{up}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{up}</math> + <math>\\pi_{down}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{down}</math>]; the second formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a [[continuous random variable]] indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by [[integration (mathematics)|integrating]] over the state price \"density\". These concepts are extended to [[martingale pricing]] and the related [[risk-neutral measure]]. See also [[Stochastic discount factor]].\n\nState prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (\"[[contingent claim analysis]]\");<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> but can also be applied to valuation problems.<ref name=\"corp fin state prices\">See de Matos, as well as Bossaerts and \u00d8degaard, under bibliography.</ref> Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value \u2014 true in fact for \"every security\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/> \u2014  as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices.<ref name=\"Chance2\"/><ref name=\"corp fin state prices\"/> These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself. (Breeden and Litzenberger's work in 1978<ref>{{cite journal |title=Prices of State-Contingent Claims Implicit in Option Prices |first=Douglas T. |last=Breeden |first2=Robert H. |last2=Litzenberger |author2-link=Robert Litzenberger |journal=[[Journal of Business]] |volume=51 |issue=4 |year=1978 |pages=621\u2013651 |jstor=2352653 |doi=10.1086/296025}}</ref> established the use of state prices in financial economics.)\n\n==Resultant models==\n[[Image:MM2.png|thumb|right|Modigliani\u2013Miller Proposition II with risky debt.

As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\",<ref name=\"stanford1\"/><ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/> as will be seen below.\n* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.\n* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.\n* [[Option (finance)|Options]]: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.\n* [[Perfect information|Information]]: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with [[Future value|future monetary value]] (FMV).\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"[[deterministic]]\" and \"random\",<ref name=\"Luenberger\"/> or \"[[stochastic]]\".)\n\n===Certainty===\nThe starting point here is \u201cInvestment under certainty\". The [[Fisher separation theorem]], asserts that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. Related is the [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]], which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\n\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'', which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the intrinsic, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of [[dividend]]s. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. [[Net present value]] (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of \"Equity valuation\" topics under {{sectionlink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}.\n([[John Burr Williams]] published his \"Theory\" in 1938; NPV was introduced by [[Joel Dean (economist)|Joel Dean]] in 1951)\n\n[[Bond valuation]], in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal) are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion.<ref name=\"Luenberger\">See Luenberger's ''Investment Science'', under Bibliography.</ref> An immediate extension, [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach|Arbitrage-free bond pricing]], discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate \u2014 i.e. at each coupon's corresponding zero-rate \u2014 as opposed to an overall rate. In many treatments bond valuation precedes [[equity valuation]], under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" ''per se''. Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these \u2014 based on historic ratios or published policy \u2014 and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under [[#Corporate finance theory]].\n\nThese \"certainty\" results are all commonly employed under corporate finance; uncertainty is the focus of \"asset pricing models\", as follows.\n\n===Uncertainty===\nFor [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|\"choice under uncertainty\"]] the twin assumptions of rationality and [[Financial market efficiency|market efficiency]], as more closely defined, lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) with its [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM)\u2014an ''equilibrium-based'' result\u2014and to the [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton theory]] (BSM; often, simply Black\u2013Scholes) for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]]\u2014an ''arbitrage-free'' result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see [[asset pricing]].\n\nBriefly, and intuitively\u2014and consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above\u2014the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows.<ref>\nFor a more formal treatment, see, for example: Eugene F. Fama. 1965. [http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/faj/1965/21/5 Random Walks in Stock Market Prices]. ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'', September/October 1965, Vol. 21, No. 5: 55\u201359.</ref> \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. ''efficient'', prices: the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See [[Earnings response coefficient]].)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information, are identical to the ''best guess of the future'': the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, but what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a [[normal distribution]]\u2014so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news:<ref name=\"Shiller\"/> the [[random walk hypothesis]]. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \n(The EMH was presented by [[Eugene Fama]] in a 1970 review paper,<ref>Fama, Eugene (1970). \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\". Journal of Finance.</ref> consolidating previous works re random walks in stock prices: [[Jules Regnault]], 1863; [[Louis Bachelier]], 1900; [[Maurice Kendall]], 1953; [[Paul Cootner]], 1964; and [[Paul Samuelson]], 1965, among others.)\n\nUnder these conditions investors can then be assumed to act rationally: their investment decision must be calculated or a loss is sure to follow; correspondingly, where an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, then arbitrageurs will exploit it, reinforcing this equilibrium.\nHere, as under the certainty-case above, the specific assumption as to pricing is that prices are calculated as the present value of expected future dividends,\n<ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\">Christopher L.

The CAPM was derived by [[Jack L. Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962), [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently. )\n\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of [[option style|European-styled options]].\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a [[partial differential equation]] describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, [[geometric Brownian motion]] (see [[Brownian model of financial markets]]).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (<math>V</math>, the value, or price, of the option, grows at <math>r</math>, the risk-free rate).<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/>\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price\u2014in an arbitrage-free sense\u2014for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is [[Partial differential equation#Analytical solutions|the solution]] to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above.

As regards [[asset pricing]], developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under \"Portfolio theory\" below, while \"Derivative pricing\" relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing.  As regards the use of capital, \"Corporate finance theory\" relates, mainly, to the application of these models.\n\n===Portfolio theory===\n[[Image:Pareto Efficient Frontier for the Markowitz Portfolio selection problem..png|thumb|right|200px|Plot of two criteria when maximizing return and minimizing risk in financial portfolios (Pareto-optimal points in red)]]\n[[File:Four Correlations.png|thumb|right|alt=Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.|Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.]]\n:''See also: [[Post-modern portfolio theory]] and {{sectionlink|Mathematical finance|Risk and portfolio management: the P world}}.''\nThe majority of developments here relate to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]] and the [[Carhart four-factor model]], propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The [[intertemporal CAPM]] and [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|consumption-based CAPM]] similarly extend the model. With [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption (in the economic sense)]] then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\n\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the [[single-index model]] is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT; [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], 1976) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\"<ref>''The Arbitrage Pricing Theory,'' Chapter VI in Goetzmann, under External links.</ref> It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\n\nAs regards [[portfolio optimization]], the [[Black\u2013Litterman model]] departs from the original [[Markowitz model]] - i.e. of constructing portfolios via an [[efficient frontier]]. Black\u2013Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] can be applied; here deriving a [[Pareto efficient]] portfolio. The [[universal portfolio algorithm]] ([[Thomas M. Cover]], 1991) applies [[machine learning]] to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data. [[Behavioral portfolio theory]] recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals.  Copulas have [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|lately been applied here]]; recently this is the case also [[List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications#Finance_and_Economics|for genetic algorithms]] and [[Machine learning #Applications|Machine learning, more generally]].

Various [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|other numeric techniques]] have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that [[martingale pricing]] is now the standard approach.\n\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based off the same logic (using \"[[contingent claim analysis]]\"). [[Real options valuation]] allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock option valuation]] explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; [[Credit derivative]]s allow that payment obligations and / or delivery requirements might not be honored. [[Exotic derivative]]s are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|copula based analysis]].\n\nSimilarly, the various [[short rate model]]s allow for an extension of these techniques to [[Fixed income#Derivatives|fixed income-]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s. (The [[Vasicek model| Vasicek]] and [[Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross model|CIR]] models are equilibrium-based, while [[Ho\u2013Lee model|Ho\u2013Lee]] and subsequent models are based on arbitrage-free pricing.) \nThe more general [[Heath\u2013Jarrow\u2013Morton framework|HJM Framework]] describes the dynamics of the full [[forward rate]] curve - as opposed to working with short rates - and is then more widely applied.\nThe valuation of the underlying bonds -  additional to their derivatives - is relatedly extended, particularly for [[Hybrid security |hybrid securities]], where credit risk is combined with uncertainty re future rates; \nsee {{sectionlink|Bond valuation|Stochastic calculus approach}} and {{sectionlink|Lattice model (finance)|Hybrid securities}}.\n([[Oldrich Vasicek]] developed his pioneering short rate model in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vasicek |first=O. |date=1977 |title=An equilibrium characterization of the term structure |journal=[[Journal of Financial Economics]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=177\u2013188 |doi=10.1016/0304-405X(77)90016-2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.164.447 }}</ref> \nThe HJM framework originates from the work of [[David Heath (probabilist) |David Heath]], [[Robert A.

(The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2014 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2014 are discussed [[#Departures from normality|in the next section]].\n\nAfter the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], a further development: ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]]) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2014 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as [[counterparty credit risk]], funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing,<ref>[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf \"Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917015231/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf |date=2016-09-17 }}, Christian Kj\u00f8lhede & Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]</ref> and a [[Credit Valuation Adjustment]], or CVA\u2014and potentially other ''valuation adjustments'', collectively [[xVA]]\u2014is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\n\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) curve, as opposed to [[LIBOR]] as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]]  is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting Dilemma |first=John |last=Hull |first2=Alan |last2=White |journal=[[Journal of Investment Management]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=14\u201327}}</ref> (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]] discounting\".) [[Swap (finance)#Valuation|Swap pricing]] - and, therefore, [[yield curve]] construction - is further modified: previously, swaps were valued off a single \"self discounting\" interest rate curve; whereas post crisis, to accommodate OIS discounting, valuation is now under a \"[[multi-curve framework]]\" where \"forecast curves\" are constructed for each floating-leg [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]], with discounting on the ''common'' OIS curve.\n\n===Corporate finance theory===\n[[Image:Manual decision tree.jpg|right|thumb|Project valuation via decision tree.]]\nCorporate finance theory has also been extended: mirroring the [[#Certainty|above]] developments, asset-valuation and decisioning no longer need assume \"certainty\". \n[[Monte Carlo methods in finance]] allow financial analysts to construct \"[[stochastic]]\" or [[probabilistic]] corporate finance models, as opposed to the traditional static and [[deterministic]] models;<ref name=\"Damodaran_Risk\"/> see {{sectionlink|Corporate finance|Quantifying uncertainty}}. \nRelatedly, Real Options theory allows for owner\u2014i.e. managerial\u2014actions that impact underlying value: by incorporating option pricing logic, these actions are then applied to a distribution of future outcomes, changing with time, which then determine the \"project's\" valuation today.<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> \n(Simulation was first applied to (corporate) finance by [[David B.

Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold (see [[Kurtosis risk]], [[Skewness risk]], [[Long tail]]) and that in practice, traders, analysts and [[financial risk management|risk managers]] frequently modify the \"standard models\" (see [[Model risk]]). In fact, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] had discovered already in the 1960s that changes in financial prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\n\n[[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]] have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while [[Jump diffusion#In economics and finance|jump diffusion models]] allow for (option) pricing incorporating [[jump process|\"jumps\"]] in the [[spot price]].<ref name=\"holes\">{{cite journal |title=  How to use the holes in Black-Scholes |first= Fischer |last=Black|author-link1=Fischer Black |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=1|issue=Jan|year=1989|pages=67\u201373|jstor=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6622.1989.tb00175.x}}</ref> \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard [[value at risk]] models with [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulations]], [[Mixture model#A financial model|mixture models]], [[principal component analysis]], [[extreme value theory]], as well as models for [[volatility clustering]].<ref>See for example III.A.3, in Carol Alexander, ed.

In this way calculated prices \u2014 and numeric structures \u2014 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense.  The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first [[Stochastic volatility#Calibration and estimation|calibrated to observed prices]], and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are [[Heston model|Heston]], [[SABR volatility model|SABR]] and [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]]. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |title=  Managing smile risk |first= Patrick |last=Hagan |display-authors=etal|journal=[[Wilmott Magazine]] |volume=|issue=Sep|year=2002 |pages=84\u2013108|jstor=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nRelated to local volatility are the [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice]]-based [[Implied binomial tree|implied-binomial]] and [[Implied trinomial tree|-trinomial trees]] \u2014 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2014 which are similarly (but less commonly) used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. \n[[Edgeworth binomial tree]]s allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required.<ref>See for example Pg 217 of: Jackson, Mary; Mike Staunton (2001).

Working paper, [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].</ref>\n\nAs discussed, additional to assuming log-normality in returns, \"classical\" BSM-type models also (implicitly) assume the existence of a credit-risk-free environment, where one can perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge, and then discount at \"the\" risk-free-rate.  \nAnd therefore, post crisis, the various x-value adjustments must be employed, effectively correcting the risk-neutral value for [[counterparty credit risk|counterparty-]] and [[XVA#Valuation_adjustments|funding-related]] risk.\nThese xVA are ''additional'' to any smile or surface effect. This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no \"[[double counting (accounting)|double counting]]\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...) \n\nAs mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly [[financial engineering]]) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above \"extreme event\" approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. \nRecognizing this, [[James Rickards]], amongst other critics of financial economics, suggests that, instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely: \n:\"The  current  system,  based  on  the  idea  that  risk  is  distributed  in  the  shape  of  a  bell  curve,  is  flawed...

Recently, however, researchers in [[experimental economics]] and [[experimental finance]] have challenged this assumption [[Empirical evidence|empirically]]. These assumptions are also challenged [[Theory|theoretically]], by [[behavioral finance]], a discipline primarily concerned with the limits to rationality of economic agents.\n\nConsistent with, and complementary to these findings, various persistent [[Market anomaly|market anomalies]] have been documented, these being price and/or return distortions\u2014e.g. [[size premium]]s\u2014which appear to contradict the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]; [[calendar effect]]s are the best known group here. Related to these are various of the [[economic puzzle]]s, concerning phenomena similarly contradicting the theory. The ''[[equity premium puzzle]]'', as one example, arises in that the difference between the observed returns on stocks as compared to government bonds is consistently higher than the [[risk premium]] rational equity investors should demand, an \"[[abnormal return]]\".

The latter is extended to [[agent-based computational economics]], where price is treated as an [[emergent phenomenon]], resulting from the interaction of the various market participants (agents). The [[noisy market hypothesis]] argues that prices can be influenced by speculators and [[momentum trader]]s, as well as by [[insider trading|insiders]] and institutions that often buy and sell stocks for reasons unrelated to [[fundamental value]]; see [[Noise (economic)]]. The [[adaptive market hypothesis]] is an attempt to reconcile the efficient market hypothesis with behavioral economics, by applying the principles of [[evolution]] to financial interactions. An [[information cascade]], alternatively, shows market participants engaging in the same acts as others (\"[[herd behavior]]\"), despite contradictions with their private information. [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|Copula-based modelling]] has similarly been applied.
