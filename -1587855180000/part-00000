The house is inhabited by tiny creatures called ''[[susuwatari]]''\u2014small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places.<ref group=note>The susuwatari are called \"black soots\" in early subtitles and \"soot sprites\" in the later English dubbed version.</ref> When the girls become comfortable in their new house, the soot spirits leave to find another empty house.\n\nOne day, Mei discovers two small spirits who lead her into the hollow of a large [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". She falls asleep atop Totoro, but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei is unable to show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her by telling her that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.{{Multiple image|align = right|image1 = Expo 2005 of Satsuki and Mei\u2019s House 01.jpg|caption1 = Satsuki and Mei's house ([[:ja:\u30b5\u30c4\u30ad\u3068\u30e1\u30a4\u306e\u5bb6]]) at the [[Expo 2005]] site.|image2 = Satsuki and Mei's House 01.JPG|caption2 = Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house|direction = vertical}}\n\nOne rainy night, the girls are waiting for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back, and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken for her father. Totoro is delighted and gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A [[catbus|giant, bus-shaped cat]] halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it and leaves. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives.\n\nThe girls plant the seeds. A few days later, they awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his colleagues engaged in a [[ceremonial dance]] around the planted seeds. The girls join in and the seeds grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying [[top]]. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have indeed sprouted; it is left unclear whether the girls were dreaming.\n\nThe girls find out that a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei does not take this well and argues with Satsuki, later leaving for the hospital to bring fresh corn to Yasuko. Her disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]] and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to help, he summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. The bus then whisks them over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital. The girls overhear a conversation between their parents and discover that she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where it is discovered by their parents, and return home.\n\nEventually, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, and the sisters play with other children, while Totoro and his friends watch them from afar.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The newspaper described the final product:\n{{quote|Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity.

The house is inhabited by tiny creatures called ''[[susuwatari]]''\u2014small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places.<ref group=note>The susuwatari are called \"black soots\" in early subtitles and \"soot sprites\" in the later English dubbed version.</ref> When the girls become comfortable in their new house, the soot spirits leave to find another empty house.\n\nOne day, Mei discovers two small spirits who lead her into the hollow of a large [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". She falls asleep atop Totoro, but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei is unable to show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her by telling her that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.{{Multiple image|align = right|image1 = Expo 2005 of Satsuki and Mei\u2019s House 01.jpg|caption1 = Satsuki and Mei's house ([[:ja:\u30b5\u30c4\u30ad\u3068\u30e1\u30a4\u306e\u5bb6]]) at the [[Expo 2005]] site.|image2 = Satsuki and Mei's House 01.JPG|caption2 = Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house|direction = vertical}}\n\nOne rainy night, the girls are waiting for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back, and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken for her father. Totoro is delighted and gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A [[catbus|giant, bus-shaped cat]] halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it and leaves. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives.\n\nThe girls plant the seeds. A few days later, they awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his colleagues engaged in a [[ceremonial dance]] around the planted seeds. The girls join in and the seeds grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying [[top]]. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have indeed sprouted; it is left unclear whether the girls were dreaming.\n\nThe girls find out that a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei does not take this well and argues with Satsuki, later leaving for the hospital to bring fresh corn to Yasuko. Her disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]] and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to help, he summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. The bus then whisks them over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital. The girls overhear a conversation between their parents and discover that she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise doing well.

It is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]]. Founded as High Point College in 1924, it became High Point University in October 1991. HPU offers 47 undergraduate majors, 51 undergraduate minors and 12 graduate-degree majors.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Roberts_Hall_at_High_Point_University.jpg|thumb|right|Roberts Hall at High Point University]]\n\n[[File:Atlas_statue_at_High_Point_University.jpg|thumb|right|Atlas sculpture at High Point University. Artist, Jon Hair]]\n\n[[File:Cottrell_Hall_at_High_Point_University.jpg|thumb|right|Cottrell Hall at High Point University]]\nIn the mid-19th century, the Methodist Protestant Church, which is now part of the United Methodist Church, became active in educational pursuits in North Carolina.  In 1921, after some years of consideration, the statewide governing body of the Methodist Protestant Church voted to establish a college.<ref>Sizemore, F. J., ed. ''The Buildings and the Builders of a City: High Point, North Carolina''. High Point: Hall Printing Company, 1947. p. 318-319</ref> Shortly afterwards the church accepted an offer from the citizens of High Point to contribute {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of land and $100,000 to the project, placing the new school in the city of High Point.<ref>Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. ''The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D.'' Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980. p. 233</ref> The campus was designed by R. E. Mitchell of Washington, D.C., assisted by Herbert Hunter of High Point, in the English Renaissance style. The school was founded in 1924 as High Point College, a joint venture between the [[Methodist Protestant Church]] and the citizens of High Point, and officially opened its doors on September 14, 1924. When the college opened, the campus consisted of three buildings, attended by nine faculty members, with a student enrollment of 122.\n\nThe steadfast growth that characterized the birth of the college ended abruptly with the Great Depression. This period was difficult for the college in 1932\u201333, as faculty salaries were cut and expenses were sometimes bartered. Despite a $50,000 fund raising campaign, the college declared bankruptcy on June 15, 1934 and reorganization in an effort to reduce its indebtedness.<ref>Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. \"The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. To 1980, A.D.\" Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980. p. 235</ref> Subsequent reorganization enabled the college to move forward with business and renewed expansion. '''\n\nOn October 9, 1991, under the guidance of President Dr. [[Jacob C. Martinson, Jr.]] and the Board of Trustees, High Point College changed its name to High Point University to reflect post-graduate degree programs.  Coinciding with the offering of graduate studies, every building on the campus was renovated and new ones were constructed with a campus quadrangle added to replace a former city street that bisected the campus,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20040928204703/http://www.high-point.net/edc/2002annrpt.pdf%7C High Point Economic Development Corporation Website</ref> and by 2004 the university's endowment increased to $40 million. When [[Jacob C. Martinson, Jr.]] stepped down as president in 2005, he was the longest serving [[United Methodist]] college president in the country.\n\nIn 2005, the university was only 92 acres and landlocked with a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,450.

In 1921, after some years of consideration, the statewide governing body of the Methodist Protestant Church voted to establish a college.<ref>Sizemore, F. J., ed.

High Point: Hall Printing Company, 1947. p. 318-319</ref> Shortly afterwards the church accepted an offer from the citizens of High Point to contribute {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of land and $100,000 to the project, placing the new school in the city of High Point.<ref>Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. ''The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D.'' Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980. p. 233</ref> The campus was designed by R. E. Mitchell of Washington, D.C., assisted by Herbert Hunter of High Point, in the English Renaissance style. The school was founded in 1924 as High Point College, a joint venture between the [[Methodist Protestant Church]] and the citizens of High Point, and officially opened its doors on September 14, 1924. When the college opened, the campus consisted of three buildings, attended by nine faculty members, with a student enrollment of 122.\n\nThe steadfast growth that characterized the birth of the college ended abruptly with the Great Depression. This period was difficult for the college in 1932\u201333, as faculty salaries were cut and expenses were sometimes bartered. Despite a $50,000 fund raising campaign, the college declared bankruptcy on June 15, 1934 and reorganization in an effort to reduce its indebtedness.<ref>Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. \"The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A.

According to the Act of Ley N\u00ba 3.544, on 19 July 1909 it held the status of \"Villa\" (town), which was elevated to \"Ciudad\" (city) on 29 September 1915 by the Act of Ley 5.335.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Population==\nIn 2011, Treinta y Tres had a population of 25,477.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.gub.uy/censos2011/resultadosfinales/cuadros/NIVEL%20DEPARTAMENTAL/Treinta%20y%20Tres/P_3_TYT.xls |title=Censos 2011 Cuadros Trenta y Tres |year=2012 |publisher=INE |accessdate=25 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010041734/http://www.ine.gub.uy/censos2011/resultadosfinales/cuadros/NIVEL%20DEPARTAMENTAL/Treinta%20y%20Tres/P_3_TYT.xls |archivedate=10 October 2012 }}</ref> It is by far the largest town in what is a sparsely populated department.

He played 18 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a player in September 2018.\n\nAllen played college basketball for the [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut Huskies]] for three seasons, gaining a reputation as an efficient long-range shooter. He entered the NBA in [[1996 NBA Draft|1996]] as the fifth overall selection. In the NBA, he developed into a prolific scorer for the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], featuring alongside [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Sam Cassell]] as the team achieved playoff success. However, the trio were unable to capture a championship, and Allen was traded to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. In Seattle, Allen's reputation as a scorer was solidified; he would break several league records for [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] and [[free throw]] shooting. Despite this, a title still eluded Allen, and he was traded to the [[Boston Celtics]] in 2007.\n\nIn Boston, Allen and new teammates [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Paul Pierce]] formed a \"Big Three\" and had immediate success, winning an [[List of NBA champions|NBA championship]] in [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]].

July 20, 1975) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player. He played 18 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a player in September 2018.\n\nAllen played college basketball for the [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut Huskies]] for three seasons, gaining a reputation as an efficient long-range shooter. He entered the NBA in [[1996 NBA Draft|1996]] as the fifth overall selection. In the NBA, he developed into a prolific scorer for the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], featuring alongside [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Sam Cassell]] as the team achieved playoff success. However, the trio were unable to capture a championship, and Allen was traded to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. In Seattle, Allen's reputation as a scorer was solidified; he would break several league records for [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] and [[free throw]] shooting. Despite this, a title still eluded Allen, and he was traded to the [[Boston Celtics]] in 2007.\n\nIn Boston, Allen and new teammates [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Paul Pierce]] formed a \"Big Three\" and had immediate success, winning an [[List of NBA champions|NBA championship]] in [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]]. He remained with the franchise for five seasons, before departing in free agency to join the [[Miami Heat]] for two seasons. In Miami, Allen accepted a reserve role, emphasizing spot-up and clutch shooting, which allowed him to capture another championship in [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]. His clutch three-pointer to tie Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals with 5.2 seconds remaining is regarded as one of the most memorable plays in NBA history.\n\nAllen's list of individual accolades are extensive; he gained ten [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] designations, he won an [[gold medal|Olympic gold medal]] as a member of the [[USA men's national basketball team#2000 Olympics U.S. Men's Basketball Team|2000 United States men's basketball team]], and he also holds NBA records in career three-point field goals made in both the [[List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders|regular]] and [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff 3-point scoring leaders|postseason]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Young |first=Royce |title=Ray Allen breaks all-time playoff 3-point record |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/22139764/video-ray-allen-breaks-all-time-playoff-3-point-record |work=CBSSPORTS}}</ref> He is also considered one of the best shooters of all-time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ft_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Free Throw Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for 3-Pt Field Goal Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref>\n\nDuring his NBA career, Allen acted during some offseasons. He is best known for his role as basketball prodigy Jesus Shuttlesworth in ''[[He Got Game]]'' (1998). Allen's performance as Shuttlesworth was greatly praised by critics, and the name was borrowed as Allen's basketball nickname.<ref>{{cite news|first=Emanuel|last=Levy|url= https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/he-got-game-1117477426/|title=He Got Game|work=Variety|date= 1998-04-27|accessdate=2020-02-26}}</ref> <ref name=\"suntimes1\">{{cite news|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/he-got-game-1998|title=He Got Game|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com |date=May 1, 1998|accessdate=February 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Edelstein |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/1998/05/he-got-balls.html|title=He Got Balls |work=Slate|date=1998-05-03 |accessdate=2020-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125225131/http://slate.msn.com/id/3252 |archivedate=2009-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThe third of five children, Allen was born at [[Castle Air Force Base]] near [[Merced, California]], the son of Walter Sr. and Flora Allen.<ref name=jock>{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Allen/Allen_bio.html |title=Ray Allen Biography |publisher=JockBio |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> A [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military child]], he spent time growing up in [[Saxmundham]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]], in [[Altus, Oklahoma]], at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]<ref name=jock /> in California, and in Germany.<ref name=rayroots>Marc J.

When he first arrived, the young Allen was often made the odd-man-out, whom kids often picked on, due to the accent acquired during his formative years in Britain. Although never completely fitting in with the other kids, Allen's natural athletic gifts, and his obsession with hard work, allowed him to excel in every sport he played. When a growth spurt left him with a natural advantage in basketball, he decided to dedicate his free time to becoming the best basketball player he possibly could.<ref name=\"theplayerstribune.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theplayerstribune.com/ray-allen-letter-to-my-younger-self/|title=Letter to My Younger Self \u2013 By Ray Allen|website=The Players' Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Allen/Allen_bio.html|title=JockBio: Ray Allen Biography|website=www.jockbio.com}}</ref> Fueled by his desire to become the top player on the military base where he lived, Allen practiced at length daily, so long as it didn't interfere with his studies.<ref name=\"theplayerstribune.com\"/> By the age of fifteen, he was playing for Hillcrest High School's varsity team, and would eventually lead them to their first state championship game. In that game, Allen showed his NBA potential by posting an impressive 25 points, to go along with 12 rebounds, in a blowout victory for Hillcrest Wildcats. Amid the resulting attention from colleges, especially from the [[University of Kentucky]], Allen ultimately accepted an offer from the [[University of Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kentuckysportsradio.com/basketball-2/ray-allen-explains-why-he-picked-uconn-over-uk-in-93/|title=Ray Allen explains why he picked UConn over UK in \u201992 \u2013 Kentucky Sports Radio|website=kentuckysportsradio.com}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAllen attended the [[University of Connecticut]] from 1993 to 1996 after being recruited by assistant coach [[Karl Hobbs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwsports.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/hobbs_karl00.html |title=Player Bio: Karl Hobbs \u2013 George Washington University Official Athletic Site |publisher=Gwsports.com |date=May 7, 2001 |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> While at UConn, he was named USA Basketball's Male Athlete of the Year in 1995.

This section will be deleted within a day because wikipedia itself is transphobic. They will silence trans people by ignoring evidence, dismiss them as vandals, and pretend to be neutral when really they're just transphobic. They have repeatedly misgendered the Roman Empress Elagabalus, and refused to remove someone's deadname even when their victims explicitly asked them to. They devote their time in dismissing and erasing evidence of transphobia instead of looking into it, because in truth they hate trans people and are glad that trans people are being, raped, murdered, and having their rights stripped. Even if some trans people are children. Wikibros will keep finding shit reasons like \"improper use of humor\" to silence people, because they can't be bothered to put in any effort to help trans people at all and would rather help to prosecute them. It matters not to us. We will do this again, again, and again, until they obtain the basic decency to recognize rudimentary facts. They cannot stop us. We're the Durruti Column. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ach|aw}}\n{{s-bef |before=[[Carol Emshwiller]]<br/>for ''[[The Mount (novel)|The Mount]]'' }}\n{{s-ttl |title=[[Philip K.
