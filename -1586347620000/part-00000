The plotline is centered on Carey hosting a \"Mariah Carey Christmas\" television show. The announcer introduces Carey saying \"here she is, the greatest singer of all time, Ms. Mariah Carey!\". The video then shows Carey's backup singers belting out the chorus while the singer is seen performing in front of a cheering audience. Her collection of fragrances is also advertised in the opening.

The plotline is centered on Carey hosting a \"Mariah Carey Christmas\" television show. The announcer introduces Carey saying \"here she is, the greatest singer of all time, Ms. Mariah Carey!\".
