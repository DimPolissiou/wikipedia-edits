Even though the collection was initiated by the society, many of the volumes were published by [[Friedrich Chrysander]] working alone (Chrysander was the major contributor for almost all of the volumes). The wording on the title page of the volumes is \"''Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel's Werke. Ausgabe der Deutschen H\u00e4ndelgesellschaft''\" which translates as \"Georg Friedrich Handel's works. Edition of the German Handel Society\". Chrysander's work has been criticised, however the scale of his achievement is also praised. The collection's abbreviation of \"'''HG'''\" can be used to identify individual works by Handel; for example Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' can be referred to as \"HG xlv\" (with the Roman numerals \"xlv\" indicating that the work is in volume 45).<ref>{{NewGrove2001|article=Handel, George Frideric|last=Hicks|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Hicks|vol=x|pages=785}}</ref> For practical use, the HG system has been superseded by the [[H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] numbering system. The 105 volumes do not contain the complete works of Handel\u2014with at least 250 of his works unpublished in the collection.\n\n==History==\nBefore the H\u00e4ndelgesellschaft, at least two collected editions of Handel's works had been produced. [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]]'s 180-volume collection was produced between 1787 and 1797\u2014however, it was far from complete, and included, for example, only five of Handel's 42 Italian [[List of operas by Handel|opera]]s.<ref>Winton Dean, ''The New Grove Handel.''

When the ''[[Hallische H\u00e4ndel-Ausgabe]]'' was inaugurated in 1955, it was at first intended as a supplement to Chrysander's work, and only later (in 1958) became a full critical edition in its own right.<ref>Dean, ''op. cit.,'' p. 117.</ref>\n<!--Should add something about how the publication was a money-making venture\u2014with the expectation that subscriptions would be sought from the public for the volumes. Subscription cost? -->\n\n==Criticism==\nSome have criticised Chrysander's efforts, with one writer commenting that \"he was an autocrat, a law into himself, who often made his selection according to his desires, who altered and revised at will, and who even falsified documents to suit his purposes,\"<ref>\"Handel's Scores,\" ''op. cit..'',</ref> and another criticising his \"arbitrary selection of material in the more complex works and his failure to explain his methods.\"<ref>Dean, ''op. cit..''</ref> \n\nThere are also problems such as the renumbering of the chamber sonatas originally published by Handel as his Op. 1 and Op. 2; for example, the Trio sonata in B flat for two violins and continuo, Op. 2 no. 3, appears in the ''H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft'' edition as Op. 2 no. 4. These renumberings by Chrysander resulted in confusion which still persists.<ref>Dean, ''op. cit.,'' pp. 117 and p. 153 (work list reference to Handel trio sonata).</ref> \n\nThe 1911 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition]]'' comments that \"The complete edition of the German ''Handelgesellschaft'' suffers from being the work of one man who would not recognize that his task was beyond any single man's power ...

Even though the collection was initiated by the society, many of the volumes were published by [[Friedrich Chrysander]] working alone (Chrysander was the major contributor for almost all of the volumes). The wording on the title page of the volumes is \"''Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel's Werke. Ausgabe der Deutschen H\u00e4ndelgesellschaft''\" which translates as \"Georg Friedrich Handel's works. Edition of the German Handel Society\". Chrysander's work has been criticised, however the scale of his achievement is also praised. The collection's abbreviation of \"'''HG'''\" can be used to identify individual works by Handel; for example Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' can be referred to as \"HG xlv\" (with the Roman numerals \"xlv\" indicating that the work is in volume 45).<ref>{{NewGrove2001|article=Handel, George Frideric|last=Hicks|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Hicks|vol=x|pages=785}}</ref> For practical use, the HG system has been superseded by the [[H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] numbering system. The 105 volumes do not contain the complete works of Handel\u2014with at least 250 of his works unpublished in the collection.\n\n==History==\nBefore the H\u00e4ndelgesellschaft, at least two collected editions of Handel's works had been produced. [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]]'s 180-volume collection was produced between 1787 and 1797\u2014however, it was far from complete, and included, for example, only five of Handel's 42 Italian [[List of operas by Handel|opera]]s.<ref>Winton Dean, ''The New Grove Handel.''

When the ''[[Hallische H\u00e4ndel-Ausgabe]]'' was inaugurated in 1955, it was at first intended as a supplement to Chrysander's work, and only later (in 1958) became a full critical edition in its own right.<ref>Dean, ''op. cit.,'' p. 117.</ref>\n<!--Should add something about how the publication was a money-making venture\u2014with the expectation that subscriptions would be sought from the public for the volumes. Subscription cost? -->\n\n==Criticism==\nSome have criticised Chrysander's efforts, with one writer commenting that \"he was an autocrat, a law into himself, who often made his selection according to his desires, who altered and revised at will, and who even falsified documents to suit his purposes,\"<ref>\"Handel's Scores,\" ''op. cit..'',</ref> and another criticising his \"arbitrary selection of material in the more complex works and his failure to explain his methods.\"<ref>Dean, ''op. cit..''</ref> \n\nThere are also problems such as the renumbering of the chamber sonatas originally published by Handel as his Op. 1 and Op. 2; for example, the Trio sonata in B flat for two violins and continuo, Op. 2 no. 3, appears in the ''H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft'' edition as Op. 2 no. 4. These renumberings by Chrysander resulted in confusion which still persists.<ref>Dean, ''op. cit.,'' pp. 117 and p. 153 (work list reference to Handel trio sonata).</ref> \n\nThe 1911 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition]]'' comments that \"The complete edition of the German ''Handelgesellschaft'' suffers from being the work of one man who would not recognize that his task was beyond any single man's power ...

{"title_page": "Christiani & Nielsen", "text_new": "[http://cn-thai.co.th/en/ Christiani & Nielsen (Thai) Pcl] is a construction [[General contractor|contractor]] with major operations in [[Thailand]] and Southeast Asia.  Originally a [[Denmark|Danish]] company, it is today a [[listed company]] majority owned by the [[GP Group]].\n\n\u201cMission Vision\u201d Statement \nWith a century of operations, we have a unique place in Thailand\u2019s development, and will firmly continue to build a strong foundation for its future. We aim to be the most highly regarded construction company in Thailand and ASEAN, by delivering excellence to our clients, honoring our commitments and nurturing each one of our people.\n\n==About us==\nChristiani & Nielsen was established by Dr. Rudolf Christiani and Captain Aage Nielsen in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1904. The founders incorporated technologies and their expertise to build bridges, marine works, and other reinforced concrete structures. Within less than ten years the company was widely recognized and had gain credibility. After that the operations were extended to other countries in Europe, South America, and South Africa. \n\nChristiani & Nielsen is a world class building contractor that has earned its reputation from civil engineering and structural works. The company is well known for its high experience, expertise, and up-to-date technology. With over one hundred years of experiences abroad and over eighty-nine years in Thailand the company has participated in numerous significant engineering projects. We developed and produced reinforced concrete load relieving platform and vertical raking piles that were used for building wharf. We developed technique for wharf construction that later became known as \u201cthe C&N Wharf\u201d. In addition we also developed immerse tube for underwater tunnel construction and cast push method for bridge construction. Those techniques have been repeated and developed for use worldwide. Knowledge and expertise have been passed down from generations to generations, resulted in numerous types of building projects and country landmarks across the world. Road, bridge, dam, seaport, tunnel, airport, gas separation plant, sport stadium, monument, high rise building, and residential building are examples of our accomplishments.\n\n==Management Executives==\n[http://cn-thai.co.th/en/index.php/people/ Board of Directors & Management Executives ]\n\nSince 2005, the Company\u2019s Shareholders changed several times starting from May 2008, when longstanding major shareholder, Siam Commercial Bank PCL, sold its stake to \nthe Crown Property Bureau, giving it a majority share. However, owning a construction company no longer fit with the long term business strategy, and in November 2011, the \nCrown Property Bureau sold all its shares to the GP Group, the company with a history that goes back more than 145 years in Thailand since 1918, through Globex Corporation which then became the major shareholders of the Company.\n\n==Financial Statement==\n[http://cnt.listedcompany.com/financial_highlights.html Financial Statement]\n\n==Operations==\nChristiani & Nielsen ([[Thailand|Siam]]) Ltd. was established on 28 February 1930. Over the years, the company executed a number of projects, including\n* [[Democracy Monument]]\n* [[Bangkok Port]]\n* The Krungthep, Krungthon, and Nonathburi bridges spanning Bangkok's [[Chao Phraya River]]\n* [[Rajadamnern Boxing Stadium]]\n* The [[Sukhothai Hotel]] in Bangkok\n* The 13th [[Asian Games]] Sports Stadium\n* All Season Place office complex\n* SCG 100 Years New Office building, certified as LEED Platinum Class \n* [[Prince Mahidol Hall]]\n* [[Khon Kaen & Krabi Airport Extension]]\n* [[PTTLNG TANK]]\n* [[Highway 3191 Map Ta Phut]]\n* [[Michelin warehouse]]\n\nThe Thai company was the first construction company to be listed on the [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]] in 1991. In December 1992 it completed a reverse takeover of its publicly listed Danish parent company, the first such transaction in Thai business history. \n\nOn 15 July 2016, the company had established a new 100% own subsidiary in The Republic of the Union of Myanmar namely Christiani and Nielsen (Myanmar) Limited to provide construction, engineering and related services.\n\nOn 4 July 2017, the company had established a new 100% own subsidiary in Kingdom of Cambodia namely Christiani & Nielsen (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. to provide construction, engineering and related services.\n\nToday, during the past 90 years, the Company has constructed almost 2,000 projects in Thailand and internationally handed to both Government and Private Sectors. We are a leading construction company in Thailand providing a wide range of services including design and construction of building and civil engineering projects, design, fabrication and erection of steel structures and mechanical and electrical installations.\n\n==New facilities==\nGP Group funded new facilities including new offices, a plant and steel fabrication yard, and a training center for staff and workers. For the new offices, the company purchased land in [[Bang Na District]] and built a seven-storey building which can accommodate up to 750 staff. In 2013, the old plant and steel fabrication yard moved to newly purchased premises in [[Si Racha District]]. The equipment yard houses some 10,000 items of construction machinery, tools, scaffolding and form work. The steel fabrication yard has a production capacity of over 10,000 tonnes per year. A training centre was built on a 30 [[Rai (area)|rai]] plot of land in [[Khlong Sam Wa District]] in Bangkok, including four training buildings, two accommodation buildings, and a canteen.

As a result of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the company needed to undertake extensive restructuring by disposing of foreign subsidiaries and other investments, and thereafter decided to focus on its core construction business in Thailand.\n\nThe past few years have seen radical changes in the shareholding structure of the company.  To comply with new regulations of the Bank of Thailand, in 2008, long standing major shareholder [[Siam Commercial Bank]] PCL sold its stake to the [[Crown Property Bureau]], its largest shareholder, giving the CPB a majority share in the company. Thereafter, in 2011, the Crown Property Bureau sold all its shares in the company to the GP Group which thereby became the new major shareholder of the Company.\n\n==New facilities==\nGP Group funded new facilities including new offices, a plant and steel fabrication yard, and a training center for staff and workers.

The song was written and produced by Madonna and [[Shep Pettibone]], with additional writing from Anthony Shimkin. It was released by [[Maverick Records]] as the album's second single on November 17, 1992. A shortened version of the song was included on Madonna's second greatest hits compilation, ''[[GHV2]]'' (2001). \"Deeper and Deeper\" is a [[dance music|dance]]-oriented song, and features instrumentation from acoustic guitars and [[castanet]] beats on its bridge. Lyrically, the song talks about [[sexual desire]], though it has been argued that it's actually about a young man coming to terms with his [[homosexuality]].\n\n\"Deeper and Deeper\" was met with positive reviews. Music critics hailed it as one of Madonna's strongest disco inspired tracks and complimented its refreshing dance oriented nature. It was also commercially successful; peaking at number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and reaching the Top 10 in several countries including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, while topping the charts in Italy.\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]] for \"Deeper and Deeper\" was directed by Bobby Woods. It was seen as a homage to American artist [[Andy Warhol]] and Italian director [[Luchino Visconti]]; it features Madonna playing a character based on [[Edie Sedgwick]], who goes out to a nightclub to meet her friends and boyfriend. Madonna has performed \"Deeper and Deeper\" in three of her [[List of Madonna concert tours|concert tours]]; the last being the [[Rebel Heart Tour]] (2015\u201316).\n\n==Background and development==\n[[File:Deeper&DeeperGirlieShowunderGround1 sh.jpg|thumb|right|Madonna and her back up singers [[Donna De Lory]] (''left'') and [[Niki Haris]] (''right''), perform \"Deeper and Deeper\" during 1993's [[The Girlie Show World Tour]].]]\nIn 1992, Madonna founded her own multi-media entertainment company, [[Maverick (entertainment company)|Maverick]], consisting of a record company ([[Maverick Records]]), a film production company ([[Maverick Films]]), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions.<ref name=\"maverick\">{{cite news|first=Stephen |last=Holden |authorlink=Stephen Holden|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/20/arts/madonna-makes-a-60-million-deal.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Madonna Makes a $60&nbsp;Million Deal|accessdate=July 25, 2015|date=April 20, 1992}}</ref> The first two projects from the venture were her fifth studio album, ''Erotica'', and a coffee table book of photographs featuring Madonna, entitled ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]''.<ref name=\"maverick\"/> For the album, Madonna primarily collaborated with producer [[Shep Pettibone]].  Pettibone first began working with Madonna during the 1980s, providing remixes for several of her singles.<ref name=SlantEro/> Alongside Pettibone, Madonna enlisted help from producer Andr\u00e9 Betts, who previously co-produced \"[[Justify My Love]]\" for ''The Immaculate Collection''.<ref name=SlantEro/> Madonna said that she was interested to work with Pettibone and Betts due to their ability to remain plugged into the dance underground, \"They come from opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of their music style and approach to music, but they're both connected to the street and they're still young and hungry.\"<ref name=\"andre\">{{cite journal|last=Flick|first=Larry|title=The Man Behind Madonna's 'Erotica'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22|journal=Billboard|location=New York|issn=0006-2510|date=November 28, 1992|accessdate=July 25, 2015|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Pettibone in an article \"Erotica Diaries\" published on Madonna's ''Icon'' magazine, he produced a tape with four songs, for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming ''[[A League of Their Own]]''.

Occasionally, Madonna also would meet Andr\u00e9 Betts.<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/>  The first batch of songs Madonna and Pettibone worked together on were \"[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]\", \"Deeper and Deeper\", \"[[Rain (Madonna song)|Rain]]\" and \"Thief of Hearts\"; Madonna would write the lyrics as Pettibone worked on the music.<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/> At first, Madonna did not like the songs she had recorded. She wanted ''Erotica'' to have a raw edge to it, as if it were recorded in an alley in [[Harlem]], and not a light glossy production to permeate her sound, according to Pettibone.<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/> The first recorded version of \"Deeper and Deeper\" was not working for Madonna. Pettibone said they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a [[flamenco guitar]].<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/> Pettibone recalled:\n<blockquote>\n\"Deeper and Deeper\" was one of those songs she always had a problem with. The middle of the song wasn't working. We tried different bridges and changes, but nothing worked. In the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar strumming big-time. I didn't like the idea of taking a Philly house song and putting '[[La Isla Bonita]]' in the middle of it. But that's what she wanted, so that's what she got.<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen\n |pos         = left\n |filename    = Madonna - Deeper and Deeper.ogg\n |title       = \"Deeper and Deeper\"\n |description = A 30 second sample from \"Deeper and Deeper\", where Madonna talks about the advice her mother gave her.\n |format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\"Deeper and Deeper\" was written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Anthony Shimkin and was produced by Madonna and Pettibone.

She moves from the twenties and thirties to the sixties and seventies and back again. She evokes [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Dita Parlo]] and [[Ingrid Thulin]] in ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|La caduta degli dei]]'' (''The Damned'', Luchino Visconti, 1969). She recreates the atmosphere of the underground films of Warhol, [[Paul Morrissey|Morrissey]], particularly ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'' (1968) and ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'' (1970). She echoes [[John Travolta]] in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977).

Our idols and demons will pursue us.

This is followed by scenes of Madonna, who portrays a character inspired by [[Warhol superstar]] [[Edie Sedgwick]] with her eyebrows shaved off, driving a [[Mercedes-Benz W111]] Convertible, visiting and walking around a [[nightclub]] where she dances with her friends and looks for her lover, Kier's character.<ref name=Bret/> According to Guilbert, the viewer is \"obviously meant to gather [Madonna's character] has signed some kind of Faustian pact with the diabolical Udo Kier.

Music Executive [[Seymour Stein]] the man credited for signing a then unknown Madonna to her first record label, Sire Records, also makes a brief cameo standing beside Madonna's good friend and rumored \"once upon a time\" lover Ingrid Casares.\n\"The images of 'Deeper and Deeper', associating drag, modeling, narcissism and lesbianism, provide a typical commentary on the construction of Madonna's success...[&] comfort Madonna's gay icon status, especially when you spot on the disco dance floor the voluminous drag queen Chi Chi LaRue, famous singer and director of gay pornographic movies\".<ref name=Guilbert />\n</blockquote>\n\nOther Warhol references in the video include a scene where Madonna and her girlfriends peel and eat a banana, sit on a couch and watch a long haired [[male stripper]] flex and exhibit himself on a mattress on the floor. The bananas have been thought to be a reference to the cover art of ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'', designed by Warhol.<ref name=Guilbert /> Guilbert also noted that during this particular scene, Stefano looked like \"a cross between Andy Warhol's fetish actor [[Joe Dallesandro]] and [[Iggy Pop]]\"; Dallesandro himself was allegedly approached by Madonna's people to do a cameo but declined the offer.<ref name=Ferguson>{{harvnb|Ferguson|2011|p=204}}</ref> Guilbert also pointed out  the scenes of Madonna driving the Mercedes as a direct reference to Visconti's works; \"She likes Visconti so much (even more than [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]) that it is possible to wonder whether her tributes to [[Marlene Dietrich]] are not occasionally filtered through her memorable scene of ''La caduta degli dei'', when [[Helmut Berger]] impersonates Dietrich\".<ref name=Guilbert1>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=70}}</ref> Up until 2009, the music video had never been commercially available; for unknown reasons, it wasn't included on 1999's ''[[The Video Collection 93:99]]''.

The song was written and produced by Madonna and [[Shep Pettibone]], with additional writing from Anthony Shimkin. It was released by [[Maverick Records]] as the album's second single on November 17, 1992. A shortened version of the song was included on Madonna's second greatest hits compilation, ''[[GHV2]]'' (2001). \"Deeper and Deeper\" is a [[dance music|dance]]-oriented song, and features instrumentation from acoustic guitars and [[castanet]] beats on its bridge. Lyrically, the song talks about [[sexual desire]], though it has been argued that it's actually about a young man coming to terms with his [[homosexuality]].\n\n\"Deeper and Deeper\" was met with positive reviews. Music critics hailed it as one of Madonna's strongest disco inspired tracks and complimented its refreshing dance oriented nature. It was also commercially successful; peaking at number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and reaching the Top 10 in several countries including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, while topping the charts in Italy.\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]] for \"Deeper and Deeper\" was directed by Bobby Woods. It was seen as a homage to American artist [[Andy Warhol]] and Italian director [[Luchino Visconti]]; it features Madonna playing a character based on [[Edie Sedgwick]], who goes out to a nightclub to meet her friends and boyfriend. Madonna has performed \"Deeper and Deeper\" in three of her [[List of Madonna concert tours|concert tours]]; the last being the [[Rebel Heart Tour]] (2015\u201316).\n\n==Background and development==\n[[File:Deeper&DeeperGirlieShowunderGround1 sh.jpg|thumb|right|Madonna and her back up singers [[Donna De Lory]] (''left'') and [[Niki Haris]] (''right''), perform \"Deeper and Deeper\" during 1993's [[The Girlie Show World Tour]].]]\nIn 1992, Madonna founded her own multi-media entertainment company, [[Maverick (entertainment company)|Maverick]], consisting of a record company ([[Maverick Records]]), a film production company ([[Maverick Films]]), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions.<ref name=\"maverick\">{{cite news|first=Stephen |last=Holden |authorlink=Stephen Holden|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/20/arts/madonna-makes-a-60-million-deal.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Madonna Makes a $60&nbsp;Million Deal|accessdate=July 25, 2015|date=April 20, 1992}}</ref> The first two projects from the venture were her fifth studio album, ''Erotica'', and a coffee table book of photographs featuring Madonna, entitled ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]''.<ref name=\"maverick\"/> For the album, Madonna primarily collaborated with producer [[Shep Pettibone]].  Pettibone first began working with Madonna during the 1980s, providing remixes for several of her singles.<ref name=SlantEro/> Alongside Pettibone, Madonna enlisted help from producer Andr\u00e9 Betts, who previously co-produced \"[[Justify My Love]]\" for ''The Immaculate Collection''.<ref name=SlantEro/> Madonna said that she was interested to work with Pettibone and Betts due to their ability to remain plugged into the dance underground, \"They come from opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of their music style and approach to music, but they're both connected to the street and they're still young and hungry.\"<ref name=\"andre\">{{cite journal|last=Flick|first=Larry|title=The Man Behind Madonna's 'Erotica'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22|journal=Billboard|location=New York|issn=0006-2510|date=November 28, 1992|accessdate=July 25, 2015|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Pettibone in an article \"Erotica Diaries\" published on Madonna's ''Icon'' magazine, he produced a tape with four songs, for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming ''[[A League of Their Own]]''.

Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. Madonna and Pettibone were in the studio for a week and then she would work with [[Steven Meisel]] on ''Sex'', for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet Andr\u00e9 Betts.<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/>  The first batch of songs Madonna and Pettibone worked together on were \"[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]\", \"Deeper and Deeper\", \"[[Rain (Madonna song)|Rain]]\" and \"Thief of Hearts\"; Madonna would write the lyrics as Pettibone worked on the music.<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/> At first, Madonna did not like the songs she had recorded. She wanted ''Erotica'' to have a raw edge to it, as if it were recorded in an alley in [[Harlem]], and not a light glossy production to permeate her sound, according to Pettibone.<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/> The first recorded version of \"Deeper and Deeper\" was not working for Madonna. Pettibone said they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a [[flamenco guitar]].<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/> Pettibone recalled:\n<blockquote>\n\"Deeper and Deeper\" was one of those songs she always had a problem with. The middle of the song wasn't working. We tried different bridges and changes, but nothing worked. In the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar strumming big-time. I didn't like the idea of taking a Philly house song and putting '[[La Isla Bonita]]' in the middle of it. But that's what she wanted, so that's what she got.<ref name=\"eroticadiaries\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen\n |pos         = left\n |filename    = Madonna - Deeper and Deeper.ogg\n |title       = \"Deeper and Deeper\"\n |description = A 30 second sample from \"Deeper and Deeper\", where Madonna talks about the advice her mother gave her.\n |format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\"Deeper and Deeper\" was written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Anthony Shimkin and was produced by Madonna and Pettibone.

an alliance of three [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] {{lang|nci|[[altepetl]]}} city-states: {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan|Mexico-Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|nci|[[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]|italic=no}}, and {{lang|nci|[[Tlacopan]]|italic=no}}. These three city-states ruled the area in and around the [[Valley of Mexico]] from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish {{lang|es|[[conquistador]]es}} and their native allies under {{lang|es|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]|italic=no}} defeated them in 1521.\n\nThe Triple Alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of {{lang|nci|[[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]]|italic=no}} and its former tributary provinces.<ref name=\"Smith2009\"/> Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}} quickly became dominant militarily.<ref name=\"Hassig 1988\">Hassig 1988</ref> By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the Alliance were effectively ruled from {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}, while the other partners in the alliance had taken subsidiary roles.\n\nThe alliance waged wars of conquest and expanded rapidly after its formation. At its height, the alliance controlled most of central [[Mexico]] as well as some more distant territories within [[Mesoamerica]], such as the [[Soconusco|Xoconochco province]], an Aztec [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] near the present-day [[Guatemala]]n border. Aztec rule has been described by scholars as \"[[hegemony|hegemonic]]\" or \"indirect\".<ref name=\"Smith2001\">Smith 2001</ref> The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual [[tribute]] to the Alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability, and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy.\n\nThe [[state religion]] of the empire was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], worshiping a diverse pantheon that included dozens of [[deities]]. Many had officially recognized cults large enough so that the deity was represented in the central temple precinct of the capital {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}. The imperial cult, specifically, was that of {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}}, the distinctive warlike patron god of the Mexica. Peoples in conquered provinces were allowed to retain and freely continue their own religious traditions, so long as they added the imperial god {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}} to their local pantheons.\n\n==Etymology and definitions==\n{{Main|Aztec#Definitions}}\nThe word \"[[Aztec]]\" in modern usage would not have been used by the people themselves. It has variously been used to refer to the Triple Alliance empire, the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking people of central Mexico prior to the Spanish conquest, or specifically the [[Mexica]] ethnicity of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples.<ref name=\"Smith2009p3-4\">Smith 2009 pp. 3\u20134</ref> The name comes from a Nahuatl word meaning \"people from [[Aztlan]],\" reflecting the mythical place of origin for Nahua peoples.<ref name=\"Smith1984\">Smith 1984</ref> For the purpose of this article, \"Aztec\" refers only to those cities that constituted or were subject to the Triple Alliance. For the broader use of the term, see the article on [[Aztec| Aztec civilization]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aztlan codex boturini.jpg|thumb|right|250px|First page of [[Codex Boturini]], showing the migration of the Mexica.]]\n===Before the Aztec Empire===\nNahua peoples descended from [[Chichimeca|Chichimec peoples]] who migrated to central Mexico from the north in the early 13th century.<ref name=\"Davies1973p3-22\">Davies 1973, pp. 3\u201322</ref> The migration story of the Mexica is similar to those of other polities in central Mexico, with supernatural sites, individuals, and events, joining earthly and divine history as they sought political legitimacy.<ref>Alfredo L\u00f3pez Austin, \"Aztec\" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture'', vol. 1, p. 68. Oxford University Press 2001.</ref>  According to the pictographic codices in which the Aztecs recorded their history, the place of origin was called [[Aztl\u00e1n]]. Early migrants settled the [[Basin of Mexico]] and surrounding lands by establishing a series of independent city-states. These early [[Nahuas|Nahua]] city-states or ''[[altepetl]]'', were ruled by dynastic heads called ''[[tlatoani|tlahtohqueh]]'' (singular, ''tlato\u0101ni''). Most of the existing settlements had been established by other indigenous peoples before the Mexica migration.<ref name=Smith2009p37>Smith 2009 p. 37</ref>\n\nThese early city-states fought various small-scale wars with each other, but due to shifting alliances, no individual city gained dominance.<ref>Calnek 1978</ref> The [[Mexica]] were the last of the Nahua migrants to arrive in Central Mexico. They entered the Basin of Mexico around the year 1250, and by then most of the good agricultural land had already been claimed.<ref name=\"Davies1973\">Davies 1973</ref> The Mexica persuaded the king of [[Culhuac\u00e1n (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], a small city-state but important historically as a refuge of the [[Toltecs]], to allow them to settle in a relatively infertile patch of land called [[Chapultepec]] (''Chapoltep\u0113c,'' \"in the hill of grasshoppers\"). The Mexica served as mercenaries for Culhuacan.<ref name=\"Tezozomocp49-51\">Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975 pp. 49\u201351</ref>\n\nAfter the Mexica served Culhuacan in battle, the ruler appointed one of his daughters to rule over the Mexica. According to mythological native accounts, the Mexica instead sacrificed her by flaying her skin, on the command of their god [[Xipe Totec]].<ref name=\"Tezozomocp52-60\">Alvarado Tezozomoc (1975), pp. 52\u201360</ref> When the ruler of Culhuacan learned of this, he attacked and used his army to drive the Mexica from Tizaapan by force. The Mexica moved to an island in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]], where an eagle nested on a [[nopal]] cactus. The Mexica interpreted this as a sign from their gods and founded their new city, [[Tenochtitlan]], on this island in the year ''\u014dme calli,'' or \"Two House\" (1325 AD).<ref name=\"Smith2009\"/>\n\n===Aztec warfare===\n{{Main|Aztec warfare}}\nThe Mexican rose to prominence as fierce warriors and were able to establish themselves as a military power.  The importance of warriors and the integral nature of warfare in Mexica political and religious life helped propel them to emerge as the dominant military power prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1519.\n\nThe new Mexica city-state allied with the city of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]] and paid tribute to its ruler, [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p44\">Smith 2009 p. 44</ref> With Mexica assistance, Azcopotzalco began to expand into a small tributary empire. Until this point, the Mexica ruler was not recognized as a legitimate king. Mexica leaders successfully petitioned one of the kings of Culhuacan to provide a daughter to marry into the Mexica line. Their son, [[Acamapichtli]], was enthroned as the first ''tlatoani'' of Tenochtitlan in the year 1372.<ref name=\"Tezozomoc\">Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Tepanec]]s of Azcapotzalco expanded their rule with help from the Mexica, the [[Acolhua]] city of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] grew in power in the eastern portion of the lake basin. Eventually, war erupted between the two states, and the Mexica played a vital role in the conquest of Texcoco. By then, Tenochtitlan had grown into a major city and was rewarded for its loyalty to the Tepanecs by receiving Texcoco as a tributary province.<ref name=\"Smith2009p46\">Smith 2009 p. 46</ref>\n\n===Tepanec War===\n\nIn 1426, the Tepanec king Tezozomoc died,<ref name=\"Bierhorst1985\">{{cite book|author=John Bierhorst|title=A Nahuatl-English Dictionary and Concordance to the Cantares Mexicanos: With an Analytic Transcription and Grammatical Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRUJDW2tW1YC&pg=PA319|year=1985|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1183-8|page=319}}</ref><ref name=\"Somervill2009\">{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

But his son, [[Maxtla]], soon usurped the throne and turned against factions that opposed him, including the Mexica ruler [[Chimalpopoca]]. The latter died shortly thereafter, possibly assassinated by Maxtla.<ref name=\"Davies1973\"/>\n\nThe new Mexica ruler [[Itzcoatl]] continued to defy Maxtla; he blockaded Tenochtitlan and demanded increased tribute payments.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\">Smith 2009 p. 47</ref> Maxtla similarly turned against the [[Acolhua]], and the king of Texcoco, [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], fled into exile. Nezahualcoyotl recruited military help from the king of Huexotzinco, and the Mexica gained the support of a dissident Tepanec city, [[Tlacopan]]. In 1427, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan, and Huexotzinco went to war against Azcapotzalco, emerging victorious in 1428.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/>\n\nAfter the war, Huexotzinco withdrew, and in 1430 <ref name=\"arqueologiamexicana.mx\"/>, the three remaining cities formed a treaty known today as the Triple Alliance.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/> The Tepanec lands were carved up among the three cities, whose leaders agreed to cooperate in future wars of conquest. Land acquired from these conquests was to be held by the three cities together. Tribute was to be divided so that two-fifths each went to Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, and one-fifth went to Tlacopan. Each of the three kings of the alliance in turn assumed the title \"huetlatoani\" (\"Elder Speaker\", often translated as \"Emperor\"). In this role, each temporarily held a ''[[de jure]]'' position above the rulers of other city-states (\"tlatoani\").<ref name=\"Evans2008p460\">Evans 2008, p. 460</ref>\n\nIn the next 100 years, the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan came to dominate the Valley of Mexico and extend its power to the shores of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]]. Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance. Two of the primary architects of this alliance were the half-brothers [[Tlacaelel]] and [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]], nephews of Itzcoatl. Moctezuma eventually succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica ''huetlatoani'' in 1440. Tlacaelel occupied the newly created title of \"[[Cihuacoatl (position)|Cihuacoatl]]\", equivalent to something between \"Prime Minister\" and \"Viceroy\".<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/><ref>The term ''cihu\u0101c\u014d\u0101tl'' literally means \"woman-snake\" or \"female snake\", and the origin of this designation is not well understood. The position was certainly not reserved for women, although the title may perhaps suggest a metaphoric dichotomy between the \"masculine\" ''Tlahto\u0101ni'' dealing with external imperial affairs and the \"feminine\" ''Cihu\u0101c\u014d\u0101tl'' managing the domestic affairs.</ref>\n\n===Imperial reforms===\n[[File:Jaguar warrior.jpg|thumb|[[Jaguar Warrior]], from the [[Codex Magliabechiano]].]]\n\nShortly after the formation of the Triple Alliance, Itzcoatl and Tlacopan instigated sweeping reforms on the Aztec state and [[Aztec religion|religion]]. It has been alleged that Tlacaelel ordered the burning of some or most of the extant Aztec books, claiming that they contained lies and that it was \"not wise that all the people should know the paintings\".<ref name=\"Leon-Portilla1963p155\">Leon-Portilla 1963 p. 155</ref> Even if he did order such book-burnings, it was probably limited primarily to documents containing political propaganda from previous regimes; he thereafter rewrote the history of the Aztecs, naturally placing the Mexica in a more central role. {{Citation needed|reason=How do we know the book-burnings were limited to \"propaganda\"? This is a serious historical claim that should be backed with a source.|date=July 2019}}\n\nAfter [[Moctezuma I]] succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica emperor, more reforms were instigated to maintain control over conquered cities.<ref name=\"Smith2009p48\">Smith 2009 p. 48</ref> Uncooperative kings were replaced with puppet rulers loyal to the Mexica. A new imperial tribute system established Mexica tribute collectors that taxed the population directly, bypassing the authority of local dynasties. Nezahualcoyotl also instituted a policy in the Acolhua lands of granting subject kings tributary holdings in lands far from their capitals.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\">Evans 2008 p. 462</ref> This was done to create an incentive for cooperation with the empire; if a city's king rebelled, he lost the tribute he received from foreign land. Some rebellious kings were replaced by ''calpixqueh'', or appointed governors rather than dynastic rulers.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\"/>\n\nMoctezuma issued new laws that further separated nobles from commoners and instituted the death penalty for adultery and other offenses.<ref name=\"Duran1994p209-210\">Duran 1994, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> By royal decree, a religiously supervised school was built in every neighborhood.<ref name=\"Duran1994p209-210\"/> Commoner neighborhoods had a school called a \"telpochcalli\" where they received basic religious instruction and military training.<ref name=\"Evans2008p456-457\">Evans 2008 pp. 456\u2013457</ref> A second, more prestigious type of school called a \"calmecac\" served to teach the nobility, as well as commoners of high standing seeking to become priests or artisans. Moctezuma also created a new title called \"quauhpilli\" that could be conferred on commoners.<ref name=\"Smith2009p48\"/> This title was a form of non-hereditary lesser nobility awarded for outstanding military or civil service (similar to the English [[knight]]). In some rare cases, commoners that received this title married into royal families and became kings.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\"/>\n\nOne component of this reform was the creation of an institution of regulated warfare called the [[flower war|Flower Wars]]. Mesoamerican warfare overall is characterized by a strong preference for capturing live prisoners as opposed to slaughtering the enemy on the battlefield, which was considered sloppy and gratuitous. The Flower Wars are a potent manifestation of this approach to warfare. These highly ritualized wars ensured a steady, healthy supply of experienced Aztec warriors as well as a steady, healthy supply of captured enemy warriors for [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifice]] to the gods. Flower wars were pre-arranged by officials on both sides and conducted specifically for the purpose of each polity collecting prisoners for sacrifice.<ref name=\"Evans2008p451\">Evans 2008, p. 451</ref> According to native historical accounts, these wars were instigated by Tlacaelel as a means of appeasing the gods in response to a massive drought that gripped the Basin of Mexico from 1450 to 1454.<ref name=\"Duran1994\">Duran 1994</ref> The flower wars were mostly waged between the Aztec Empire and the neighboring cities of their arch-enemy [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].\n\n===Early years of expansion===\n[[File:Aztecexpansion.png|thumb|450px|Map of the expansion of the empire, showing the areas conquered by the Aztec rulers.<ref>Based on Hassig 1988.</ref>]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Tepanecs, Itzcoatl and Nezahualcoyotl rapidly consolidated power in the Basin of Mexico and began to expand beyond its borders. The first targets for imperial expansion were Coyoacan in the Basin of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac and Huaxtepec in the modern Mexican state of [[Morelos]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p47-48\">Smith 2009 pp. 47\u201348</ref> These conquests provided the new empire with a large influx of tribute, especially agricultural goods.\n\nOn the death of Itzcoatl, Moctezuma I was enthroned as the new Mexica emperor. The expansion of the empire was briefly halted by a major four-year drought that hit the Basin of Mexico in 1450, and several cities in Morelos had to be re-conquered after the drought subsided.<ref>Smith 2009 p. 49</ref> Moctezuma and Nezahualcoyotl continued to expand the empire east towards the Gulf of Mexico and south into [[Oaxaca]]. In 1468, Moctezuma I died and was succeeded by his son, [[Axayacatl]]. Most of Axayacatl's thirteen-year-reign was spent consolidating the territory acquired under his predecessor. Motecuzoma and Nezahualcoyotl had expanded rapidly and many provinces rebelled.<ref name=\"Davies1973\"/>\n\nAt the same time as the Aztec Empire was expanding and consolidating power, the [[Pur\u00e9pecha Empire]] in West Mexico was similarly expanding. In 1455, the Pur\u00e9pecha under their king Tzitzipandaquare had invaded the Toluca Valley, claiming lands previously conquered by Motecuzoma and Itzcoatl.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\">Pollard 1993, p. 169</ref> In 1472, Axayacatl re-conquered the region and successfully defended it from Pur\u00e9pecha attempts to take it back. In 1479, Axayacatl launched a major invasion of the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire with 32,000 Aztec soldiers.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> The Pur\u00e9pecha met them just across the border with 50,000 soldiers and scored a resounding victory, killing or capturing over 90% of the Aztec army. Axayacatl himself was wounded in the battle, retreated to Tenochtitlan, and never engaged the Pur\u00e9pecha in battle again.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\">Smith 2009 p. 51</ref>\n\nIn 1472, Nezahualcoyotl died and his son [[Nezahualpilli]] was enthroned as the new huetlatoani of Texcoco.<ref name=\"Evans2008p450\">Evans 2008, p. 450</ref> This was followed by the death of Axayacatl in 1481.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Axayacatl was replaced by his brother [[Tizoc]]. Tizoc's reign was notoriously brief. He proved to be ineffectual and did not significantly expand the empire. Apparently due to his incompetence, Tizoc was likely assassinated by his own nobles five years into his rule.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/>\n\n===Later years of expansion===\n[[File:Aztec Empire 1519 map-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The maximal extent of the Aztec Empire, according to Mar\u00eda del Carmen Solanes Carraro and Enrique Vela Ram\u00edrez.]]\n\nTizoc was succeeded by his brother [[Ahuitzotl]] in 1486. Like his predecessors, the first part of Ahuitzotl's reign was spent suppressing rebellions that were commonplace due to the indirect nature of Aztec rule.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Ahuitzotl then began a new wave of conquests including the [[Oaxaca Valley]] and the [[Soconusco|Soconusco Coast]]. Due to increased border skirmishes with the Pur\u00e9pechas, Ahuitzotl conquered the border city of Otzoma and turned the city into a military outpost.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\">Smith 2009 p. 54</ref> The population of Otzoma was either killed or dispersed in the process.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> The Pur\u00e9pecha subsequently established fortresses nearby to protect against Aztec expansion.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> Ahuitzotl responded by expanding further west to the Pacific Coast of [[Guerrero]].\n\nBy the reign of Ahuitzotl, the Mexica were the largest and most powerful faction in the Aztec Triple Alliance.<ref>Smith 2009 pp. 50\u201351</ref> Building on the prestige the Mexica had acquired over the course of the conquests, Ahuitzotl began to use the title \"huehuetlatoani\" (\"Eldest Speaker\") to distinguish himself from the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Even though the alliance still technically ran the empire, the Mexica Emperor now assumed nominal if not actual seniority.\n\nAhuitzotl was succeeded by his nephew [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuzoma II]] in 1502. Moctezuma II spent most of his reign consolidating power in lands conquered by his predecessors.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> In 1515, Aztec armies commanded by the Tlaxcalan general Tlahuicole invaded the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire once again.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169-170\">Pollard 1993 pp. 169\u2013170</ref> The Aztec army failed to take any territory and was mostly restricted to raiding.

Cort\u00e9s had actually been removed as the expedition's commander by the governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Diego Vel\u00e1squez]], but had stolen the boats and left without permission.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003pp35-40\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 35\u201340</ref> At the island of Cozumel, Cort\u00e9s encountered a shipwrecked Spaniard named [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] who joined the expedition and translated between Spanish and Mayan. The expedition then sailed west to Campeche, where after a brief battle with the local army, Cort\u00e9s was able to negotiate peace through his interpreter, Aguilar. The King of Campeche gave Cort\u00e9s a second translator, a bilingual Nahua-Maya slave woman named [[La Malinche]] (she was known also as Malinalli [mali\u02c8nal\u02d0i], Malintzin [ma\u02c8lintsin] or Do\u00f1a Marina [\u02c8do\u0272a ma\u02c8\u027eina] ). Aguilar translated from Spanish to Mayan and La Malinche translated from Mayan to Nahuatl. Once Malinche learned Spanish, she became Cort\u00e9s's translator for both language and culture, and was a key figure in interactions with [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] rulers.

Nearby, he founded the town of [[Veracruz]] where he met with ambassadors from the reigning Mexica emperor, [[Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin|Motecuzoma II]]. When the ambassadors returned to Tenochtitlan, Cort\u00e9s went to Cempoala to meet with the local [[Totonac]] leaders. After the Totonac ruler told Cort\u00e9s of his various grievances against the Mexica, Cort\u00e9s convinced the Totonacs to imprison an imperial tribute collector.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003pp92-94\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 92\u201394</ref> Cort\u00e9s subsequently released the tribute collector after persuading him that the move was entirely the Totonac's idea and that he had no knowledge of it.

After fighting several close battles, Cort\u00e9s eventually convinced the leaders of Tlaxcala to order their general to stand down. Cort\u00e9s then secured an alliance with the people of Tlaxcala, and traveled from there to the Basin of Mexico with a smaller company of 5,000-6,000 Tlaxcalans and 400 Totonacs, in addition to the Spanish soldiers.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> During his stay in the city of Cholula, Cort\u00e9s claims he received word of a planned ambush against the Spanish.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> In a pre-emptive response, Cort\u00e9s directed his troops attack and kill a large number of unarmed Cholulans gathered in the main square of the city.\n\nFollowing the massacre at Cholula, Hernan Cort\u00e9s and the other Spaniards entered Tenochtitlan, where they were greeted as guests and given quarters in the palace of former emperor Axayacatl.<ref name=\"Smith2009p275\">Smith 2009 p. 275</ref> After staying in the city for six weeks, two Spaniards from the group left behind in Veracruz were killed in an altercation with an Aztec lord named Quetzalpopoca.

In the theoretical framework of imperial systems posited by American historian [[Alexander J. Motyl]] the Aztec empire was an informal type of empire in that the Alliance did not claim supreme authority over its tributary provinces; it merely expected tributes to be paid.<ref name=\"motyl\">{{cite book\n | last = Motyl\n | first = Alexander J.\n | title = Imperial Ends: The Decay, Collapse, and Revival of Empires\n | year = 2001\n | publisher = Columbia University Press\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-231-12110-5\n | pages = 13, 19\u201321, 32\u201336\n}}</ref> The empire was also territorially discontinuous, i.e. not all of its dominated territories were connected by land. For example, the southern peripheral zones of [[Soconusco|Xoconochco]] were not in immediate contact with the central part of the empire. The [[hegemonic]] nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tribute payments were made.<ref>Berdan, ''et al.'' (1996), Aztec Imperial Strategies. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC</ref>\n\nAlthough the form of government is often referred to as an empire, in fact most areas within the empire were organized as city-states (individually known as ''[[altepetl]]'' in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Aztecs). These were small polities ruled by a king or ''tlatoani'' (literally \"speaker\", plural ''tlatoque'') from an aristocratic dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepeme. Even after the empire was formed in 1428 and began its program of expansion through conquest, the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.<ref>Smith, Michael E. (2000), Aztec City-States. In A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures, edited by [[Mogens Herman Hansen]], pp. 581\u2013595. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Copenhagen.</ref>\n\nIt should be remembered that the term \"Aztec empire\" is a modern one, not one used by the Aztec themselves. The Aztec realm was at its core composed of three [[Nahuatl]]-speaking city states in the densely populated Valley of Mexico. Over time, asymmetries of power elevated one of those city states, Tenochtitlan, above the other two. The \"Triple Alliance\" came to establish [[hegemony]] over much of central Mesoamerica, including areas of great linguistic and cultural diversity. Administration of the empire was performed through largely traditional, indirect means. However, over time something of a nascent [[bureaucracy]] may have been beginning to form insofar as the state organization became increasingly centralized.\n\n===Central administration===\n[[Image:Tlacochcalcatl.jpg|thumb|180px|A ''[[tlacochcalcatl]]'' pictured in the [[Codex Mendoza]]]]\nBefore the reign of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] (1429\u20131472), the Aztec empire operated as a confederation along traditional [[Mesoamerica]]n lines. Independent altepetl were led by tlatoani (lit., \"speakers\"), who supervised village headmen, who in turn supervised groups of households. A typical Mesoamerican confederation placed a ''[[Huey Tlatoani]]'' (lit., \"great speaker\") at the head of several tlatoani. Following Nezahualcoyotl, the Aztec empire followed a somewhat divergent path, with some tlatoani of recently conquered or otherwise subordinated altepetl becoming replaced with ''calpixque'' stewards charged with collecting tribute on behalf of the Huetlatoani rather than simply replacing an old tlatoque with new ones from the same set of local nobility.<ref>\nEvans, Susan T. (2004). Ancient Mexico & Central America: Archaeology and Culture History. Thames & Hudson: New York, pp. 443\u2013446, 449\u2013451</ref>\n\nYet the Huey tlatoani was not the sole executive. It was the responsibility of the Huey tlatoani to deal with the ''external'' issues of empire; the management of tribute, war, diplomacy, and expansion were all under the purview of the Huey tlatoani. It was the role of the ''[[Cihuacoatl]]'' to govern a given city itself. The Cihuacoatl was always a close relative of the Huey tlatoani; [[Tlacaelel]], for example, was the brother of Moctezuma I. Both the title \"Cihuacoatl\", which means \"female snake\" (it is the name of a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] deity), and the role of the position, somewhat analogous to a European [[Viceroy]] or [[Prime Minister]], reflect the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature of Nahua [[cosmology]]. Neither the position of Cihuacoatl nor the position of Huetlatoani were priestly, yet both did have important ritual tasks. Those of the former were associated with the \"female\" wet season, those of the latter with the \"male\" dry season. While the position of Cihuacoatl is best attested in Tenochtitlan, it is known that the position also existed the nearby altepetl of [[Atzcapotzalco]], [[Culhuac\u00e1n (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], and Tenochtitlan's ally [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. Despite the apparent lesser status of the position, a Cihuacoatl could prove both influential and powerful, as in the case of Tlacaelel.<ref>\nCoe, Michael D. (1984). Mexico, 3rd Ed.

Thames & Hudson: London, pp. 200\u2013202.\n</ref>\n\nEarly in the history of the empire, Tenochtitlan developed a four-member military and advisory Council which assisted the Huey tlatoani in his decision-making: the ''tlacochcalcatl''; the ''tlaccatecatl''; the ''ezhuahuacatl'';<ref name=\"BerdanAnawalt1992p196\">\nBerdan, Francis F. and Patricia Rieff Anawalt. 1992. The Codex Mendoza Vol. 1. University of California Press, p. 196</ref> and the ''tlillancalqui''. This design not only provided advise for the ruler, it also served to contain ambition on the part of the nobility, as henceforth [[Huey Tlatoani]] could only be selected from the Council. Moreover, the actions of any one member of the Council could easily be blocked by the other three, providing a simple system of checks on the ambition higher officials. These four Council members were also generals, members of various military societies. The ranks of the members were not equal, with the tlacochcalcatl and tlaccatecatl having a higher status than the others. These two Councillors were members of the two most prestigious military societies, the ''cuauhchique'' (\"shorn ones\") and the ''otontin'' (\"[[Otomi (military)|Otomies]]\").<ref>Brumfiel, Elizabeth M.

Thames & Hudson: London, p. 204.</ref>\n\n===Provincial administration===\nTraditionally, provinces and altepetl were governed by hereditary tlatoani. As the empire grew, the system evolved further and some tlatoani were replaced by other officials. The other officials had similar authority to tlatoani. As has already been mentioned, directly appointed stewards (singular ''calpixqui'', plural ''calpixque'') were sometimes imposed on altepetl instead of the selection of provincial nobility to the same position of tlatoani. At the height of empire, the organization of the state into tributary and strategic provinces saw an elaboration of this system. The 38 tributary provinces fell under the supervision of high stewards, or ''huecalpixque'', whose authority extended over the lower-ranking calpixque. These calpixque and huecalpixque were essentially managers of the provincial tribute system which was overseen and coordinated in the paramount capital of Tenochtitlan not by the ''huetlatoani'', but rather by a separate position altogether: the ''petlacalcatl''. On the occasion that a recently conquered altepetl was seen as particularly restive, a military governor, or ''cuauhtlatoani'', was placed at the head of provincial supervision.<ref>Calnek, Edward E. (1982). Patterns of Empire Formation in the Valley of Mexico, in The Inca and Aztec States: 1400\u20131800. Collier, Rosaldo & Wirth (Eds.) Academic Press: New York, pp. 56\u201359</ref> During the reign of Moctezuma I, the calpixque system was elaborated, with two calpixque assigned per tributary province. One was stationed in the province itself, perhaps for supervising the collection of tribute, and the other in Tenochtitlan, perhaps for supervising storage of tribute. Tribute was drawn from commoners, the ''macehualtin'', and distributed to the nobility, be they 'kings' (''tlatoque''), lesser rulers (''teteuctin''), or provincial nobility (''pipiltin'').<ref>Smith, Michael E. (1986). Social Stratification in the Aztec Empire: A View from the Provinces, in American Anthropologist,\n(88)1, p. 74</ref>\n\nTribute collection was supervised by the above officials and relied upon the coercive power of the Aztec military, but also upon the cooperation of the ''pipiltin'' (the local nobility who were themselves exempt from and recipient to tribute) and the hereditary class of merchants known as ''pochteca''. These pochteca had various gradations of ranks which granted them certain trading rights and so were not necessarily pipiltin themselves, yet they played an important role in both the growth and administration of the Aztec tributary system nonetheless. The power, political and economic, of the pochteca was strongly tied to the political and military power of the Aztec nobility and state. In addition to serving as diplomats (''teucnenenque'', or \"travelers of the lord\") and spies in the prelude to conquest, higher-ranking pochteca also served as judges in market plazas and were to certain degree autonomous [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]], having administrative duties within their own [[Estates of the Realm|estate]].<ref>Kurtz, Donald V.

As such, they were known as the 'Triple Alliance.' This political form was very common in Mesoamerica, where alliances of city-states were ever fluctuating. However, over time, it was Tenochtitlan which assumed paramount authority in the alliance, and although each partner city shared spoils of war and rights to regular tribute from the provinces and were governed by their own Huetlatoani, it was Tenochtitlan which became the largest, most powerful, and most influential of the three cities. It was the de facto and acknowledged center of empire.<ref>Brumfiel, Elizabeth M. (2001). Religion and state in the Aztec Empire, in Empires (Alcock et al, Eds). Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, p. 284</ref>\n\nThough they were not described by the Aztec this way, there were essentially two types of provinces: Tributary and Strategic. Strategic provinces were essentially subordinate [[client states]] which provided tribute or aid to the Aztec state under \"mutual consent\". Tributary provinces, on the other hand, provided regular tribute to the empire; obligations on the part of Tributary provinces were mandatory rather than consensual.<ref name=Evans470-471>Evans, pp. 470\u2013471</ref><ref name=Smith1-2>Smith, Michael E.

''Tlatocayotl'', or the principle of rulership, established that this divine right was inherited by descent. Political order was therefore also a cosmic order, and to kill a tlatoani was to transgress that order. For that reason, whenever a tlatoani was killed or otherwise removed from their station, a relative and member of the same bloodline was typically placed in their stead.

It was under this new, militaristic interpretation of Huitzilopochtli that Aztec soldiers were encouraged to fight wars and capture enemy soldiers for sacrifice. Though blood sacrifice was common in Mesoamerica, the scale of [[human sacrifice]] under the Aztecs was likely unprecedented in the region.<ref>Le\u00f3n-Portilla, Miguel. (1963).

The law code in Texcoco under Nezahualcoyotl was legalistic, that is cases were tried by particular types of evidence and the social status of the litigants was disregarded, and consisted of 80 written laws. These laws called for severe, publicly administered punishments, creating a legal framework of social control.<ref>Offner, Jerome A. ''Law and Politics in Aztec Texcoco''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp.81-82.</ref>\n\nMuch less is known about the legal system in Tenochtitlan, which might be less legalistic or sophisticated as those of Texcoco for this period.<ref>Offner, 1983, p. 83</ref> It was established under the reign of [[Moctezuma I]]. These laws served to establish and govern relations between the state, classes, and individuals. Punishment was to be meted out solely by state authorities. Nahua mores were enshrined in these laws, criminalizing public acts of homosexuality, drunkenness, and nudity, not to mention more universal proscriptions against theft, murder, and property damage. As stated before, ''pochteca'' could serve as judges, often exercising judicial oversight of their own members. Likewise, [[Court-martial|military courts]] dealt with both cases within the military and without during wartime. There was an [[appeal]] process, with appellate courts standing between local, typically market-place courts, on the provincial level and a [[supreme court]] and two special higher appellate courts at Tenochtitlan. One of those two special courts dealt with cases arising within Tenochtitlan, the other with cases originating from outside the capital. The ultimate judicial authority laid in hands of the ''[[Huey tlatoani]]'', who had the right to appoint lesser judges.<ref>Kurtz, p. 307</ref>\n\n==Rulers==\n{{see also|Aztec emperors family tree}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Tenochtitlan\n!

an alliance of three [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] {{lang|nci|[[altepetl]]}} city/states: {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan|Mexico-Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|nci|[[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]|italic=no}}, and {{lang|nci|[[Tlacopan]]|italic=no}}. These three city-states ruled the area in and around the [[Valley of Mexico]] from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish {{lang|es|[[conquistador]]es}} and their native allies under {{lang|es|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]|italic=no}} defeated them in 1521.\n\nThe Triple Alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of {{lang|nci|[[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]]|italic=no}} and its former tributary provinces.<ref name=\"Smith2009\"/> Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}} quickly became dominant militarily.<ref name=\"Hassig 1988\">Hassig 1988</ref> By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the Alliance were effectively ruled from {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}, while the other partners in the alliance had taken subsidiary roles.\n\nThe alliance waged wars of conquest and expanded rapidly after its formation. At its height, the alliance controlled most of central [[Mexico]] as well as some more distant territories within [[Mesoamerica]], such as the [[Soconusco|Xoconochco province]], an Aztec [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] near the present-day [[Guatemala]]n border. Aztec rule has been described by scholars as \"[[hegemony|hegemonic]]\" or \"indirect\".<ref name=\"Smith2001\">Smith 2001</ref> The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual [[tribute]] to the Alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability, and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy.\n\nThe [[state religion]] of the empire was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], worshiping a diverse pantheon that included dozens of [[deities]]. Many had officially recognized cults large enough so that the deity was represented in the central temple precinct of the capital {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}. The imperial cult, specifically, was that of {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}}, the distinctive warlike patron god of the Mexica. Peoples in conquered provinces were allowed to retain and freely continue their own religious traditions, so long as they added the imperial god {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}} to their local pantheons.\n\n==Etymology and definitions==\n{{Main|Aztec#Definitions}}\nThe word \"[[Aztec]]\" in modern usage would not have been used by the people themselves. It has variously been used to refer to the Triple Alliance empire, the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking people of central Mexico prior to the Spanish conquest, or specifically the [[Mexica]] ethnicity of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples.<ref name=\"Smith2009p3-4\">Smith 2009 pp. 3\u20134</ref> The name comes from a Nahuatl word meaning \"people from [[Aztlan]],\" reflecting the mythical place of origin for Nahua peoples.<ref name=\"Smith1984\">Smith 1984</ref> For the purpose of this article, \"Aztec\" refers only to those cities that constituted or were subject to the Triple Alliance. For the broader use of the term, see the article on [[Aztec| Aztec civilization]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aztlan codex boturini.jpg|thumb|right|250px|First page of [[Codex Boturini]], showing the migration of the Mexica.]]\n===Before the Aztec Empire===\nNahua peoples descended from [[Chichimeca|Chichimec peoples]] who migrated to central Mexico from the north in the early 13th century.<ref name=\"Davies1973p3-22\">Davies 1973, pp. 3\u201322</ref> The migration story of the Mexica is similar to those of other polities in central Mexico, with supernatural sites, individuals, and events, joining earthly and divine history as they sought political legitimacy.<ref>Alfredo L\u00f3pez Austin, \"Aztec\" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture'', vol. 1, p. 68. Oxford University Press 2001.</ref>  According to the pictographic codices in which the Aztecs recorded their history, the place of origin was called [[Aztl\u00e1n]]. Early migrants settled the [[Basin of Mexico]] and surrounding lands by establishing a series of independent city-states. These early [[Nahuas|Nahua]] city-states or ''[[altepetl]]'', were ruled by dynastic heads called ''[[tlatoani|tlahtohqueh]]'' (singular, ''tlato\u0101ni''). Most of the existing settlements had been established by other indigenous peoples before the Mexica migration.<ref name=Smith2009p37>Smith 2009 p. 37</ref>\n\nThese early city-states fought various small-scale wars with each other, but due to shifting alliances, no individual city gained dominance.<ref>Calnek 1978</ref> The [[Mexica]] were the last of the Nahua migrants to arrive in Central Mexico. They entered the Basin of Mexico around the year 1250, and by then most of the good agricultural land had already been claimed.<ref name=\"Davies1973\">Davies 1973</ref> The Mexica persuaded the king of [[Culhuac\u00e1n (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], a small city-state but important historically as a refuge of the [[Toltecs]], to allow them to settle in a relatively infertile patch of land called [[Chapultepec]] (''Chapoltep\u0113c,'' \"in the hill of grasshoppers\"). The Mexica served as mercenaries for Culhuacan.<ref name=\"Tezozomocp49-51\">Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975 pp. 49\u201351</ref>\n\nAfter the Mexica served Culhuacan in battle, the ruler appointed one of his daughters to rule over the Mexica. According to mythological native accounts, the Mexica instead sacrificed her by flaying her skin, on the command of their god [[Xipe Totec]].<ref name=\"Tezozomocp52-60\">Alvarado Tezozomoc (1975), pp. 52\u201360</ref> When the ruler of Culhuacan learned of this, he attacked and used his army to drive the Mexica from Tizaapan by force. The Mexica moved to an island in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]], where an eagle nested on a [[nopal]] cactus. The Mexica interpreted this as a sign from their gods and founded their new city, [[Tenochtitlan]], on this island in the year ''\u014dme calli,'' or \"Two House\" (1325 AD).<ref name=\"Smith2009\"/>\n\n===Aztec warfare===\n{{Main|Aztec warfare}}\nThe Mexican rose to prominence as fierce warriors and were able to establish themselves as a military power.  The importance of warriors and the integral nature of warfare in Mexica political and religious life helped propel them to emerge as the dominant military power prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1519.\n\nThe new Mexica city-state allied with the city of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]] and paid tribute to its ruler, [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p44\">Smith 2009 p. 44</ref> With Mexica assistance, Azcopotzalco began to expand into a small tributary empire. Until this point, the Mexica ruler was not recognized as a legitimate king. Mexica leaders successfully petitioned one of the kings of Culhuacan to provide a daughter to marry into the Mexica line. Their son, [[Acamapichtli]], was enthroned as the first ''tlatoani'' of Tenochtitlan in the year 1372.<ref name=\"Tezozomoc\">Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Tepanec]]s of Azcapotzalco expanded their rule with help from the Mexica, the [[Acolhua]] city of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] grew in power in the eastern portion of the lake basin. Eventually, war erupted between the two states, and the Mexica played a vital role in the conquest of Texcoco. By then, Tenochtitlan had grown into a major city and was rewarded for its loyalty to the Tepanecs by receiving Texcoco as a tributary province.<ref name=\"Smith2009p46\">Smith 2009 p. 46</ref>\n\n===Tepanec War===\n\nIn 1426, the Tepanec king Tezozomoc died,<ref name=\"Bierhorst1985\">{{cite book|author=John Bierhorst|title=A Nahuatl-English Dictionary and Concordance to the Cantares Mexicanos: With an Analytic Transcription and Grammatical Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRUJDW2tW1YC&pg=PA319|year=1985|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1183-8|page=319}}</ref><ref name=\"Somervill2009\">{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

But his son, [[Maxtla]], soon usurped the throne and turned against factions that opposed him, including the Mexica ruler [[Chimalpopoca]]. The latter died shortly thereafter, possibly assassinated by Maxtla.<ref name=\"Davies1973\"/>\n\nThe new Mexica ruler [[Itzcoatl]] continued to defy Maxtla; he blockaded Tenochtitlan and demanded increased tribute payments.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\">Smith 2009 p. 47</ref> Maxtla similarly turned against the [[Acolhua]], and the king of Texcoco, [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], fled into exile. Nezahualcoyotl recruited military help from the king of Huexotzinco, and the Mexica gained the support of a dissident Tepanec city, [[Tlacopan]]. In 1427, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan, and Huexotzinco went to war against Azcapotzalco, emerging victorious in 1428.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/>\n\nAfter the war, Huexotzinco withdrew, and in 1430 <ref name=\"arqueologiamexicana.mx\"/>, the three remaining cities formed a treaty known today as the Triple Alliance.<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/> The Tepanec lands were carved up among the three cities, whose leaders agreed to cooperate in future wars of conquest. Land acquired from these conquests was to be held by the three cities together. Tribute was to be divided so that two-fifths each went to Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, and one-fifth went to Tlacopan. Each of the three kings of the alliance in turn assumed the title \"huetlatoani\" (\"Elder Speaker\", often translated as \"Emperor\"). In this role, each temporarily held a ''[[de jure]]'' position above the rulers of other city-states (\"tlatoani\").<ref name=\"Evans2008p460\">Evans 2008, p. 460</ref>\n\nIn the next 100 years, the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan came to dominate the Valley of Mexico and extend its power to the shores of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]]. Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance. Two of the primary architects of this alliance were the half-brothers [[Tlacaelel]] and [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]], nephews of Itzcoatl. Moctezuma eventually succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica ''huetlatoani'' in 1440. Tlacaelel occupied the newly created title of \"[[Cihuacoatl (position)|Cihuacoatl]]\", equivalent to something between \"Prime Minister\" and \"Viceroy\".<ref name=\"Smith2009p47\"/><ref>The term ''cihu\u0101c\u014d\u0101tl'' literally means \"woman-snake\" or \"female snake\", and the origin of this designation is not well understood. The position was certainly not reserved for women, although the title may perhaps suggest a metaphoric dichotomy between the \"masculine\" ''Tlahto\u0101ni'' dealing with external imperial affairs and the \"feminine\" ''Cihu\u0101c\u014d\u0101tl'' managing the domestic affairs.</ref>\n\n===Imperial reforms===\n[[File:Jaguar warrior.jpg|thumb|[[Jaguar Warrior]], from the [[Codex Magliabechiano]].]]\n\nShortly after the formation of the Triple Alliance, Itzcoatl and Tlacopan instigated sweeping reforms on the Aztec state and [[Aztec religion|religion]]. It has been alleged that Tlacaelel ordered the burning of some or most of the extant Aztec books, claiming that they contained lies and that it was \"not wise that all the people should know the paintings\".<ref name=\"Leon-Portilla1963p155\">Leon-Portilla 1963 p. 155</ref> Even if he did order such book-burnings, it was probably limited primarily to documents containing political propaganda from previous regimes; he thereafter rewrote the history of the Aztecs, naturally placing the Mexica in a more central role. {{Citation needed|reason=How do we know the book-burnings were limited to \"propaganda\"? This is a serious historical claim that should be backed with a source.|date=July 2019}}\n\nAfter [[Moctezuma I]] succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica emperor, more reforms were instigated to maintain control over conquered cities.<ref name=\"Smith2009p48\">Smith 2009 p. 48</ref> Uncooperative kings were replaced with puppet rulers loyal to the Mexica. A new imperial tribute system established Mexica tribute collectors that taxed the population directly, bypassing the authority of local dynasties. Nezahualcoyotl also instituted a policy in the Acolhua lands of granting subject kings tributary holdings in lands far from their capitals.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\">Evans 2008 p. 462</ref> This was done to create an incentive for cooperation with the empire; if a city's king rebelled, he lost the tribute he received from foreign land. Some rebellious kings were replaced by ''calpixqueh'', or appointed governors rather than dynastic rulers.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\"/>\n\nMoctezuma issued new laws that further separated nobles from commoners and instituted the death penalty for adultery and other offenses.<ref name=\"Duran1994p209-210\">Duran 1994, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> By royal decree, a religiously supervised school was built in every neighborhood.<ref name=\"Duran1994p209-210\"/> Commoner neighborhoods had a school called a \"telpochcalli\" where they received basic religious instruction and military training.<ref name=\"Evans2008p456-457\">Evans 2008 pp. 456\u2013457</ref> A second, more prestigious type of school called a \"calmecac\" served to teach the nobility, as well as commoners of high standing seeking to become priests or artisans. Moctezuma also created a new title called \"quauhpilli\" that could be conferred on commoners.<ref name=\"Smith2009p48\"/> This title was a form of non-hereditary lesser nobility awarded for outstanding military or civil service (similar to the English [[knight]]). In some rare cases, commoners that received this title married into royal families and became kings.<ref name=\"Evans2008p462\"/>\n\nOne component of this reform was the creation of an institution of regulated warfare called the [[flower war|Flower Wars]]. Mesoamerican warfare overall is characterized by a strong preference for capturing live prisoners as opposed to slaughtering the enemy on the battlefield, which was considered sloppy and gratuitous. The Flower Wars are a potent manifestation of this approach to warfare. These highly ritualized wars ensured a steady, healthy supply of experienced Aztec warriors as well as a steady, healthy supply of captured enemy warriors for [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifice]] to the gods. Flower wars were pre-arranged by officials on both sides and conducted specifically for the purpose of each polity collecting prisoners for sacrifice.<ref name=\"Evans2008p451\">Evans 2008, p. 451</ref> According to native historical accounts, these wars were instigated by Tlacaelel as a means of appeasing the gods in response to a massive drought that gripped the Basin of Mexico from 1450 to 1454.<ref name=\"Duran1994\">Duran 1994</ref> The flower wars were mostly waged between the Aztec Empire and the neighboring cities of their arch-enemy [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].\n\n===Early years of expansion===\n[[File:Aztecexpansion.png|thumb|450px|Map of the expansion of the empire, showing the areas conquered by the Aztec rulers.<ref>Based on Hassig 1988.</ref>]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Tepanecs, Itzcoatl and Nezahualcoyotl rapidly consolidated power in the Basin of Mexico and began to expand beyond its borders. The first targets for imperial expansion were Coyoacan in the Basin of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac and Huaxtepec in the modern Mexican state of [[Morelos]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p47-48\">Smith 2009 pp. 47\u201348</ref> These conquests provided the new empire with a large influx of tribute, especially agricultural goods.\n\nOn the death of Itzcoatl, Moctezuma I was enthroned as the new Mexica emperor. The expansion of the empire was briefly halted by a major four-year drought that hit the Basin of Mexico in 1450, and several cities in Morelos had to be re-conquered after the drought subsided.<ref>Smith 2009 p. 49</ref> Moctezuma and Nezahualcoyotl continued to expand the empire east towards the Gulf of Mexico and south into [[Oaxaca]]. In 1468, Moctezuma I died and was succeeded by his son, [[Axayacatl]]. Most of Axayacatl's thirteen-year-reign was spent consolidating the territory acquired under his predecessor. Motecuzoma and Nezahualcoyotl had expanded rapidly and many provinces rebelled.<ref name=\"Davies1973\"/>\n\nAt the same time as the Aztec Empire was expanding and consolidating power, the [[Pur\u00e9pecha Empire]] in West Mexico was similarly expanding. In 1455, the Pur\u00e9pecha under their king Tzitzipandaquare had invaded the Toluca Valley, claiming lands previously conquered by Motecuzoma and Itzcoatl.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\">Pollard 1993, p. 169</ref> In 1472, Axayacatl re-conquered the region and successfully defended it from Pur\u00e9pecha attempts to take it back. In 1479, Axayacatl launched a major invasion of the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire with 32,000 Aztec soldiers.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> The Pur\u00e9pecha met them just across the border with 50,000 soldiers and scored a resounding victory, killing or capturing over 90% of the Aztec army. Axayacatl himself was wounded in the battle, retreated to Tenochtitlan, and never engaged the Pur\u00e9pecha in battle again.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\">Smith 2009 p. 51</ref>\n\nIn 1472, Nezahualcoyotl died and his son [[Nezahualpilli]] was enthroned as the new huetlatoani of Texcoco.<ref name=\"Evans2008p450\">Evans 2008, p. 450</ref> This was followed by the death of Axayacatl in 1481.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Axayacatl was replaced by his brother [[Tizoc]]. Tizoc's reign was notoriously brief. He proved to be ineffectual and did not significantly expand the empire. Apparently due to his incompetence, Tizoc was likely assassinated by his own nobles five years into his rule.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/>\n\n===Later years of expansion===\n[[File:Aztec Empire 1519 map-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The maximal extent of the Aztec Empire, according to Mar\u00eda del Carmen Solanes Carraro and Enrique Vela Ram\u00edrez.]]\n\nTizoc was succeeded by his brother [[Ahuitzotl]] in 1486. Like his predecessors, the first part of Ahuitzotl's reign was spent suppressing rebellions that were commonplace due to the indirect nature of Aztec rule.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Ahuitzotl then began a new wave of conquests including the [[Oaxaca Valley]] and the [[Soconusco|Soconusco Coast]]. Due to increased border skirmishes with the Pur\u00e9pechas, Ahuitzotl conquered the border city of Otzoma and turned the city into a military outpost.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\">Smith 2009 p. 54</ref> The population of Otzoma was either killed or dispersed in the process.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> The Pur\u00e9pecha subsequently established fortresses nearby to protect against Aztec expansion.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169\"/> Ahuitzotl responded by expanding further west to the Pacific Coast of [[Guerrero]].\n\nBy the reign of Ahuitzotl, the Mexica were the largest and most powerful faction in the Aztec Triple Alliance.<ref>Smith 2009 pp. 50\u201351</ref> Building on the prestige the Mexica had acquired over the course of the conquests, Ahuitzotl began to use the title \"huehuetlatoani\" (\"Eldest Speaker\") to distinguish himself from the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan.<ref name=\"Smith2009p51\"/> Even though the alliance still technically ran the empire, the Mexica Emperor now assumed nominal if not actual seniority.\n\nAhuitzotl was succeeded by his nephew [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuzoma II]] in 1502. Moctezuma II spent most of his reign consolidating power in lands conquered by his predecessors.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> In 1515, Aztec armies commanded by the Tlaxcalan general Tlahuicole invaded the Pur\u00e9pecha Empire once again.<ref name=\"Pollard1993p169-170\">Pollard 1993 pp. 169\u2013170</ref> The Aztec army failed to take any territory and was mostly restricted to raiding. The Pur\u00e9pechas defeated them and the army withdrew.\n\nMoctezuma II instituted more imperial reforms.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> After the death of Nezahualcoyotl, the Mexica Emperors had become the ''de facto'' rulers of the alliance. Moctezuma II used his reign to attempt to consolidate power more closely with the Mexica Emperor.<ref>Davies 1973 p. 216</ref> He removed many of Ahuitzotl's advisors and had several of them executed.<ref name=\"Smith2009p54\"/> He also abolished the \"quauhpilli\" class, destroying the chance for commoners to advance to the nobility. His reform efforts were cut short by the Spanish Conquest in 1519.\n\n===Spanish conquest===\n{{Main article|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}\n[[File:Basin of Mexico 1519 map-en.svg|thumb|The [[Valley of Mexico]] at the time of the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico|Spanish Conquest]].]]\n\nSpanish expedition leader [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] landed in Yucat\u00e1n in 1519 with approximately 630 men (most armed with only a sword and shield). Cort\u00e9s had actually been removed as the expedition's commander by the governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Diego Vel\u00e1squez]], but had stolen the boats and left without permission.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003pp35-40\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 35\u201340</ref> At the island of Cozumel, Cort\u00e9s encountered a shipwrecked Spaniard named [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] who joined the expedition and translated between Spanish and Mayan. The expedition then sailed west to Campeche, where after a brief battle with the local army, Cort\u00e9s was able to negotiate peace through his interpreter, Aguilar. The King of Campeche gave Cort\u00e9s a second translator, a bilingual Nahua-Maya slave woman named [[La Malinche]] (she was known also as Malinalli [mali\u02c8nal\u02d0i], Malintzin [ma\u02c8lintsin] or Do\u00f1a Marina [\u02c8do\u0272a ma\u02c8\u027eina] ). Aguilar translated from Spanish to Mayan and La Malinche translated from Mayan to Nahuatl. Once Malinche learned Spanish, she became Cort\u00e9s's translator for both language and culture, and was a key figure in interactions with [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] rulers. An important article, \"Rethinking Malinche\" by [[Frances Karttunen]] examines her role in the conquest and beyond.<ref>Frances Karttunen, \"Rethinking Malinche\" in ''Indian Women of Early Mexico,'' Susan Schroeder, et al. eds. University of Oklahoma Press 1997.</ref>\n\nCort\u00e9s then sailed from Campeche to [[Cempoala]], a tributary province of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Nearby, he founded the town of [[Veracruz]] where he met with ambassadors from the reigning Mexica emperor, [[Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin|Motecuzoma II]]. When the ambassadors returned to Tenochtitlan, Cort\u00e9s went to Cempoala to meet with the local [[Totonac]] leaders. After the Totonac ruler told Cort\u00e9s of his various grievances against the Mexica, Cort\u00e9s convinced the Totonacs to imprison an imperial tribute collector.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003pp92-94\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 92\u201394</ref> Cort\u00e9s subsequently released the tribute collector after persuading him that the move was entirely the Totonac's idea and that he had no knowledge of it. Having effectively declared war on the Aztecs, the Totonacs provided Cort\u00e9s with 20 companies of soldiers for his march to Tlaxcala.<ref name=\"DiazdelCastillo2003p120\">Diaz del Castillo 2003, p. 120</ref> At this time several of Cort\u00e9s's soldiers attempted to mutiny.

However, the Tlaxcalan general [[Xicotencatl the Younger]] believed them to be hostile, and attacked. After fighting several close battles, Cort\u00e9s eventually convinced the leaders of Tlaxcala to order their general to stand down. Cort\u00e9s then secured an alliance with the people of Tlaxcala, and traveled from there to the Basin of Mexico with a smaller company of 5,000-6,000 Tlaxcalans and 400 Totonacs, in addition to the Spanish soldiers.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> During his stay in the city of Cholula, Cort\u00e9s claims he received word of a planned ambush against the Spanish.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> In a pre-emptive response, Cort\u00e9s directed his troops attack and kill a large number of unarmed Cholulans gathered in the main square of the city.\n\nFollowing the massacre at Cholula, Hernan Cort\u00e9s and the other Spaniards entered Tenochtitlan, where they were greeted as guests and given quarters in the palace of former emperor Axayacatl.<ref name=\"Smith2009p275\">Smith 2009 p. 275</ref> After staying in the city for six weeks, two Spaniards from the group left behind in Veracruz were killed in an altercation with an Aztec lord named Quetzalpopoca. Cort\u00e9s claims that he used this incident as an excuse to take Motecuzoma prisoner under threat of force.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> For several months, Motecuzoma continued to run the kingdom as a prisoner of Hernan Cort\u00e9s. Then, in 1520, a second, larger Spanish expedition arrived under the command of [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] sent by Diego Vel\u00e1squez with the goal of arresting Cort\u00e9s for treason. Before confronting Narv\u00e1ez, Cort\u00e9s secretly persuaded Narv\u00e1ez's lieutenants to betray him and join Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" />\n\nWhile Cort\u00e9s was away from Tenochtitlan dealing with Narv\u00e1ez, his second in command [[Pedro de Alvarado]] massacred a group of Aztec nobility in response to a ritual of human sacrifice honoring [[Huitzilopochtli]].<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> The Aztecs retaliated by attacking the palace where the Spanish were quartered. Cort\u00e9s returned to Tenochtitlan and fought his way to the palace. He then took Motecuzoma up to the roof of the palace to ask his subjects to stand down. However, by this point the ruling council of Tenochtitlan had voted to depose Motecuzoma and had elected his brother [[Cuitlahuac]] as the new emperor.<ref name=\"Smith2009p275\" /> One of the Aztec soldiers struck Motecuzoma in the head with a sling stone, and he died several days later \u2013 although the exact details of his death, particularly who was responsible, are unclear.<ref name=\"Smith2009p275\" />\n\n[[File:Aztec Indians Mexico Tlaxcalan Cortez.jpg|thumb|[[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] led Spanish soldiers with [[Tlaxcala]]n allies in the conquests of Jalisco and Colima of West Mexico.]]\n\nThe Spaniards and their allies, realizing they were vulnerable to the hostile Mexica in Tenochtitlan following Moctezuma's death, attempted to retreat without detection in what is known as the \"Sad Night\" or [[La Noche Triste]]. Spaniards and their Indian allies were discovered clandestinely retreating, and then were forced to fight their way out of the city, with heavy loss of life. Some Spaniards lost their lives by drowning, loaded down with gold.<ref>''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', chapter 3 \"Conquest and Colonization\", Ida Altman, S.L. (Sarah) Cline, and Javier Pescador. Pearson, 2003.</ref> They retreated to [[Tlacopan]] (now Tacuba) and made their way to [[Tlaxcala]], where they recovered and prepared for the second, successful assault on Tenochtitlan. After this incident, a [[smallpox]] [[outbreak]] hit Tenochtitlan. As the indigenous of the New World had no previous exposure to smallpox, this outbreak alone killed more than 50% of the region's population, including the emperor, [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]].<ref name=\"Smith2009p279\">Smith 2009, p. 279</ref> While the new emperor [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] dealt with the smallpox outbreak, Cort\u00e9s raised an army of Tlaxcalans, Texcocans, Totonacs, and others discontent with Aztec rule. With a combined army of up to 100,000 warriors,<ref name=\"Cort\u00e9s\" /> the overwhelming majority of which were indigenous rather than Spanish, Cort\u00e9s marched back into the Basin of Mexico. Through numerous subsequent battles and skirmishes, he captured the various indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]] around the lake shore and surrounding mountains, including the other capitals of the Triple Alliance, Tlacopan and [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. Texcoco in fact had already become firm allies of the Spaniards and the city-state, and subsequently petitioned the Spanish crown for recognition of their services in the conquest, just as Tlaxcala had done.<ref>Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, ''Ally of Cort\u00e9s: Account 13 of the Coming of the Spaniards and the Beginning of Evangelical Law.''

Although the attackers took heavy casualties, the Aztecs were ultimately defeated. The city of Tenochtitlan was thoroughly destroyed in the process.

In the theoretical framework of imperial systems posited by American historian [[Alexander J. Motyl]] the Aztec empire was an informal type of empire in that the Alliance did not claim supreme authority over its tributary provinces; it merely expected tributes to be paid.<ref name=\"motyl\">{{cite book\n | last = Motyl\n | first = Alexander J.\n | title = Imperial Ends: The Decay, Collapse, and Revival of Empires\n | year = 2001\n | publisher = Columbia University Press\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-231-12110-5\n | pages = 13, 19\u201321, 32\u201336\n}}</ref> The empire was also territorially discontinuous, i.e. not all of its dominated territories were connected by land. For example, the southern peripheral zones of [[Soconusco|Xoconochco]] were not in immediate contact with the central part of the empire. The [[hegemonic]] nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tribute payments were made.<ref>Berdan, ''et al.'' (1996), Aztec Imperial Strategies. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC</ref>\n\nAlthough the form of government is often referred to as an empire, in fact most areas within the empire were organized as city-states (individually known as ''[[altepetl]]'' in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Aztecs). These were small polities ruled by a king or ''tlatoani'' (literally \"speaker\", plural ''tlatoque'') from an aristocratic dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepeme. Even after the empire was formed in 1428 and began its program of expansion through conquest, the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.<ref>Smith, Michael E. (2000), Aztec City-States. In A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures, edited by [[Mogens Herman Hansen]], pp. 581\u2013595. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Copenhagen.</ref>\n\nIt should be remembered that the term \"Aztec empire\" is a modern one, not one used by the Aztec themselves. The Aztec realm was at its core composed of three [[Nahuatl]]-speaking city states in the densely populated Valley of Mexico. Over time, asymmetries of power elevated one of those city states, Tenochtitlan, above the other two. The \"Triple Alliance\" came to establish [[hegemony]] over much of central Mesoamerica, including areas of great linguistic and cultural diversity. Administration of the empire was performed through largely traditional, indirect means. However, over time something of a nascent [[bureaucracy]] may have been beginning to form insofar as the state organization became increasingly centralized.\n\n===Central administration===\n[[Image:Tlacochcalcatl.jpg|thumb|180px|A ''[[tlacochcalcatl]]'' pictured in the [[Codex Mendoza]]]]\nBefore the reign of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] (1429\u20131472), the Aztec empire operated as a confederation along traditional [[Mesoamerica]]n lines. Independent altepetl were led by tlatoani (lit., \"speakers\"), who supervised village headmen, who in turn supervised groups of households. A typical Mesoamerican confederation placed a ''[[Huey Tlatoani]]'' (lit., \"great speaker\") at the head of several tlatoani. Following Nezahualcoyotl, the Aztec empire followed a somewhat divergent path, with some tlatoani of recently conquered or otherwise subordinated altepetl becoming replaced with ''calpixque'' stewards charged with collecting tribute on behalf of the Huetlatoani rather than simply replacing an old tlatoque with new ones from the same set of local nobility.<ref>\nEvans, Susan T. (2004). Ancient Mexico & Central America: Archaeology and Culture History. Thames & Hudson: New York, pp. 443\u2013446, 449\u2013451</ref>\n\nYet the Huey tlatoani was not the sole executive. It was the responsibility of the Huey tlatoani to deal with the ''external'' issues of empire; the management of tribute, war, diplomacy, and expansion were all under the purview of the Huey tlatoani. It was the role of the ''[[Cihuacoatl]]'' to govern a given city itself. The Cihuacoatl was always a close relative of the Huey tlatoani; [[Tlacaelel]], for example, was the brother of Moctezuma I. Both the title \"Cihuacoatl\", which means \"female snake\" (it is the name of a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] deity), and the role of the position, somewhat analogous to a European [[Viceroy]] or [[Prime Minister]], reflect the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature of Nahua [[cosmology]]. Neither the position of Cihuacoatl nor the position of Huetlatoani were priestly, yet both did have important ritual tasks. Those of the former were associated with the \"female\" wet season, those of the latter with the \"male\" dry season. While the position of Cihuacoatl is best attested in Tenochtitlan, it is known that the position also existed the nearby altepetl of [[Atzcapotzalco]], [[Culhuac\u00e1n (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], and Tenochtitlan's ally [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. Despite the apparent lesser status of the position, a Cihuacoatl could prove both influential and powerful, as in the case of Tlacaelel.<ref>\nCoe, Michael D. (1984). Mexico, 3rd Ed.

The Codex Mendoza Vol. 1. University of California Press, p. 196</ref> and the ''tlillancalqui''. This design not only provided advise for the ruler, it also served to contain ambition on the part of the nobility, as henceforth [[Huey Tlatoani]] could only be selected from the Council. Moreover, the actions of any one member of the Council could easily be blocked by the other three, providing a simple system of checks on the ambition higher officials. These four Council members were also generals, members of various military societies. The ranks of the members were not equal, with the tlacochcalcatl and tlaccatecatl having a higher status than the others. These two Councillors were members of the two most prestigious military societies, the ''cuauhchique'' (\"shorn ones\") and the ''otontin'' (\"[[Otomi (military)|Otomies]]\").<ref>Brumfiel, Elizabeth M.

Thames & Hudson: London, p. 204.</ref>\n\n===Provincial administration===\nTraditionally, provinces and altepetl were governed by hereditary tlatoani. As the empire grew, the system evolved further and some tlatoani were replaced by other officials. The other officials had similar authority to tlatoani. As has already been mentioned, directly appointed stewards (singular ''calpixqui'', plural ''calpixque'') were sometimes imposed on altepetl instead of the selection of provincial nobility to the same position of tlatoani. At the height of empire, the organization of the state into tributary and strategic provinces saw an elaboration of this system. The 38 tributary provinces fell under the supervision of high stewards, or ''huecalpixque'', whose authority extended over the lower-ranking calpixque. These calpixque and huecalpixque were essentially managers of the provincial tribute system which was overseen and coordinated in the paramount capital of Tenochtitlan not by the ''huetlatoani'', but rather by a separate position altogether: the ''petlacalcatl''. On the occasion that a recently conquered altepetl was seen as particularly restive, a military governor, or ''cuauhtlatoani'', was placed at the head of provincial supervision.<ref>Calnek, Edward E. (1982). Patterns of Empire Formation in the Valley of Mexico, in The Inca and Aztec States: 1400\u20131800. Collier, Rosaldo & Wirth (Eds.) Academic Press: New York, pp. 56\u201359</ref> During the reign of Moctezuma I, the calpixque system was elaborated, with two calpixque assigned per tributary province. One was stationed in the province itself, perhaps for supervising the collection of tribute, and the other in Tenochtitlan, perhaps for supervising storage of tribute. Tribute was drawn from commoners, the ''macehualtin'', and distributed to the nobility, be they 'kings' (''tlatoque''), lesser rulers (''teteuctin''), or provincial nobility (''pipiltin'').<ref>Smith, Michael E. (1986). Social Stratification in the Aztec Empire: A View from the Provinces, in American Anthropologist,\n(88)1, p. 74</ref>\n\nTribute collection was supervised by the above officials and relied upon the coercive power of the Aztec military, but also upon the cooperation of the ''pipiltin'' (the local nobility who were themselves exempt from and recipient to tribute) and the hereditary class of merchants known as ''pochteca''. These pochteca had various gradations of ranks which granted them certain trading rights and so were not necessarily pipiltin themselves, yet they played an important role in both the growth and administration of the Aztec tributary system nonetheless. The power, political and economic, of the pochteca was strongly tied to the political and military power of the Aztec nobility and state. In addition to serving as diplomats (''teucnenenque'', or \"travelers of the lord\") and spies in the prelude to conquest, higher-ranking pochteca also served as judges in market plazas and were to certain degree autonomous [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]], having administrative duties within their own [[Estates of the Realm|estate]].<ref>Kurtz, Donald V.

As such, they were known as the 'Triple Alliance.' This political form was very common in Mesoamerica, where alliances of city-states were ever fluctuating. However, over time, it was Tenochtitlan which assumed paramount authority in the alliance, and although each partner city shared spoils of war and rights to regular tribute from the provinces and were governed by their own Huetlatoani, it was Tenochtitlan which became the largest, most powerful, and most influential of the three cities. It was the de facto and acknowledged center of empire.<ref>Brumfiel, Elizabeth M. (2001). Religion and state in the Aztec Empire, in Empires (Alcock et al, Eds). Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, p. 284</ref>\n\nThough they were not described by the Aztec this way, there were essentially two types of provinces: Tributary and Strategic. Strategic provinces were essentially subordinate [[client states]] which provided tribute or aid to the Aztec state under \"mutual consent\". Tributary provinces, on the other hand, provided regular tribute to the empire; obligations on the part of Tributary provinces were mandatory rather than consensual.<ref name=Evans470-471>Evans, pp. 470\u2013471</ref><ref name=Smith1-2>Smith, Michael E.

''Tlatocayotl'', or the principle of rulership, established that this divine right was inherited by descent. Political order was therefore also a cosmic order, and to kill a tlatoani was to transgress that order. For that reason, whenever a tlatoani was killed or otherwise removed from their station, a relative and member of the same bloodline was typically placed in their stead. The establishment of the office of Huetlatoani understood through the creation of another level of rulership, ''hueitlatocayotl'', standing in superior contrast to the lesser ''tlatocayotl'' principle.<ref>Almaz\u00e1n, pp. 165\u2013166</ref>\n\nExpansion of the empire was guided by a [[militaristic]] interpretation of Nahua religion, specifically a devout veneration of the sun god, [[Huitzilopochtli]]. Militaristic state rituals were performed throughout the year according to a ceremonial calendar of events, rites, and mock battles.<ref>Brumfiel (2001), pp. 287, 288\u2013301</ref> The time period they lived in was understood as the ''Ollintonatiuh'', or Sun of Movement, which was believed to be the final age after which humanity would be destroyed. It was under Tlacaelel that Huitzilopochtli assumed his elevated role in the state pantheon and who argued that it was through blood sacrifice that the Sun would be maintained and thereby stave off the end of the world. It was under this new, militaristic interpretation of Huitzilopochtli that Aztec soldiers were encouraged to fight wars and capture enemy soldiers for sacrifice. Though blood sacrifice was common in Mesoamerica, the scale of [[human sacrifice]] under the Aztecs was likely unprecedented in the region.<ref>Le\u00f3n-Portilla, Miguel. (1963). Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the ANcient Nahuatl Mind. Davis, Jack E., Trans. University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, pp. 6, 161\u2013162</ref>\n\n==Law==\nThe most developed [[Code (law)|code of law]] was developed in the city-state of Texcoco under its ruler [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]. It was a formal written code, not merely a collection of customary practices. The sources for knowing about the legal code are colonial-era writings by Franciscan [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]], Franciscan [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]], and Texcocan historians [[Juan Bautista Pomar]], and [[Fernando de Alva Cort\u00e9s Ixtlilxochitl]]. The law code in Texcoco under Nezahualcoyotl was legalistic, that is cases were tried by particular types of evidence and the social status of the litigants was disregarded, and consisted of 80 written laws. These laws called for severe, publicly administered punishments, creating a legal framework of social control.<ref>Offner, Jerome A. ''Law and Politics in Aztec Texcoco''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp.81-82.</ref>\n\nMuch less is known about the legal system in Tenochtitlan, which might be less legalistic or sophisticated as those of Texcoco for this period.<ref>Offner, 1983, p. 83</ref> It was established under the reign of [[Moctezuma I]]. These laws served to establish and govern relations between the state, classes, and individuals. Punishment was to be meted out solely by state authorities. Nahua mores were enshrined in these laws, criminalizing public acts of homosexuality, drunkenness, and nudity, not to mention more universal proscriptions against theft, murder, and property damage. As stated before, ''pochteca'' could serve as judges, often exercising judicial oversight of their own members. Likewise, [[Court-martial|military courts]] dealt with both cases within the military and without during wartime. There was an [[appeal]] process, with appellate courts standing between local, typically market-place courts, on the provincial level and a [[supreme court]] and two special higher appellate courts at Tenochtitlan. One of those two special courts dealt with cases arising within Tenochtitlan, the other with cases originating from outside the capital. The ultimate judicial authority laid in hands of the ''[[Huey tlatoani]]'', who had the right to appoint lesser judges.<ref>Kurtz, p. 307</ref>\n\n==Rulers==\n{{see also|Aztec emperors family tree}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Tenochtitlan\n!
