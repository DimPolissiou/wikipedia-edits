Two months after his stepfather's death he committed his first robbery, in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], in which he was shot and wounded. On release from jail, he teamed up with Clarence Lee Shaffer Jr., James Dalhover, and Charles Geisking. The gang stole cars and committed armed robberies across Indiana, mostly of grocery stores. They eventually murdered a 23-year-old Indianapolis store clerk, and then [[Indianapolis]] policeman Richard Rivers.<ref>[http://officersearch.inlem.org/officer.php?id=0407 Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial \u2013 Indianapolis Police Officer Richard Rivers]</ref> The gang was also suspected of killing a policeman in [[Anderson, Indiana]], in 1935.<ref>[http://officersearch.inlem.org/officer.php?id=0085 Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial \u2013 Anderson Patrol Officer Frank M. Levy]</ref> The four were captured in 1936, but Brady, Dalhover, and Shaffer escaped from a jail in [[Greenfield, Indiana]], and then robbed a bank in [[Goodland, Indiana]], in May 1937. In fleeing the robbery, they managed to ambush and kill one of their pursuers, [[Indiana State Police]] trooper Paul Minneman,<ref>[http://officersearch.inlem.org/officer.php?id=0338 Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial \u2013 Indiana State Trooper Paul Vincent Minneman]</ref> and severely injure another. The gang then relocated, first to [[Baltimore]], then to [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], and eventually to [[Bangor, Maine]].\n\n==In Bangor, Maine==\n[[File:Al Brady Place Marker Stone.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Marker in Bangor, Maine, where Al Brady was killed by FBI agents.]]\nThe four arrived in Bangor, having accumulated about $5,000 from their spree of robberies. Brady believed Maine to be an easy place to procure large numbers of guns and amounts of ammunition without suspicion, because of the extensive hunting in the area.<ref name=\"TGNews\" />\n\nRelaxing their guard in Bangor, the trio began negotiating the purchase of [[Thompson submachine gun]]s at the downtown Dakin's Sporting Goods Store.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bangorinfo.com/Focus/focus_brady_gang.html |title=The Brady Gang |last=Robbins |first=Ryan R. |date= |website= |work=Bangor in Focus; Notable places, people and events |access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> On September 21, 1937, they first approached the store. Brady asked the owner, Everett Hurd, for 500 rounds of .30-caliber ammunition.  One of the party took out a large roll of money in large bills, which drew the suspicion of the owner.<ref name=\"TGNews\" />  Hurd contacted the police after taking their order and telling them to return in a few weeks. When the three later returned to pick up the guns, on October 12, 1937, a large number of [[FBI]] agents were waiting in ambush, inside the store and across the street. Dalhover entered Dakin's alone and was apprehended after a scuffle. Brady and Shaffer drew their weapons in the street and were shot down in a furious exchange.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/the-brady-gang\n|accessdate= 2017-02-01\n|title= The Brady Gang\n|work= FBI History: Famous Cases\n|publisher= [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n}}</ref>\n\nPhotographs of their bullet-ridden bodies lying dead in the middle of Central Street became iconic local images, and long hung behind the counter at Dakin's.

Two months after his stepfather's death he committed his first robbery, in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], in which he was shot and wounded. On release from jail, he teamed up with Clarence Lee Shaffer Jr., James Dalhover, and Charles Geisking. The gang stole cars and committed armed robberies across Indiana, mostly of grocery stores. They eventually murdered a 23-year-old Indianapolis store clerk, and then [[Indianapolis]] policeman Richard Rivers.<ref>[http://officersearch.inlem.org/officer.php?id=0407 Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial \u2013 Indianapolis Police Officer Richard Rivers]</ref> The gang was also suspected of killing a policeman in [[Anderson, Indiana]], in 1935.<ref>[http://officersearch.inlem.org/officer.php?id=0085 Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial \u2013 Anderson Patrol Officer Frank M. Levy]</ref> The four were captured in 1936, but Brady, Dalhover, and Shaffer escaped from a jail in [[Greenfield, Indiana]], and then robbed a bank in [[Goodland, Indiana]], in May 1937. In fleeing the robbery, they managed to ambush and kill one of their pursuers, [[Indiana State Police]] trooper Paul Minneman,<ref>[http://officersearch.inlem.org/officer.php?id=0338 Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial \u2013 Indiana State Trooper Paul Vincent Minneman]</ref> and severely injure another. The gang then relocated, first to [[Baltimore]], then to [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], and eventually to [[Bangor, Maine]].\n\n==In Bangor, Maine==\n[[File:Al Brady Place Marker Stone.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Marker in Bangor, Maine, where Al Brady was killed by FBI agents.]]\nThe four arrived in Bangor, having accumulated about $5,000 from their spree of robberies. Brady believed Maine to be an easy place to procure large numbers of guns and amounts of ammunition without suspicion, because of the extensive hunting in the area.<ref name=\"TGNews\" />\n\nRelaxing their guard in Bangor, the trio began negotiating the purchase of [[Thompson submachine gun]]s at the downtown Dakin's Sporting Goods Store.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bangorinfo.com/Focus/focus_brady_gang.html |title=The Brady Gang |last=Robbins |first=Ryan R. |date= |website= |work=Bangor in Focus; Notable places, people and events |access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> On September 21, 1937, they first approached the store. Brady asked the owner, Everett Hurd, for 500 rounds of .30-caliber ammunition.  One of the party took out a large roll of money in large bills, which drew the suspicion of the owner.<ref name=\"TGNews\" />  Hurd contacted the police after taking their order and telling them to return in a few weeks. When the three later returned to pick up the guns, on October 12, 1937, a large number of [[FBI]] agents were waiting in ambush, inside the store and across the street. Dalhover entered Dakin's alone and was apprehended after a scuffle. Brady and Shaffer drew their weapons in the street and were shot down in a furious exchange.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/the-brady-gang\n|accessdate= 2017-02-01\n|title= The Brady Gang\n|work= FBI History: Famous Cases\n|publisher= [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n}}</ref>\n\nPhotographs of their bullet-ridden bodies lying dead in the middle of Central Street became iconic local images, and long hung behind the counter at Dakin's.

The Test series ended without a result, with both Test matches drawn.\n\n[[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] won all three of the One Day International matches, although the third one had to be replayed due to bad weather. Sanath Jayasuriya was the most notable player during the tournament. He was selected as player of the series in both the Test series and the ODI series, and won two-man of the match awards as well. He was the highest scoring batsman during the Test series, and also took the highest number of wickets for Sri Lanka in the ODI series.\n\n==Background==\nThe Indian cricket team had arrived in Sri Lanka on 12 July 1997 to participate in the Asia Cup. After that, they stayed on in the country for two Test matches and three One Day International matches with the Sri Lankan cricket team. The Sri Lankans were the world champions, having won the cricket world cup the previous year, and had also won the Asia Cup, having beaten India in the final.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997-98/IND_IN_SL/ARTICLES/ELMO_COMMENT_02AUG1997.html|title=Test Cricket is what the game is all about|last=Rodrigopolle|first=Elmo|date=2 August 1997|work=The Daily News|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Tour matches ==\n=== 50-over: Sri Lankan Board President's XI v Indians ===\n{{Single-innings cricket match\n| date = 15 August 1997\n| time = \n| daynight = \n| team1 = Sri Lankan Board President's XI\n| team2 = {{cr|IND|name=Indians}}\n| score1 = 240/7 (50 overs)\n| runs1 = [[Russel Arnold]] 56\n| wickets1 = [[Sourav Ganguly]] 2/29 (5 overs)\n| score2 = 243/8 (49.3 overs)\n| runs2 = [[Rahul Dravid]] 95\n| wickets2 = N Sadikin 2/38 (7 overs)\n| result = Indians won by 2 wickets\n| report = [http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997-98/IND_IN_SL/IND_SL-BPRES-XI_15AUG1997.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[De Soysa Stadium]], [[Moratuwa]]\n| umpires = \n| motm = \n| toss = Indians won the toss and elected to field.\n| rain = \n| notes = \n}}\n\n==Test series==\n[[File:R Premadasa Stadium.jpg|thumb|The R.

Both matches were drawn, but a number of world records were established during the series, particularly in the first match. India played a three-day tour match before the first Test against the [[Sri Lanka Board President's XI]], starting on 29 July.

The film was released simultaneously in 60 countries on November 5, 2003. While being the final entry in the original trilogy of the series, the ''Matrix'' storyline is continued in ''[[The Matrix Online]]''. It was the first live-action feature film to be released in both regular and [[IMAX]] theaters at the same time. Despite having a mixed reception from critics, the film grossed $427.3 million worldwide. A [[The Matrix 4|fourth ''Matrix'' film]] began production in February 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILM PLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS.-->\n[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]] lie unconscious in the medical bay of the ship ''Hammer''. Inside the Matrix, Neo is trapped in a [[subway station]] named Mobil Ave (an anagram for [[limbo]]), a transition zone between the Matrix and the Machine City. He meets a \"family\" of programs, including a girl named Sati. The \"father\" tells Neo the subway is controlled by the Trainman, a program loyal to the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]]. When Neo tries to board a train with the family, the Trainman refuses and overpowers him.\n\n[[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]] contacts [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] on behalf of the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]], who informs them of Neo's confinement. Seraph, Morpheus and Trinity enter [[Club Hel]], where they confront the Merovingian and force him to release Neo. Troubled by visions of the Machine City, Neo visits the Oracle, who reveals that [[Agent Smith|Smith]] intends to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. She states that \"everything that has a beginning has an end,\" and that the war will conclude. After Neo leaves, a large group of Smiths assimilates Sati and Seraph. One assimilates the Oracle and gains her powers of [[precognition]].\n\nIn the real world, the crews of the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'' and the ''Hammer'' find and reactivate [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe's]] ship, the ''Logos''. They interrogate Bane, who says that he has no recollection of the earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her [[Enter the Matrix|encounter with the Oracle]], Niobe offers him the ''Logos''. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the ''Logos'', takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes that Bane has been assimilated by Smith and a fight ensues. Bane burns Neo's eyes with a power cable, permanently blinding him. Neo, discovering an ability to perceive anything part of the machine source code in the real world as wreathed in golden light, sees and kills Bane. Trinity pilots them to the Machine City.\n\nNiobe and Morpheus rush toward Zion in the ''Hammer'' to aid the human defenses. Zion's shipyard is overwhelmed by a horde of Sentinels, and the fatally wounded [[Captain Mifune]] instructs [[Kid (The Matrix)|Kid]] to open the gate for the ''Hammer''. When it arrives, it discharges its [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]], disabling all the Sentinels present but also Zion's remaining defenses. The humans are forced to retreat and wait for the next attack, thinking it will be their last stand.\n\nNear the Machine City, the ''Logos'' is bombarded by thousands of missiles, causing it to crash, fatally wounding Trinity. She dies in Neo's arms. Neo enters the Machine City and encounters \"Deus Ex Machina,\" the machine leader. Neo warns that Smith plans to conquer both the Matrix and the real world and offers to stop Smith in exchange for peace with Zion. The machine leader agrees, and the Sentinels stop attacking Zion.\n\nThe Machines provide a connection for Neo to enter the Matrix. Inside, the Smith with the Oracle's powers steps forth, saying that he has foreseen his victory against Neo. After a protracted battle, Neo realizes there is no other way to win and allows himself to be assimilated. The machine leader sends a surge of energy into Neo's body in the real world. Because Neo is connected to the Source, the energy surge causes the Neo-Smith clone and all other Smith clones in the Matrix to be destroyed, deleting Smith once and for all. The Sentinels withdraw from Zion, Morpheus and Niobe embrace, and Neo sees a final vision of the machine city while seemingly succumbing to his injuries, as his body is carried away by the machines.\n\nThe Matrix is rebooted, and the Architect encounters the Oracle in a park. They agree that the peace will last \"as long as it can\" and that all humans will be offered the opportunity to leave the Matrix. When questioned about Neo's fate, the Oracle tells Sati that she thinks they will see Neo again as Sati reveals she created a beautiful sunrise over the horizon in Neo's honor. Seraph asks the Oracle if she knew this would happen. She replies that she did not know, but she believed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith]]\n** [[Ian Bliss]] as Bane\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]\n* [[Mary Alice]] as [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Link\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]]\n* [[Harry J.

Aside from [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]]' score, again collaborating with [[Juno Reactor]], only one external track (by [[Pale 3]]) is used. Although Davis rarely focuses on strong melodies, familiar [[leitmotif]]s from earlier in the series reappear. For example, Neo and Trinity's love theme\u2014which briefly surfaces in the two preceding films\u2014is finally fully expanded into \"Trinity Definitely\"; the theme from the Zion docks in ''Reloaded'' returns as \"Men in Metal\", and the energetic drumming from the ''Reloaded'' tea house fight between Neo and Seraph opens \"Tetsujin\", as Seraph, Trinity and Morpheus fight off Club Hel's three doormen. The climactic battle theme, named \"Neod\u00e4mmerung\" (in reference to [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]''), features a choir singing extracts ([[shlokas]]) from the [[Pavamana Mantra]], introduced in the [[Upanishad]]s. The chorus can be roughly translated from [[Sanskrit]] as follows: \"lead us from untruth to truth, lead us from darkness to light, lead us from death to immortality, peace peace peace\". The extracts were brought to Davis by the Wachowskis when he informed them that it would be wasteful for such a large choir to be singing simple \"ooh\"s and \"aah\"s (according to the DVD commentary, Davis felt that the dramatic impact of the piece would be lost if the choir was to sing 'This is the one, see what he can do' in plain English). These extracts return in the film's denouement, and in ''Navras'', the track that plays over the closing credits (which may be considered a loose [[remix]] of \"Neod\u00e4mmerung\").\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film's budget was estimated between [[United States dollar|US$]]110 million<ref name=\"Allmovie (2010, The Matrix Revolutions)\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-matrix-revolutions-v282917|title=The Matrix Revolutions (2003) \u2013 Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski \u2013 Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related \u2013 AllMovie|website=AllMovie|accessdate=October 8, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425055503/http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-matrix-revolutions-282917 |archivedate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> and $150 million.<ref name=\"Mojo\"/> It grossed over $139 million in North America and approximately $427 million worldwide,<ref name=\"Mojo\"/> roughly half of ''The Matrix Reloaded'' box-office total.

The film was released simultaneously in 60 countries on November 5, 2003. While being the final entry in the original trilogy of the series, the ''Matrix'' storyline is continued in ''[[The Matrix Online]]''. It was the first live-action feature film to be released in both regular and [[IMAX]] theaters at the same time. Despite having a mixed reception from critics, the film grossed $427.3 million worldwide. A [[The Matrix 4|fourth ''Matrix'' film]] began production in February 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILM PLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS.-->\n[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]] lie unconscious in the medical bay of the ship ''Hammer''. Inside the Matrix, Neo is trapped in a [[subway station]] named Mobil Ave (an anagram for [[limbo]]), a transition zone between the Matrix and the Machine City. He meets a \"family\" of programs, including a girl named Sati. The \"father\" tells Neo the subway is controlled by the Trainman, a program loyal to the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]]. When Neo tries to board a train with the family, the Trainman refuses and overpowers him.\n\n[[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]] contacts [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] on behalf of the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]], who informs them of Neo's confinement. Seraph, Morpheus and Trinity enter [[Club Hel]], where they confront the Merovingian and force him to release Neo. Troubled by visions of the Machine City, Neo visits the Oracle, who reveals that [[Agent Smith|Smith]] intends to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. She states that \"everything that has a beginning has an end,\" and that the war will conclude. After Neo leaves, a large group of Smiths assimilates Sati and Seraph. One assimilates the Oracle and gains her powers of [[precognition]].\n\nIn the real world, the crews of the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'' and the ''Hammer'' find and reactivate [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe's]] ship, the ''Logos''. They interrogate Bane, who says that he has no recollection of the earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her [[Enter the Matrix|encounter with the Oracle]], Niobe offers him the ''Logos''. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the ''Logos'', takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes that Bane has been assimilated by Smith and a fight ensues. Bane burns Neo's eyes with a power cable, permanently blinding him. Neo, discovering an ability to perceive anything part of the machine source code in the real world as wreathed in golden light, sees and kills Bane. Trinity pilots them to the Machine City.\n\nNiobe and Morpheus rush toward Zion in the ''Hammer'' to aid the human defenses. Zion's shipyard is overwhelmed by a horde of Sentinels, and the fatally wounded [[Captain Mifune]] instructs [[Kid (The Matrix)|Kid]] to open the gate for the ''Hammer''. When it arrives, it discharges its [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]], disabling all the Sentinels present but also Zion's remaining defenses. The humans are forced to retreat and wait for the next attack, thinking it will be their last stand.\n\nNear the Machine City, the ''Logos'' is bombarded by thousands of missiles, causing it to crash, fatally wounding Trinity. Neo enters the Machine City and encounters \"Deus Ex Machina,\" the machine leader. Neo warns that Smith plans to conquer both the Matrix and the real world and offers to stop Smith in exchange for peace with Zion. The machine leader agrees, and the Sentinels stop attacking Zion.\n\nThe Machines provide a connection for Neo to enter the Matrix. Inside, the Smith with the Oracle's powers steps forth, saying that he has foreseen his victory against Neo. After a protracted battle, Neo realizes there is no other way to win and allows himself to be assimilated. The machine leader sends a surge of energy into Neo's body in the real world. Because Neo is connected to the Source, the energy surge causes the Neo-Smith clone and all other Smith clones in the Matrix to be destroyed, deleting Smith once and for all. The Sentinels withdraw from Zion, Morpheus and Niobe embrace, and Neo sees a final vision of the machine city while seemingly succumbing to his injuries, as his body is carried away by the machines.\n\nThe Matrix is rebooted, and the Architect encounters the Oracle in a park. They agree that the peace will last \"as long as it can\" and that all humans will be offered the opportunity to leave the Matrix. When questioned about Neo's fate, the Oracle tells Sati that she thinks they will see Neo again as Sati reveals she created a beautiful sunrise over the horizon in Neo's honor. Seraph asks the Oracle if she knew this would happen. She replies that she did not know, but she believed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith]]\n** [[Ian Bliss]] as Bane\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]\n* [[Mary Alice]] as [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Link\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]]\n* [[Harry J.

Aside from [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]]' score, again collaborating with [[Juno Reactor]], only one external track (by [[Pale 3]]) is used. Although Davis rarely focuses on strong melodies, familiar [[leitmotif]]s from earlier in the series reappear. For example, Neo and Trinity's love theme\u2014which briefly surfaces in the two preceding films\u2014is finally fully expanded into \"Trinity Definitely\"; the theme from the Zion docks in ''Reloaded'' returns as \"Men in Metal\", and the energetic drumming from the ''Reloaded'' tea house fight between Neo and Seraph opens \"Tetsujin\", as Seraph, Trinity and Morpheus fight off Club Hel's three doormen. The climactic battle theme, named \"Neod\u00e4mmerung\" (in reference to [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]''), features a choir singing extracts ([[shlokas]]) from the [[Pavamana Mantra]], introduced in the [[Upanishad]]s. The chorus can be roughly translated from [[Sanskrit]] as follows: \"lead us from untruth to truth, lead us from darkness to light, lead us from death to immortality, peace peace peace\". The extracts were brought to Davis by the Wachowskis when he informed them that it would be wasteful for such a large choir to be singing simple \"ooh\"s and \"aah\"s (according to the DVD commentary, Davis felt that the dramatic impact of the piece would be lost if the choir was to sing 'This is the one, see what he can do' in plain English).

The Main Boreholes show eustatic changes on the marine conditions, with a retreat of the sea level, leading to the appearance of vegetation and abundant pollen on the uppermost parts of the formation. The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

They instead granted the Tribunal jurisdiction over a set of very broadly defined crimes, the specific content of which was to be found in customary international law. Though the Tribunal recognized that binding conventional law could also provide the basis for its jurisdiction, it has in practice always determined that the treaty provisions in question are also declaratory of custom.</ref>\nTo prove that a certain rule is customary one has to show that it is reflected in state practice and that there exists a conviction in the international community that such practice is required as a matter of law. In this context, \"practice\" relates to official state practice and therefore includes formal statements by states. A contrary practice by some states is possible because if this contrary practice is condemned by the other states, or subsequently denied by the government itself, the original rule is actually confirmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/customary-law|title=Customary law|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=22 April 2016|date=2014-07-28}}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with article 13 of the [[UN Charter]], the General Assembly is obligated to initiate studies and to make recommendations that encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm#art13|title=The Avalon Project: United Nations Charter; June 26, 1945|accessdate=22 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421122334/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm#art13|archivedate=21 April 2016}}</ref> Acting in that agreed-upon treaty capacity, the General Assembly affirmed the principles of international law that were recognized by the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtconst.asp Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal] and directed that they should be codified.<ref>See General Assembly Resolution 95 (I), 11 December 1946, and [[UN General Assembly Resolution 177]].</ref> Many of those same principles were subsequently adopted for inclusion in draft treaties that were under development by the [[International Law Commission|International Law Commission of the United Nations]].

In 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries approved the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]. The offenses against unwritten customary international law were amenable to prosecution by international tribunals, like the Nuremberg Tribunal, long before they were codified and incorporated into the subsequent treaties.\n\n==Conventions, resolutions and declarations==\n\nMany provisions of international law are based upon principles and norms that were developed in the Americas during the 19th century.

No territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized.</blockquote>\n\n==Legal issues related to sovereignty==\nIn their relations with other peoples and countries during the colonial era the [[Concert of Europe]] adopted a fundamental legal principle that the supreme legal authority, or [[sovereignty]], lay outside the indigenous nations. That legal principle resulted in the creation of a large number of dependent states with restricted sovereignty or colonial autonomy. Various terms were used to describe different types of dependent states, such as condominium, mandate, protectorate, colony, and vassal state. After World War II there was strong international pressure to eliminate dependencies associated with colonialism.<ref>see [http://law.jrank.org/pages/6068/Dependent-States.html American Law Encyclopedia Vol 3, Dependent States], [http://www.un-documents.net/ch-11.htm The Declaration Regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories, in Chapter XI of the UN Charter], and [http://www.un-documents.net/a15r1514.htm The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV)]</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of the world's [[Sovereign state|sovereign states]] resulted from the grant of independence to colonial peoples and dependent territories. Prior to World War II many states were formed as a result of [[war]]s that were resolved through [[Peace treaty|peace treaties]]. Some of these peace treaties were imposed on the losing side in a war; others came about as a result of negotiations that followed wars, or were entered into under the threat of war. In these cases, the applicable law was bound in peace treaties among the states. The practice of territorial aggrandizement was prohibited by the UN Charter, a multilateral treaty, and the authoritative explanation of its legal principles contained in UN General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, Declaration of Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3dda1f104.html|title=Refworld \u2013 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref> The purpose of the United Nations is the prevention and removal of threats to peace and the suppression of acts of aggression.

For example, the International Court of Justice advisory opinion noted that access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places had been protected by various laws dating back to the early Ottoman Empire, with the latest provisions having been incorporated into the UN Partition Plan, article 13 of the League of Nations Mandate, and Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris in 1814 called for a congress of the Great Powers of Europe to settle the future boundaries of the continent. Nearly every state in Europe was represented, and among other things a prohibition on unilateral annexation was adopted. This bolstered the concept of territorial integrity, which was enshrined in the Congress of Vienna in 1815.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/26.3/benvenisti.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207231639/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/26.3/benvenisti.html |archivedate=2011-02-07 }} Benvenisti, Eyal, The Origins of the Concept of Belligerent Occupation.

After the Russo-Turkish Wars in 1878, Russia and the Ottoman Empire concluded the Treaty of San Stefano. Because it modified the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1856, the other signatories called for a Congress to obtain its revision. The Treaty of Berlin of 1878 was the result. Montenegro, Serbia, and Romania were recognized as new independent states and granted specific territory on condition that religious, political, and property rights of minorities were guaranteed on a nondiscriminatory basis.<ref>See Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection, 1878\u20131938, Carole Fink, Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-02994-5}}, p. 37</ref> The delegates of the [[First Zionist Congress]] acknowledged these customary diplomatic precedents in the [[Basle Program]]. It stated that the aim of Zionism was the creation of a home for the Jewish people in Palestine, ''secured by public law''.\n\nDuring the course of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British mandate in Palestine]], the [[British government]] sought to reconcile the two claims in different ways. A number of proposals and declarations were put forward, all of which were rejected by one party or the other, and usually both. Again, two different interpretations apply:\n* The Israeli perspective is that the [[United Kingdom]] only had the mandate to propose solutions in keeping with the resolutions adopted at the [[San Remo Conference]], not to amend them. In other words, that the relevant resolutions adopted at the San Remo Conference are the public law that awarded the Jewish people de jure sovereignty over Palestine.{{Dubious| date=December 2011}}\n* The Arab perspective views British proposals as promises (subsequently broken) to the people of Palestine, see also the [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]].  {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the British government decided to abandon its mandate in Palestine. A [[United Nations]] Commission ([[UNSCOP]]) was assigned to recommend a solution to the conflict to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The recommendation was a [[1947 UN Partition Plan|partition plan]] that would result in an Arab and a Jewish state in the remaining mandate, and [[Jerusalem]] under UN rule, was approved by the General Assembly.\n\nHowever, the resolution served partially as a basis for the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} to take effect when Great Britain's mandate expired. Many states granted the State of Israel either ''[[de facto]]'' or ''[[de jure]]'' recognition. Israel was accepted as a sovereign member state in the United Nations and has [[Foreign relations of Israel|diplomatic relations]] with many, but not all, sovereign states.\n\n===The legal consequence of subsequent events===\nSeveral events have affected the legal issues related to the conflict:\n* After the war in 1948, the mandate ended up being split between Israel, [[Egypt]] and Jordan. Israel and [[Rule of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Jordan annexed]] all areas under their administration; [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egypt maintained a military occupation of Gaza]]. The United Nations attempted to assert its authority over Jerusalem but the designated mediator, [[Folke Bernadotte|Count Bernadotte]], was killed by the militant [[Zionism|Zionist]] group [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] while pursuing his official duties, and the city ended up being split between Israel and Jordan. Lehi had feared that Israel would agree to Bernadotte's peace proposals, which they considered disastrous, unaware that the provisional Israeli government had already rejected a proposal by Bernadotte the day before.<ref>A. Ilan, ''Bernadotte in Palestine'', 1948 (Macmillan, 1989) p. 194</ref>\n* Although there were numerous informal and backchannel communications between Israel and Arab states through the years, all Arab states refused to accept Israel's sovereignty until 1979, and most (excluding [[Jordan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Egypt]]) persisted in rejecting Israel's desire to exist (see [[Khartoum Resolution]]) until the 2002 [[Arab Peace Initiative]] that offers Israel peace and normal relations with all Arab countries if Israel withdraws from all areas occupied in the 1967 war and \"attain a just solution\" to the [[Palestinian refugee]] problem \"to be agreed upon in accordance with the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN General Assembly Resolution 194]]\".\n* The [[Six-Day War|war in 1967]] brought all remaining parts of the Mandate (as defined by Great Britain in 1947) as well as the Sinai Peninsula and parts of the Golan Heights under Israeli administration. Israel subsequently effectively [[annexed]] [[East Jerusalem]], asserting that the West Bank and Gaza were \"[[disputed territories]]\". The United Nations Security Council rejected the effective annexation of East Jerusalem and Golan Heights as \"null and void\" in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 497]] respectively, and consider Israel to hold the Gaza Strip, the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|West Bank, including East Jerusalem]], and the Golan Heights under [[military occupation]].\n* Both as a result of the wars in 1948 and 1967, Arab residents of the former Mandate were displaced and classified by the United Nations as \"[[Palestinian refugee|refugees]]\".\n* In approximately the same time frame, most Jews in Arab states fled or were forced to leave, with most of them [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|absorbed by Israel]].\n* United Nations Security Council issued [[UN Security Council Resolution 242|resolution 242]] that set the framework for a resolution through \"[[land for peace]]\".\n* In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]], Israel returning Sinai in return for peace, agreeing on international borders between the two states, but leaving the disposition of Gaza for peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.\n* In 1988, the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] declared \"the establishment of the State of Palestine in the land of Palestine with its capital at Jerusalem.\"<ref name=doi-un>{{cite web|title=Political Communiqu\u00e9 of the Palestine National Council and Declaration of Independence of 15 November 1988|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6EB54A389E2DA6C6852560DE0070E392|publisher=United Nations General Assembly Security Council|accessdate=11 July 2011|date=18 November 1988|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728142712/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6EB54A389E2DA6C6852560DE0070E392|archivedate=28 July 2011}}</ref> Jordan relinquished it\u2019s claims to the West Bank.\n* In 1993, the PLO and Israel signed a [[Oslo Accords|declaration of principles]] that included mutual recognition and the ultimate goal of establishing [[self rule]] for the Palestinian people.\n* In 1994, [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Jordan and Israel also signed a peace treaty]].\n* No other Arab state has granted legal recognition of Israel's sovereignty. A formal state of war still exists between Israel and several Arab states, though [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice agreements]] govern interaction between the states.\n* Several attempts at finalizing the terms for a peace agreement between Israel and the PLO have failed. In 2006 the Palestinians elected [[Hamas]] into power, a party that does not recognize Israel as legitimate.\n\n==Legal issues related to the wars==\n[[Sovereign state]]s have the right to defend themselves against overt external aggression, in the form of an invasion or other attack. A number of states assert that this principle extends to the right to launch military actions to reduce a threat, protect vital interests, or pre-empt a possible attack or emerging threat.\n\n===Wars between Israel and Arab states===\nSecurity Council resolution 242, emphasized \"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,\" setting the stage for controversy on the legal status of areas captured in 1967, and in 1948.{{citation needed|reason=1948?|date=April 2016}}\n\nThere are two interpretations of this matter:\n* The Israeli position is that:\n** The wars in [[Suez Crisis|1956]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]] were waged by Israel to ensure the state's survival. As most hostilities were initiated by the Arab side, Israel had to fight and win these wars in order to ensure the state's sovereignty and safety. Territories captured in the course of those wars are therefore legitimately under Israeli administration for both security reasons and to deter hostile states from belligerence.\n** In the absence of peace treaties between all the parties at war, Israel has under all circumstances the right to maintain control of the captured territories. Their ultimate disposition should be a result of peace treaties, and not a condition for them.  Even so, Israel asserts that:\n*** The [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] was caused by a pattern of Egyptian belligerence against Israel, culminating with the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]] and the blockage of the canal for Israeli traffic in violation of the [[Convention of Constantinople]] and other relevant treaties, in their view a clear ''casus belli'' (i.e., an act justifying war)\n*** The [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] was similarly caused by the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]], the rejection of UN forces in the Sinai desert, and the redeployment of Egyptian forces. Jordan and Syria entered the war in spite of Israeli efforts to keep these frontiers peaceful.\n*** The [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]] was a surprise attack against Israel by Syria and Egypt.\n* The Arab position is that:\n** The 1956 war came after an Israeli attack on the Gaza strip killing 25 Egyptian soldiers, and was a result of a conspiracy between France, the United Kingdom and Israel in violation of Egypt's sovereignty.  Egypt claimed several legal justifications for refusing Israel use of the Suez Canal, including the right of self-defence.\n** The war in 1967 was an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at expanding the boundaries of Israel, and the territories captured during this war are illegally occupied.\n** As a result, the territories must be ceded in order for peace to be discussed.\n\nAs noted above, Israel, Egypt, and Jordan have resolved this impasse and have recognized international borders between these states. The dispute has now shifted to the conflict between the [[Palestinians]] and Israel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shalim|first=Avi|title=The Iron Wall|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-028870-4|pages=117\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues related to occupation==\nThe Geneva Conventions and other international tractates recognize that land a) conquered in the course of a war; and b) the disposition of which is unresolved through subsequent peace treaties is \"occupied\" and subject to international laws of war and [[international humanitarian law]].<ref>Klapper, Bradley S.

This was approved by the General Assembly in November 1947, accepted by the Jews and rejected by the Arabs. However, the 1948\u20131949 war resulted in Israel occupying the western portion of the city. Israel made Jerusalem its capital in 1950, establishing governmental offices in areas it controlled. Soon afterward in 1950, Jordan annexed the eastern part along with the remainder of the West Bank.\n\nAfter the 1967 war, Israel put the parts of Jerusalem that had been captured during the war under its jurisdiction and civilian administration, establishing new municipal borders.  Arguing that this did not amount to annexation at the time, subsequent legal actions have been interpreted as consistent with an annexation.\n\nOn July 30, 1980, the [[Knesset]] passed a basic law making \"Jerusalem, complete and united\u2026the capital of Israel.\"  Since then Israel has extended the municipal boundaries several times.\n\nOn October 6, 2002, [[Yasser Arafat]] signed the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]]'s law making Al Quds \"the eternal capital of Palestine.\"\n\nInternational bodies such as the United Nations have condemned Israel's Basic Law concerning Jerusalem as a violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] and therefore hold that the establishment of the city as Israel's capital is against international law.

Article 33 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] categorize collective punishment in occupied territories as a [[war crime]].\n** At various locations, the selected route of the barrier required the demolition of Palestinian property, in violation of article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Conventions.\n** The barrier is an attempt to establish ''de facto'' borders between Israel and a future Palestinian state, in effect annexing large parts of West Bank and all of East Jerusalem, in violation of numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions.\n** The barrier attempts to separate Palestinians from their means of livelihood and from interaction with others and it, therefore, qualifies as [[apartheid]]. Apartheid is illegal as per the 2002 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and is considered a [[crime against humanity]] (see also: [[Israel and the apartheid analogy]]).\n** The barrier is constructed ''inside'' of the West Bank, making it completely in violation of international law.\n** The barrier differs from all other protective barriers built by any other state (such as the Berlin Wall, or the US-Mexico border) in that it is not constructed on the border between states but rather crosses the occupied territories in numerous locations, and with existing/expanding settlements, divides the occupied territories into 4 or 5 [[Canton (country subdivision)|cantons]].\n* Israel defends the security barrier by arguing that:\n** The barrier and its route are solely security measures that will have no bearing on future peace negotiations.\n** The land is not subject to the Geneva Conventions.\n** The Geneva Conventions explicitly allows structures to be built for purposes of self-defense.\n** The Israeli Supreme Court is reviewing the route on a continuous basis and has forced it to change.\n** [[StandWithUs]], a pro-Israel advocacy organization, defends the security fence by pointing out:\n*** Israel did not begin building the fence until 2003 when terrorism reached unprecedented levels.\n*** The fence is similar to [[Separation barrier|barriers]] that dozens of other [[Democracy|democracies]] have built to keep out terrorists or illegal immigrants, such as the barriers between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]], [[India]] and [[Kashmir]], [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]], [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] and even the walls within [[Belfast]] that separate Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods.\n*** Since construction of the fence began in 2003, the number of completed terrorist attacks has dropped by more than 90%.\n*** 97% of the barrier is a chain-link fence similar to those along the United States's border; only 3% (10 miles) is a concrete wall, built to prevent sniper shooting prevalent in certain areas.\n*** Only 5%\u20138% of the West Bank and less than 1% of Palestinians will end up on the Israeli side of the fence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2268|title=Israel's Newly Approved Security Fence Route|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=1|title=The West Bank Fence|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n*** Palestinians can bring their specific grievances about the barrier to [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israel's Supreme Court]], which in several cases has ruled that the fence must be re-routed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal+Issues+And+Rulings/High+Court+rules+on+security+fence+around+ALFEI+MENASHE+15-SEP-2005.htm?DMode=print|title=High Court of Justice rules on security fence around Alfei Menashe|work=GxMSDev|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the United Nations passed a number of resolutions and the [[International Court of Justice]] issued a ruling where judges ruled 14\u20131 that the portions of the Israeli West Bank barrier that are located within occupied Palestinian territories are illegal under international law.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140825085245/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1677.pdf]<ref>Falk, Richard (July 20, 2004).

The [[Palestinian Authority]] is not a member of the court but was allowed to make a submission by virtue of being a UN observer and a co-sponsor of the General Assembly resolution. In January 2004, the court also authorized the [[League of Arab States]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] to make submissions.\n\nIsrael initially announced that it would cooperate with the court, while noting that advisory rulings of the ICJ are not binding. Israel later made a written submission to the court rejecting the authority of the court to rule on the case, but announced (on February 12, 2004) that it would not appear at the court to make oral submissions.\n\nOn January 30, 2004, Israel announced officially it did not recognize ICJ authority to rule over the barrier issue. Israel also dispatched a 120-page document, elaborating on the security needs to build the \"terror prevention fence\" and purporting to demonstrate the atrocities committed by [[Palestinian terrorism|Palestinian terrorists]]. The document also included a judicial part with legal accounts supporting Israel's claim that the issue of the barrier is political and not in the ICJ authority.\n\nOn 23, 24, and 25 February 2004 the hearings before the International Court of Justice took place in the [[Peace Palace]] at [[the Hague]].\n\n===Ruling of the ICJ===\n[[File:Israeli West Bank barrier watchtower.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti on the barrier, reading \"Illegal.\"]]\nOn July 9, 2004, the International Court of Justice issued its opinion against the barrier, calling for it to be removed and the Arab residents to be compensated for any damage done. The Court advised that the United Nations General Assembly, which had asked for the ruling, and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] should act on the issue.\n\nA summary of the ruling is as follows:<ref name=\"icj-cij.org\">[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, [[International Court of Justice]] [[Advisory Opinion]], July 9, 2004, paragraph 163.</ref>\n# The construction of the wall by the [[Military occupation|occupying power]] Israel in the [[Palestinian territories|Occupied Palestinian Territory]], including around [[East Jerusalem]] and its regime are \"contrary to international law\u201d.\n# Israel is obligated to stop construction of the wall, including around [[East Jerusalem]] and to dismantle the structure, and to repeal all legislative and regulatory acts relating to the wall.\n# Israel is obligated to \"make [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparation]] for all damages caused\" by the wall, including around East Jerusalem\u201d.\n# All states are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal wall and \"not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation\", and to \"ensure compliance by Israel with [[international humanitarian law]]\" in accordance with the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] relating to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949, while \"respecting the [[United Nations Charter]] and international law, as embodied in that convention\u201d\".\n# The [[United Nations General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal wall and the associated regime.\u201d\n\nThe opinion was passed 14-1 by the court judges, except for the 4th decision which was passed 13\u20132.\n\n[[Thomas Buergenthal]], the American judge, was the sole dissenting member of the 15 judges on this ICJ panel. In his declaration, he stated that there was much in the court's opinion with which he agreed but that the court should have declined to hear the case since it did not have before it \"relevant facts bearing directly on issues of Israel's legitimate right of self-defense\". He stated that his dissenting opinion \"should not be seen as reflecting my view that the construction of the wall by Israel on the Occupied Palestinian Territory does not raise serious questions as a matter of international law.\" On the point of portions of the wall that were being built beyond the green line, which Israel stated were to defend settlements, Buergenthal stated:<ref name=\"icj-cij.org\" />\n\n<blockquote>''Paragraph 6 of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention also does not admit exceptions on grounds of military or security exigencies. It provides that \"the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies\". I agree that this provision applies to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that their existence violates Article 49, paragraph 6. It follows that the segments of the wall being built by Israel to protect the settlements are ''[[ipso facto]]'' in violation of international humanitarian law. Moreover, given the demonstrable great hardship to which the affected Palestinian population is being subjected in and around the enclaves created by those segments of the wall, seriously doubt that the wall would here satisfy the proportionality requirement to qualify as a legitimate measure of self-defence.''</blockquote>\n\n===Reaction to the ICJ===\nThe opinion was accepted by the United Nations General Assembly,<ref name=\"Dugard2006\">{{cite book|author=John Dugard|title=International Law: A South African Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9PFcjzhFcYC&pg=PA477|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=30 June 2006|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=978-0-7021-7121-5|page=477}}</ref> on July 20, 2004, it passed a resolution demanding that Israel obey the ICJ ruling.

The United States also rejected the ruling, declaring that the issue was of political rather than legal nature. [[Colin Powell]] stated that barrier was effective against terror, and noted that the ICJ ruling was not binding, but insisted that Israel not use the barrier to predetermine permanent borders. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/449648.html]\n\nNumerous human rights organizations welcomed the ICJ ruling. [[Amnesty International]] said that Israel should immediately cease constructing the barrier. The governments of Israel's neighbors [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]] also welcomed the ruling.\n\nOn July 13, 2004, the US House of Representatives passed Resolution HR 713 deploring \"the misuse of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)... for the narrow political purpose of advancing the Palestinian position on matters Palestinian authorities have said should be the subject of negotiations between the parties.\" [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.RES.713:] The Resolution further stated that twenty-three countries, including every member of the [[G8]] and several other European states, had \"submitted objections on various grounds against the ICJ hearing the case.\"\n\n==Legal issues related to refugees==\n\n===Legal definition of refugee===\nThe tractate that is most often invoked for legally defining [[refugee]]s is the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]]. The definition of \"refugee\" is most often summarized as\n<blockquote>\n''... a person who is outside his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution.'' The convention is administered by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR).\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA), which was established prior to the 1951 convention in response to the humanitarian crisis, applies a different definition:\n<blockquote>\n''Under UNRWA's operational definition, Palestine refugees are persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. UNRWA's services are available to all those living in its area of operations who meet this definition, who are registered with the Agency and who need assistance. UNRWA's definition of a refugee also covers the descendants of persons who became refugees in 1948.''\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the definition used by UNRWA was originally made on an operational basis rather than dictated by specific international law, obligations and rights related to Palestinian refugees under international law are a matter of some debate.  The debate centers on questions such as: whether the status of refugees can properly be passed through inheritance to individuals who have never lived in the vacated areas, and whether individuals who have repatriated in other countries can legally claim refugee status.\n\nPalestinian refugees were excluded from the 1951 Convention due to the clause that \"This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection or assistance.\" As [https://web.archive.org/web/20050411161104/http://www.badil.org/Publications/Other/UNHCR-1D-Handbook92.htm interpreted] by UNHCR, this caused some anomalies, since UNRWA admits some persons as refugees that are not automatically admitted by the Convention, and, conversely, some of the legal protections given to refugees by the Convention were not available to most Palestinians. In 2002, UNHCR adopted a revised interpretation that fills some of these gaps.

In 1890, the [[First International Conference of American States]] adopted a proscription against territorial conquest and agreed upon the non-recognition of all acquisitions made by force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/chapul.asp|title=The Avalon Project : Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance and Solidarity (Act of Chapultepec); March 6, 1945|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\nThose principles and regional understandings were recognized in  Article 21 of the Covenant of the [[League of Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/leagcov.asp#art21|title=Avalon Project \u2013 The Covenant of the League of Nations|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref> The system of mandates contained in article 22 of the Covenant was based in part upon those normative declarations and state practices.

No territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized.</blockquote>\n\n==Legal issues related to sovereignty==\nIn their relations with other peoples and countries during the colonial era the [[Concert of Europe]] adopted a fundamental legal principle that the supreme legal authority, or [[sovereignty]], lay outside the indigenous nations. That legal principle resulted in the creation of a large number of dependent states with restricted sovereignty or colonial autonomy. Various terms were used to describe different types of dependent states, such as condominium, mandate, protectorate, colony, and vassal state. After World War II there was strong international pressure to eliminate dependencies associated with colonialism.<ref>see [http://law.jrank.org/pages/6068/Dependent-States.html American Law Encyclopedia Vol 3, Dependent States], [http://www.un-documents.net/ch-11.htm The Declaration Regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories, in Chapter XI of the UN Charter], and [http://www.un-documents.net/a15r1514.htm The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV)]</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of the world's sovereign states resulted from the grant of independence to colonial peoples and dependent territories. Prior to World War II many states were formed as a result of [[war]]s that were resolved through [[Peace treaty|peace treaties]]. Some of these peace treaties were imposed on the losing side in a war; others came about as a result of negotiations that followed wars, or were entered into under the threat of war. In these cases, the applicable law was bound in peace treaties among the states. The practice of territorial aggrandizement was prohibited by the UN Charter, a multilateral treaty, and the authoritative explanation of its legal principles contained in UN General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, Declaration of Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3dda1f104.html|title=Refworld \u2013 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref> The purpose of the United Nations is the prevention and removal of threats to peace and the suppression of acts of aggression.

For example, the International Court of Justice advisory opinion noted that access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places had been protected by various laws dating back to the early Ottoman Empire, with the latest provisions having been incorporated into the UN Partition Plan, article 13 of the League of Nations Mandate, and Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris in 1814 called for a congress of the Great Powers of Europe to settle the future boundaries of the continent. Nearly every state in Europe was represented, and among other things a prohibition on unilateral annexation was adopted. This bolstered the concept of territorial integrity, which was enshrined in the Congress of Vienna in 1815.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/26.3/benvenisti.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207231639/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/26.3/benvenisti.html |archivedate=2011-02-07 }} Benvenisti, Eyal, The Origins of the Concept of Belligerent Occupation.

After the Russo-Turkish Wars in 1878, Russia and the Ottoman Empire concluded the Treaty of San Stefano. Because it modified the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1856, the other signatories called for a Congress to obtain its revision. The Treaty of Berlin of 1878 was the result. Montenegro, Serbia, and Romania were recognized as new independent states and granted specific territory on condition that religious, political, and property rights of minorities were guaranteed on a nondiscriminatory basis.<ref>See Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection, 1878\u20131938, Carole Fink, Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-02994-5}}, p. 37</ref> The delegates of the [[First Zionist Congress]] acknowledged these customary diplomatic precedents in the [[Basle Program]]. It stated that the aim of Zionism was the creation of a home for the Jewish people in Palestine, ''secured by public law''.\n\nDuring the course of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British mandate in Palestine]], the [[British government]] sought to reconcile the two claims in different ways. A number of proposals and declarations were put forward, all of which were rejected by one party or the other, and usually both. Again, two different interpretations apply:\n* The Israeli perspective is that the [[United Kingdom]] only had the mandate to propose solutions in keeping with the resolutions adopted at the [[San Remo Conference]], not to amend them. In other words, that the relevant resolutions adopted at the San Remo Conference are the public law that awarded the Jewish people de jure sovereignty over Palestine.{{Dubious| date=December 2011}}\n* The Arab perspective views British proposals as promises (subsequently broken) to the people of Palestine, see also the [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]].  {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the British government decided to abandon its mandate in Palestine. A [[United Nations]] Commission ([[UNSCOP]]) was assigned to recommend a solution to the conflict to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The recommendation was a [[1947 UN Partition Plan|partition plan]] that would result in an Arab and a Jewish state in the remaining mandate, and [[Jerusalem]] under UN rule, was approved by the General Assembly.\n\nHowever, the resolution served partially as a basis for the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} to take effect when Great Britain's mandate expired. Many states granted the State of Israel either ''[[de facto]]'' or ''[[de jure]]'' recognition. Israel was accepted as a sovereign member state in the United Nations and has [[Foreign relations of Israel|diplomatic relations]] with many, but not all, sovereign states.\n\n===The legal consequence of subsequent events===\nSeveral events have affected the legal issues related to the conflict:\n* After the war in 1948, the mandate ended up being split between Israel, [[Egypt]] and Jordan. Israel and [[Rule of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Jordan annexed]] all areas under their administration; [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egypt maintained a military occupation of Gaza]]. The United Nations attempted to assert its authority over Jerusalem but the designated mediator, [[Folke Bernadotte|Count Bernadotte]], was killed by the militant [[Zionism|Zionist]] group [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] while pursuing his official duties, and the city ended up being split between Israel and Jordan. Lehi had feared that Israel would agree to Bernadotte's peace proposals, which they considered disastrous, unaware that the provisional Israeli government had already rejected a proposal by Bernadotte the day before.<ref>A. Ilan, ''Bernadotte in Palestine'', 1948 (Macmillan, 1989) p. 194</ref>\n* Although there were numerous informal and backchannel communications between Israel and Arab states through the years, all Arab states refused to accept Israel's sovereignty until 1979, and most (excluding [[Jordan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Egypt]]) persisted in rejecting Israel's desire to exist (see [[Khartoum Resolution]]) until the 2002 [[Arab Peace Initiative]] that offers Israel peace and normal relations with all Arab countries if Israel withdraws from all areas occupied in the 1967 war and \"attain a just solution\" to the [[Palestinian refugee]] problem \"to be agreed upon in accordance with the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN General Assembly Resolution 194]]\".\n* The [[Six-Day War|war in 1967]] brought all remaining parts of the Mandate (as defined by Great Britain in 1947) as well as the Sinai Peninsula and parts of the Golan Heights under Israeli administration. Israel subsequently effectively [[annexed]] [[East Jerusalem]], asserting that the West Bank and Gaza were \"[[disputed territories]]\". The United Nations Security Council rejected the effective annexation of East Jerusalem and Golan Heights as \"null and void\" in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 497]] respectively, and consider Israel to hold the Gaza Strip, the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|West Bank, including East Jerusalem]], and the Golan Heights under [[military occupation]].\n* Both as a result of the wars in 1948 and 1967, Arab residents of the former Mandate were displaced and classified by the United Nations as \"[[Palestinian refugee|refugees]]\".\n* In approximately the same time frame, most Jews in Arab states fled or were forced to leave, with most of them [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|absorbed by Israel]].\n* United Nations Security Council issued [[UN Security Council Resolution 242|resolution 242]] that set the framework for a resolution through \"[[land for peace]]\".\n* In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]], Israel returning Sinai in return for peace, agreeing on international borders between the two states, but leaving the disposition of Gaza for peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.\n* In 1988, the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] declared \"the establishment of the State of Palestine in the land of Palestine with its capital at Jerusalem.\"<ref name=doi-un>{{cite web|title=Political Communiqu\u00e9 of the Palestine National Council and Declaration of Independence of 15 November 1988|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6EB54A389E2DA6C6852560DE0070E392|publisher=United Nations General Assembly Security Council|accessdate=11 July 2011|date=18 November 1988|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728142712/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6EB54A389E2DA6C6852560DE0070E392|archivedate=28 July 2011}}</ref> Jordan relinquished it\u2019s claims to the West Bank.\n* In 1993, the PLO and Israel signed a [[Oslo Accords|declaration of principles]] that included mutual recognition and the ultimate goal of establishing [[self rule]] for the Palestinian people.\n* In 1994, [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Jordan and Israel also signed a peace treaty]].\n* No other Arab state has granted legal recognition of Israel's sovereignty. A formal state of war still exists between Israel and several Arab states, though [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice agreements]] govern interaction between the states.\n* Several attempts at finalizing the terms for a peace agreement between Israel and the PLO have failed. In 2006 the Palestinians elected [[Hamas]] into power, a party that does not recognize Israel as legitimate.\n\n==Legal issues related to the wars==\n[[Sovereign state]]s have the right to defend themselves against overt external aggression, in the form of an invasion or other attack. A number of states assert that this principle extends to the right to launch military actions to reduce a threat, protect vital interests, or pre-empt a possible attack or emerging threat.\n\n===Wars between Israel and Arab states===\nSecurity Council resolution 242, emphasized \"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,\" setting the stage for controversy on the legal status of areas captured in 1967, and in 1948.{{citation needed|reason=1948?|date=April 2016}}\n\nThere are two interpretations of this matter:\n* The Israeli position is that:\n** The wars in [[Suez Crisis|1956]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]] were waged by Israel to ensure the state's survival. As most hostilities were initiated by the Arab side, Israel had to fight and win these wars in order to ensure the state's sovereignty and safety. Territories captured in the course of those wars are therefore legitimately under Israeli administration for both security reasons and to deter hostile states from belligerence.\n** In the absence of peace treaties between all the parties at war, Israel has under all circumstances the right to maintain control of the captured territories. Their ultimate disposition should be a result of peace treaties, and not a condition for them.  Even so, Israel asserts that:\n*** The [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] was caused by a pattern of Egyptian belligerence against Israel, culminating with the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]] and the blockage of the canal for Israeli traffic in violation of the [[Convention of Constantinople]] and other relevant treaties, in their view a clear ''casus belli'' (i.e., an act justifying war)\n*** The [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] was similarly caused by the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]], the rejection of UN forces in the Sinai desert, and the redeployment of Egyptian forces. Jordan and Syria entered the war in spite of Israeli efforts to keep these frontiers peaceful.\n*** The [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]] was a surprise attack against Israel by Syria and Egypt.\n* The Arab position is that:\n** The 1956 war came after an Israeli attack on the Gaza strip killing 25 Egyptian soldiers, and was a result of a conspiracy between France, the United Kingdom and Israel in violation of Egypt's sovereignty.  Egypt claimed several legal justifications for refusing Israel use of the Suez Canal, including the right of self-defence.\n** The war in 1967 was an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at expanding the boundaries of Israel, and the territories captured during this war are illegally occupied.\n** As a result, the territories must be ceded in order for peace to be discussed.\n\nAs noted above, Israel, Egypt, and Jordan have resolved this impasse and have recognized international borders between these states. The dispute has now shifted to the conflict between the [[Palestinians]] and Israel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shalim|first=Avi|title=The Iron Wall|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-028870-4|pages=117\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues related to occupation==\nThe Geneva Conventions and other international tractates recognize that land a) conquered in the course of a war; and b) the disposition of which is unresolved through subsequent peace treaties is \"occupied\" and subject to international laws of war and [[international humanitarian law]].<ref>Klapper, Bradley S.

This was approved by the General Assembly in November 1947, accepted by the Jews and rejected by the Arabs. However, the 1948\u20131949 war resulted in Israel occupying the western portion of the city. Israel made Jerusalem its capital in 1950, establishing governmental offices in areas it controlled. Soon afterward in 1950, Jordan annexed the eastern part along with the remainder of the West Bank.\n\nAfter the 1967 war, Israel put the parts of Jerusalem that had been captured during the war under its jurisdiction and civilian administration, establishing new municipal borders.  Arguing that this did not amount to annexation at the time, subsequent legal actions have been interpreted as consistent with an annexation.\n\nOn July 30, 1980, the [[Knesset]] passed a basic law making \"Jerusalem, complete and united\u2026the capital of Israel.\"  Since then Israel has extended the municipal boundaries several times.\n\nOn October 6, 2002, [[Yasser Arafat]] signed the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]]'s law making Al Quds \"the eternal capital of Palestine.\"\n\nInternational bodies such as the United Nations have condemned Israel's Basic Law concerning Jerusalem as a violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] and therefore hold that the establishment of the city as Israel's capital is against international law.

Apartheid is illegal as per the 2002 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and is considered a [[crime against humanity]] (see also: [[Israel and the apartheid analogy]]).\n** The barrier is constructed ''inside'' of the West Bank, making it completely in violation of international law.\n** The barrier differs from all other protective barriers built by any other state (such as the Berlin Wall, or the US-Mexico border) in that it is not constructed on the border between states but rather crosses the occupied territories in numerous locations, and with existing/expanding settlements, divides the occupied territories into 4 or 5 [[Canton (country subdivision)|cantons]].\n* Israel defends the security barrier by arguing that:\n** The barrier and its route are solely security measures that will have no bearing on future peace negotiations.\n** The land is not subject to the Geneva Conventions.\n** The Geneva Conventions explicitly allows structures to be built for purposes of self-defense.\n** The Israeli Supreme Court is reviewing the route on a continuous basis and has forced it to change.\n** [[StandWithUs]], a pro-Israel advocacy organization, defends the security fence by pointing out:\n*** Israel did not begin building the fence until 2003 when terrorism reached unprecedented levels.\n*** The fence is similar to [[Separation barrier|barriers]] that dozens of other [[Democracy|democracies]] have built to keep out terrorists or illegal immigrants, such as the barriers between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]], [[India]] and [[Kashmir]], [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]], [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] and even the walls within [[Belfast]] that separate Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods.\n*** Since construction of the fence began in 2003, the number of completed terrorist attacks has dropped by more than 90%.\n*** 97% of the barrier is a chain-link fence similar to those along the United States's border; only 3% (10 miles) is a concrete wall, built to prevent sniper shooting prevalent in certain areas.\n*** Only 5%\u20138% of the West Bank and less than 1% of Palestinians will end up on the Israeli side of the fence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2268|title=Israel's Newly Approved Security Fence Route|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=1|title=The West Bank Fence|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n*** Palestinians can bring their specific grievances about the barrier to [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israel's Supreme Court]], which in several cases has ruled that the fence must be re-routed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal+Issues+And+Rulings/High+Court+rules+on+security+fence+around+ALFEI+MENASHE+15-SEP-2005.htm?DMode=print|title=High Court of Justice rules on security fence around Alfei Menashe|work=GxMSDev|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the United Nations passed a number of resolutions and the [[International Court of Justice]] issued a ruling where judges ruled 14\u20131 that the portions of the Israeli West Bank barrier that are located within occupied Palestinian territories are illegal under international law.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140825085245/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1677.pdf]<ref>Falk, Richard (July 20, 2004).

The justification given by the U.S. for the veto was that the resolution did not condemn terrorist attacks made by Palestinian groups (see [[Negroponte doctrine]]).

The [[Palestinian Authority]] is not a member of the court but was allowed to make a submission by virtue of being a UN observer and a co-sponsor of the General Assembly resolution. In January 2004, the court also authorized the [[League of Arab States]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] to make submissions.\n\nIsrael initially announced that it would cooperate with the court, while noting that advisory rulings of the ICJ are not binding. Israel later made a written submission to the court rejecting the authority of the court to rule on the case, but announced (on February 12, 2004) that it would not appear at the court to make oral submissions.\n\nOn January 30, 2004, Israel announced officially it did not recognize ICJ authority to rule over the barrier issue. Israel also dispatched a 120-page document, elaborating on the security needs to build the \"terror prevention fence\" and purporting to demonstrate the atrocities committed by [[Palestinian terrorism|Palestinian terrorists]]. The document also included a judicial part with legal accounts supporting Israel's claim that the issue of the barrier is political and not in the ICJ authority.\n\nOn 23, 24, and 25 February 2004 the hearings before the International Court of Justice took place in the [[Peace Palace]] at [[the Hague]].\n\n===Ruling of the ICJ===\n[[File:Israeli West Bank barrier watchtower.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti on the barrier, reading \"Illegal.\"]]\nOn July 9, 2004, the International Court of Justice issued its opinion against the barrier, calling for it to be removed and the Arab residents to be compensated for any damage done. The Court advised that the United Nations General Assembly, which had asked for the ruling, and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] should act on the issue.\n\nA summary of the ruling is as follows:<ref name=\"icj-cij.org\">[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, [[International Court of Justice]] [[Advisory Opinion]], July 9, 2004, paragraph 163.</ref>\n# The construction of the wall by the [[Military occupation|occupying power]] Israel in the [[Palestinian territories|Occupied Palestinian Territory]], including around [[East Jerusalem]] and its regime are \"contrary to international law\u201d.\n# Israel is obligated to stop construction of the wall, including around [[East Jerusalem]] and to dismantle the structure, and to repeal all legislative and regulatory acts relating to the wall.\n# Israel is obligated to \"make [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparation]] for all damages caused\" by the wall, including around East Jerusalem\u201d.\n# All states are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal wall and \"not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation\", and to \"ensure compliance by Israel with [[international humanitarian law]]\" in accordance with the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] relating to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949, while \"respecting the [[United Nations Charter]] and international law, as embodied in that convention\u201d\".\n# The [[United Nations General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal wall and the associated regime.\u201d\n\nThe opinion was passed 14-1 by the court judges, except for the 4th decision which was passed 13\u20132.\n\n[[Thomas Buergenthal]], the American judge, was the sole dissenting member of the 15 judges on this ICJ panel. In his declaration, he stated that there was much in the court's opinion with which he agreed but that the court should have declined to hear the case since it did not have before it \"relevant facts bearing directly on issues of Israel's legitimate right of self-defense\". He stated that his dissenting opinion \"should not be seen as reflecting my view that the construction of the wall by Israel on the Occupied Palestinian Territory does not raise serious questions as a matter of international law.\" On the point of portions of the wall that were being built beyond the green line, which Israel stated were to defend settlements, Buergenthal stated:<ref name=\"icj-cij.org\" />\n\n<blockquote>''Paragraph 6 of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention also does not admit exceptions on grounds of military or security exigencies. It provides that \"the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies\". I agree that this provision applies to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that their existence violates Article 49, paragraph 6. It follows that the segments of the wall being built by Israel to protect the settlements are ''[[ipso facto]]'' in violation of international humanitarian law. Moreover, given the demonstrable great hardship to which the affected Palestinian population is being subjected in and around the enclaves created by those segments of the wall, seriously doubt that the wall would here satisfy the proportionality requirement to qualify as a legitimate measure of self-defence.''</blockquote>\n\n===Reaction to the ICJ===\nThe opinion was accepted by the United Nations General Assembly,<ref name=\"Dugard2006\">{{cite book|author=John Dugard|title=International Law: A South African Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9PFcjzhFcYC&pg=PA477|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=30 June 2006|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=978-0-7021-7121-5|page=477}}</ref> on July 20, 2004, it passed a resolution demanding that Israel obey the ICJ ruling.

This is a victory for the Palestinian people and for all the free peoples of the world.\"\n\nIsrael rejected the ICJ ruling and emphasized the barrier's self-defense aspect [http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/about%20the%20ministry/mfa%20spokesman/2004/Statement%20on%20ICJ%20Advisory%20Opinion%209-July-2004], and stressed that Israel will continue to build the barrier. The United States also rejected the ruling, declaring that the issue was of political rather than legal nature. [[Colin Powell]] stated that barrier was effective against terror, and noted that the ICJ ruling was not binding, but insisted that Israel not use the barrier to predetermine permanent borders. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/449648.html]\n\nNumerous human rights organizations welcomed the ICJ ruling. [[Amnesty International]] said that Israel should immediately cease constructing the barrier. The governments of Israel's neighbors [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]] also welcomed the ruling.\n\nOn July 13, 2004, the US House of Representatives passed Resolution HR 713 deploring \"the misuse of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)... for the narrow political purpose of advancing the Palestinian position on matters Palestinian authorities have said should be the subject of negotiations between the parties.\" [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.RES.713:] The Resolution further stated that twenty-three countries, including every member of the [[G8]] and several other European states, had \"submitted objections on various grounds against the ICJ hearing the case.\"\n\n==Legal issues related to refugees==\n\n===Legal definition of refugee===\nThe tractate that is most often invoked for legally defining [[refugee]]s is the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]]. The definition of \"refugee\" is most often summarized as\n<blockquote>\n''... a person who is outside his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution.'' The convention is administered by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR).\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA), which was established prior to the 1951 convention in response to the humanitarian crisis, applies a different definition:\n<blockquote>\n''Under UNRWA's operational definition, Palestine refugees are persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. UNRWA's services are available to all those living in its area of operations who meet this definition, who are registered with the Agency and who need assistance. UNRWA's definition of a refugee also covers the descendants of persons who became refugees in 1948.''\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the definition used by UNRWA was originally made on an operational basis rather than dictated by specific international law, obligations and rights related to Palestinian refugees under international law are a matter of some debate.  The debate centers on questions such as: whether the status of refugees can properly be passed through inheritance to individuals who have never lived in the vacated areas, and whether individuals who have repatriated in other countries can legally claim refugee status.\n\nPalestinian refugees were excluded from the 1951 Convention due to the clause that \"This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection or assistance.\" As [https://web.archive.org/web/20050411161104/http://www.badil.org/Publications/Other/UNHCR-1D-Handbook92.htm interpreted] by UNHCR, this caused some anomalies, since UNRWA admits some persons as refugees that are not automatically admitted by the Convention, and, conversely, some of the legal protections given to refugees by the Convention were not available to most Palestinians. In 2002, UNHCR adopted a revised interpretation that fills some of these gaps. The BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights published a critical analysis of UNHCR revised interpretation of the 1951 Refugee Convention.<ref name=badilnov2002>{{cite web|title=A Critical Analysis of the Revised UNHCR Interpretation|publisher=BADIL|accessdate=11 July 2011|url=http://www.badil.org/en/component/k2/item/994-refugee-protection |date=November 2002}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Arab\u2013Israeli peace diplomacy and treaties==\n* [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]\n* [[Faisal\u2013Weizmann Agreement]] (1919)\n* [[San Remo Conference]], 1920\n* [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine Mandate]], 1922\n* [[1949 Armistice Agreements]]\n* [[Camp David Accords (1978)]]\n* [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]] (1979)\n* [[Madrid Conference of 1991]]\n* [[Oslo Accords]] (1993)\n* [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty]] (1994)\n* [[Camp David 2000 Summit]]\n* [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process]]\n* [[Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs]]\n* [[List of Middle East peace proposals]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/mideast.asp Collection of legal documents relating to the Middle East 1916\u20132003, Avalon Project \u2013 Yale Law School]\n* [https://archive.today/20121218130109/http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/04/560/020/A28/04020560.a28.htm Israeli Supreme Court Judgement Regarding the Security Fence, June 24, 2004]\n* {{Cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/imwp/imwp_advisory_opinion/imwp_advisory_opinion_20040709.htm |title=ICJ Ruling on Israel's Security Fence, July 9, 2004 |access-date=January 7, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002122847/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/imwp/imwp_advisory_opinion/imwp_advisory_opinion_20040709.htm |archive-date=October 2, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100828183722/http://www.diakonia.se/ihl Easy Guide to International Humanitarian Law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Law And The Arab-Israeli Conflict}}\n[[Category:International law]]\n[[Category:Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]\n", "name_user": "Selfstudier", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegal issues related to sovereignty:wl", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict"}

Both sides couldn't reach an agreement about the album material. Burgerkill decided to leave the label to release their third album under their own label, Revolt! Record, in August 2006.\nIn the days waiting to release their third album, the vocalist Ivan Scumbag died because of inflamed brain disease. ''[[Beyond Coma and Despair]]'', the title of their third album, has become some kind like Scumbag's personal reflection. To honor their past vocalist and friend, Kimung, the group's original bassist and Ivan Scumbag's childhood friend, released a biographical novel based on Ivan Scumbag's life in late 2007.

The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] were individual [[sovereign state]]s, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, though both were ruled by James in [[personal union]].\n\nJames was the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland]], and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was compelled to [[abdicate]] in his favour. Four different [[regent]]s governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he [[Succession to Elizabeth I of England|succeeded]] the last [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] monarch of England and Ireland, [[Elizabeth I]], who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known after him as the [[Jacobean era]], until his death. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 1617, and [[style (manner of address)|styled]] himself \"[[King of Great Britain and Ireland]]\". He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and [[British colonisation of the Americas]] began.\n\nAt 57 years and 246 days, James's reign in Scotland was the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign#Scotland|longest of any Scottish monarch]]. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the [[English Parliament]]. Under James, the \"Golden Age\" of [[Elizabethan literature]] and drama continued, with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Donne]], [[Ben Jonson]], and Sir [[Francis Bacon]] contributing to a flourishing literary culture.{{sfn|Milling|2004|p=155}} James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597), ''[[The True Law of Free Monarchies]]'' (1598), and ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' (1599). He sponsored the [[translation of the Bible]] into English that would later be named after him: the [[Authorized King James Version]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|Richards|Marshall|2003|p=1}}: \"James VI and I was the most writerly of British monarchs. He produced original poetry, as well as translation and a treatise on poetics; works on witchcraft and tobacco; meditations and commentaries on the [[Scriptures]]; a manual on kingship; works of [[political theory]]; and, of course, speeches to parliament&nbsp;... He was the patron of Shakespeare, Jonson, Donne, and the translators of the \"Authorized version\" of the Bible, surely the greatest concentration of literary talent ever to enjoy royal sponsorship in England.\"</ref> Sir [[Anthony Weldon]] claimed that James had been termed \"the wisest fool in [[Christianity|Christendom]]\", an epithet associated with his character ever since.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=238}}: \"The label 'the wisest fool in Christendom', often attributed to [[Henry IV of France]] but possibly coined by Anthony Weldon, catches James's paradoxical qualities very neatly\"; Sir Anthony Weldon (1651), ''The Court and Character of King James I'', quoted by {{harvnb|Stroud|1999|p=27}}: \"A very wise man was wont to say that he believed him the wisest fool in Christendom, meaning him wise in small things, but a fool in weighty affairs.\"</ref> Since the latter half of the 20th century, historians have tended to revise James's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch.<ref>{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=6}}: \"Historians have returned to reconsidering James as a serious and intelligent ruler\"; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=4\u20136}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=238}}: \"In contrast to earlier historians, recent research on his reign has tended to emphasize the wisdom and downplay the foolishness\".</ref> He was strongly committed to a peace policy, and tried to avoid involvement in [[religious wars]], especially the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) that devastated much of Central Europe. He tried but failed to prevent the rise of hawkish elements in the English Parliament who wanted war with Spain.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1959|pp=47\u201357}}</ref>\n\n==Childhood==\n\n===Birth===\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland by Arnold van Brounckhorst.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of James as a boy, after [[Arnold Bronckorst]], 1574.

Both Mary and Darnley were great-grandchildren of [[Henry VII of England]] through [[Margaret Tudor]], the older sister of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Mary's rule over Scotland was insecure, and she and her husband, being [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Roman Catholics]], faced a rebellion by [[Protestant]] noblemen.

He was baptised \"Charles James\" or \"James Charles\" on 17 December 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at [[Stirling Castle]]. His godparents were [[Charles IX of France]] (represented by [[John III, Count of Ligny|John, Count of Brienne]]), [[Elizabeth I of England]] (represented by the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]]), and [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] (represented by ambassador Philibert du Croc).{{efn|As the Earl of Bedford was a Protestant, his place in the ceremony was taken by [[Lady Jean Stewart|Jean, Countess of Argyll]].{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=17}} }} Mary refused to let the [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop of St Andrews]], whom she referred to as \"a pocky priest\", spit in the child's mouth, as was then the custom.{{sfn|Donaldson|1974|p=99}} The subsequent entertainment, devised by Frenchman [[Bastian Pagez]], featured men dressed as satyrs and sporting tails, to which the English guests took offence, thinking the satyrs \"done against them\".{{sfn|Thomson|1827|pp=171\u2013172}}\n\nJames's father, Darnley, was murdered on 10 February 1567 at [[Kirk o' Field]], Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge for the killing of Rizzio. James inherited his father's titles of [[Duke of Albany]] and [[Earl of Ross]]. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her.{{efn|Elizabeth I wrote to Mary: \"My ears have been so astounded, my mind so disturbed and my heart so appalled at hearing the horrible report of the abominable murder of your late husband and my slaughtered cousin, that I can scarcely as yet summon the spirit to write about it&nbsp;... I will not conceal from you that people for the most part are saying that you will look through your fingers at this deed instead of avenging it and that you don't care to take action against those who have done you this pleasure.\" Historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] nonetheless concludes: \"Not a single piece of uncontaminated evidence has ever been found to show that Mary had foreknowledge of Darnley's murder\".{{sfn|Guy|2004|pp=312\u2013313}} In historian David Harris Willson's view, however: \"That Bothwell was the murderer no one can doubt; and that Mary was his accomplice seems equally certain.\"{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=18}} }} In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in [[Loch Leven Castle]]; she never saw her son again. She was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate on 24 July 1567]] in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother, [[James Stewart, Earl of Moray]], as [[regent]].<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|2004|pp=364\u2013365}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=19}}.</ref>\n\n===Regencies===\n\n[[File:Mary Stuart James.jpg|thumb|James (right) depicted aged 17 beside his mother [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]] (left), 1583.

Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate lack of attention to the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy \u2013 now understood to be more troubled \u2013 which he left Charles I.<ref>{{citation|first=John|last=Cramsie|title=The Changing Reputations of Elizabeth I and James VI & I|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/334|work=Reviews and History: Covering books and digital resources across all fields of history|type=review no. 334|date=June 2003}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Titles, styles, honours, and arms==\n{{Infobox British Royalty styles|scotland\n|name=James VI, King of Scots\n| image    = Royal Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland (1603-1707).svg\n|dipstyle=His Grace\n|offstyle=Your Grace\n}}\n{{Infobox British Royalty styles|own\n|name=James I, King of England\n| image    = Royal Arms of England (1399-1603).svg\n|dipstyle=[[Majesty|His Majesty]]\n|offstyle=Your Majesty\n}}\n\n===Titles and styles===\nIn Scotland, James was \"James the sixth, King of Scotland\", until 1604.

[[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] as '''James I''' from the [[Union of the Crowns|union of the Scottish and English crowns]] on 24 March 1603 until his death in 1625. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] were individual [[sovereign state]]s, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, though both were ruled by James in [[personal union]].\n\nJames was the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland]], and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was compelled to [[abdicate]] in his favour. Four different [[regent]]s governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he [[Succession to Elizabeth I of England|succeeded]] the last [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] monarch of England and Ireland, [[Elizabeth I]], who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known after him as the [[Jacobean era]], until his death. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 1617, and [[style (manner of address)|styled]] himself \"[[King of Great Britain and Ireland]]\". He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and [[British colonisation of the Americas]] began.\n\nAt 57 years and 246 days, James's reign in Scotland was the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign#Scotland|longest of any Scottish monarch]]. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the [[English Parliament]]. Under James, the \"Golden Age\" of [[Elizabethan literature]] and drama continued, with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Donne]], [[Ben Jonson]], and Sir [[Francis Bacon]] contributing to a flourishing literary culture.{{sfn|Milling|2004|p=155}} James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597), ''[[The True Law of Free Monarchies]]'' (1598), and ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' (1599). He sponsored the [[translation of the Bible]] into English that would later be named after him: the [[Authorized King James Version]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|Richards|Marshall|2003|p=1}}: \"James VI and I was the most writerly of British monarchs. He produced original poetry, as well as translation and a treatise on poetics; works on witchcraft and tobacco; meditations and commentaries on the [[Scriptures]]; a manual on kingship; works of [[political theory]]; and, of course, speeches to parliament&nbsp;... He was the patron of Shakespeare, Jonson, Donne, and the translators of the \"Authorized version\" of the Bible, surely the greatest concentration of literary talent ever to enjoy royal sponsorship in England.\"</ref> Sir [[Anthony Weldon]] claimed that James had been termed \"the wisest fool in [[Christianity|Christendom]]\", an epithet associated with his character ever since.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=238}}: \"The label 'the wisest fool in Christendom', often attributed to [[Henry IV of France]] but possibly coined by Anthony Weldon, catches James's paradoxical qualities very neatly\"; Sir Anthony Weldon (1651), ''The Court and Character of King James I'', quoted by {{harvnb|Stroud|1999|p=27}}: \"A very wise man was wont to say that he believed him the wisest fool in Christendom, meaning him wise in small things, but a fool in weighty affairs.\"</ref> Since the latter half of the 20th century, historians have tended to revise James's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch.<ref>{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=6}}: \"Historians have returned to reconsidering James as a serious and intelligent ruler\"; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=4\u20136}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=238}}: \"In contrast to earlier historians, recent research on his reign has tended to emphasize the wisdom and downplay the foolishness\".</ref> He was strongly committed to a peace policy, and tried to avoid involvement in [[religious wars]], especially the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) that devastated much of Central Europe. He tried but failed to prevent the rise of hawkish elements in the [[English Parliament]] who wanted war with Spain.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1959|pp=47\u201357}}</ref>\n\n==Childhood==\n\n===Birth===\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland by Arnold van Brounckhorst.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of James as a boy, after [[Arnold Bronckorst]], 1574.

Both Mary and Darnley were great-grandchildren of [[Henry VII of England]] through [[Margaret Tudor]], the older sister of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Mary's rule over Scotland was insecure, and she and her husband, being [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Roman Catholics]], faced a rebellion by [[Protestant]] noblemen.

He was baptised \"Charles James\" or \"James Charles\" on 17 December 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at [[Stirling Castle]]. His godparents were [[Charles IX of France]] (represented by [[John III, Count of Ligny|John, Count of Brienne]]), [[Elizabeth I of England]] (represented by the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]]), and [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] (represented by ambassador Philibert du Croc).{{efn|As the Earl of Bedford was a Protestant, his place in the ceremony was taken by [[Lady Jean Stewart|Jean, Countess of Argyll]].{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=17}} }} Mary refused to let the [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop of St Andrews]], whom she referred to as \"a pocky priest\", spit in the child's mouth, as was then the custom.{{sfn|Donaldson|1974|p=99}} The subsequent entertainment, devised by Frenchman [[Bastian Pagez]], featured men dressed as satyrs and sporting tails, to which the English guests took offence, thinking the satyrs \"done against them\".{{sfn|Thomson|1827|pp=171\u2013172}}\n\nJames's father, Darnley, was murdered on 10 February 1567 at [[Kirk o' Field]], Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge for the killing of Rizzio. James inherited his father's titles of [[Duke of Albany]] and [[Earl of Ross]]. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her.{{efn|Elizabeth I wrote to Mary: \"My ears have been so astounded, my mind so disturbed and my heart so appalled at hearing the horrible report of the abominable murder of your late husband and my slaughtered cousin, that I can scarcely as yet summon the spirit to write about it&nbsp;...

She was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate on 24 July 1567]] in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother, [[James Stewart, Earl of Moray]], as [[regent]].<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|2004|pp=364\u2013365}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=19}}.</ref>\n\n===Regencies===\n\n[[File:Mary Stuart James.jpg|thumb|James (right) depicted aged 17 beside his mother [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]] (left), 1583.

His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate lack of attention to the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk.
