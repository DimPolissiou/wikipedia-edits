She was the first female winner of ''[[Academy Fantasia]]''.\n\n==Changes from Season 5==\n\nIt was announced before the season get started that there would be no surprise in a previous way like first five seasons. No voting back, or the other twists to get eliminated contestants back into the competition again. They would cut the contestants off week by week until the final concert, week 12. If so, it confirmed that would be only two finalists in the final round, unlike in the previously seasons.\n\nLater, it declared that at the end of every concerts, the judges would give '''The Immunity Idol''' to save one of the bottom three \ncontestants who performed best. This means that the immuned contestant would be safe automatically.\n\nOn the other hand, if the contestant with the fewest popular votes was not the same as the immuned contestant, they would send the fewest votes contestant home immediately as in a normal elimination scenario. From this rule, the number of finalists in the grand finale concert might be a whole top 12 (if '''The Immunity Idol''' could save every week), or only two candidates.\n\n==Auditions==\n\nThere were two channel for auditions, Live and Online. The contestants were required to between the ages of 18 to 28 years old who are not embedded with music recording contracts.\n\nThe Live Auditions were held in the following cities:\n*The South district, [[Surat Thani]]\n*The North district, [[Chiangmai]]\n*The Northeast district, [[Nakhon Ratchasima]]\n*The Center district, [[Bangkok]]\n\n==Semi-finalists==\n\nThe Top 100 finalists (50 from live audition and 50 from online audition) were announced and made the final audition together in front of all judges. The final audition were held at The Akara Theater of King Power Complex, Bangkok, on May 20, 2009.\n\nIn this season, they broadcast the final auditions live for two days on [[True Visions]]. The Top 100 finalists were cut off to Top 50, Top 30, and finally they declared the Top 12 who would get into the AF house to study and perform 12 concerts in this competition.\n\nIt was noticed that there were only 12 final contestants, unlike in the Season 4 and Season 5 which had Top 20 and Top 16, respectively, get into the house, and then cut them off to Top 12 within first two concerts.\n\n==Concert summaries==\n\n===Week 1 - My Style===\n''Original Airdate: July 4, 2009''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They announced list of three contestants step forward and made the audiences noticed those were bottom three; Tee (V5), Zani (V6), & Mac (V8). Then the judges decided to give the Immunity Idol to Zani (V6). After that they declared three of them were not bottom three, but top three of the week, and Zani (V6) was selected by judges to be as the best show in the top three ranks. From this, she got a special prize from a sponsor for her mother.\n\nBut it was not ended, they announced Koonjae-Sal (V3) & Ann (V10) step forward like they both are real bottom ranks, but they both were announced to be safe. This means the rest in the bottom line, Aof (V2), Newty (V4), & Nooknick (V9) are bottom three of a night. The judges had to judge again and Newty (V4) was immuned.

This was the fourth time for her that she was in the bottom ranks, but three times previously she had received the immunity idol.

Season 6''''' is the sixth season of ''[[Academy Fantasia]]'' which premiered on [[True Visions]] on June 29, 2009.\n\nZani (V6), Nipaporn Thitithanakarn, won in the competition. She was the first female winner of ''[[Academy Fantasia]]''.\n\n==Changes from Season 5==\n\nIt was announced before the season get started that there would be no surprise in a previous way like first five seasons. No voting back, or the other twists to get eliminated contestants back into the competition again. They would cut the contestants off week by week until the final concert, week 12. If so, it confirmed that would be only two finalists in the final round, unlike in the previously seasons.\n\nLater, it declared that at the end of every concerts, the judges would give '''The Immunity Idol''' to save one of the bottom three \ncontestants who performed best. This means that the immuned contestant would be safe automatically.\n\nOn the other hand, if the contestant with the fewest popular votes was not the same as the immuned contestant, they would send the fewest votes contestant home immediately as in a normal elimination scenario. From this rule, the number of finalists in the grand finale concert might be a whole top 12 (if '''The Immunity Idol''' could save every week), or only two candidates.\n\n==Auditions==\n\nThere were two channel for auditions, Live and Online. The contestants were required to between the ages of 18 to 28 years old who are not embedded with music recording contracts.\n\nThe Live Auditions were held in the following cities:\n*The South district, [[Surat Thani]]\n*The North district, [[Chiangmai]]\n*The Northeast district, [[Nakhon Ratchasima]]\n*The Center district, [[Bangkok]]\n\n==Semi-finalists==\n\nThe Top 100 finalists (50 from live audition and 50 from online audition) were announced and made the final audition together in front of all judges. The final audition were held at The Akara Theater of King Power Complex, Bangkok, on May 20, 2009.\n\nIn this season, they broadcast the final auditions live for two days on [[True Visions]]. The Top 100 finalists were cut off to Top 50, Top 30, and finally they declared the Top 12 who would get into the AF house to study and perform 12 concerts in this competition.\n\nIt was noticed that there were only 12 final contestants, unlike in the Season 4 and Season 5 which had Top 20 and Top 16, respectively, get into the house, and then cut them off to Top 12 within first two concerts.\n\n==Concert summaries==\n\n===Week 1 - My Style===\n''Original Airdate: July 4, 2009\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is broadcast on SkyVivo, a channel of the Italian subscription television [[SKY Italia|Sky TV]]. It began airing in September 2008.\n\nThe host is once again the Russian former model and actress Natasha Stefanenko. Other permanent judges are Micheal Giannini, art director and talent scout of model agency d\u2019Management, former top model, [[Gianni Versace]]'s and [[Giorgio Armani]]'s muse [[Nad\u00e8ge du Bospertus]] and fashion journalist Giusi Ferr\u00e9. Recurring judges are photographer Ciro Zizzo and photographer Settimio Benedusi.\n\n[[Michela Maggioni]] was the winner of this season thus receiving a one-year-contract with d\u2019Management Group as well as a Max Factor campaign worth \u20ac150,000.\n\n==Episode summaries==\n\n===Episode 1===\n''First aired September 23, 2008''\n\nAfter months of castings throughout Italy, the 30 pre-selected semi-finalists arrive in Milan. They are welcomed by Natasha Stefanenko, the host, and Michael Giannini, art director of d'Management, in a modern luxury hotel where the final castings will take place.\n\nSoon the girls start their individual evaluations in front of the judging panel made up of Natasha, Michael, former top model Nad\u00e8ge, model scouts Danilo Di Pasquale and Anna Peggion. Interesting and determined contestants show up at panel, such as Claudia B., coming from a small village in [[Sardinia]], Claudia C., a karate expert, Diletta, the soccer player, Beatrice, with an ethereal modelesque look, Claudia M., with a wonderful body and a bubbly personality, Giorgia, who shows great self-confidence despite her body flaws and Amy, the Ivorian woman with a hard past reflected in her eyes. Unfortunately, only 20 will continue to the final choice, and the girls are asked to show their walks and potential.\n\nLater on, Natasha reveals the 20 aspiring contestants that have passed the selection and some tears are shed by the eliminated ones. But there is no time for rest for the others, since they must face a photoshoot to show their facial intensity to the judging panel.\n\nAfter the judges' deliberation Natasha welcomes the girls at the final cast selection. Once chosen, the selected contestants show happiness and joy, but, while leaving the hotel, some of the rejected girls express rude remarks about some picked ones or by saying the judges will regret not casting them.\n\n===Episode 2===\n''First aired September 30, 2008''\n\nThe 14 finalists are sent to the exclusive sea resort of [[Santa Margherita Ligure]] to be immediately tested by facing their first photoshoot with famous photographer Settimio Benedusi who also worked for [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|Sports Illustrated]]. The contestants must pose on rocks with aggressive but modelesque attitude in front of the [[Ligurian sea]] while wearing bikinis. Some need to be coached, others perform naturally.\n\nLater the excited girls enter their Milan home, but Natasha's letter inform them they will be judged the following day.\n\nAt their first judging Amy and Michela are highly praised for their effortless performance, Beatrice is noted for her high fashion features, whereas Claudia B. disappoints the judges with her unacceptable shot and Noemi produces a vulgar photo. Giorgia and Giulia are told to work on their bodies.\n\nNoemi and Claudia B. land in the bottom two for being uncomfortable at the photoshoot and Claudia B. is sent home for losing her determination in front of the camera and having a bad body posture.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Claudia B. & Noemi Del Falco\n*'''Eliminated:''' Claudia B.\n*'''Guest judges:''' Settimio Benedusi, fashion photographer & Danilo Di Pasquale, model scout\n\n===Episode 3===\n''First aired October 7, 2008''\n\nIn this episode, the girls are announced to get ready for their makeovers, so they reach the Charme&Cheveux salon to find out what they will be. Beatrice sheds a few tears when told to be dyed from blonde to red but she is surprisingly satisfied with the outcome. Michela and Martina get more radical changes as their hair is chopped off but appreciate the result. Almost all the girls are pleasantly happy with the changes with the exception of Claudia C. who does not allow the hairstylist to cut a fringe since for her that haircut is not easy to manage.\n\nThe next day the contestants are taken to their first runway challenge where they must walk wearing Love Moschino outfits showing a happy mood. Noemi redeems herself with an effortless performance, Giada demonstrates a huge improvement from her first walk, Martina does not impress, Beatrice is liked by Rossella Jardini, the creative head of Moschino, and Claudia M. has troubles with her shoes too small for her size.\n\nIn the judging room, Nadege is appalled and disappointed with most of the girls, Giorgia is critiqued for walking with a sad mood, Claudia M. is warned to have done a step backwards by being too maneater when walking and judge Nad\u00e8ge comments about her excuses, she also says Giulia's performance had horrified her. The judges ask Diletta for more of her presence and deeply scold Claudia C. for her poor performance and bad attitude at the makeovers. Mary is found again to be walking like a soldier despite an entire week of training in runway walking.\n\nFinally Claudia C. and Mary are placed in the bottom two for their dreadful performances but Mary is sent home as her look is considered too commercial and her walk is deemed the worst.\n \n*'''Bottom two:''' Claudia Cuomo & Mary\n*'''Eliminated:''' Mary\n*'''Guest designer:''' Rossella Jardini, creative head of Moschino\n\n===Episode 4===\n''First aired October 14, 2008''\n\nThe twelve remaining girls experience the first problems of cohabitation as Martina argues with Michela over cereals while Diletta is annoyed by Michela's lack of interest in other people's needs. A group made up of Giorgia, Elena, Diletta, Noemi and Martina does not seem to get along well with Michela's personality. Natasha is deeply disappointed with this childish attitude and reminds the girls they are there to compete and show an adult behavior.\n\nThis week the contestants take part in their first reward challenge. Judge Giusi Ferr\u00e9, fashion journalist, gives them a brief lesson on the history of fashion in the 20th century and asks the girls to recreate a vintage look using vintage dresses and clothes from Franco Jacassi's collection. Amy is declared the winner for her elegant look and is awarded with an [[Emilio Pucci]] vintage dress.\n\nThen the girls are announced their third elimination challenge. They will pose in two groups for a photoshoot that will be their first printed advertisement where they will be wearing only a pair of Indian Rose jeans and nothing else. Some of them, such as Giorgia and Claudia C., work very well in group while others, like Diletta, need to be coached more.\n\nAt panel Nadege is still not convinced by many girls' performances and states that Beatrice is not the kind of model for jeans. Amy is praised for her never boring look, Noemi is found again uncomfortable in front of the camera and Diletta, although showing improvement in the facial expression, is deemed a broken doll about her body position and reprimanded for not listening to the photographer. Giulia is complimented for her eyes' intensity and for working with her body. Elena is found too plain and Martina's face is noticed for her look, despite Nadege's disapproval.\n\nDiletta and Noemi find themselves in the bottom two and Noemi is sent packing for her mature look and inability in the photoshoots that placed her at the bottom of the pack twice in three weeks.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Diletta & Noemi Del Falco\n*'''Eliminated:''' Noemi Del Falco\n*'''Special Guest:''' Franco Jacassi, fashion collection owner\n\n===Episode 5===\n''First aired October 21, 2008''\n\nAfter being told to get ready for this week's reward challenge, the eleven remaining girls meet Rajan Tolomei, make-up artist of Max Factor. He teaches the girls a basic lesson on how to create a natural and fresh make-up useful for castings. Then the contestants are asked to recreate the make-up of a Japanese [[geisha]] on their faces using photos of geishas. Giorgia, Giulia and Elena do extremely well but is Giorgia who wins the challenge and she shares the prize with Elena. The reward is a phone call to a loved person.\n\nThis week the girls will be evaluated on a runway challenge where the contestants must walk wearing the elegant lingerie designed by Madame Chantal Thomass. The designer herself prepares and coaches the girls for the runway where they will interpret the sexy and sophisticated lingerie without being vulgar. At the end Chantal Thomass is quite satisfied with some girls' walks and interpretation.\n\nIn the judging session Claudia M., Elena and Giada shine because of their improvements on the runway, Giulia is highly praised for being self-confident despite her curvy thighs. Diletta is found bored and scared while walking but Michael and Nadege defend her for delivering a good walk wearing open shoes with pantyhose that can get slippery. Michela is reprimanded for showing lack of confidence by making grimaces at the end of the runway, Amy is scolded for losing composure and producing an unacceptable performance and so is Claudia C. for her lack of expression.\n\nClaudia C. and Amy land in the bottom two because of their second lackluster performance on the runway and Claudia C. is sent home for always having only an aggressive mood on the runway despite her high fashion look.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Claudia Cuomo & Amy\n*'''Eliminated:''' Claudia Cuomo\n*'''Guest designer:''' Madame Chantal Thomass, lingerie designer\n*'''Guest judge:''' Rajan Tolomei, make-up artist of Max Factor\n\n===Episode 6===\n''First aired October 28, 2008''\n\nThis week the ten aspiring models get a visit from Stefano Fadda, a coolhunter. He explains that, for this week's reward challenge, they must improvise themselves as photographers to do coolhunting in the centre of [[Milan]], taking pictures of people who may anticipate certain fashion trends. Martina is exempt from the challenge, having injured her foot by slipping on the staircase when walking with wet feet. So the nine girls are split into groups of three and sent downtown to take snapshots. Diletta, Elena and Giorgia are declared winners and can spend an evening out in one of Milan's coolest lounge bars.\n\nFor this week's elimination the girls participate in a beauty photo shoot with Ciro Zizzo, and they must pose without make-up to show their true potential. Beatrice, Martina and Michela shine according to the photographer, while Diletta, Elena, Giorgia and Giulia struggle and need to be coached.\n\nIn the judging room the contestants' photos are shown with and without digital retouching to determine who has a fresh face and who has not. Claudia M. cries when critiqued, Giulia disappoints the panel because of a banal shot and so does Diletta for resting on pretty, Elena is deemed too normal by the photographer. Martina and Amy are praised for their photos and Giorgia surprises the judges with the best shot despite her struggle with the camera.\n\nDiletta and Giulia are paired in the bottom two for not translating their beauty into their pictures and for the amount of coaching needed. Although declared one of the most beautiful girls, Diletta is eliminated for not progressing in the competition because of her weakness and for requiring too much retouching on her photo.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Diletta & Giulia Galizia\n*'''Eliminated:''' Diletta\n*'''Special guest:''' Stefano Fadda, cool-hunter\n\n===Episode 7===\n''First aired November 4, 2008''\n\nThe nine remaining girls face their fourth reward challenge when Susanna Ausoni, stylist and look maker, pays them a visit to teach the contestant how to accessorize a dress properly. Then the aspiring models wear a simple black sheath and are put through a test to evaluate who has learnt the most by accessorizing this simple dress. After single critiques are given, Claudia M. is declared winner of the challenge and is awarded with a shopping trip to a shoe store where she picks a pair of Les Tropezi\u00e9nnes shoes.\n\nThe competition gets tougher and tougher for the contestants as they leave [[Milan]] for [[Genoa]], where they will take part in this week's complicated editorial photo shoot. The girls arrive at the monumental cemetery of Staglieno and meet [[Nicola Majocchi]] who will be their photographer for this unusual photo shoot. The contestants must impersonate women in mourning while wearing high fashion dresses with a monumental and macabre grave in the background. Elena, Giorgia and Michela show great interpretive skills, but for Amy, Beatrice, and Claudia M. the task seems to be much harder.\n\nBack in Milan, at panel, the judges scold Amy for the sleepy look on her photo and Martina receives warnings to be more present when doing the photoshoots. Judge Nadege is deeply disappointed with Giulia's weight gain and strongly reprimands her for not taking care of her body thus showing a deplorable lack of involvement in the competition. Elena, Giada, Giorgia and Michela shine in their photos according to the panel, while Claudia's performance proves that the photo shoot was too much of an obstacle for her.\n\nMartina and Claudia M. land in the bottom two for their disappointing performances both on set and on picture. After Martina is warned to overcome her limits quickly to be noticed by the panel, Claudia M. is sent home for not impressing the judges enough with her poor results on set and for her lack of expression in the last photo shoots.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Martina & Claudia Manzella\n*'''Eliminated:''' Claudia Manzella\n*'''Guest judge:''' Nicola Majocchi, fashion photographer\n*'''Special guest:''' Susanna Ausoni, stylist and look maker\n\n===Episode 8===\n''First aired November 11, 2008''\n\nFor this week's reward challenge the eight remaining girls face a photo shoot where they must pose in motion while playing tennis. After the contestants get coached in the basic movements, their photographer Ciro Zizzo asks them to express elegance and flexibility even under physical effort. The winner of the challenge is Michela who can get a visit from her mother.\n\nFor their weekly elimination challenge the aspiring models are taken at the beautiful neoclassical scenery of Villa Olmo in [[Como]], there they will take part in their first public runway show that evening. They must walk on a runway submerged by ten centimeters of water. The task consists of walking and showing the gowns by being natural despite the difficulty of walking on water. All the girls are scared for this twist but some of them manage to deliver good walks.\n\nIn the judging room Giorgia is praised for being more natural compared to her first weeks, Martina is noticed for her improvements, Beatrice gets unanimous praise for her pleasant performance. Michael is extremely disappointed in Elena's failure on this runway and Natasha reprimands her by stating that excuses will not get her anywhere. Nadege scolds Giulia for her heavy walk and for not having the spirit of sacrifice required in a model since she has gained weight the previous weeks, but Michael defends her performance. Then Nad\u00e8ge tells Michela that her performance was overdone. Giada is told to show more confidence as her walk did not impress the panel as the previous ones.\n\nIn the end Elena and Giulia land in the bottom two and Giulia gets eliminated for her weight gain that hampered her performance and for lacking the determination and abnegation she declared to have.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Elena Ripamonti & Giulia Galizia\n*'''Eliminated:''' Giulia Galizia\n*'''Guest judge:''' [[Costantino Della Gherardesca]], fashion expert\n*'''Special guest:''' Stefano Lacarbonara, tennis instructor\n\n===Episode 9===\n''First aired November 18, 2008''\n\nPreviously, during this week, the seven remaining contestants received second makeovers to refresh their looks and, despite some initial preoccupation, all were satisfied with the final outcomes.\n\nThe girls are announced that for their weekly reward challenge they will be treated like stars. Soon after they are taken to a television studios centre where they meet Cristina Parodi, journalist and fashion expert, who explains that they will be prepared with elegant dresses and make-up to face a fake red carpet event, where they will be evaluated on their presence. The girls must impersonate actresses at their movie premiere and, after posing for the photographers, they are briefly interviewed by Cristina. For handling the questions with a natural attitude Elena is chosen as the winner and decides to share the reward with Giorgia. They will be spending time with Cristina in a luxury Japanese restaurant.\n\nThen the aspiring models are told to get ready for their elimination challenge. The girls will act as sexy women in a TV commercial with the model and actor Sergio Muniz, who is very popular in Italy. They are excited to work with a man and must interpret different types of young women trying to seduce him as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"1\"| Contestant\n! colspan=\"1\"| Type of Woman\n|-\n| Amy \n| Lady Eating a Cherry\n|-\n| Beatrice\n| Androgynous Woman\n|-\n| Elena\n| Flamenco Dancer\n|-\n| Giada\n| Sexy Mechanic\n|-\n| Giorgia\n| Sexy Teacher\n|-\n| Martina\n| Baby Lolita\n|-\n| Michela\n| Fetish Mistress\n|-\n|}\n\nThe contestants are asked to pose with sensuality as tempting ladies behind an opening door while the male model walks through a corridor to reach the only woman of his life, his mother, since the commercial celebrates Mother's Day. Some of the girls shine, others, such as Amy and Martina, are found too stiff.\n\nIn the judging room all the judges are wowed by Giorgia's constant improvements, Giada impresses the panel with her seductive performance although judge Giusi Ferr\u00e9 finds her a bit ordinary. Michela get praises for adapting to her role. Amy totally disappoints the judges with her sleepy eyes and mechanical movements and Martina is strongly scolded for not being sexy as required.\n\nAmy and Martina are paired in the bottom two for their lackluster performances on set and Amy is sent packing for not being consistent in her improvements and for losing the determination Martina is considered to keep.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Amy & Martina\n*'''Eliminated:''' Amy\n*'''Guest judges:''' Sergio Muniz, model and actor & Danilo Di Pasquale, model scout\n*'''Special guests:''' Cristina Parodi, journalist and fashion expert & Umberto Spinazzola, director\n\n===Episode 10===\n''First aired November 25, 2008''\n\nThe six aspiring models receive a visit from Barbara Ronchi Della Rocca, one of the major experts of etiquette, who will teach them how to behave appropriately when attending a social event that may occur in the public life of a model. For this reward challenge the girls are taught the basis of bon-ton when at the table and soon after they wear elegant dresses to attend a mock aristocratic dinner to show what they have learned. After some laughs are shared for some difficult situations, Martina is declared the winner for quickly learning and showing good manners. She decides to share the prize with Beatrice who was eager of a win. The two girls can telephone to their families and tears are shed during their calls after spending two months with no contacts.\n\nFor this week's elimination challenge the contestants are brought to Frankie Morello's atelier where they meet Maurizio Modica and Pierfrancesco Gigliotti, founders and designers of this fashion house. The girls will show their runway skills wearing eccentric complex outfits. After being coached by the stylists about their dresses they get prepared for the task. Many of the aspiring models are confident and after the performance each one is satisfied.\n\nIn the judging room this week the judges have contrasting opinions. Martina is praised for her confident walk but is told to avoid her stiff facial expressions, Elena is complimented for delivering a good walk while wearing the most difficult outfit, although she still has to learn how to use her face. Michela is highly praised for her improvements, but Natasha scolds her for wasting the pose at the end of the runway and Nadege says she was lucky with a dress fitting her happy personality, however Michael notices her impressive pose and glance before her exit. Giorgia is reprimanded for looking bored and forgettable when walking and so is Giada for delivering a stiff performance with a bad pose. Beatrice's walk and mood are praised by Michael and the designers but not appreciated by judges Nad\u00e8ge and Giusi since they find it always the same.\n\nAfter deliberation Giada and Giorgia are placed in the bottom two for their lack of improvement on runway and, although the judges recognise Giada's potential they decide to eliminate her for not overcoming her fears and letting them hamper her walk and presence on the runway.\n \n*'''Bottom two:''' Giada Folcia & Giorgia\n*'''Eliminated:''' Giada Folcia\n*'''Guest judges:''' Maurizio Modica & Pierfrancesco Gigliotti, founders and fashion designers of Frankie Morello\n*'''Special guests:''' Barbara Ronchi Della Rocca, etiquette expert & Renzo Martini, actor\n\n===Episode 11===\n''First aired December 2, 2008''\n\nThe five remaining contestants get letters from their parents and some tears are shed after two months without contacts with their families. The next day the girls are announced that, for their weekly reward challenge, they will take part in a casting for Mariella Burani, noted Italian fashion designer. Casting director Francesca Mezzali evaluates the girls: Giorgia has too big hips for her standards, Elena must walk with more determination, Beatrice is noticed for her good walk and right look, Michela fails to impress because of her playful attitude and gets reprimanded for not taking the casting seriously and Martina is deemed too shy by the way she walks and presents herself. Some of them are ordered to be faster when getting dressed. Beatrice wins the challenge and can spend the entire afternoon out shopping, in addition she wins an expensive Mariella Burani's purse.\n\nThis week's photoshoot will take place in [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], located in the very centre of [[Milan]]. There the contestants will be photographed by the renowned photographer Settimio Benedusi while suspended in the air, floating with peacock-inspired long dresses. After a demonstration from Natasha they get coached about the movements. Each aspiring model is asked to express dynamism and lightness at the same time. Elena shines after overcoming her fear of heights while Michela loses her focus.\n\nAt panel Beatrice is critiqued for her legs' and arms' stiffness and is reprimanded for not giving enough, despite producing an overall acceptable photo. Martina is praised by the photographer for taking directions well and expressing the requested emotion although Nad\u00e8ge does not like the result. Giorgia is deemed too heavy in her shot for not being able to balance her body thus looking lifeless to the judges. Elena is highly praised for working with her body and assuming a positive attitude on set, taking directions and giving various poses to the photographer like a professional model. With her performance Michela upsets Natasha, Michael and Nadege who heavily scold her for being unprofessional on set, playing rather than focusing, thus making a step backwards.\n\nMichela and Giorgia land in the bottom two and Michela is saved for effortless producing a good shot but is warned to grow up. Giorgia is eliminated for reaching her limit in the competition despite her previous constant improvements.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Michela Maggioni & Giorgia\n*'''Eliminated:''' Giorgia\n*'''Guest judges:''' Settimio Benedusi, fashion photographer & Marta Citacov, fashion journalist\n*'''Special guest:''' Francesca Mazzali, casting director of fashion designer Mariella Burani\n\n===Episode 12===\n''First aired December 9, 2008''\n\nThe four remaining contestants leave [[Milan]] for [[Capri]], one of Italy's most fashionable islands and a sea resort noted for inspiring such designers as Coco Chanel. After visiting the town and discovering the local fashion the girls face their last reward challenge: they will pose in pairs as mannequins in the windows of the local [[Valentino Garavani|Valentino]] boutique, wearing the designer's elegant dresses. For totally embodying the spirit of a living mannequin Beatrice is declared the winner and can get a pair of Sandali Capresi, the typical shoes of Capri.\n\nLater the girls take part in this week's photo shoot: they pose as sensual and sophisticated ladies on their yacht with Capri's reefs in the background. The task requires them to balance their bodies on wedge-heeled shoes while standing and showing their '80s-inspired outfits. All the girls manage to focus and deliver a good performance.\n\nBack in [[Milan]], in the judging room, Elena gets universal praises for her body pose, facial expression and effort to make the most of her outfit, although Nadege reminds her she lucked into her pose. Beatrice is praised by Michael and Nadege for her photo and her modern icy beauty, while the photographer Settimio Benedusi points out her stiffness during the shooting. Michela is highly appreciated by Natasha and all the panel for her results and professionalism after her unprofessional behavior on the previous set. Martina is noticed for showing more femininity with her intense look and facial expression, although Nadege still finds her body too masculine.\n\nAfter a difficult deliberation Beatrice and Martina are left in the bottom two and Beatrice is spared for her constant results and high fashion look. Martina is eliminated because, although delivering her best performance, the judges think her determination can not make up for being still less impressive than the other finalists.\n \n*'''Bottom two:''' Beatrice Coos & Martina\n*'''Eliminated:''' Martina\n*'''Guest judge:''' Settimio Benedusi, fashion photographer\n\n===Episode 13===\n''First aired December 16, 2008''\n\nThe three finalists face their next to last challenge posing for a Marie Claire-cover inspired photoshoot. All of them perform well showing self-confidence and professionalism. Elena is satisfied with this challenge since for her is a revenge after her bland beauty shot. Beatrice and Michela are determined to stay in the competition.\n\nAt judging the girls get universal praises for their results and achievements in the competition. Antonella Antonelli, editor of Italian Marie Claire magazine, tells Michela that her shot could be an actual cover and appreciates her modern face. Elena is noticed for using her beauty to her advantage thus producing a captivating shot and getting praised for not being a useless beauty anymore. Beatrice is praised for her elegance though her important dress on the photo may distract from her face.\n\nFollowing a difficult deliberation the three contestants are all called in front of Natasha and commended for getting this far. Michela is called first and Elena is saved soon after, so Beatrice brokes into tears after her elimination and is comforted by Natasha before leaving.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Beatrice Coos & Elena Ripamonti\n*'''Eliminated:''' Beatrice Coos\n*'''Guest judges:''' Paolo Candian, fashion photographer & Rajan Tolomei, make-up artist of Max Factor\n\nThen the two finalists are driven to Verona, at the main atelier of Byblos, an important Italian fashion house. There Elena and Michela will face their last challenge: a runway show with professional models where they are asked to show three different outfits each, walking with self-confidence, elegance and strength. Both the girls do their best and are happy to be in the final runway after overcoming the hostility they had at the beginning of the competition.\n\nIn their last judging session Natasha and Michael show their pride for the girls' achievements. Elena is commended for delivering a truly confident walk with a captivating and determined glance and the judges are amazed at her improvements that transformed her from beautiful girl into a model. Although judge Rajan states that her beauty gives her a more commercial appeal she is praised for being able to change in the competition. Then Michela is commended by Nadege for her effortless talent on set and her performance on the final runway, and, although Michael reminds her of a flaw in her second exit, she has convinced the judges of being capable to perform as a professional model.\n\nAfter a really tough deliberation the two remaining contestants are called back in the judging room and Natasha reveals that Michela is the new Italia's Next Top Model thanks to her natural posing talent and her new improved model attitude and walk.\n\n*'''Final two:''' Elena Ripamonti e Michela Maggioni\n*'''Runner-up:''' Elena Ripamonti\n*'''Italia's Next Top Model:''' '''[[Michela Maggioni]]'''\n*'''Special guest:''' Manuel Facchini, designer and creative head of Byblos\n*'''Guest judge:''' Rajan Tolomei, make-up artist of Max Factor\n\n==Contestants==\n(''ages stated are at start of contest'')\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;

They are welcomed by Natasha Stefanenko, the host, and Michael Giannini, art director of d'Management, in a modern luxury hotel where the final castings will take place.\n\nSoon the girls start their individual evaluations in front of the judging panel made up of Natasha, Michael, former top model Nad\u00e8ge, model scouts Danilo Di Pasquale and Anna Peggion.

Unfortunately, only 20 will continue to the final choice, and the girls are asked to show their walks and potential.\n\nLater on, Natasha reveals the 20 aspiring contestants that have passed the selection and some tears are shed by the eliminated ones. But there is no time for rest for the others, since they must face a photoshoot to show their facial intensity to the judging panel.\n\nAfter the judges' deliberation Natasha welcomes the girls at the final cast selection. Once chosen, the selected contestants show happiness and joy, but, while leaving the hotel, some of the rejected girls express rude remarks about some picked ones or by saying the judges will regret not casting them.\n\n===Episode 2===\n''First aired September 30, 2008\n\nThe 14 finalists are sent to the exclusive sea resort of [[Santa Margherita Ligure]] to be immediately tested by facing their first photoshoot with famous photographer Settimio Benedusi who also worked for [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|Sports Illustrated]]. The contestants must pose on rocks with aggressive but modelesque attitude in front of the [[Ligurian sea]] while wearing bikinis. Some need to be coached, others perform naturally.\n\nLater the excited girls enter their Milan home, but Natasha's letter inform them they will be judged the following day.\n\nAt their first judging Amy and Michela are highly praised for their effortless performance, Beatrice is noted for her high fashion features, whereas Claudia B. disappoints the judges with her unacceptable shot and Noemi produces a vulgar photo. Giorgia and Giulia are told to work on their bodies.\n\nNoemi and Claudia B. land in the bottom two for being uncomfortable at the photoshoot and Claudia B. is sent home for losing her determination in front of the camera and having a bad body posture.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Claudia B. & Noemi Del Falco\n*'''Eliminated:''' Claudia B.\n*'''Guest judges:''' Settimio Benedusi, fashion photographer & Danilo Di Pasquale, model scout\n\n===Episode 3===\n''First aired October 7, 2008\n\nIn this episode, the girls are announced to get ready for their makeovers, so they reach the Charme&Cheveux salon to find out what they will be. Beatrice sheds a few tears when told to be dyed from blonde to red but she is surprisingly satisfied with the outcome. Michela and Martina get more radical changes as their hair is chopped off but appreciate the result. Almost all the girls are pleasantly happy with the changes with the exception of Claudia C. who does not allow the hairstylist to cut a fringe since for her that haircut is not easy to manage.\n\nThe next day the contestants are taken to their first runway challenge where they must walk wearing Love Moschino outfits showing a happy mood. Noemi redeems herself with an effortless performance, Giada demonstrates a huge improvement from her first walk, Martina does not impress, Beatrice is liked by Rossella Jardini, the creative head of Moschino, and Claudia M. has troubles with her shoes too small for her size.\n\nIn the judging room, Nadege is appalled and disappointed with most of the girls, Giorgia is critiqued for walking with a sad mood, Claudia M. is warned to have done a step backwards by being too maneater when walking and judge Nad\u00e8ge comments about her excuses, she also says Giulia's performance had horrified her. The judges ask Diletta for more of her presence and deeply scold Claudia C. for her poor performance and bad attitude at the makeovers. Mary is found again to be walking like a soldier despite an entire week of training in runway walking.\n\nFinally Claudia C. and Mary are placed in the bottom two for their dreadful performances but Mary is sent home as her look is considered too commercial and her walk is deemed the worst.\n \n*'''Bottom two:''' Claudia Cuomo & Mary\n*'''Eliminated:''' Mary\n*'''Guest designer:''' Rossella Jardini, creative head of Moschino\n\n===Episode 4===\n''First aired October 14, 2008\n\nThe twelve remaining girls experience the first problems of cohabitation as Martina argues with Michela over cereals while Diletta is annoyed by Michela's lack of interest in other people's needs. A group made up of Giorgia, Elena, Diletta, Noemi and Martina does not seem to get along well with Michela's personality. Natasha is deeply disappointed with this childish attitude and reminds the girls they are there to compete and show an adult behavior.\n\nThis week the contestants take part in their first reward challenge. Judge Giusi Ferr\u00e9, fashion journalist, gives them a brief lesson on the history of fashion in the 20th century and asks the girls to recreate a vintage look using vintage dresses and clothes from Franco Jacassi's collection. Amy is declared the winner for her elegant look and is awarded with an [[Emilio Pucci]] vintage dress.\n\nThen the girls are announced their third elimination challenge. They will pose in two groups for a photoshoot that will be their first printed advertisement where they will be wearing only a pair of Indian Rose jeans and nothing else. Some of them, such as Giorgia and Claudia C., work very well in group while others, like Diletta, need to be coached more.\n\nAt panel Nadege is still not convinced by many girls' performances and states that Beatrice is not the kind of model for jeans. Amy is praised for her never boring look, Noemi is found again uncomfortable in front of the camera and Diletta, although showing improvement in the facial expression, is deemed a broken doll about her body position and reprimanded for not listening to the photographer. Giulia is complimented for her eyes' intensity and for working with her body. Elena is found too plain and Martina's face is noticed for her look, despite Nadege's disapproval.\n\nDiletta and Noemi find themselves in the bottom two and Noemi is sent packing for her mature look and inability in the photoshoots that placed her at the bottom of the pack twice in three weeks.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Diletta & Noemi Del Falco\n*'''Eliminated:''' Noemi Del Falco\n*'''Special Guest:''' Franco Jacassi, fashion collection owner\n\n===Episode 5===\n''First aired October 21, 2008\n\nAfter being told to get ready for this week's reward challenge, the eleven remaining girls meet Rajan Tolomei, make-up artist of Max Factor. He teaches the girls a basic lesson on how to create a natural and fresh make-up useful for castings. Then the contestants are asked to recreate the make-up of a Japanese [[geisha]] on their faces using photos of geishas. Giorgia, Giulia and Elena do extremely well but is Giorgia who wins the challenge and she shares the prize with Elena. The reward is a phone call to a loved person.\n\nThis week the girls will be evaluated on a runway challenge where the contestants must walk wearing the elegant lingerie designed by Madame Chantal Thomass. The designer herself prepares and coaches the girls for the runway where they will interpret the sexy and sophisticated lingerie without being vulgar. At the end Chantal Thomass is quite satisfied with some girls' walks and interpretation.\n\nIn the judging session Claudia M., Elena and Giada shine because of their improvements on the runway, Giulia is highly praised for being self-confident despite her curvy thighs. Diletta is found bored and scared while walking but Michael and Nadege defend her for delivering a good walk wearing open shoes with pantyhose that can get slippery. Michela is reprimanded for showing lack of confidence by making grimaces at the end of the runway, Amy is scolded for losing composure and producing an unacceptable performance and so is Claudia C. for her lack of expression.\n\nClaudia C. and Amy land in the bottom two because of their second lackluster performance on the runway and Claudia C. is sent home for always having only an aggressive mood on the runway despite her high fashion look.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Claudia Cuomo & Amy\n*'''Eliminated:''' Claudia Cuomo\n*'''Guest designer:''' Madame Chantal Thomass, lingerie designer\n*'''Guest judge:''' Rajan Tolomei, make-up artist of Max Factor\n\n===Episode 6===\n''First aired October 28, 2008\n\nThis week the ten aspiring models get a visit from Stefano Fadda, a coolhunter. He explains that, for this week's reward challenge, they must improvise themselves as photographers to do coolhunting in the centre of [[Milan]], taking pictures of people who may anticipate certain fashion trends. Martina is exempt from the challenge, having injured her foot by slipping on the staircase when walking with wet feet. So the nine girls are split into groups of three and sent downtown to take snapshots. Diletta, Elena and Giorgia are declared winners and can spend an evening out in one of Milan's coolest lounge bars.\n\nFor this week's elimination the girls participate in a beauty photo shoot with Ciro Zizzo, and they must pose without make-up to show their true potential. Beatrice, Martina and Michela shine according to the photographer, while Diletta, Elena, Giorgia and Giulia struggle and need to be coached.\n\nIn the judging room the contestants' photos are shown with and without digital retouching to determine who has a fresh face and who has not. Claudia M. cries when critiqued, Giulia disappoints the panel because of a banal shot and so does Diletta for resting on pretty, Elena is deemed too normal by the photographer. Martina and Amy are praised for their photos and Giorgia surprises the judges with the best shot despite her struggle with the camera.\n\nDiletta and Giulia are paired in the bottom two for not translating their beauty into their pictures and for the amount of coaching needed. Although declared one of the most beautiful girls, Diletta is eliminated for not progressing in the competition because of her weakness and for requiring too much retouching on her photo.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Diletta & Giulia Galizia\n*'''Eliminated:''' Diletta\n*'''Special guest:''' Stefano Fadda, cool-hunter\n\n===Episode 7===\n''First aired November 4, 2008\n\nThe nine remaining girls face their fourth reward challenge when Susanna Ausoni, stylist and look maker, pays them a visit to teach the contestant how to accessorize a dress properly. Then the aspiring models wear a simple black sheath and are put through a test to evaluate who has learnt the most by accessorizing this simple dress. After single critiques are given, Claudia M. is declared winner of the challenge and is awarded with a shopping trip to a shoe store where she picks a pair of Les Tropezi\u00e9nnes shoes.\n\nThe competition gets tougher and tougher for the contestants as they leave [[Milan]] for [[Genoa]], where they will take part in this week's complicated editorial photo shoot. The girls arrive at the monumental cemetery of Staglieno and meet [[Nicola Majocchi]] who will be their photographer for this unusual photo shoot. The contestants must impersonate women in mourning while wearing high fashion dresses with a monumental and macabre grave in the background. Elena, Giorgia and Michela show great interpretive skills, but for Amy, Beatrice, and Claudia M. the task seems to be much harder.\n\nBack in Milan, at panel, the judges scold Amy for the sleepy look on her photo and Martina receives warnings to be more present when doing the photoshoots. Judge Nadege is deeply disappointed with Giulia's weight gain and strongly reprimands her for not taking care of her body thus showing a deplorable lack of involvement in the competition. Elena, Giada, Giorgia and Michela shine in their photos according to the panel, while Claudia's performance proves that the photo shoot was too much of an obstacle for her.\n\nMartina and Claudia M. land in the bottom two for their disappointing performances both on set and on picture. After Martina is warned to overcome her limits quickly to be noticed by the panel, Claudia M. is sent home for not impressing the judges enough with her poor results on set and for her lack of expression in the last photo shoots.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Martina & Claudia Manzella\n*'''Eliminated:''' Claudia Manzella\n*'''Guest judge:''' Nicola Majocchi, fashion photographer\n*'''Special guest:''' Susanna Ausoni, stylist and look maker\n\n===Episode 8===\n''First aired November 11, 2008\n\nFor this week's reward challenge the eight remaining girls face a photo shoot where they must pose in motion while playing tennis. After the contestants get coached in the basic movements, their photographer Ciro Zizzo asks them to express elegance and flexibility even under physical effort. The winner of the challenge is Michela who can get a visit from her mother.\n\nFor their weekly elimination challenge the aspiring models are taken at the beautiful neoclassical scenery of Villa Olmo in [[Como]], there they will take part in their first public runway show that evening. They must walk on a runway submerged by ten centimeters of water. The task consists of walking and showing the gowns by being natural despite the difficulty of walking on water. All the girls are scared for this twist but some of them manage to deliver good walks.\n\nIn the judging room Giorgia is praised for being more natural compared to her first weeks, Martina is noticed for her improvements, Beatrice gets unanimous praise for her pleasant performance. Michael is extremely disappointed in Elena's failure on this runway and Natasha reprimands her by stating that excuses will not get her anywhere. Nadege scolds Giulia for her heavy walk and for not having the spirit of sacrifice required in a model since she has gained weight the previous weeks, but Michael defends her performance. Then Nad\u00e8ge tells Michela that her performance was overdone. Giada is told to show more confidence as her walk did not impress the panel as the previous ones.\n\nIn the end Elena and Giulia land in the bottom two and Giulia gets eliminated for her weight gain that hampered her performance and for lacking the determination and abnegation she declared to have.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Elena Ripamonti & Giulia Galizia\n*'''Eliminated:''' Giulia Galizia\n*'''Guest judge:''' [[Costantino Della Gherardesca]], fashion expert\n*'''Special guest:''' Stefano Lacarbonara, tennis instructor\n\n===Episode 9===\n''First aired November 18, 2008\n\nPreviously, during this week, the seven remaining contestants received second makeovers to refresh their looks and, despite some initial preoccupation, all were satisfied with the final outcomes.\n\nThe girls are announced that for their weekly reward challenge they will be treated like stars. Soon after they are taken to a television studios centre where they meet Cristina Parodi, journalist and fashion expert, who explains that they will be prepared with elegant dresses and make-up to face a fake red carpet event, where they will be evaluated on their presence. The girls must impersonate actresses at their movie premiere and, after posing for the photographers, they are briefly interviewed by Cristina. For handling the questions with a natural attitude Elena is chosen as the winner and decides to share the reward with Giorgia. They will be spending time with Cristina in a luxury Japanese restaurant.\n\nThen the aspiring models are told to get ready for their elimination challenge. The girls will act as sexy women in a TV commercial with the model and actor Sergio Muniz, who is very popular in Italy. They are excited to work with a man and must interpret different types of young women trying to seduce him as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"1\"| Contestant\n! colspan=\"1\"| Type of Woman\n|-\n| Amy \n| Lady Eating a Cherry\n|-\n| Beatrice\n| Androgynous Woman\n|-\n| Elena\n| Flamenco Dancer\n|-\n| Giada\n| Sexy Mechanic\n|-\n| Giorgia\n| Sexy Teacher\n|-\n| Martina\n| Baby Lolita\n|-\n| Michela\n| Fetish Mistress\n|-\n|}\n\nThe contestants are asked to pose with sensuality as tempting ladies behind an opening door while the male model walks through a corridor to reach the only woman of his life, his mother, since the commercial celebrates Mother's Day. Some of the girls shine, others, such as Amy and Martina, are found too stiff.\n\nIn the judging room all the judges are wowed by Giorgia's constant improvements, Giada impresses the panel with her seductive performance although judge Giusi Ferr\u00e9 finds her a bit ordinary. Michela get praises for adapting to her role. Amy totally disappoints the judges with her sleepy eyes and mechanical movements and Martina is strongly scolded for not being sexy as required.\n\nAmy and Martina are paired in the bottom two for their lackluster performances on set and Amy is sent packing for not being consistent in her improvements and for losing the determination Martina is considered to keep.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Amy & Martina\n*'''Eliminated:''' Amy\n*'''Guest judges:''' Sergio Muniz, model and actor & Danilo Di Pasquale, model scout\n*'''Special guests:''' Cristina Parodi, journalist and fashion expert & Umberto Spinazzola, director\n\n===Episode 10===\n''First aired November 25, 2008\n\nThe six aspiring models receive a visit from Barbara Ronchi Della Rocca, one of the major experts of etiquette, who will teach them how to behave appropriately when attending a social event that may occur in the public life of a model. For this reward challenge the girls are taught the basis of bon-ton when at the table and soon after they wear elegant dresses to attend a mock aristocratic dinner to show what they have learned. After some laughs are shared for some difficult situations, Martina is declared the winner for quickly learning and showing good manners. She decides to share the prize with Beatrice who was eager of a win. The two girls can telephone to their families and tears are shed during their calls after spending two months with no contacts.\n\nFor this week's elimination challenge the contestants are brought to Frankie Morello's atelier where they meet Maurizio Modica and Pierfrancesco Gigliotti, founders and designers of this fashion house. The girls will show their runway skills wearing eccentric complex outfits. After being coached by the stylists about their dresses they get prepared for the task. Many of the aspiring models are confident and after the performance each one is satisfied.\n\nIn the judging room this week the judges have contrasting opinions. Martina is praised for her confident walk but is told to avoid her stiff facial expressions, Elena is complimented for delivering a good walk while wearing the most difficult outfit, although she still has to learn how to use her face. Michela is highly praised for her improvements, but Natasha scolds her for wasting the pose at the end of the runway and Nadege says she was lucky with a dress fitting her happy personality, however Michael notices her impressive pose and glance before her exit. Giorgia is reprimanded for looking bored and forgettable when walking and so is Giada for delivering a stiff performance with a bad pose. Beatrice's walk and mood are praised by Michael and the designers but not appreciated by judges Nad\u00e8ge and Giusi since they find it always the same.\n\nAfter deliberation Giada and Giorgia are placed in the bottom two for their lack of improvement on runway and, although the judges recognise Giada's potential they decide to eliminate her for not overcoming her fears and letting them hamper her walk and presence on the runway.\n \n*'''Bottom two:''' Giada Folcia & Giorgia\n*'''Eliminated:''' Giada Folcia\n*'''Guest judges:''' Maurizio Modica & Pierfrancesco Gigliotti, founders and fashion designers of Frankie Morello\n*'''Special guests:''' Barbara Ronchi Della Rocca, etiquette expert & Renzo Martini, actor\n\n===Episode 11===\n''First aired December 2, 2008\n\nThe five remaining contestants get letters from their parents and some tears are shed after two months without contacts with their families. The next day the girls are announced that, for their weekly reward challenge, they will take part in a casting for Mariella Burani, noted Italian fashion designer. Casting director Francesca Mezzali evaluates the girls: Giorgia has too big hips for her standards, Elena must walk with more determination, Beatrice is noticed for her good walk and right look, Michela fails to impress because of her playful attitude and gets reprimanded for not taking the casting seriously and Martina is deemed too shy by the way she walks and presents herself. Some of them are ordered to be faster when getting dressed. Beatrice wins the challenge and can spend the entire afternoon out shopping, in addition she wins an expensive Mariella Burani's purse.\n\nThis week's photoshoot will take place in [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], located in the very centre of [[Milan]]. There the contestants will be photographed by the renowned photographer Settimio Benedusi while suspended in the air, floating with peacock-inspired long dresses. After a demonstration from Natasha they get coached about the movements. Each aspiring model is asked to express dynamism and lightness at the same time. Elena shines after overcoming her fear of heights while Michela loses her focus.\n\nAt panel Beatrice is critiqued for her legs' and arms' stiffness and is reprimanded for not giving enough, despite producing an overall acceptable photo. Martina is praised by the photographer for taking directions well and expressing the requested emotion although Nad\u00e8ge does not like the result. Giorgia is deemed too heavy in her shot for not being able to balance her body thus looking lifeless to the judges. Elena is highly praised for working with her body and assuming a positive attitude on set, taking directions and giving various poses to the photographer like a professional model. With her performance Michela upsets Natasha, Michael and Nadege who heavily scold her for being unprofessional on set, playing rather than focusing, thus making a step backwards.\n\nMichela and Giorgia land in the bottom two and Michela is saved for effortless producing a good shot but is warned to grow up. Giorgia is eliminated for reaching her limit in the competition despite her previous constant improvements.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Michela Maggioni & Giorgia\n*'''Eliminated:''' Giorgia\n*'''Guest judges:''' Settimio Benedusi, fashion photographer & Marta Citacov, fashion journalist\n*'''Special guest:''' Francesca Mazzali, casting director of fashion designer Mariella Burani\n\n===Episode 12===\n''First aired December 9, 2008\n\nThe four remaining contestants leave [[Milan]] for [[Capri]], one of Italy's most fashionable islands and a sea resort noted for inspiring such designers as Coco Chanel.

For totally embodying the spirit of a living mannequin Beatrice is declared the winner and can get a pair of Sandali Capresi, the typical shoes of Capri.\n\nLater the girls take part in this week's photo shoot: they pose as sensual and sophisticated ladies on their yacht with Capri's reefs in the background. The task requires them to balance their bodies on wedge-heeled shoes while standing and showing their '80s-inspired outfits. All the girls manage to focus and deliver a good performance.\n\nBack in [[Milan]], in the judging room, Elena gets universal praises for her body pose, facial expression and effort to make the most of her outfit, although Nadege reminds her she lucked into her pose. Beatrice is praised by Michael and Nadege for her photo and her modern icy beauty, while the photographer Settimio Benedusi points out her stiffness during the shooting. Michela is highly appreciated by Natasha and all the panel for her results and professionalism after her unprofessional behavior on the previous set. Martina is noticed for showing more femininity with her intense look and facial expression, although Nadege still finds her body too masculine.\n\nAfter a difficult deliberation Beatrice and Martina are left in the bottom two and Beatrice is spared for her constant results and high fashion look. Martina is eliminated because, although delivering her best performance, the judges think her determination can not make up for being still less impressive than the other finalists.\n \n*'''Bottom two:''' Beatrice Coos & Martina\n*'''Eliminated:''' Martina\n*'''Guest judge:''' Settimio Benedusi, fashion photographer\n\n===Episode 13===\n''First aired December 16, 2008\n\nThe three finalists face their next to last challenge posing for a Marie Claire-cover inspired photoshoot. All of them perform well showing self-confidence and professionalism. Elena is satisfied with this challenge since for her is a revenge after her bland beauty shot. Beatrice and Michela are determined to stay in the competition.\n\nAt judging the girls get universal praises for their results and achievements in the competition. Antonella Antonelli, editor of Italian Marie Claire magazine, tells Michela that her shot could be an actual cover and appreciates her modern face. Elena is noticed for using her beauty to her advantage thus producing a captivating shot and getting praised for not being a useless beauty anymore. Beatrice is praised for her elegance though her important dress on the photo may distract from her face.\n\nFollowing a difficult deliberation the three contestants are all called in front of Natasha and commended for getting this far. Michela is called first and Elena is saved soon after, so Beatrice brokes into tears after her elimination and is comforted by Natasha before leaving.\n\n*'''Bottom two:''' Beatrice Coos & Elena Ripamonti\n*'''Eliminated:''' Beatrice Coos\n*'''Guest judges:''' Paolo Candian, fashion photographer & Rajan Tolomei, make-up artist of Max Factor\n\nThen the two finalists are driven to Verona, at the main atelier of Byblos, an important Italian fashion house. There Elena and Michela will face their last challenge: a runway show with professional models where they are asked to show three different outfits each, walking with self-confidence, elegance and strength. Both the girls do their best and are happy to be in the final runway after overcoming the hostility they had at the beginning of the competition.\n\nIn their last judging session Natasha and Michael show their pride for the girls' achievements. Elena is commended for delivering a truly confident walk with a captivating and determined glance and the judges are amazed at her improvements that transformed her from beautiful girl into a model. Although judge Rajan states that her beauty gives her a more commercial appeal she is praised for being able to change in the competition.

This season things are different and New York has picked 5 men from the internet, [[Michelle Rothschild-Patterson|Sister Patterson]] has also picked 5 men called the \"mama's boys\". During the mixer, some suitors make a bad impression to New York and her mother. Wolf reveals that he has a big penis causing New York to laugh. At elimination, New York eliminates 5 men Sweetie Pie, Champion, Milliown, Ears, and, Doc were eliminated. 3 out of 5 men who were picked on the internet were eliminated on the first night, 1 was from the \"mama's boys\",and 1 was picked by producers.\n\n*'''Eliminated:''' Sweetie Pie, Champion, Milliown, Ears, Doc\n\n===Flowers From Fishburne===\n''First aired October 15, 2007 (3.2M viewers)''<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Multichannel News]] | title = VH1 Scores With Celebrity Reality Shows; 'The Salt-N-Pepa Show' and 'Gotti's Way'd Start Strong | first = R Thomas | last = Umstead | date = October 17, 2007 | accessdate = September 26, 2010 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/130810-VH1_Scores_With_Celebrity_Reality_Shows.php}}</ref>\n\nNow down to 15 men, New York invites the guys to a pond where they must prove their love by swimming to her and presenting her with a gift. The guys who make the best impressions will receive dates with New York. Midget Mac nearly drowned after his flotation device popped and Buddha saved him. When the guys find out that one of their housemates is \"re-gifting\", they proceed to tell NY about it. In true New York fashion, she lets the poor guy have it. Will he be one of the three to be eliminated, or will he squirm his way out of the mouth of danger? Meanwhile, a huge controversy arises when one suitor intercepts another man's flowers for NY, and presents them as his own. The only thing better than the drama is his story of where the flowers came from.\nUnsure decided to quit the competition because the jacket that he gave to New York wasn't for her, instead was for his sister and the other guys got upset about this and told this to New York and he told her that he won't be with people who don't do the right thing but he remains in the house until the elimination where New York threw his jacket and kicked him off very angrily.\nAfter this she sent home \"Yours\" because he spent all the time sleeping and he drew an unflattering picture of New York, this upset Sister Patterson because Yours was a \"Mama's boy\". She also sent home Knock Out because of his looks and his violent tendencies.\n\n*'''Challenge:''' Swim across a pond and present New York with a present.\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' Buddha, Midget Mac, Tailor Made\n*'''Eliminated:''' Yours, Knock Out\n*'''Withdrew:''' Unsure\n\n===The Stolen Date===\n''First aired October 22, 2007''\n\nWith 12 guys left, some of the boys play a prank on a few of the \"less popular\" men that keeps them up all night. The sleep deprived few head into the days challenge a complete mess, but will the prank-ees have the last laugh at the end of the day? Wanting a man who can help build her financial empire, NY asks the boys to create a marketing plan to build her brand name. Some ideas are legitimate and professional and some are off the charts. Later, one of the guys from the winning team steals a private date with New York away from his teammate. The result is an angry house waiting for the back-stabber on his return. The following day, during a fashion photo shoot, someone gets down on his knees to impress New York. New York may have to send home more than one man. Man Man and Cheezy were both eliminated.\n\n*'''Challenge:''' Create a plan for New York's empire.\n*'''Teams'''\n:*'''Blue:''' Wolf, Buddha, 20 Pack\n:*'''Green:''' Mr. Wise, Punk, Pretty\n:*'''Yellow:''' Midget Mac, Man Man, The Entertainer\n:*'''Red:''' It, Cheezy, Tailor Made\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' It, Cheezy, Tailor Made\n*'''Eliminated:''' Cheezy, Man Man\n\n===Nobody Likes A Snitch===\n''First aired October 29, 2007''\n\nNew York has barely wiped the morning out of her eyes when a fight breaks out between Tailor Made and Buddha. Although NY can be a tolerant person, violence is non-negotiable and she is faced with the tough decision to let Buddha go. Eager to see how the other boys deal with aggression, NY brings them to a Muy Thai gym where she tests their ability to take a good old-fashioned beating, with a new-fashioned twist. The team who handles the challenge the best, wins a date with NY. Back at the mansion, tensions rise as a \"snitch\" is revealed among the men. This \"snitch\" will stop at nothing to get ahead and ultimately win NY's heart. During her double date, NY reveals some gossip she heard from this source. Things come to a real heat when the guys confront Tailor Made back at the house. Before the night is over, curses, heated threats and gross injustices are exchanged. A fight between Tailor Made and Mr. Wise breaks out, in which Tailor Made spits on Mr. Wise. When Tailor Made reveals this to New York, she is pissed because she gets a flashback to when Pumkin spat on her in ''Flavor of Love (season 1)'' . New York is confronted with yet another act of violence under her roof. In the end, 20 pack is eliminated.\n\n*'''Disqualified:''' Buddha\n*'''Challenge:''' Team that performs the best in the boxing match wins.\n*'''Teams'''\n:*'''Pink:''' The Entertainer, Wolf\n:*'''Yellow:''' Punk, Pretty\n:*'''Black:''' It, Midget Mac\n:*'''Blue:''' Tailor Made\n:*'''Red:''' Mr. Wise, 20 Pack\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' Mr. Wise, 20 Pack\n*'''Eliminated:''' 20 Pack\n\n===Blood Oath Gone Bad===\n''First aired November 5, 2007 (3.5M viewers)''<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Mediaweek]] | title = ESPN Sits Atop Ratings Pile With Strong MNF| first = Anthony | last = Crupi | date = November 13, 2007 | accessdate = September 26, 2010 | url = http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003671872}}</ref>\n\nAfter snitching, fighting, and spitting, and nearly getting eliminated, Tailor Made is the house enemy and anxiously waits for an opportunity to redeem himself. The guys find out the next challenge will involve an offering and a blood oath to test their devotion to their goddess New York. When \"It\" refuses to sign, and another signs an oath that includes obvious lies, New York is left worried about who she can really trust. Later that night there are some strange events in the house, which are hard to explain and make everyone wonder just how powerful spirits and lies can be. A visit from Sister Patterson ends in an argument with The Entertainer, putting him on thin ice. At the elimination, New York eliminates Midget Mac because she thinks he needs more time to overcome the loss of his deceased wife and time to be with his children. She also eliminates It, accusing him of being a fake and too dumb for her. The guys are in for an even bigger surprise when she brings Buddha back.\n\n*'''Challenge:''' Offer something sentimental to New York and sign a blood oath.\n*'''Challenge Winner:''' Punk\n*'''Eliminated:''' It, Midget Mac\n*'''Brought Back:''' Buddha\n\n===Nip/Suck===\n''First aired November 12, 2007''\n\nNew York surprises the guys with the return of Buddha. Tailor Made is unhappy as his world is suddenly turned upside down and he fears for his life. Later, the guys compete in a cooking challenge run by Season 1 favorite, \"Mr. Boston\". New York must endure tasting the boys' cooking. New York also gets a guest spot on the show \"Nip/Tuck,\" and she takes Wolf along to keep her company. At the set, Wolf in the trailer farts so loud it wakes New York up. He blames this fart on the tuna she fed him, saying it tasted like a \"cow tongue\". She was very shocked by this but on set she surprisingly remembered her lines. At eliminations, she let Wolf go, claiming he was too much of a \"country bumpkin\". Jokingly, she said before he left, \"We can get some ribs together or whatever y'all do in Texas.\"\n\n*'''Challenge:''' Cook a meal for New York.\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' Buddha, Wolf\n*'''Eliminated:''' Wolf\n\n===I Still Have Love For New York===\n''First aired November 19, 2007 (4.39M viewers)''<ref>{{cite news | agency = [[Associated Press]] | title = ESPN's 'Monday Night Football' cable television's most-watched show for week of Nov. 19-25 | date = November 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nNew York invites the remaining six guys' exes to the house and this time, there's a special twist involved. She's bringing two of her exes, Chance and Real, to help dig up some dirt on her guys. The only problem is that feelings resurface when the old flame admits he still has serious feelings for New York. When her \"new\" guys catch wind of this, all hell breaks loose. Later on, Pretty quits the competition because of the interrogating his sister received and New York asking her way too personal questions regarding his sexuality. At eliminations, no one was eliminated as a result of Pretty leaving the mansion.\n\n*'''Withdrew:''' Pretty\n\n===Mind Games===\n''First aired November 26, 2007''\n\nWith 5 guys left, New York wants to find out who's the most compatible with her and who's just plain crazy, when she takes the boys for a psych test. Things get tense, when it is revealed that one of the guys, who has been frustrating New York with mind games, may be using her to further his acting career. Her feelings for this person are thrown even more up in the air. After the test, the most compatible guy wins date with New York and discovers that three's a crowd at an exotic restaurant. The next day, New York brings her boys to see her therapist, renowned relationship author Dr. Allen, for a session of couple's counseling. Here, New York discovers that the individual she secretly has the strongest emotions for, is the one who also has been frustrating her the most. Also, Buddha is accused of being on a BET show called Hell Date. New York questions him and Buddha tells her that he is indeed on the show, and she becomes very upset with this information she received. Later, The Entertainer, the winner of the challenge, goes on a date with her. Back at the house, the guys play a prank on The Entertainer and he plays a trick himself by pretending to leave. After the jokes, it was eliminations where Mr. Wise was sent home for not being aggressive enough.\n\n*'''Challenge:''' Take a psych test.\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' The Entertainer\n*'''Eliminated:''' Mr. Wise\n\n===Meet The Parents===\n''First aired December 3, 2007''\n\nWith only four guys left, it is time to clean house. New York has invited some special guests - the guy's parents, so she gets her boys to scour and scrub her house for their arrival. Upon meeting her possible future in-laws it doesn't take long for New York to realize that these apples don't fall very far from the tree. While some parents are instantly in awe by New York, it takes others a little longer to warm up to her. Later, New York takes two of the families out to dinner, but before they can even break bread, all hell breaks loose. Hoping to make the next family outing a bit calmer, New York stays closer to home, but again is unable to create a happy family reunion. In the end, New York learns a very valuable lesson: You can't choose your family, but you can choose your lover and his family. Possible in-laws become outlaws as The Entertainer is sent packing because New York claims that he is a \"loser\" for the fact that he lives with his parents, and that he is so cheap.\n\n*'''Dates'''\n:*'''The Entertainer & Punk:''' Dinner date with family.\n:*'''Buddha & Tailor Made:''' Date in the backyard with family.\n*'''Eliminated:''' The Entertainer\n\n===Miami Thrice===\n''First aired December 10, 2007''\n\nAfter the last elimination, New York tells her final three men to pack their bags because they're heading to Miami. Miami is a party city, but things quickly get serious when New York invites one man to spend some alone time in her beachfront villa room the first night, leaving the other two shocked and angry. As New York spends quality time with each man, she starts to realize that two of these guys are totally devoted and in love with her while one is manipulative and hard to trust. At elimination New York must decide whether to listen to her mind or her heart and lets Punk go. Punk is eliminated, and Sister Paterson questions her decision. She says to New York, \"You're dead meat, girl!\" indicating that she believes that New York made the wrong choice for herself.\n\n*'''Eliminated:''' Punk\n\n===Clip Show===\n''First aired December 12, 2007''\n\nA catch up with New York, with bonus scenes not aired on TV.\n\n===Rasta Finale===\n''First aired December 17, 2007 (5.4M viewers)''<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | title = Showtime's 'Dexter' on fire | first = Kimberly | last = Nordyke | first2 = Paul J. | last2 = Gough | volume = 402 | page = 6 | date = 19 December 2007 | access-date = May 26, 2010 | url = http://hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i5d843c633b3a4760ee9785fa0b974ceb | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905203349/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i5d843c633b3a4760ee9785fa0b974ceb | archive-date = September 5, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n*'''Winner:''' Tailor Made\n*'''Runner-Up:''' Buddha\n\n===Reunion Show===\n''First aired January 6, 2008 (4.86M viewers)''<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Mediaweek]] | title = USA Rings In New Year With Ratings Win| first = Anthony | last = Crupi | date = January 8, 2008 | accessdate = May 26, 2010 | url = http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003694084}}</ref>\n\nAll of the men are back to talk about this season with New York and Sister Paterson.

When the guys find out that one of their housemates is \"re-gifting\", they proceed to tell NY about it. In true New York fashion, she lets the poor guy have it. Will he be one of the three to be eliminated, or will he squirm his way out of the mouth of danger? Meanwhile, a huge controversy arises when one suitor intercepts another man's flowers for NY, and presents them as his own. The only thing better than the drama is his story of where the flowers came from.\nUnsure decided to quit the competition because the jacket that he gave to New York wasn't for her, instead was for his sister and the other guys got upset about this and told this to New York and he told her that he won't be with people who don't do the right thing but he remains in the house until the elimination where New York threw his jacket and kicked him off very angrily.\nAfter this she sent home \"Yours\" because he spent all the time sleeping and he drew an unflattering picture of New York, this upset Sister Patterson because Yours was a \"Mama's boy\".

Although NY can be a tolerant person, violence is non-negotiable and she is faced with the tough decision to let Buddha go. Eager to see how the other boys deal with aggression, NY brings them to a Muy Thai gym where she tests their ability to take a good old-fashioned beating, with a new-fashioned twist. The team who handles the challenge the best, wins a date with NY. Back at the mansion, tensions rise as a \"snitch\" is revealed among the men. This \"snitch\" will stop at nothing to get ahead and ultimately win NY's heart. During her double date, NY reveals some gossip she heard from this source. Things come to a real heat when the guys confront Tailor Made back at the house. Before the night is over, curses, heated threats and gross injustices are exchanged. A fight between Tailor Made and Mr. Wise breaks out, in which Tailor Made spits on Mr. Wise. When Tailor Made reveals this to New York, she is pissed because she gets a flashback to when Pumkin spat on her in ''Flavor of Love (season 1)'' .
