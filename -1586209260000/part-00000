It becomes the official national anthem of the United States in 1931. The unique 15-star, 15-stripe design with a red stripe under the blue canton with stars (used from 1795 to 1818) of the huge flag made by [[Mary Young Pickersgill]] later seen by Key flying over [[Fort McHenry]] outside [[Baltimore]] in September 1814 during the [[Battle of Baltimore]] in a British attack becomes known as the \"Star Spangled Banner Flag\".\n*1818 &ndash; Flag with 20 stars and returned to the 13 stripes design of alternating red and white colors of 1777. It remains at 13 stripes hereafter to the present with only stars added for additional states admitted to the Union, on next following [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4. ([[Tennessee]] (1796), [[Ohio]] (1803), [[Louisiana]] (1812), [[Indiana]] (1816), [[Mississippi]] (1817) added from previous years). (An unofficial 16-star, 16-stripe flag had been made in Tennessee, and an unofficial 17-star, 13-stripe flag in Ohio.)\n*1819 &ndash; Flag with 21 stars ([[Illinois]])\n*1820 &ndash; Flag with 23 stars ([[Alabama]], [[Maine]]) first flag on [[Pikes Peak]], (located in future [[Colorado]])\n*1822 &ndash; Flag with 24 stars ([[Missouri]])\n*1836 &ndash; Flag with 25 stars ([[Arkansas]])\n*1837 &ndash; Flag with 26 stars ([[Michigan]])\n*1845 &ndash; Flag with 27 stars ([[Florida]])\n*1846 &ndash; Flag with 28 stars ([[Texas]])\n*1847 &ndash; Flag with 29 stars ([[Iowa]])\n*1848 &ndash; Flag with 30 stars ([[Wisconsin]])\n*1851 &ndash; Flag with 31 stars ([[California]])\n*1858 &ndash; Flag with 32 stars ([[Minnesota]])\n*1859 &ndash; Flag with 33 stars ([[Oregon]])\n*1861 &ndash; Flag with 34 stars; ([[Kansas]]). Even after the Southern states seceded from the Union, establishing the [[Confederate States of America]], 16th President [[Abraham Lincoln]] would not allow any star to be removed from the American flag. The first [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|National Flag of the Confederacy]] (nicknamed \"The Stars and Bars\") is adopted by the provisional government in the temporary capital of [[Montgomery, Alabama]]\n*1863 &ndash; Flag with 35 stars ([[West Virginia]], western counties withdrew from seceded [[Virginia]])\n*1865 &ndash; Flag with 36 stars ([[Nevada]])\n*1867 &ndash; Flag with 37 stars ([[Nebraska]])\n*1869 &ndash; First flag on a U.S. postage stamp\n*1876 &ndash; Flag with 38 stars ([[Colorado]])\n*1889 &ndash; Flag with 39 stars that never was. Flag manufacturers mistakenly believed that the two Dakotas would be admitted instead as one state and so manufactured this flag, some of which still exist. It was never an official flag.\n*1890 &ndash; Flag with 42 stars that never was. It was anticipated that Idaho would be admitted after July 4 and manufacturers tried to get a headstart by making 42 star flags. Idaho was admitted on July 3rd. As Wyoming was admitted July 10, few of the official 43 star flags were manufactured.\n*1890 &ndash; Flag with 43 stars ([[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Montana]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]])\n*1891 &ndash; Flag with 44 stars ([[Wyoming]])\n*1892 &ndash; \"[[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]\" first published in a magazine called ''\"The Youth's Companion\"'', written by [[Francis Bellamy]]. Revised in 1954.\n*1896 &ndash; Flag with 45 stars ([[Utah]])\n*1897 &ndash; Adoption of State Flag Desecration Statutes \u2013 By the late 1800s an organized flag protection movement was born in reaction to perceived commercial and political misuse of the flag. After supporters failed to obtain federal legislation, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota became the first States to adopt flag desecration statutes. By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag. Under the model flag desecration law, the term \"flag\" was defined to include any flag, standard, ensign, or color, or any representation of such made of any substance whatsoever and of any size that evidently purported to be said flag or a picture or representation thereof, upon which shall be shown the colors, the stars and stripes in any number, or by which the person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the U.S.\n*1907 &ndash; [[Halter v. Nebraska]] (205 U.S. 34) \u2013 The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] held that although the flag was a federal creation, the States' had the authority to promulgate flag desecration laws under their general police power to safeguard public safety and welfare. Halter involved a conviction of two businessmen selling \"Stars and Stripes\" brand beer with representations of the U.S. flag affixed to the labels. The defendants did not raise any constitutional First Amendment claim.\n*1908 &ndash; Flag with 46 stars ([[Oklahoma]])\n*1909 &ndash; Explorer [[Robert Peary]] places the flag his wife sewed atop the [[North Pole]]. He left pieces of another flag along the way. He was never censured for his action.\n*1912 &ndash; Flag with 48 stars ([[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]]) completing \"Lower 48\" continental U.S. Becomes longest serving flag of 47 years 1912\u20131959. (An unofficial 47-star flag was made for commemorative purposes in New Mexico.)\n*1931 &ndash; [[Stromberg v. California]] (283 U.S. 359) \u2013 The Supreme Court found that a State statute prohibiting the display of a \"red flag\" as a sign of opposition to organized government unconstitutionally infringed on the defendant's First Amendment rights. Stromberg represented the Court's first declaration that \"symbolic speech\" was protected by the First Amendment.\n*1942 &ndash; Federal Flag Code (36 U.S.C. 171 et seq.) \u2013 On June 22, 1942, 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] approved the Federal Flag Code, providing for uniform guidelines for the display and respect shown to the flag. The Flag Code does not prescribe any penalties for non-compliance nor does it include any enforcement provisions, rather it functions simply as a guide for voluntary civilian compliance.\n*1943 &ndash; [[West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette]] (319 U.S. 624) \u2013 The Supreme Court held that public school children could not be compelled to salute the U.S. flag. In a now famous passage, Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] highlighted the importance of freedom of expression under the First Amendment: Freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order. If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion.\n*1945 &ndash; The flag that flew over [[Pearl Harbor]] naval base in [[Hawaii]] on Sunday, December 7, 1941, is flown over the [[White House]] on August 14, 1945, \"V-J Day\" when the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] accepted surrender terms.\n*1949 August 3 &ndash; 34th President [[Harry Truman]] signs bill requesting the President call for a [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] (June 14th) observance each year by proclamation.\n*1954 &ndash; By act of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the words \"Under God\" are inserted into the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]\n*1959 &ndash; Flag with 49 stars ([[Alaska]])\n*1960 &ndash; Flag with 50 stars ([[Hawaii]])\n*1963 &ndash; American Flag placed on top of [[Mount Everest]]  in [[Himalayas Mountains]] in [[Nepal]] (tallest in the world), by [[Barry Bishop (mountaineer)|Barry Bishop]].\n*1968 &ndash; Adoption of Federal Flag Desecration Law (18 U.S.C. 700 et seq.) \u2013 Congress approved the first federal flag desecration law in the wake of a highly publicized [[Central Park]] flag burning incident in [[New York City]] in protest of the [[Vietnam War]]. The federal law made it illegal to \"knowingly\" cast \"contempt\" upon \"any flag of the [[United States]] by publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling upon it.\" The law defined flag in an expansive manner similar to most States.\n*1969 &ndash; July 20 \u2013 Astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] with [[Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin]] of [[Apollo 11]] places the American flag on the [[Moon]] at \"Tranquillity Base\".\n*1969 &ndash; [[Street v. New York]] (394 U.S. 576) \u2013 The Supreme Court held that New York State could not convict a person based on his verbal remarks disparaging the flag. Street was arrested after he learned of the shooting of civil rights leader [[James Meredith]] and reacted by burning his own flag and exclaiming to a small crowd that if the government could allow Meredith to be killed, \"we don't need no damn flag.\" The Court avoided deciding whether flag burning was protected by the First Amendment, and instead overturned the conviction based on Street's oral remarks. In Street, the Court found there was not a sufficient governmental interest to warrant regulating verbal criticism of the flag.\n*1972 &ndash; Smith v. Goguen (415 U.S. 94) \u2013 The Supreme Court held that Massachusetts could not prosecute a person for wearing a small cloth replica of the flag on the seat of his pants based on a State law making it a crime to publicly treat the flag of the United States with \"contempt\". The Massachusetts statute was held to be unconstitutionally \"void for vagueness.\"\n*1974 &ndash; Spence v. Washington (418 U.S. 405) \u2013 The Supreme Court held that the State of Washington could not convict a person for attaching removable tape in the form of a peace sign to a flag. The defendant had attached the tape to his flag and draped it outside of his window in protest of the 1970 [[U.S. invasion of Cambodia]] and the [[Kent State killings]]. The Court again found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment.\n*1970\u20131980 &ndash; Revision of State Flag Desecration Statutes \u2013 During this period legislatures in some 20 States narrowed the scope of their flag desecration laws in an effort to conform to perceived Constitutional restrictions under the Street, Smith, and Spence cases and to more generally parallel the Federal Law (i.e., focusing more specifically on mutilation and other forms of physical desecration, rather than verbal abuse or commercial or political misuse).\n*1989 &ndash; [[Texas v. Johnson]] (491 U.S. 397) \u2013 The Supreme Court upheld the Texas Court of Criminal appeals finding that Texas law \u2013 making it a crime to \"desecrate\" or otherwise \"mistreat\" the flag in a way the \"actor knows will seriously offend one or more persons\" \u2013 was unconstitutional as applied. This was the first time the Supreme Court had directly considered the applicability of the First Amendment to flag burning. Gregory Johnson, a member of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA|Revolutionary Communist Party]], was arrested during a demonstration outside of the [[1984 Republican National Convention]] in [[Dallas]] after he set fire to a flag while protesters chanted \"America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.\" In a 5\u20134 decision authored by Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], the Court first found that burning the flag was a form of symbolic speech subject to protection under the First Amendment. The Court also determined that under [[United States v. O'Brien]], 391 U.S. 367 (1968), since the State law was related to the suppression of freedom of expression, the conviction could only be upheld if Texas could demonstrate a \"compelling\" interest in its law. The Court next found that Texas' asserted interest in \"protecting the peace\" was not implicated under the facts of the case. Finally, while the Court acknowledged that Texas had a legitimate interest in preserving the flag as a \"symbol of national unity\", this interest was not sufficiently compelling to justify a \"content based\" legal restriction (i.e., the law was not based on protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, but was designed to protect it from symbolic protest likely to cause offense to others).\n*1989 &ndash; Revision of Federal Flag Desecration Statute \u2013 Pursuant to the Flag Protection Act of 1989, Congress amended the 1968 federal flag desecration statute in an effort to make it \"content neutral\" and conform to the Constitutional requirements of the Johnson case. As a result, the 1989 Act sought to prohibit flag desecration under all circumstances by deleting the statutory requirement that the conduct cast contempt upon the flag and narrowing the definition of the term \"flag\" so that its meaning was not based on the observation of third parties.\n*1990 &ndash; [[United States v. Eichman]] (496 U.S. 310) \u2013 Passage of the Flag Protection Act of 1989 resulted in a number of flag burning incidents protesting the new law. The Supreme Court overturned several flag burning convictions brought under the Flag Protection Act. The Court held that notwithstanding Congress' effort to adopt a more content neutral law, the federal law continued to be principally aimed at limiting symbolic speech.\n*1990 &ndash; Rejection of Constitutional Amendment \u2013 Following the Eichman decision, Congress considered and rejected a Constitutional Amendment specifying that \"the Congress and the States have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\" The amendment failed to muster the necessary two-thirds Congressional majorities, as it was supported by only a 254 \u2013 177 margin in the House (290 votes were necessary) and a 58 \u2013 42 margin in the Senate (67 votes were necessary).\n*1995 &ndash; The [[Flag Desecration Amendment|Flag Desecration Constitutional Amendment]] is narrowly defeated in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. The Amendment to the Constitution would make burning the flag a punishable crime.\n*2005 &ndash; [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] passes a new flag desecration constitutional amendment\n*2006 &ndash; U.S. Senate rejects new constitutional amendment\n*2007 &ndash; The longevity in years used of the present 50-star flag is now tied with that of the 48-star flag, both having experienced 47 years of continuous use.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  After this date, the 50-star flag became the longest-used version of the Flag of the United States of America.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Flags of the United States}}\n*[[Flag Acts (United States)]]\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Flags of the United States| ]]\n[[Category:History of flags|United States]]\n[[Category:United States history timelines|Flag of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2007}}\n\n<div class=\"floatright\">\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:500 height:2000\nPlotArea   = left:50 right:0 bottom:10 top:10\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1775 till:2010\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical order:reverse\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1780\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1780\n\nColors =\n  id:red value:rgb(0.698,0.132,0.203)\n  id:blue value:rgb(0.234,0.233,0.430)\n\nPlotData=\n  Color:red mark:(line,blue) align:left fontsize:S \n  shift:(15,-3) # shift text to right side of bar\n\n  # there is no automatic collision detection, fontsize:XS \n  # so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap shift:(25,-10)\n\n  at:1776 textcolor:red  text: Continental Colors displayed for the first time\n  at:1777 textcolor:blue text: Continental Congress adopts flag with 13 stars and 13 stripes\n  at:1795 textcolor:blue text: 15 stars and 15 stripes (Vermont, Kentucky)\n  at:1814 textcolor:red  text: \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" written\n  at:1818 textcolor:blue text: 20 stars and 13 stripes (Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, Mississippi)\n  at:1819 textcolor:blue text: 21 stars (Illinois)\n  at:1820 textcolor:blue text: 23 stars (Alabama, Maine)\n  at:1822 textcolor:blue text: 24 stars (Missouri)\n  at:1836 textcolor:blue text: 25 stars (Arkansas)\n  at:1837 textcolor:blue text: 26 stars (Michigan)\n  at:1845 textcolor:blue text: 27 stars (Florida)\n  at:1846 textcolor:blue text: 28 stars (Texas)\n  at:1847 textcolor:blue text: 29 stars (Iowa)\n  at:1848 textcolor:blue text: 30 stars (Wisconsin)\n  at:1851 textcolor:blue text: 31 stars (California)\n  at:1858 textcolor:blue text: 32 stars (Minnesota)\n  at:1859 textcolor:blue text: 33 stars (Oregon)\n  at:1861 textcolor:blue text: 34 stars (Kansas)\n  at:1863 textcolor:blue text: 35 stars (West Virginia)\n  at:1865 textcolor:blue text: 36 stars (Nevada)\n  at:1867 textcolor:blue text: 37 stars (Nebraska)\n  at:1876 textcolor:blue text: 38 stars (Colorado)\n  at:1890 textcolor:blue text: 43 stars (North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho)\n  at:1891 textcolor:blue text: 44 stars (Wyoming)\n  at:1892 textcolor:red  text: Pledge of Allegiance first published\n  at:1896 textcolor:blue text: 45 stars (Utah)\n  at:1897 textcolor:red  text: State flag desecration statutes adopted\n  at:1907 textcolor:red  text: Halter v.

It was anticipated that Idaho would be admitted after July 4 and manufacturers tried to get a headstart by making 42 star flags. Idaho was admitted on July 3rd.

Revised in 1954.\n*1896 &ndash; Flag with 45 stars ([[Utah]])\n*1897 &ndash; Adoption of State Flag Desecration Statutes \u2013 By the late 1800s an organized flag protection movement was born in reaction to perceived commercial and political misuse of the flag. After supporters failed to obtain federal legislation, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota became the first States to adopt flag desecration statutes. By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag. Under the model flag desecration law, the term \"flag\" was defined to include any flag, standard, ensign, or color, or any representation of such made of any substance whatsoever and of any size that evidently purported to be said flag or a picture or representation thereof, upon which shall be shown the colors, the stars and stripes in any number, or by which the person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the U.S.\n*1907 &ndash; [[Halter v. Nebraska]] (205 U.S. 34) \u2013 The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] held that although the flag was a federal creation, the States' had the authority to promulgate flag desecration laws under their general police power to safeguard public safety and welfare. Halter involved a conviction of two businessmen selling \"Stars and Stripes\" brand beer with representations of the U.S. flag affixed to the labels. The defendants did not raise any constitutional First Amendment claim.\n*1908 &ndash; Flag with 46 stars ([[Oklahoma]])\n*1909 &ndash; Explorer [[Robert Peary]] places the flag his wife sewed atop the [[North Pole]]. He left pieces of another flag along the way. He was never censured for his action.\n*1912 &ndash; Flag with 48 stars ([[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]]) completing \"Lower 48\" continental U.S. Becomes longest serving flag of 47 years 1912-1959. (An unofficial 47-star flag was made for commemorative purposes in New Mexico.)\n*1931 &ndash; [[Stromberg v. California]] (283 U.S. 359) \u2013 The Supreme Court found that a State statute prohibiting the display of a \"red flag\" as a sign of opposition to organized government unconstitutionally infringed on the defendant's First Amendment rights. Stromberg represented the Court's first declaration that \"symbolic speech\" was protected by the First Amendment.\n*1942 &ndash; Federal Flag Code (36 U.S.C. 171 et seq.) \u2013 On June 22, 1942, 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] approved the Federal Flag Code, providing for uniform guidelines for the display and respect shown to the flag. The Flag Code does not prescribe any penalties for non-compliance nor does it include any enforcement provisions, rather it functions simply as a guide for voluntary civilian compliance.\n*1943 &ndash; [[West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette]] (319 U.S. 624) \u2013 The Supreme Court held that public school children could not be compelled to salute the U.S. flag. In a now famous passage, Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] highlighted the importance of freedom of expression under the First Amendment: Freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order. If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion.\n*1945 &ndash; The flag that flew over [[Pearl Harbor]] naval base in [[Hawaii]] on Sunday, December 7, 1941, is flown over the [[White House]] on August 14, 1945, \"V-J Day\" when the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] accepted surrender terms.\n*1949 August 3 &ndash; 34th President [[Harry Truman]] signs bill requesting the President call for a [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] (June 14th) observance each year by proclamation.\n*1954 &ndash; By act of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the words \"Under God\" are inserted into the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]\n*1959 &ndash; Flag with 49 stars ([[Alaska]])\n*1960 &ndash; Flag with 50 stars ([[Hawaii]])\n*1963 &ndash; American Flag placed on top of [[Mount Everest]]  in [[Himalayas Mountains]] in [[Nepal]] (tallest in the world), by [[Barry Bishop (mountaineer)|Barry Bishop]].\n*1968 &ndash; Adoption of Federal Flag Desecration Law (18 U.S.C. 700 et seq.) \u2013 Congress approved the first federal flag desecration law in the wake of a highly publicized [[Central Park]] flag burning incident in [[New York City]] in protest of the [[Vietnam War]]. The federal law made it illegal to \"knowingly\" cast \"contempt\" upon \"any flag of the [[United States]] by publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling upon it.\" The law defined flag in an expansive manner similar to most States.\n*1969 &ndash; July 20 \u2013 Astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] with [[Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin]] of [[Apollo 11]] places the American flag on the [[Moon]] at \"Tranquillity Base\".\n*1969 &ndash; [[Street v. New York]] (394 U.S. 576) \u2013 The Supreme Court held that New York State could not convict a person based on his verbal remarks disparaging the flag. Street was arrested after he learned of the shooting of civil rights leader [[James Meredith]] and reacted by burning his own flag and exclaiming to a small crowd that if the government could allow Meredith to be killed, \"we don't need no damn flag.\" The Court avoided deciding whether flag burning was protected by the First Amendment, and instead overturned the conviction based on Street's oral remarks. In Street, the Court found there was not a sufficient governmental interest to warrant regulating verbal criticism of the flag.\n*1972 &ndash; Smith v. Goguen (415 U.S. 94) \u2013 The Supreme Court held that Massachusetts could not prosecute a person for wearing a small cloth replica of the flag on the seat of his pants based on a State law making it a crime to publicly treat the flag of the United States with \"contempt\". The Massachusetts statute was held to be unconstitutionally \"void for vagueness.\"\n*1974 &ndash; Spence v. Washington (418 U.S. 405) \u2013 The Supreme Court held that the State of Washington could not convict a person for attaching removable tape in the form of a peace sign to a flag. The defendant had attached the tape to his flag and draped it outside of his window in protest of the 1970 [[U.S. invasion of Cambodia]] and the [[Kent State killings]]. The Court again found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment.\n*1970\u20131980 &ndash; Revision of State Flag Desecration Statutes \u2013 During this period legislatures in some 20 States narrowed the scope of their flag desecration laws in an effort to conform to perceived Constitutional restrictions under the Street, Smith, and Spence cases and to more generally parallel the Federal Law (i.e., focusing more specifically on mutilation and other forms of physical desecration, rather than verbal abuse or commercial or political misuse).\n*1989 &ndash; [[Texas v. Johnson]] (491 U.S. 397) \u2013 The Supreme Court upheld the Texas Court of Criminal appeals finding that Texas law \u2013 making it a crime to \"desecrate\" or otherwise \"mistreat\" the flag in a way the \"actor knows will seriously offend one or more persons\" \u2013 was unconstitutional as applied. This was the first time the Supreme Court had directly considered the applicability of the First Amendment to flag burning. Gregory Johnson, a member of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA|Revolutionary Communist Party]], was arrested during a demonstration outside of the [[1984 Republican National Convention]] in [[Dallas]] after he set fire to a flag while protesters chanted \"America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.\" In a 5\u20134 decision authored by Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], the Court first found that burning the flag was a form of symbolic speech subject to protection under the First Amendment. The Court also determined that under [[United States v. O'Brien]], 391 U.S. 367 (1968), since the State law was related to the suppression of freedom of expression, the conviction could only be upheld if Texas could demonstrate a \"compelling\" interest in its law. The Court next found that Texas' asserted interest in \"protecting the peace\" was not implicated under the facts of the case. Finally, while the Court acknowledged that Texas had a legitimate interest in preserving the flag as a \"symbol of national unity\", this interest was not sufficiently compelling to justify a \"content based\" legal restriction (i.e., the law was not based on protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, but was designed to protect it from symbolic protest likely to cause offense to others).\n*1989 &ndash; Revision of Federal Flag Desecration Statute \u2013 Pursuant to the Flag Protection Act of 1989, Congress amended the 1968 federal flag desecration statute in an effort to make it \"content neutral\" and conform to the Constitutional requirements of the Johnson case. As a result, the 1989 Act sought to prohibit flag desecration under all circumstances by deleting the statutory requirement that the conduct cast contempt upon the flag and narrowing the definition of the term \"flag\" so that its meaning was not based on the observation of third parties.\n*1990 &ndash; [[United States v. Eichman]] (496 U.S. 310) \u2013 Passage of the Flag Protection Act of 1989 resulted in a number of flag burning incidents protesting the new law. The Supreme Court overturned several flag burning convictions brought under the Flag Protection Act. The Court held that notwithstanding Congress' effort to adopt a more content neutral law, the federal law continued to be principally aimed at limiting symbolic speech.\n*1990 &ndash; Rejection of Constitutional Amendment \u2013 Following the Eichman decision, Congress considered and rejected a Constitutional Amendment specifying that \"the Congress and the States have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\" The amendment failed to muster the necessary two-thirds Congressional majorities, as it was supported by only a 254 \u2013 177 margin in the House (290 votes were necessary) and a 58 \u2013 42 margin in the Senate (67 votes were necessary).\n*1995 &ndash; The [[Flag Desecration Amendment|Flag Desecration Constitutional Amendment]] is narrowly defeated in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. The Amendment to the Constitution would make burning the flag a punishable crime.\n*2005 &ndash; [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] passes a new flag desecration constitutional amendment\n*2006 &ndash; U.S. Senate rejects new constitutional amendment\n*2007 &ndash; The longevity in years used of the present 50-star flag is now tied with that of the 48-star flag, both having experienced 47 years of continuous use.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  After this date, the 50-star flag became the longest-used version of the Flag of the United States of America.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Flags of the United States}}\n*[[Flag Acts (United States)]]\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Flags of the United States| ]]\n[[Category:History of flags|United States]]\n[[Category:United States history timelines|Flag of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1912-1959 \u2192 1912\u20131959", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_flag_of_the_United_States"}

Bush]] differed in the 2004 [[2004 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election]]. Kerry said in August 2004 that he would make the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq a goal of his first presidential term. However, he did not offer a deadline or a timetable, and proposed an increase in deployment size in the immediate future. In the debate, he said that he reiterated that withdrawal was a goal, if an initial troop increase works.\n\nIn the debate, Bush did not offer any timetable or estimate of troops, either increasing or decreasing, but said only that the commanders of the troops in Iraq had the ability to ask for whatever force they needed. In general, this is consistent with his earlier remarks.

Kerry said in August 2004 that he would make the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq a goal of his first presidential term. However, he did not offer a deadline or a timetable, and proposed an increase in deployment size in the immediate future. In the debate, he said that he reiterated that withdrawal was a goal, if an initial troop increase works.\n\nIn the debate, Bush did not offer any timetable or estimate of troops, either increasing or decreasing, but said only that the commanders of the troops in Iraq had the ability to ask for whatever force they needed. In general, this is consistent with his earlier remarks. When questioned about troop strength, Bush and then-[[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] said that they were using the troops asked for by the general staff.\n\n===Congressional proposals and acts===\n{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}}\n{{See also|Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007}}\n\nOn 17 November 2005 Representative [[John Murtha]] (D-PA) introduced {{USBill|109|hj|73}}, a resolution calling for U.S. forces in Iraq to be \"redeployed at the earliest practicable date\" to stand as a quick-reaction force in U.S. bases in neighboring countries such as [[Kuwait]].

objective of the meeting was to discuss legal regimes and jurisdictional issues in the Arctic Ocean, only the five coastal states of that ocean were invited.<ref name=\"Buixade Farre 2014\" /> The [[Arctic Council]], being the only circumpolar Arctic international forum, which also includes the three Arctic states that do ''not'' border the Arctic Ocean (Sweden, Finland and Iceland) was deliberately not used as a forum. These three states are therefore not a party to the Ilulissat Declaration. Likewise, the Arctic indigenous peoples, who have a prominent position within the Arctic Council, were not involved in the Ilulissat negotiations.\n\nThe conference, held May 27 to May 29, 2008, was hosted by [[Per Stig M\u00f8ller]], Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs, and [[Hans Enoksen]], Greenlandic Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arctic-council.org/article/2008/5/conference_on_the_arctic_ocean |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820072237/http://arctic-council.org/article/2008/5/conference_on_the_arctic_ocean |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-08-20 |title=Conference on the Arctic Ocean: The Danish Foreign Minister wants unity about the future of the Arctic Ocean.
