Hanna performed the Google search to research how she needed to dress and apply makeup to transform herself into a TikTok e-girl.  In the video Hanna didn't acknowledge or attempt to remove the information about the murder, instead focusing on the image accompanying the article, which was an e-girl themed photo of Bianca. She received backlash from viewers, some of whom left comments on the video accusing her of \"using a murder victim as an aesthetic\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMjvWz7CgDg|language=en|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> On February 13, 2020, Hanna posted a video in which she read the apology that she sent to Bianca's mother. Hanna explained that as she scrolled and skimmed through the e-girl article looking for inspiration photos for her 'Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl' YouTube video, she stopped at a photo of Bianca and completely missed the body of text next to photo. Hanna said she would never have included the image in her video if she had known its context within the article.  Hanna also read and showed the messages from the conversation she had with Bianca's mother following the apology.  Bianca's mother said she appreciated Hanna's apology and the fact that she reached out to her personally.  Hanna said that she wanted to speak with the mother and ask for her permission before making a public apology, and when asked Bianca's mother replied, \"It's up to you.  Sometimes letting it settle down is better.  But if you want to be public about it you can.  I really wasn't offended by the video.\"  When Hanna asked her feelings about mentioning that they spoke and that there is an upcoming memorial gala, she replied, \"Absolutely.

You can tell people I said that.\"  This YouTube video, titled \"For Bianca.\", includes a link to the Bianca Michelle Devins Memorial Scholarship Fund, and Hanna stated that the ad revenue from this video contributes to that fund.<ref>{{Citation|title=For Bianca.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX-g_MZdW9c|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\nOn March 25th, 2020, Hanna stated on Instagram that she would soon release a 4 song EP, since singles from \"This Time Next Year\" had been pushed back due to COVID-19 concerns.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Im7hug6b7/|title=GABBIE HANNA on Instagram: \u201cif you could go anywhere rn with no restrictions, where would it be? i was supposed to be shooting a music video today that [obviously] got\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> The first single from the EP, \"Dandelion\", is set for release on April 17, 2020.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Dating life ===\nIn early 2018, Hanna began semi-publicly dating a man who fans dubbed the \"mystery man\".

Hanna promptly deleted the 2011 tweet and tweeted an apology, saying at the age of 20 she thought it was funny and that she's \"sorry to anyone who was hurt by this, i think it's gross, too\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GabbieHanna/status/1211458432844222464?s=19|title=Gabbie Hanna adresses pedophilia joke|last=Gabbie Hanna|first=@gabbiehanna|date=December 29, 2019|website=[[Twitter]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref> Hanna later added on her podcast that multiple old tweets that people were digging up against her were [[Bo Burnham]] quotes and at the time, certain jokes were considered comical that would not be in the present day.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_PIAZe4XU|title=Our Thoughts on NikkieTutorials Coming Out|work=Box of Thoughts Podcast|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref> \n\nOn January 23rd 2020, Hanna uploaded a video titled 'Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl' in which she is shown performing a Google search for \"what is an egirl\" and, after clicking on the second link titled \"E-girl definition: What is an e-girl? - Vox\", information about the [[Murder of Bianca Devins]] was brielfy displayed from one paragraph of the Vox article.  Hanna performed the Google search to research how she needed to dress and apply makeup to transform herself into a TikTok e-girl.  In the video Hanna didn't acknowledge or attempt to remove the information about the murder, instead focusing on the image accompanying the article, which was an e-girl themed photo of Bianca. She received backlash from viewers, some of whom left comments on the video accusing her of \"using a murder victim as an aesthetic\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMjvWz7CgDg|language=en|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> On February 13, 2020, Hanna posted a video in which she read the apology that she sent to Bianca's mother. Hanna explained that as she scrolled and skimmed through the e-girl article looking for inspiration photos for her 'Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl' YouTube video, she stopped at a photo of Bianca and completely missed the body of text next to photo. Hanna said she would never have included the image in her video if she had known its context within the article.  Hanna also read and showed the messages from the conversation she had with Bianca's mother following the apology.  Bianca's mother said she appreciated Hanna's apology and the fact that she reached out to her personally.  Hanna said that she wanted to speak with the mother and ask for her permission before making a public apology, and when asked Bianca's mother replied, \"It's up to you.  Sometimes letting it settle down is better.  But if you want to be public about it you can.  I really wasn't offended by the video.\"  When Hanna asked her feelings about mentioning that they spoke and that there is an upcoming memorial gala, she replied, \"Absolutely. Like I said, it didn't offend me. You can tell people I said that.\"  This YouTube video, titled \"For Bianca.\", includes a link to the Bianca Michelle Devins Memorial Scholarship Fund, and Hanna stated that the ad revenue from this video contributes to that fund.<ref>{{Citation|title=For Bianca.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX-g_MZdW9c|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\nOn March 25th, 2020, Hanna stated on Instagram that she would soon release a 4 song EP, since singles from \"This Time Next Year\" had been pushed back due to COVID-19 concerns.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Im7hug6b7/|title=GABBIE HANNA on Instagram: \u201cif you could go anywhere rn with no restrictions, where would it be? i was supposed to be shooting a music video today that [obviously] got\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> The first single from the EP, \"Dandelion\", is set for release on April 17, 2020.<ref name=\":11\" />  \n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Dating life ===\nIn early 2018, Hanna began semi-publicly dating a man who fans dubbed the \"mystery man\".

As a result, the technical section will only cover these differences.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Prototypes ===\nIn 1971 the prototypes, 614 001 + 914 001 + 614 002 and 614 003 + 914 002 + 614 004, were delivered. Testing was carried out from [[Trier]] along the [[Moselle]] valley and into the [[Eifel]]. Unlike the production vehicles the prototypes had a [[tilting train|tilting systems]].\n\n=== Production units ===\nFull production by [[MAN SE]] and the ''Uerdingen Waggonfabrik'' began in 1973. The first series of 25 three-coach units was delivered at the time when so-called \"pop liveries\" were in vogue and so they were painted in stone-grey and orange. Immediately following the first batch were the 15 units of the second series delivered in 1975 and stabled at [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] locomotive depot. These were already painted in the new ocean blue and beige livery.\n\n=== Operations ===\n[[Image:Bahnhofsoltau001.JPG|thumb|614 at Soltau station]]\nThere are a total of 42 Class 614 three-car units, which are stationed at [[Nuremberg]] and Brunswick. In the early years, Trier was also a base for these DMUs. The Brunswick 614's have mainly worked in the [[Harz]] and [[Weser Uplands]] since their introduction. In doing so they often ran on former East-West trunk lines, which lost their significance after the [[partition of Germany]]. The most important termini were [[Altenbeken]], [[Bad Harzburg]], [[Bad Lauterberg]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[Bodenburg]], [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Hamelin]], [[Hildesheim]], [[Kreiensen]], [[L\u00f6hne]], [[Northeim]], Ottbergen, [[Paderborn]], [[Salzgitter]]-Lebenstedt, and [[Walkenried]]. During some timetable periods they also called at [[Lemgo]], [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Nordhausen]], [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], [[Oldenburg]], [[Rahden]], [[Uelzen]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]]. Currently the units all operate in the standard configuration as three-car multiples, whereas in former years they were frequently run as just two-car units or sometimes in fours. Quite often they formed part of mixed multiples, for example: 614+914+934+634. Meanwhile, following the transfer of numerous lines to private firms as a result of competition, and the delivery of the Class 648.25 to [[DB Regio]], the Brunswick DMUs have largely withdrawn from these classic routes. \nInstead they have been used on atypical routes, like e.g. [[Leer]] - [[Nieuweschans]], [[Emden Hbf]] - [[Emden]]-Au\u00dfenhafen, [[Minden]] - [[Rotenburg (W\u00fcmme)|Rotenburg]], Uelzen - [[Bremen]] and [[Hanover]] \u2013 [[Soltau]] - [[Buchholz in der Nordheide|Buchholz]], although currently only the last two routes are still worked by them. The Brunswick Class 628's freed up from other locations were expected to replace the remaining 614's during 2008. Several vehicles have already been set aside and scrapped, several were moved to [[Hamm]] Rbf and are hoping for a better future there.\n\nThe Nuremberg 614's are underway in the [[Upper Palatinate]] (''Oberpfalz'') and in [[Franconia]] (''Franken''), working such routes as [[Forchheim]]\u2013[[Ebermannstadt]], [[F\u00fcrth]]\u2013[[Cadolzburg]], F\u00fcrth\u2013[[Markt Erlbach]] and Nuremberg\u2013[[Simmelsdorf]]-H\u00fcttenbach/[[Neuhaus an der Pegnitz]]. Here too only three-coach trains are used, whilst previously several 934's were stationed at Nuremberg in order to be able to form four-car multiples. These formations were not liked by drivers because the lack of engine power on the 614 was only too obvious on inclines. The use of the Nuremberg VT 614's is coming to an end, because in December 2008 new VT 648s were to be used on most of the routes in the Nuremberg diesel network.\n\nA number of class 614 units have been sold on to [[C\u0103ile_Ferate_Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]] in [[Romania]], where they form CFR's Class 76. Some have been partially rebuilt by [[Remarul_16_Februarie]] with new driver's cabs and MTU powerplants.\n\n== Differences from 624/634 ==\nEven though their external appearance is somewhat different, the variations between Classes 614 and 624 are not that great. The following sections describe their main differences; in all other respects the classes are the same.\n\n=== Running gear ===\nThe [[bogies]] were slightly changed. They are supported, as on the 634's, by air bags, but are controlled by 4 air suspension valves on each coach (apart from 614 001 to 004). The resulting four-point support changes over to a three-point support at speeds below 25&nbsp;km/h using a pressure control on the wheelset bearing, which deactivates one of the valves.\n\nInstead of the mechanical anti-skid system on the 624/634 the Class 614 has electronic anti-skid control.\n\n=== Engine ===\nThe D 3650 HM 12 U diesel engine from MAN is largely the same as that on the 624/634, but is driven at a higher final speed  of 2150 rpm and is rated at 370&nbsp;kW/500&nbsp;hp, but only set at 331&nbsp;kW/450&nbsp;hp (as is normal on the 624/634). The handpump fitted to many 624/634's for topping up the cooling water is not installed on the 614. The fan equipment for the coolant water system can be set to emergency operation by the driver should the fan valve fail, something which can only be done in a workshop on the 624/634.\n\n26 coaches (13 sets) have been equipped with new [[Cummins Engine|Cummins]] diesel engines in recent years. These engines have the considerably higher power of 448&nbsp;kW. However, this remotoring programme was stopped when the operational future of the Class 614 became markedly bleaker.\n\n=== Heating ===\nOn modernisation all 614's, and even the 914 centre coaches, were given a timer that enables the time to be set for coaches to be preheated. In this way their preparation time can be shortened. At the same time standard thermostat valves from trade were installed in the 1st class compartments.\n\n=== Door operation ===\nThe Class 614 has door control with [[selective door opening]] and door sensory systems. The doors, which on the 624/634 were not always easy to open, are assisted by [[compressed air]]. As part of modernisation in the mid-90s a warning tone device was retrofitted and - unlike the 624 - also an anti-jam system. Some of the vehicles also have warning lights in the area of the door. Shortly after the turn of the millennium several 614's were converted to TAV (''technikbasierte Abfertigungsverfahren'') automatic door operation. Door control computers were installed, door handles removed and replaced by door opening buttons and [[light curtain|photoelectric beams]]. Because the new door control system was not very reliable and the vehicles were approaching the end of their service life the TAV installation programme was halted after a few years, even befhore the end of the remotoring programme.\n\n=== Passenger information systems ===\nUntil their modernisation the 614's had the [[destination blind]]s familiar from the 624/634 series. These were later replaced by two electronic [[dot matrix display]]s on each VT coach. The control of all displays in the train was achieved by entering the destination code number into ''Brose'' entry devices that are installed on every driver's console. In addition several Nuremberg 614's were gieven early passenger information displays.\n\n=== Passenger areas ===\n[[File:Inneneinrichtung 614 2. Klasse.jpg|thumb|Interior of 614 002 after modernisation (31 March 2006)]]\nThe interior of the Class 614 always set it apart clearly from its older brethren. On delivery the coaches had adjustable seats with individual, fabric-covered cushions. The colour of the seat covers as well as the imitation leather arms and headrests varied, being either red-brown or green. The sides were screened with beige plastic. The 1st class compartment was largely the same as that on the 624/634. And whilst the interiors looked very smart, the colours were very much contemporary and were no longer up to date by the mid-1990s.\n\nDuring the course of the modernisation programme the 614's were given the first double-decker coaches delivered to the old Federal states and the y-coaches of well-known design with beige wall coverings and light green fabric-covered individual seats, some arranged facing each other, others all facing in the same direction. One unique feature is the folding table at every seat, some of which are now missing as a result of vandalism. As on the 624/634 the luggage compartment behind the cab, together with its loading doors, was omitted. The 1st class compartments were given pink wall coverings, blue tables and blue, adjustable individual seats with red head cushions.\n\nThe last 914's to be modernised were each given two closed vacuum toilet systems, of which one is fitted for the disable. Later the remaining 914's were retrofitted with them.\n\n=== Livery ===\n[[Image:614022-135-01.jpg|thumb|614 + 934 + 934 + 614<br>F\u00fcrth (Bay) Hbf, June 1987]]\nThe first series to be delivered, which went to Nuremberg depot, were painted in the contemporary 'pop' colour scheme. This was later changed on the 614 to a blood orange window stripe on a gravel grey background. This livery was retained until the coaches were modernised. The second series, delivered to Brunswick depot, was supplied in ocean-blue and beige. Unlike the 624/634 the 614 was given an additional thin blue decorative stripe above the line dividing the colours which lent the vehicles a more dynamic appearance. Almost all 614s were initially painted light grey and mint green for the redesign and, later on, traffic red and white. The only exception is unit 614 005 + 914 003 + 614 006 which was painted in gravel grey and orange on modernisation and preserved the 'pop' colour scheme into the new millennium. All other vehicles have since been repainted in the current scheme of traffic red and white.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Citations==\n* {{cite book |last=Garvin |first=Brian |title=German Railways: The Complete Guide to All Locomotives and Multiple Units of Deutsche Bahn \u2013 Part 1: Locomotives & Multiple Units of Deutsche Bahn |date=2013 | edition=5| location=Sheffield, UK |publisher=Platform 5 Publishing |isbn=978-1-9094-3103-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAJcngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:ISBN1909431184 |ref=harv}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]]\n* [[Deutsche Bahn]]\n* [[List of Deutsche Bundesbahn locomotives and railbuses]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat|DB Class 614}}\n* [http://www.baureihe614.de/ Class 614/624/634]\n\n\n{{German DMUs}}\n\n[[Category:Diesel multiple units of Germany|614]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox train\n| background       = #aa0000;color:white;\n| name             = DB Class 614/914\n| image            = 614 in Hersbruck.jpg\n| imagealt         = \n| imagesize        = 280px\n| caption          = Three-car 614+914+614 in [[Hersbruck]], 28 July 2006\n| interiorimage    = \n| interiorimagealt = \n| interiorcaption  = \n| service          = \n| manufacturer     = {{ubl|[[MAN SE|MAN]]|[[DUEWAG|Uerdingen]] }}\n| ordernumber      = \n| factory          = \n| family           = \n| replaced         = \n| yearconstruction = {{ubl|Prototypes: 1971|Series production: 1972\u20131975}}\n| yearservice      = \n| refurbishment    = \n| yearscrapped     = \n| numberconstruction= \n| numberbuilt      = {{ubl|84 driving motor cars (614)|42 centre trailer cars (914)}}\n| numberservice    = \n| numberpreserved  = \n| numberscrapped   = \n| formation        = \n| diagram          = \n| code             = \n| fleetnumbers     = {{ubl|614&nbsp;001/002\u2013083/084|914&nbsp;001\u2013042}}\n| capacity         = \n| operator         = \n| depots           = \n| lines            = \n\n| carbody          = \n| trainlength      = 3-car: {{convert|79,460|mm|ftin|frac=4|abbr=on}}\n| carlength        = \n| width            = \n| height           = \n| floorheight      = \n| platformheight   = \n| entrylevelorstep = \n| doors            = \n| art-sections     = \n| wheeldiameter    = \n| wheelbase        = \n| maxspeed         = {{convert|140|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight           = 3-car: {{convert|141.8|t}}\n| axleload         =   \n| traction         = \n| engine           = [[MAN SE|MAN]]\n| enginetype       = [[Diesel engine|Diesel]]\n| cylindercount    = \n| cylindersize     = \n| traction motors  =  \n| poweroutput      = {{convert|754|kW|PS hp|abbr=on}}\n| tractiveeffort   = \n| transmission     = [[Torque converter|Hydraulic]]\n| acceleration     = \n| deceleration     = \n| aux              = \n| powersupply      = \n| hvac             = \n| electricsystem   = \n| collectionmethod = \n| uicclass         = 3-car: B\u20322\u2032+2\u20322\u2032+2\u2032B\u2032\n| aarwheels        = \n| bogies           = \n| brakes           = [[KE-R-A]]<!-- Find this -->\n| safety           = [[Sifa]] / [[PZB]]\n| coupling         = \n| multipleworking  = \n| light            =\n| gauge            = \n| notes            =\n}}\nThe '''DB Class 614'''s are German [[diesel multiple unit]]s operated by the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]], comprising two '''Class 614''' driving units and up to two '''Class 914''' centre cars.{{sfnp|Garvin|2013|page=155}} On 1 January 1994 the ownership of these vehicles was transferred to the DB's legal successor ''[[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]]'' and its subsidiaries or business areas.\n\nThe Class 614 is a direct evolution of the Class [[DB Class VT 24|624 / 634]]{{cn|date=December 2017}}  and only differs from them in a few points of detail. As a result, the technical section will only cover these differences.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Prototypes ===\nIn 1971 the prototypes, 614 001 + 914 001 + 614 002 and 614 003 + 914 002 + 614 004, were delivered. Testing was carried out from [[Trier]] along the [[Moselle]] valley and into the [[Eifel]]. Unlike the production vehicles the prototypes had a [[tilting train|tilting systems]].\n\n=== Production units ===\nFull production by [[MAN SE]] and the ''Uerdingen Waggonfabrik'' began in 1973. The first series of 25 three-coach units was delivered at the time when so-called \"pop liveries\" were in vogue and so they were painted in stone-grey and orange. Immediately following the first batch were the 15 units of the second series delivered in 1975 and stabled at [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] locomotive depot. These were already painted in the new ocean blue and beige livery.\n\n=== Operations ===\n[[Image:Bahnhofsoltau001.JPG|thumb|614 at Soltau station]]\nThere are a total of 42 Class 614 three-car units, which are stationed at [[Nuremberg]] and Brunswick. In the early years, Trier was also a base for these DMUs. The Brunswick 614's have mainly worked in the [[Harz]] and [[Weser Uplands]] since their introduction. In doing so they often ran on former East-West trunk lines, which lost their significance after the [[partition of Germany]]. The most important termini were [[Altenbeken]], [[Bad Harzburg]], [[Bad Lauterberg]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[Bodenburg]], [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Hamelin]], [[Hildesheim]], [[Kreiensen]], [[L\u00f6hne]], [[Northeim]], Ottbergen, [[Paderborn]], [[Salzgitter]]-Lebenstedt, and [[Walkenried]]. During some timetable periods they also called at [[Lemgo]], [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Nordhausen]], [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], [[Oldenburg]], [[Rahden]], [[Uelzen]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]]. Currently the units all operate in the standard configuration as three-car multiples, whereas in former years they were frequently run as just two-car units or sometimes in fours. Quite often they formed part of mixed multiples, for example: 614+914+934+634. Meanwhile, following the transfer of numerous lines to private firms as a result of competition, and the delivery of the Class 648.25 to [[DB Regio]], the Brunswick DMUs have largely withdrawn from these classic routes. \nInstead they have been used on atypical routes, like e.g. [[Leer]] - [[Nieuweschans]], [[Emden Hbf]] - [[Emden]]-Au\u00dfenhafen, [[Minden]] - [[Rotenburg (W\u00fcmme)|Rotenburg]], Uelzen - [[Bremen]] and [[Hanover]] \u2013 [[Soltau]] - [[Buchholz in der Nordheide|Buchholz]], although currently only the last two routes are still worked by them. The Brunswick Class 628's freed up from other locations were expected to replace the remaining 614's during 2008. Several vehicles have already been set aside and scrapped, several were moved to [[Hamm]] Rbf and are hoping for a better future there.\n\nThe Nuremberg 614's are underway in the [[Upper Palatinate]] (''Oberpfalz'') and in [[Franconia]] (''Franken''), working such routes as [[Forchheim]]\u2013[[Ebermannstadt]], [[F\u00fcrth]]\u2013[[Cadolzburg]], F\u00fcrth\u2013[[Markt Erlbach]] and Nuremberg\u2013[[Simmelsdorf]]-H\u00fcttenbach/[[Neuhaus an der Pegnitz]]. Here too only three-coach trains are used, whilst previously several 934's were stationed at Nuremberg in order to be able to form four-car multiples. These formations were not liked by drivers because the lack of engine power on the 614 was only too obvious on inclines. The use of the Nuremberg VT 614's is coming to an end, because in December 2008 new VT 648s were to be used on most of the routes in the Nuremberg diesel network.\n\nA number of class 614 units have been sold on to [[C\u0103ile_Ferate_Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]] in [[Romania]], where they form CFR's Class 76. Some have been partially rebuilt by [[Remarul_16_Februarie]] with new driver's cabs and MTU powerplants.\n\n== Differences from 624/634 ==\nEven though their external appearance is somewhat different, the variations between Classes 614 and 624 are not that great. The following sections describe their main differences; in all other respects the classes are the same.\n\n=== Running gear ===\nThe [[bogies]] were slightly changed. They are supported, as on the 634's, by air bags, but are controlled by 4 air suspension valves on each coach (apart from 614 001 to 004). The resulting four-point support changes over to a three-point support at speeds below 25&nbsp;km/h using a pressure control on the wheelset bearing, which deactivates one of the valves.\n\nInstead of the mechanical anti-skid system on the 624/634 the Class 614 has electronic anti-skid control.\n\n=== Engine ===\nThe D 3650 HM 12 U diesel engine from MAN is largely the same as that on the 624/634, but is driven at a higher final speed  of 2150 rpm and is rated at 370&nbsp;kW/500&nbsp;hp, but only set at 331&nbsp;kW/450&nbsp;hp (as is normal on the 624/634). The handpump fitted to many 624/634's for topping up the cooling water is not installed on the 614. The fan equipment for the coolant water system can be set to emergency operation by the driver should the fan valve fail, something which can only be done in a workshop on the 624/634.\n\n26 coaches (13 sets) have been equipped with new [[Cummins Engine|Cummins]] diesel engines in recent years. These engines have the considerably higher power of 448&nbsp;kW. However, this remotoring programme was stopped when the operational future of the Class 614 became markedly bleaker.\n\n=== Heating ===\nOn modernisation all 614's, and even the 914 centre coaches, were given a timer that enables the time to be set for coaches to be preheated. In this way their preparation time can be shortened. At the same time standard thermostat valves from trade were installed in the 1st class compartments.\n\n=== Door operation ===\nThe Class 614 has door control with [[selective door opening]] and door sensory systems. The doors, which on the 624/634 were not always easy to open, are assisted by [[compressed air]]. As part of modernisation in the mid-90s a warning tone device was retrofitted and - unlike the 624 - also an anti-jam system. Some of the vehicles also have warning lights in the area of the door. Shortly after the turn of the millennium several 614's were converted to TAV (''technikbasierte Abfertigungsverfahren'') automatic door operation. Door control computers were installed, door handles removed and replaced by door opening buttons and [[light curtain|photoelectric beams]]. Because the new door control system was not very reliable and the vehicles were approaching the end of their service life the TAV installation programme was halted after a few years, even befhore the end of the remotoring programme.\n\n=== Passenger information systems ===\nUntil their modernisation the 614's had the [[destination blind]]s familiar from the 624/634 series. These were later replaced by two electronic [[dot matrix display]]s on each VT coach. The control of all displays in the train was achieved by entering the destination code number into ''Brose'' entry devices that are installed on every driver's console. In addition several Nuremberg 614's were gieven early passenger information displays.\n\n=== Passenger areas ===\n[[File:Inneneinrichtung 614 2. Klasse.jpg|thumb|Interior of 614 002 after modernisation (31 March 2006)]]\nThe interior of the Class 614 always set it apart clearly from its older brethren. On delivery the coaches had adjustable seats with individual, fabric-covered cushions. The colour of the seat covers as well as the imitation leather arms and headrests varied, being either red-brown or green. The sides were screened with beige plastic. The 1st class compartment was largely the same as that on the 624/634. And whilst the interiors looked very smart, the colours were very much contemporary and were no longer up to date by the mid-1990s.\n\nDuring the course of the modernisation programme the 614's were given the first double-decker coaches delivered to the old Federal states and the y-coaches of well-known design with beige wall coverings and light green fabric-covered individual seats, some arranged facing each other, others all facing in the same direction. One unique feature is the folding table at every seat, some of which are now missing as a result of vandalism. As on the 624/634 the luggage compartment behind the cab, together with its loading doors, was omitted. The 1st class compartments were given pink wall coverings, blue tables and blue, adjustable individual seats with red head cushions.\n\nThe last 914's to be modernised were each given two closed vacuum toilet systems, of which one is fitted for the disable. Later the remaining 914's were retrofitted with them.\n\n=== Livery ===\n[[Image:614022-135-01.jpg|thumb|614 + 934 + 934 + 614<br>F\u00fcrth (Bay) Hbf, June 1987]]\nThe first series to be delivered, which went to Nuremberg depot, were painted in the contemporary 'pop' colour scheme. This was later changed on the 614 to a blood orange window stripe on a gravel grey background. This livery was retained until the coaches were modernised. The second series, delivered to Brunswick depot, was supplied in ocean-blue and beige. Unlike the 624/634 the 614 was given an additional thin blue decorative stripe above the line dividing the colours which lent the vehicles a more dynamic appearance. Almost all 614s were initially painted light grey and mint green for the redesign and, later on, traffic red and white. The only exception is unit 614 005 + 914 003 + 614 006 which was painted in gravel grey and orange on modernisation and preserved the 'pop' colour scheme into the new millennium. All other vehicles have since been repainted in the current scheme of traffic red and white.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Citations==\n* {{cite book |last=Garvin |first=Brian |title=German Railways: The Complete Guide to All Locomotives and Multiple Units of Deutsche Bahn \u2013 Part 1: Locomotives & Multiple Units of Deutsche Bahn |date=2013 | edition=5| location=Sheffield, UK |publisher=Platform 5 Publishing |isbn=978-1-9094-3103-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAJcngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:ISBN1909431184 |ref=harv}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]]\n* [[Deutsche Bahn]]\n* [[List of Deutsche Bundesbahn locomotives and railbuses]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat|DBAG Class 614|DB Class 614}}\n* [http://www.baureihe614.de/ Class 614/624/634]\n\n\n{{German DMUs}}\n\n[[Category:Diesel multiple units of Germany|614]]\n", "name_user": "Flummi-2011", "label": "safe", "comment": "Link corr.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB_Class_614"}

She is the elder daughter of [[Frank Sinatra]] and Nancy ({{n\u00e9e}} Barbato) Sinatra, and is widely known for her 1966 [[signature song|signature hit]] \"[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]{{-\"}}.\n\nOther defining recordings include \"[[Sugar Town]]\", the 1967 number one \"[[Somethin' Stupid]]\" (a duet with her father), [[You Only Live Twice (song)|the title song]] from the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', several collaborations with [[Lee Hazlewood]] such as \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]\", \"[[Summer Wine]]\" and her cover of [[Cher]]'s \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]\". Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] number-one hit with \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin{{'\"}}. She appeared on TV in high boots, and with colorfully dressed [[Go-go dancing|go-go dancers]], creating a popular and enduring image of the [[Swinging Sixties]].<ref name=KLSmith/><ref name=SLeigh/> The song was written by [[Lee Hazlewood]], who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including \"[[Some Velvet Morning]]\". In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured [[Billy Strange]] as arranger and conductor.\n\nSinatra also had a brief acting career in the mid-1960s, including a co-starring role with [[Elvis Presley]] in the movie ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'', and with [[Peter Fonda]] in ''[[The Wild Angels]]''. In ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]'', Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter.\n\n==Early life==\nSinatra was born on June 8, 1940, in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. She is the eldest of the three children [[Frank Sinatra]] had by his first wife, Nancy Barbato (1917\u20132018).
