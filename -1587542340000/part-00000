Referenced from ''Male Desire: The Homoerotic in American Art'' by Jonathan Weinberg</ref>]]\n\n===Early modern in the United States===\n[[Homoeroticism]] has been present in photography and film since their invention. During much of that time, any sexual depiction had to remain [[Subculture|underground]] because of [[obscenity]] laws. In particular, gay material might constitute evidence of an illegal act under [[sodomy law]]s in many jurisdictions. This is no longer the case in the United States, since such laws were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2003 in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.\n\nHowever, hardcore pornographic motion pictures (''stag films,'' as they were called prior to their legalization in 1970) were produced relatively early in the history of film. The first known pornographic film appears to have been made in Europe in 1908. The earliest known film to depict hardcore gay (and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]) sexual activity was the [[Cinema of France|French film]] ''[[Le m\u00e9nage moderne du Madame Butterfly]]'', produced and released in 1920.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0213916|title=Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly}}</ref> Most historians consider the first American stag film to be ''[[A Free Ride]]'',<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0218277|title=A Free Ride}}</ref> produced and released in 1915.<ref>Knight, Arthur, and Alpert, Hollis. \"The Stag Film.\" ''Playboy.''

Pornography in the 1940s and 1950s focused on athletic men or [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] in statuesque poses. They were generally young, muscular, and with little or no visible body hair. These pictures were sold in physique magazines, also known as [[beefcake magazine]]s, allowing the reader to pass as a fitness enthusiast.\n\nThe [[Athletic Model Guild]] (AMG), founded by photographer [[Bob Mizer]] in 1945 in Los Angeles, was arguably the first studio to commercially produce material specifically for gay men and published the first magazine known as ''[[Physique Pictorial]]'' in 1951. [[Tom of Finland]] drawings are featured in many issues.<ref>Ramakers, Mischa. ''Dirty Pictures: Tom of Finland, Masculinity and Homosexuality.'' New York: Saint Martin's Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-312-20526-0}}</ref> Mizer produced about a million images, and thousands of films and videos before he died on May 12, 1992. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the advent of [[16 mm film]] cameras enabled these photographers to produce underground movies of gay sex, male [[masturbation]], or both. Sales of these products were either by mail-order or through more discreet channels. Some of the early gay pornographers would travel around the country selling their photographs and films out of their hotel rooms, with advertising only through word of mouth and magazine ads.\n\nThe 1960s were also a period where many underground art-film makers integrated suggestive or overtly gay content in their work. [[Kenneth Anger]]'s ''[[Scorpio Rising (film)|Scorpio Rising]]'' (1963), [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''[[Blow Job (1963 film)|Blow Job]]'' (1963) and ''My Hustler'' (1965), or [[Paul Morrissey]]'s ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'' (1968) are examples of [[experimental film]]s that are known to have influenced further gay pornographic films with their formal qualities and narratives. Also of note is [[Joe Dallesandro]], who acted in hardcore gay pornographic films in his early 20s,<ref name=Burger/> posed nude for [[Francesco Scavullo]], [[Bruce Bellas|Bruce of L.A.]] and Bob Mizer, and later acted for Warhol in films such as ''Flesh''. Dallesandro was well-known to the public. In 1969 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called him one of the most beautiful people of the 1960s, and he appeared on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in April 1971.<ref name=Ferguson1998>{{Cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Michael |year=1998 |title=Little Joe, superstar : the films of Joe Dallesandro |publisher=Companion Press |isbn=978-1-889138-09-1 |postscript=<!--None-->|oclc=39901459 }}</ref> Dallesandro also appeared on the cover of The Smiths' eponymous debut album, ''[[The Smiths (album)|The Smiths]].''\n\n===Sexual revolution===\nDuring the 1960s, a series of [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] rulings created a more liberalized legal environment that allowed the commercialization of pornography. ''[[MANual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day]]''<ref>{{ussc|name=MANual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day|volume=370|page=478|pin=|year=1962}}.</ref> was the first decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that magazines consisting largely of photographs of nude or near-nude male models are not obscene within the meaning of \u00a7 1461. It was the first case in which the Court engaged in plenary review of a [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]] order holding obscene matter \"nonmailable.\"<ref>370 U.S. at 495\u2013496.</ref> The case is notable for its ruling that photographs of nude men are not obscene, an implication which opened up the U.S. Postal Service to nude male [[pornographic magazine]]s, especially those catering to gay men.<ref name=Waugh/>\n\n[[Wakefield Poole]]'s ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'', starring [[Casey Donovan (actor)|Casey Donovan]], was the first gay pornographic feature film, along with the works of filmmakers such as [[Pat Rocco]] and the Park Theatre, Los Angeles, California, circa 1970. In fact, it was the first pornographic feature film of any sort. ''Boys in the Sand'' opened in a theater in New York City in December 1971 and played to a packed house with record-breaking box office receipts, preceding ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', the first commercial straight pornography film in America, which opened in June 1972. This success launched gay pornographic film as a popular phenomenon.<ref name=Burger/>\n\nThe production of gay pornography films expanded during the 1970s. A few studios released films for the growing number of gay [[adult movie theater|adult movie theatres]], where men could also have sexual encounters. Often, the films reflected the sexual liberation that gay men were experiencing at the time, depicting the numerous public spaces where men engaged in sex: [[gay bathhouse|bathhouses]], [[sex club]]s, beaches, etc.\n\n[[Peter Berlin]]'s 1973 film ''Nights in Black Leather'' was the first major pornographic film designed to appeal to the gay [[leather subculture]] and drew some mainstream gays into this culture.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s also saw the rise of gay publishing with ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]'' and ''Michael's Thing''. During this time many more magazines were founded, including ''In Touch'' and ''[[Blueboy (magazine)|Blueboy]].'' ''[[Playgirl]]'', ostensibly produced for women, was purchased and enjoyed by gay men and feature full frontal nudity (the posing straps and fig leaves were removed).\n\nGay pornography of the 1950s through the production date of the movie is reviewed, with many excerpts, in [[Fred Halsted]]'s documentary ''[[Erotikus: A History of the Gay Movie]] (1974).\n\n=== 1970\u20131985 ===\nFrom 1970\u20131985, commercial gay pornography was just getting set up to become the large industry that it is today.<ref name=Escoffier>{{cite journal|last=Escoffier|first=Jeffrey|year=2003|title=Gay-for-Pay: Straight Men and the Making of Gay Pornography|journal=Qualitative Sociology|doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000005056.46990.c0|volume=26|issue=4|pages=531\u2013555}}</ref> Because it was in the fledgling stage, it recruited actors from the only network it had access to: the gay community.<ref name=Escoffier/> Even among members of the gay community, people willing to act in gay porn were hard to come by due to the social stigma and implicated social risk of being publicly out.<ref name=Escoffier/>\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s were a period of transition for gay pornography film. The proliferation of [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] made pornography videos easily accessible, and, as their prices fell, the market for home videos aimed at adult viewers became more and more lucrative. By the mid-1980s, the standard was to release pornography movies directly on video, which meant the wide disappearance of pornography theaters. Furthermore, video recording being more affordable, a multitude of producers entered the market, making low-budget pornography videos.\n\nThis shift from watching pornography as a public activity to doing so in private was also influenced by the discovery of HIV and the subsequent AIDS crisis. Public spaces for sex, such as theatres, became less attended when in the early 1980s it became a much riskier behavior. Masturbatory activities in the privacy of the home became a [[safe sex]] practice in the midst of this health crisis.\n\n[[Gay movies]] of the 1970s had contained some exploration of novel ways to represent the sexual act. In the 1980s, by contrast, all movies seemed to be made under an unwritten set of rules and conventions. Most scenes would start with a few lines of dialogue, have performers engage in [[foreplay]] ([[fellatio]]), followed by [[Anal sex|anal penetration]], and ending with a visual climax [[close-up]] of [[Ejaculation|ejaculating]] [[human penis|penises]], called a ''money shot'' or ''[[cum shot]].'' Video technology allowed the recording of longer scenes than did the costly [[film stock]]. Scenes were often composed of extended [[footage]] of the same act filmed from different [[shot (filmmaking)|shots]] using multiple cameras. The quality of the picture and sound were often very poor.\n\nMajor directors such as Matt Sterling, Eric Peterson, John Travis, and [[William Higgins (director)|William Higgins]] set the standard for the models of the decade. The performers they cast were especially young, usually appearing to be around the ages of 22 or 23. Their bodies were slender and hairless, of the \"swimmer's build\" type, which contrasted with the older, bigger, and hairier man of the 1970s' gay pornography. Performer roles also evolved into the tight divisions of [[top, bottom and versatile|''tops'' and ''bottoms'']]. The ''top'' in [[anal sex]] is the penetrating partner, who, in these films, typically has a more muscular body and the larger penis. The ''bottom,'' or receiver of anal sex, in the films is often smaller and sometimes more [[effeminacy|effeminate]]. The stars of the decade were almost always tops, while the bottoms were interchangeable (with the exception of [[Joey Stefano]], a popular star, who was more of a ''bottom.'')\n\nThis strict division between ''tops'' and ''bottoms'' may have reflected a preference by some of the popular directors of the decade to hire heterosexual men for their movies. Heterosexual men who perform gay sex for monetary reasons (commonly labeled ''[[gay-for-pay]]'') were considered a rare commodity in the gay sex trade, but the biggest producers of the decade could afford them. Many critics attributed the conventionalization of gay pornography of the 1980s to this trend.\n\n=== After 1985 ===\n1985 was a pivotal year for gay porn because by then, the market had grown enough to make it a desirable field of work for not only gay men but also straight men. According to one estimate by porn director Chi Chi Larue, 60% of the actors in gay porn are actually straight. This incidence of straight men in gay porn is known as gay-for-pay and the ethics behind it and implications of it are highly disputed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Escoffier | first1 = Jeffrey | year = 2003 | title = Gay-for-Pay: Straight Men and the Making of Gay Pornography | journal = Qualitative Sociology | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 531\u2013555 | doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000005056.46990.c0}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Fluffer on set.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|A [[fluffer]] on set of a gay pornographic movie. Fluffers help actors get and keep an erection for their scene. As the gay pornography industry has grown, so have unique jobs related to the production and distribution.]]\nThe gay pornography industry diversified steadily during the 1990s.\n\nIn 1989, director [[Kristen Bjorn]] started a pornographic business which was considered as setting a standard for gay pornography producers. He was a professional photographer, and the images in his videos were considered to be of high-quality. As a former porn star himself, he directed his models with care, which helped improved the actors' believability. Other directors had to improve their technical quality to keep up with demands from their audiences.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAnother significant change during this decade was the explosion of the [[niche market]]. Many videos began to be produced for viewers with specific tastes (i.e. for [[amateur pornography]], military (men in uniform) pornography, [[Transgender pornography|transgender]] performers, [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] fetishes, performers belonging to specific [[ethnic group]]s, etc.), and this led to a diversification of the people involved in pornography production and consumption.\n\nThe gay pornography industry grew substantially in popularity during the 1990s, evolving into a complex and interactive subculture. Professional directors (such as [[Chi Chi LaRue]] and John Rutherford), technicians or deck operators during the [[U-matic]] phase of video technology, and performers started to engage in pornography as a career, their work sustained by emerging pornographic media and influential critics, such as Mikey Skee.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Van Darkholme 2.JPG|thumb|[[Vietnamese American]] gay pornographic actor, film director, and photographer [[Van Darkholme]] is among the few Asian American men working in Western gay porn as a director and actor.<ref>[http://bnmagazine.com/article_detail.php?art_id=257 BN Magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505190735/http://www.bnmagazine.com/article_detail.php?art_id=257 |date=May 5, 2007 }} feature (vietnamese American magazine)</ref>]]\n[[File:Blatino Erotica Awards.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Photo taken during the 2010 [[Blatino Erotica Awards]].]]\nIn the 21st century, gay pornography has become a highly profitable enterprise, ranging from the \"straight-guy\" pornography of [[Active Duty (web site)|Active Duty]] and [[Sean Cody]], to the '[[twink (gay slang)|twinks]]' of [[BelAmi]]. Many niche genres and online delivery sites cater to various and changing interests. For instance much of [[Van Darkholme]]'s work contains [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and particularly [[Japanese bondage|shibari]], the Japanese art of bondage and knot-tying, a specialty within [[BDSM]] cultures.\n\nOn the other hand, [[Lucas Kazan Productions]] successfully adapted literary classics: ''Decameron: Two Naughty Tales'' is based on two novels by Boccaccio, ''The Innkeeper'' on Goldoni's ''La Locandiera''. [[Lucas Kazan]] also found inspiration in 19th and 20th century operas, combining gay porn and melodrama: ''[[School for Lovers (2006 film)|The School for Lovers]]'', 2007 [[GayVN]] Award Winner for Best Foreign Picture, is in fact inspired by Mozart's ''Cos\u00ec fan tutte''.\n\nSome controversy currently exists regarding studios that produce [[bareback (sex)|bareback]] videos (videos of sexual penetration by the penis without a condom).<ref name=hivscandalbbc/> Mainstream companies, such as [[Falcon Entertainment]], [[Hot House Entertainment]], Channel 1 Releasing, Lucas Entertainment, [[Raging Stallion Studios]], [[Lucas Kazan Productions]] and [[Titan Media]] and [[LGBT]] health advocates assert that condomless videos promote unsafe sex and contribute to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, both in the pornography industry and in the gay community as a whole.<ref name=hivscandalbbc/> The controversy dates back to the first few years of the HIV crisis, when nearly all gay pornography production companies voluntarily required their models to wear condoms for anal sex.\n\nThe premise of industry figures, notably [[Chi Chi LaRue]], is that gay pornography serves as a leading forum for teaching safer sex skills and modelling healthy sexual behaviors.<ref name=hivscandalbbc>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7277000.stm|title=HIV scandal in gay porn industry|first=Madeleine|last=Holt|work=BBC|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}</ref> At least one bareback studio agrees that porn should promote healthy sexual behaviors, but disagrees on the definition of ''healthy'' in this context: speaking about the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] crisis, [[Treasure Island Media]] owner and founder [[Paul Morris (producer)|Paul Morris]] has expressed his belief that, \"To a great extent, the current gay mindset surrounding HIV is a result of a generation of men living with PTSD and not getting the support and help they need now that the war is over.

Viewers of gay porn in a survey by Escoffier reported a preference for authentic porn, which they define as exhibiting both erections and orgasms.<ref name=Escoffier/> Escoffier argues if straight-identifying actors are able to deliver erections and orgasms to the set, their performance is classified as situational homosexuality; therefore, the porn itself is authentic gay porn.<ref name=Escoffier/> Simon and Gagnon examine authenticity through scripts, arguing that porn actors follow learned behavioral sex scripts, so no porn is any more or less authentic than any other porn.<ref name=Escoffier/>\n\nBecause the term \"gay-for-pay\" implies a motivation that is solely economic, Escoffier argues it is not a fitting title.<ref name=Escoffier/> Other reasons certain gay-for-pay actors report for their career choice include latent homosexual fantasy and curiosity.<ref name=Escoffier/>\n\nAmong gay-for-pay actors, there is divided preference for the performance roles of top vs. bottom.<ref name=Escoffier/> It is common for gay-for-pay porn actors to start out as tops before they eventually give in to fan and industry pressure to shoot a scene or more as a bottom.<ref name=Escoffier/> Gay-for-pay actors are typically more comfortable being tops because the role of top is analogous to the \"less gay\" penetrator role of the man in straight sex.<ref name=Escoffier/> On the other hand, some gay-for-pay porn actors prefer to act as bottoms because they can do so without maintaining an erection.<ref name=Escoffier/> The implication here is that they are not even necessarily aroused during sex, making this the \"less gay\" of the two positions.<ref name=Escoffier/>\n\nEven though they are acting in gay porn, some gay-for-pay actors hold [[Homophobia|homophobic]] views, causing tension in the workplace.<ref name=Escoffier/> Additionally, gay actors often find it difficult to perform with straight actors due to the lack of attraction.<ref name=Escoffier/> Tommy Cruise, a bisexual actor in gay porn, is quoted saying, \"A lot of straight guys, they don't even want me touching them.

As awareness of the risk of AIDS developed, pornography producers came under pressure to use condoms, both for the health of the performers and to serve as role models for their viewers.  By the early 1990s new pornographic videos usually featured the use of condoms for anal sex.  However, beginning in the 1990s, an increasing number of studios have been devoted to the production of new films featuring men engaging in unprotected sex.<ref name=hivscandalbbc /> For example, [[San Francisco]]-based studio [[Treasure Island Media]], whose work focuses in this area, has produced bareback films since 1999. Other companies that do so include SEVP and [[Eurocreme]]. Mainstream gay pornographic studios such as [[Kristen Bjorn]] Productions have featured the occasional bareback scene, such as in \"El Rancho\" between performers who are real-life partners. Other studios such as [[Falcon Entertainment]] have also reissued older pre-condom films.<ref>\"Bareback Classics\" (FVS 301) is an example of such a re-issue by Falcon.</ref> Also, mainstream studios that consistently use condoms for anal sex scenes may sometimes choose editing techniques that make the presence of condoms somewhat ambiguous and less visually evident, and thus may encourage viewers to fantasize that barebacking is taking place, even though the performers are following safer-sex protocols. (In contrast, some mainstream directors are conscientious about using close-up shots of condom packets being opened, etc., to help clearly establish for the viewer that the sex is not bareback.)\n\nSome scholars argue that while \"barebacking\" and \"UAI\" technically both mean the same thing, they have different undertones.<ref name=Mowlabocus>{{cite journal|last1=Mowlabocus|first1=Sharif|last2=Harbottle|first2=Justin|last3=Witzel|first3=Charlie|year=2014|title=What We Can't See?

During much of that time, any sexual depiction had to remain [[Subculture|underground]] because of [[obscenity]] laws. In particular, gay material might constitute evidence of an illegal act under [[sodomy law]]s in many jurisdictions. This is no longer the case in the United States, since such laws were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2003 in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.\n\nHowever, hardcore pornographic motion pictures (''stag films,'' as they were called prior to their legalization in 1970) were produced relatively early in the history of film. The first known pornographic film appears to have been made in Europe in 1908. The earliest known film to depict hardcore gay (and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]) sexual activity was the [[Cinema of France|French film]] ''[[Le m\u00e9nage moderne du Madame Butterfly]]'', produced and released in 1920.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0213916|title=Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly}}</ref> Most historians consider the first American stag film to be ''[[A Free Ride]]'',<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0218277|title=A Free Ride}}</ref> produced and released in 1915.<ref>Knight, Arthur, and Alpert, Hollis. \"The Stag Film.\" ''Playboy.''

Pornography in the 1940s and 1950s focused on athletic men or [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] in statuesque poses. They were generally young, muscular, and with little or no visible body hair. These pictures were sold in physique magazines, also known as [[beefcake magazine]]s, allowing the reader to pass as a fitness enthusiast.\n\nThe [[Athletic Model Guild]] (AMG), founded by photographer [[Bob Mizer]] in 1945 in Los Angeles, was arguably the first studio to commercially produce material specifically for gay men and published the first magazine known as ''[[Physique Pictorial]]'' in 1951. [[Tom of Finland]] drawings are featured in many issues.<ref>Ramakers, Mischa. ''Dirty Pictures: Tom of Finland, Masculinity and Homosexuality.'' New York: Saint Martin's Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-312-20526-0}}</ref> Mizer produced about a million images, and thousands of films and videos before he died on May 12, 1992. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the advent of [[16 mm film]] cameras enabled these photographers to produce underground movies of gay sex, male [[masturbation]], or both. Sales of these products were either by mail-order or through more discreet channels. Some of the early gay pornographers would travel around the country selling their photographs and films out of their hotel rooms, with advertising only through word of mouth and magazine ads.\n\nThe 1960s were also a period where many underground art-film makers integrated suggestive or overtly gay content in their work. [[Kenneth Anger]]'s ''[[Scorpio Rising (film)|Scorpio Rising]]'' (1963), [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' (1964) and ''My Hustler'' (1965), or [[Paul Morrissey]]'s ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'' (1968) are examples of [[experimental film]]s that are known to have influenced further gay pornographic films with their formal qualities and narratives. Also of note is [[Joe Dallesandro]], who acted in hardcore gay pornographic films in his early 20s,<ref name=Burger/> posed nude for [[Francesco Scavullo]], [[Bruce Bellas|Bruce of L.A.]] and Bob Mizer, and later acted for Warhol in films such as ''Flesh''. Dallesandro was well-known to the public. In 1969 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called him one of the most beautiful people of the 1960s, and he appeared on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in April 1971.<ref name=Ferguson1998>{{Cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Michael |year=1998 |title=Little Joe, superstar : the films of Joe Dallesandro |publisher=Companion Press |isbn=978-1-889138-09-1 |postscript=<!--None-->|oclc=39901459 }}</ref> Dallesandro also appeared on the cover of The Smiths' eponymous debut album, ''[[The Smiths (album)|The Smiths]].''\n\n===Sexual revolution===\nDuring the 1960s, a series of [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] rulings created a more liberalized legal environment that allowed the commercialization of pornography. ''[[MANual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day]]''<ref>{{ussc|name=MANual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day|volume=370|page=478|pin=|year=1962}}.</ref> was the first decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that magazines consisting largely of photographs of nude or near-nude male models are not obscene within the meaning of \u00a7 1461. It was the first case in which the Court engaged in plenary review of a [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]] order holding obscene matter \"nonmailable.\"<ref>370 U.S. at 495\u2013496.</ref> The case is notable for its ruling that photographs of nude men are not obscene, an implication which opened up the U.S. Postal Service to nude male [[pornographic magazine]]s, especially those catering to gay men.<ref name=Waugh/>\n\n[[Wakefield Poole]]'s ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'', starring [[Casey Donovan (actor)|Casey Donovan]], was the first gay pornographic feature film, along with the works of filmmakers such as [[Pat Rocco]] and the Park Theatre, Los Angeles, California, circa 1970. In fact, it was the first pornographic feature film of any sort. ''Boys in the Sand'' opened in a theater in New York City in December 1971 and played to a packed house with record-breaking box office receipts, preceding ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', the first commercial straight pornography film in America, which opened in June 1972. This success launched gay pornographic film as a popular phenomenon.<ref name=Burger/>\n\nThe production of gay pornography films expanded during the 1970s. A few studios released films for the growing number of gay [[adult movie theater|adult movie theatres]], where men could also have sexual encounters. Often, the films reflected the sexual liberation that gay men were experiencing at the time, depicting the numerous public spaces where men engaged in sex: [[gay bathhouse|bathhouses]], [[sex club]]s, beaches, etc.\n\n[[Peter Berlin]]'s 1973 film ''Nights in Black Leather'' was the first major pornographic film designed to appeal to the gay [[leather subculture]] and drew some mainstream gays into this culture.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s also saw the rise of gay publishing with ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]'' and ''Michael's Thing''. During this time many more magazines were founded, including ''In Touch'' and ''[[Blueboy (magazine)|Blueboy]].'' ''[[Playgirl]]'', ostensibly produced for women, was purchased and enjoyed by gay men and feature full frontal nudity (the posing straps and fig leaves were removed).\n\nGay pornography of the 1950s through the production date of the movie is reviewed, with many excerpts, in [[Fred Halsted]]'s documentary ''[[Erotikus: A History of the Gay Movie]] (1974).\n\n=== 1970\u20131985 ===\nFrom 1970\u20131985, commercial gay pornography was just getting set up to become the large industry that it is today.<ref name=Escoffier>{{cite journal|last=Escoffier|first=Jeffrey|year=2003|title=Gay-for-Pay: Straight Men and the Making of Gay Pornography|journal=Qualitative Sociology|doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000005056.46990.c0|volume=26|issue=4|pages=531\u2013555}}</ref> Because it was in the fledgling stage, it recruited actors from the only network it had access to: the gay community.<ref name=Escoffier/> Even among members of the gay community, people willing to act in gay porn were hard to come by due to the social stigma and implicated social risk of being publicly out.<ref name=Escoffier/>\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s were a period of transition for gay pornography film. The proliferation of [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] made pornography videos easily accessible, and, as their prices fell, the market for home videos aimed at adult viewers became more and more lucrative. By the mid-1980s, the standard was to release pornography movies directly on video, which meant the wide disappearance of pornography theaters. Furthermore, video recording being more affordable, a multitude of producers entered the market, making low-budget pornography videos.\n\nThis shift from watching pornography as a public activity to doing so in private was also influenced by the discovery of HIV and the subsequent AIDS crisis. Public spaces for sex, such as theatres, became less attended when in the early 1980s it became a much riskier behavior. Masturbatory activities in the privacy of the home became a [[safe sex]] practice in the midst of this health crisis.\n\n[[Gay movies]] of the 1970s had contained some exploration of novel ways to represent the sexual act. In the 1980s, by contrast, all movies seemed to be made under an unwritten set of rules and conventions. Most scenes would start with a few lines of dialogue, have performers engage in [[foreplay]] ([[fellatio]]), followed by [[Anal sex|anal penetration]], and ending with a visual climax [[close-up]] of [[Ejaculation|ejaculating]] [[human penis|penises]], called a ''money shot'' or ''[[cum shot]].'' Video technology allowed the recording of longer scenes than did the costly [[film stock]]. Scenes were often composed of extended [[footage]] of the same act filmed from different [[shot (filmmaking)|shots]] using multiple cameras. The quality of the picture and sound were often very poor.\n\nMajor directors such as Matt Sterling, Eric Peterson, John Travis, and [[William Higgins (director)|William Higgins]] set the standard for the models of the decade. The performers they cast were especially young, usually appearing to be around the ages of 22 or 23. Their bodies were slender and hairless, of the \"swimmer's build\" type, which contrasted with the older, bigger, and hairier man of the 1970s' gay pornography. Performer roles also evolved into the tight divisions of [[top, bottom and versatile|''tops'' and ''bottoms'']]. The ''top'' in [[anal sex]] is the penetrating partner, who, in these films, typically has a more muscular body and the larger penis. The ''bottom,'' or receiver of anal sex, in the films is often smaller and sometimes more [[effeminacy|effeminate]]. The stars of the decade were almost always tops, while the bottoms were interchangeable (with the exception of [[Joey Stefano]], a popular star, who was more of a ''bottom.'')\n\nThis strict division between ''tops'' and ''bottoms'' may have reflected a preference by some of the popular directors of the decade to hire heterosexual men for their movies. Heterosexual men who perform gay sex for monetary reasons (commonly labeled ''[[gay-for-pay]]'') were considered a rare commodity in the gay sex trade, but the biggest producers of the decade could afford them. Many critics attributed the conventionalization of gay pornography of the 1980s to this trend.\n\n=== After 1985 ===\n1985 was a pivotal year for gay porn because by then, the market had grown enough to make it a desirable field of work for not only gay men but also straight men. According to one estimate by porn director Chi Chi Larue, 60% of the actors in gay porn are actually straight. This incidence of straight men in gay porn is known as gay-for-pay and the ethics behind it and implications of it are highly disputed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Escoffier | first1 = Jeffrey | year = 2003 | title = Gay-for-Pay: Straight Men and the Making of Gay Pornography | journal = Qualitative Sociology | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 531\u2013555 | doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000005056.46990.c0}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Fluffer on set.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|A [[fluffer]] on set of a gay pornographic movie.

As the gay pornography industry has grown, so have unique jobs related to the production and distribution.]]\nThe gay pornography industry diversified steadily during the 1990s.\n\nIn 1989, director [[Kristen Bjorn]] started a pornographic business which was considered as setting a standard for gay pornography producers. He was a professional photographer, and the images in his videos were considered to be of high-quality. As a former porn star himself, he directed his models with care, which helped improved the actors' believability. Other directors had to improve their technical quality to keep up with demands from their audiences.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAnother significant change during this decade was the explosion of the [[niche market]]. Many videos began to be produced for viewers with specific tastes (i.e. for [[amateur pornography]], military (men in uniform) pornography, [[Transgender pornography|transgender]] performers, [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] fetishes, performers belonging to specific [[ethnic group]]s, etc.), and this led to a diversification of the people involved in pornography production and consumption.\n\nThe gay pornography industry grew substantially in popularity during the 1990s, evolving into a complex and interactive subculture. Professional directors (such as [[Chi Chi LaRue]] and John Rutherford), technicians or deck operators during the [[U-matic]] phase of video technology, and performers started to engage in pornography as a career, their work sustained by emerging pornographic media and influential critics, such as Mikey Skee.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Van Darkholme 2.JPG|thumb|[[Vietnamese American]] gay pornographic actor, film director, and photographer [[Van Darkholme]] is among the few Asian American men working in Western gay porn as a director and actor.<ref>[http://bnmagazine.com/article_detail.php?art_id=257 BN Magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505190735/http://www.bnmagazine.com/article_detail.php?art_id=257 |date=May 5, 2007 }} feature (vietnamese American magazine)</ref>]]\n[[File:Blatino Erotica Awards.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Photo taken during the 2010 [[Blatino Erotica Awards]].]]\nIn the 21st century, gay pornography has become a highly profitable enterprise, ranging from the \"straight-guy\" pornography of [[Active Duty (web site)|Active Duty]] and [[Sean Cody]], to the '[[twink (gay slang)|twinks]]' of [[BelAmi]]. Many niche genres and online delivery sites cater to various and changing interests. For instance much of [[Van Darkholme]]'s work contains [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and particularly [[Japanese bondage|shibari]], the Japanese art of bondage and knot-tying, a specialty within [[BDSM]] cultures.\n\nOn the other hand, [[Lucas Kazan Productions]] successfully adapted literary classics: ''Decameron: Two Naughty Tales'' is based on two novels by Boccaccio, ''The Innkeeper'' on Goldoni's ''La Locandiera''. [[Lucas Kazan]] also found inspiration in 19th and 20th century operas, combining gay porn and melodrama: ''[[School for Lovers (2006 film)|The School for Lovers]]'', 2007 [[GayVN]] Award Winner for Best Foreign Picture, is in fact inspired by Mozart's ''Cos\u00ec fan tutte''.\n\nSome controversy currently exists regarding studios that produce [[bareback (sex)|bareback]] videos (videos of sexual penetration by the penis without a condom).<ref name=hivscandalbbc/> Mainstream companies, such as [[Falcon Entertainment]], [[Hot House Entertainment]], Channel 1 Releasing, Lucas Entertainment, [[Raging Stallion Studios]], [[Lucas Kazan Productions]] and [[Titan Media]] and [[LGBT]] health advocates assert that condomless videos promote unsafe sex and contribute to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, both in the pornography industry and in the gay community as a whole.<ref name=hivscandalbbc/> The controversy dates back to the first few years of the HIV crisis, when nearly all gay pornography production companies voluntarily required their models to wear condoms for anal sex.\n\nThe premise of industry figures, notably [[Chi Chi LaRue]], is that gay pornography serves as a leading forum for teaching safer sex skills and modelling healthy sexual behaviors.<ref name=hivscandalbbc>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7277000.stm|title=HIV scandal in gay porn industry|first=Madeleine|last=Holt|work=BBC|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}</ref> At least one bareback studio agrees that porn should promote healthy sexual behaviors, but disagrees on the definition of ''healthy'' in this context: speaking about the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] crisis, [[Treasure Island Media]] owner and founder [[Paul Morris (producer)|Paul Morris]] has expressed his belief that, \"To a great extent, the current gay mindset surrounding HIV is a result of a generation of men living with PTSD and not getting the support and help they need now that the war is over.

Viewers of gay porn in a survey by Escoffier reported a preference for authentic porn, which they define as exhibiting both erections and orgasms.<ref name=Escoffier/> Escoffier argues if straight-identifying actors are able to deliver erections and orgasms to the set, their performance is classified as situational homosexuality; therefore, the porn itself is authentic gay porn.<ref name=Escoffier/> Simon and Gagnon examine authenticity through scripts, arguing that porn actors follow learned behavioral sex scripts, so no porn is any more or less authentic than any other porn.<ref name=Escoffier/>\n\nBecause the term \"gay-for-pay\" implies a motivation that is solely economic, Escoffier argues it is not a fitting title.<ref name=Escoffier/> Other reasons certain gay-for-pay actors report for their career choice include latent homosexual fantasy and curiosity.<ref name=Escoffier/>\n\nAmong gay-for-pay actors, there is divided preference for the performance roles of top vs. bottom.<ref name=Escoffier/> It is common for gay-for-pay porn actors to start out as tops before they eventually give in to fan and industry pressure to shoot a scene or more as a bottom.<ref name=Escoffier/> Gay-for-pay actors are typically more comfortable being tops because the role of top is analogous to the \"less gay\" penetrator role of the man in straight sex.<ref name=Escoffier/> On the other hand, some gay-for-pay porn actors prefer to act as bottoms because they can do so without maintaining an erection.<ref name=Escoffier/> The implication here is that they are not even necessarily aroused during sex, making this the \"less gay\" of the two positions.<ref name=Escoffier/>\n\nEven though they are acting in gay porn, some gay-for-pay actors hold [[Homophobia|homophobic]] views, causing tension in the workplace.<ref name=Escoffier/> Additionally, gay actors often find it difficult to perform with straight actors due to the lack of attraction.<ref name=Escoffier/> Tommy Cruise, a bisexual actor in gay porn, is quoted saying, \"A lot of straight guys, they don't even want me touching them.

As awareness of the risk of AIDS developed, pornography producers came under pressure to use condoms, both for the health of the performers and to serve as role models for their viewers.  By the early 1990s new pornographic videos usually featured the use of condoms for anal sex.  However, beginning in the 1990s, an increasing number of studios have been devoted to the production of new films featuring men engaging in unprotected sex.<ref name=hivscandalbbc /> For example, [[San Francisco]]-based studio [[Treasure Island Media]], whose work focuses in this area, has produced bareback films since 1999. Other companies that do so include SEVP and [[Eurocreme]]. Mainstream gay pornographic studios such as [[Kristen Bjorn]] Productions have featured the occasional bareback scene, such as in \"El Rancho\" between performers who are real-life partners. Other studios such as [[Falcon Entertainment]] have also reissued older pre-condom films.<ref>\"Bareback Classics\" (FVS 301) is an example of such a re-issue by Falcon.</ref> Also, mainstream studios that consistently use condoms for anal sex scenes may sometimes choose editing techniques that make the presence of condoms somewhat ambiguous and less visually evident, and thus may encourage viewers to fantasize that barebacking is taking place, even though the performers are following safer-sex protocols. (In contrast, some mainstream directors are conscientious about using close-up shots of condom packets being opened, etc., to help clearly establish for the viewer that the sex is not bareback.)\n\nSome scholars argue that while \"barebacking\" and \"UAI\" technically both mean the same thing, they have different undertones.<ref name=Mowlabocus>{{cite journal|last1=Mowlabocus|first1=Sharif|last2=Harbottle|first2=Justin|last3=Witzel|first3=Charlie|year=2014|title=What We Can't See?

The [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Great Britain in the late 1700s and new ideas emerged about free markets, such as Adam Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776). Free trade became a central principle that Britain practiced by the 1840s.

Even outside its formal empire, Britain controlled trade with many countries such as China, [[Thailand|Siam]], and Argentina.

Land wars fought between the major powers include the [[Crimean War]], the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]], the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Franco-Prussian War]], as well as numerous conflicts between lesser powers. The Royal Navy prosecuted the [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842) and [[Second Opium War]] (1856{{ndash}}1860) against [[Qing dynasty|Imperial China]].

Alongside the formal control exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled access to many regions, such as [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. The British also, much to the dismay of other colonial empires, helped the [[United States]] uphold the [[Monroe Doctrine]] which helped maintain peace within [[Americas|the Americas]]. British merchants, shippers and bankers had such an overwhelming advantage over everyone else that in addition to its colonies it had an \"[[informal empire]]\".<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;8.</ref><ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;156\u201357.</ref><ref>[[#refCameron1991|Cameron]], pp.&nbsp;45-47.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom#1814\u20131914|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Timeline of British diplomatic history#1815\u20131860}}\nAfter losing the American colonies in the [[American Revolution]], Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific and later Africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the [[Second British Empire]] (1783\u20131815). The [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Great Britain in the late 1700s and new ideas emerged about free markets, such as Adam Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776). Free trade became a central principle that Britain practiced by the 1840s. It played a key role in Britain's [[European Miracle|economic growth]] and [[Global financial system#Emergence of financial globalization: 1870\u20131914|financial dominance]].<ref name=\"refDarwin2012\">[[#refDarwin2012|Darwin]], p.&nbsp;391.</ref>\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the British Empire (as of 1910)]]\n\nFrom the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 until [[World War I]] in 1914, the United Kingdom played the role of global [[Hegemony|hegemon]] (most powerful actor).  Imposition of a \"British Peace\" on key maritime trade routes began in 1815 with the annexation of [[British Ceylon#Kandyan Wars|British Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka).<ref name=\"refCrawfurd1830\">[[#refCrawfurd1830|Crawfurd]], pp.&nbsp;191\u2013192: \"...for what purpose was it conquered and is it now retained?'

Britain imposed an anti-piracy treaty, known as the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820]], on all Arab rulers in the region. By signing the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 1853, Arab rulers gave up their right to wage war at sea in return for British protection against external threats.<ref>{{cite web|title=The British in the Gulf: An Overview|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/british-gulf-overview|website=Qatar Digital Library|publisher=British Library Qatar Foundation Partnership|accessdate=25 October 2014|quote=The increased stability that this 'Pax Britannica' brought led to increased volumes of trade in the region. Ruling families began to actively seek British protection as a means of securing their rule and safeguarding their territories.}}</ref> The global superiority of [[British Armed Forces|British military]] and commerce was aided by a divided and relatively weak continental Europe, and the presence of the [[Royal Navy]] on all of the world's oceans and seas. Even outside its formal empire, Britain controlled trade with many countries such as China, [[Thailand|Siam]], and Argentina. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] the British Empire's economic strength continued to develop through naval dominance<ref>[[#refPugh99|Pugh]], p.&nbsp;83.</ref> and diplomatic efforts to maintain a [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] in continental Europe.<ref name=\"refThackeray2002\">[[#refThackeray2002|Thackeray]], p.&nbsp;57.</ref>\n\nIn this era, the Royal Navy provided services around the world that benefited other nations, such as the [[Piracy#History|suppression of piracy]] and [[Blockade of Africa|blocking the slave trade]]. The [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] had banned the trade across the British Empire, after which the Royal Navy established the [[West Africa Squadron]] and the government negotiated [[Abolition of slavery timeline#1800\u20131849|international treaties]] under which they could enforce the ban.<ref name=\"refFalola2007\">[[#refFalola2007|Falola]], pp.&nbsp;xxi, xxxiii-xxxiv.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels by the Royal Navy|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS}}</ref> Sea power, however, did not project on land. Land wars fought between the major powers include the [[Crimean War]], the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]], the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Franco-Prussian War]], as well as numerous conflicts between lesser powers. The Royal Navy prosecuted the [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842) and [[Second Opium War]] (1856{{ndash}}1860) against [[Qing dynasty|Imperial China]]. The Royal Navy was superior to any other two navies in the world, combined. Between 1815 and the passage of the German naval laws of 1890 and 1898, only France was a potential naval threat.\n\nThe most decisive event emerged from the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|Anglo-Egyptian War]], which resulted in the British occupation of Egypt for seven decades, even though the Ottoman Empire retained nominal ownership until 1914.<ref>M.W. Daly, ed. ''The Cambridge History Of Egypt Volume 2 Modern Egypt, from 1517 to the end of the twentieth century''  (1998) [https://archive.org/download/iB_CE/02.pdf online]</ref> Historian [[A.J.P. Taylor]] says that this \"was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war.\"<ref>He adds, \"All the rest were maneuvers which left the combatants at the close of the day exactly where they had started.\" A.J.P. Taylor, \"International Relations\" in F.H. Hinsley, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: XI: Material Progress and World-Wide Problems, 1870\u201398'' (1962): 554.</ref> Taylor emphasizes the long-term impact:\n\n: The British occupation of Egypt altered the balance of power. It not only gave the British security for their route to India; it made them masters of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East; it made it unnecessary for them to stand in the front line against Russia at the Straits....And thus prepared the way for the Franco-Russian Alliance ten years later.<ref>Taylor, \"International Relations\" p 554</ref>\n\nBritain [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#19th century|traded goods and capital]] extensively with countries around the world, adopting a free trade policy after 1840. The growth of British imperial strength was further underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]].<ref>[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], pp.&nbsp;88\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe ''Pax Britannica'' was weakened by the breakdown of the continental order which had been established by the Congress of Vienna.<ref>[[#refPugh99|Pugh]], p.&nbsp;90.</ref> Relations between the Great Powers of Europe were strained to breaking point by issues such as the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which led to the [[Crimean War]], and later the emergence of new nation states in the form of Italy and Germany after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Both of these wars involved Europe's largest states and armies. The industrialisation of [[Germany]], the [[Empire of Japan]], and the [[United States]] contributed to the relative decline of British industrial supremacy in the late 19th century.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[Imperial Federation]]\n*[[List of wars involving the United Kingdom#United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801\u20131922)|List of wars involving the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Pax Americana]]\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Albrecht-Carri\u00e9, Ren\u00e9.
