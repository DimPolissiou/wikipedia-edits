The array is a [[passive electronically scanned array|passive electronically scanned]] system and is a key component of the [[Aegis Combat System]]. The system is computer controlled, using four complementary antennas to provide 360 degree coverage. The system was first installed in 1973 on {{USS|Norton Sound|AVM-1|6}} and entered active service in 1983 as the SPY-1A on {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|6}}. The -1A was installed on ships up to CG-58, with the -1B upgrade first installed on {{USS|Princeton|CG-59|6}} in 1986. The upgraded -1B(V) was retrofitted to existing ships from CG-59 up to the last, {{USS|Port Royal|CG-73|6}}.\n\n==Description==\nThe first production model of SPY-1 series is SPY-1, forms the baseline configuration of all subsequent SPY-1 radars. SPY-1A has four antenna arrays in two separate deckhouses, with each antenna array containing 148 modules.<ref name=\"SPY-1\">{{cite book |authorlink=Norman Polmar |last=Polmar |first=Norman |year=2006 ||title=The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapon Systems |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4S3h8j_NEmkC&pg=PA316&lpg=PA316&dq=weight+of+SPY-1+antenna&source=bl&ots=hJRxRSZY9_&sig=HhSryUnB4DAJdxUdxYQ55DdvCeY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LIbrU5aiHs_8oASvgoCoCQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=weight%20of%20SPY-1%20antenna&f=false |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]] |isbn=978-1557502629 |pages=316\u2013317}}</ref> Each module contains up to 32 radiating element and [[phase shifter]]s, and modules are paired to form transmitting and receiving sub-arrays, which are grouped into 32 transmitting and 68 receiving arrays.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> Transmitting arrays are driven by eight transmitters, each with four [[crossed-field amplifier]]s (CFAs), and each CFA produces a peak power of 132&nbsp;kW.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> There are a total of 4,096 radiators, 4,352 receivers and 128 auxiliary elements on each antenna array.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> The power requirement of SPY-1A is four times that of [[AN/SPS-48]] and SPY-1 is controlled by [[AN/UYK-7]] computer.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1A''' upgrade is a development of SPY-1, resulting from the deployment of SPY-1-equipped {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|6}} off the Lebanese coast. It was discovered that the false alarm rate was high because the radar would pick up swarms of insects and clutter from mountainous terrain. The solution is to allow the operator to change the sensitivity profile of radar by periodically reducing attenuation, and to set threat and non threat sectors according to changing environment.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> The result is more efficient utilization of resources. About 10% of the software totaling thirty thousand lines had to be rewritten to accommodate the necessary upgrade.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> In 2003, the U.S. Navy donated a SPY-1A antenna to the National Severe Storms Laboratory in [[Norman, Oklahoma]], making it one of the first stationary phased arrays used in weather forecasting.  The [[Multifunction Phased Array Radar]] was was decommissioned and removed in 2016. \n\n'''SPY-1B''' is the model adopts [[VLSI]] resulting in increased performance and reduced size and weight. For example, the electronic cabinets area reduced from 11 to 5, with corresponding weight reduced from {{convert|14700|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10800|lb|abbr=on}}, and separate digital modules are reduced from 3,806 to 1,606.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> A 7-bit phase shifter replaced the 4-bit phase shifter in earlier models, with corresponding weight of phase shifters in face of the antenna reduced from {{convert|12000|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|7900|lb|abbr=on}}, and a reduction of side lobe by 15&nbsp;dB.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> There are 4,350 radiators with two side lobe cancellation antenna, each with two elements, and the radar uses eleven 16-bit microprocessors.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> Ability to counter steep diving missiles are improved with more energy at higher elevation or longer pulse.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1B(V)''' is development of earlier SPY-1B with [[moving target indication]] capability incorporated in 1997.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1D''' was first installed on {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} in 1991, with all antenna in a single [[deckhouse]]. It is a variant of the -1B to fit the {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|4}} using the UYK-43 computer, with the main antenna also used as missile uplinks, thus eliminate the need of separate missile uplink in earlier models, and the UYA-4 display in earlier models is replaced by UYQ-21 display.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1D(V)''', the Littoral Warfare Radar, was an upgrade introduced in 1998 with new track initiation processor for high clutter near-coast operations, where the earlier \"blue water\" systems were especially weak. The wave form is coded and signal processing is improved.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1E SBAR''' (S Band Active Array) is the only [[active phased array]] model in SPY-1 series, and it was later renamed as '''SPY-2''', subsequently developed into VSR. SPY-1E utilizes [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) subsystems and a single faced demonstration unit was built in 2004. The weight of antenna remains the same but weight below deck is greatly reduced.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1F FARS''' (frigate array radar system) is a smaller version of the 1D designed to fit [[frigate]]s. It is not used by the US Navy, but has been exported to Norway. The origin of the SPY-1F can be traced back to the FARS proposed to the [[German Navy]] in the 1980s. The size of the antenna of SPY-1F is reduced from the original {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} with 4,350 elements to {{convert|8|ft|m|0}} with 1,856 elements, and the range is 54% of the SPY-1D.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1F(V)''' is a derivative of SPY-1F with improved capability against littoral targets and cruise missiles, with better multi-mission capability.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1K''' is the smallest version of the radar currently offered, based on the same architecture as the 1D and 1F. It is intended for use on very small vessels such as [[corvette]]s, where the SPY-1F would be too large. The size of the antenna is further reduced to {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} with 912 elements.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> As of 2007, none are in service, although the radar is incorporated into the design of the yet-unbuilt AFCON Corvette.<ref>http://www.afconships.com/products.html</ref><ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/findPage.do?dsp=fec&ci=13584&rsbci=7&fti=0&ti=0&sc=400 ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n* AN/SPY-1: Prototypes, {{USS|Norton Sound|AVM-1|6}}.\n* AN/SPY-1A: {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s up to CG-58.\n* AN/SPY-1B: ''Ticonderoga''-class cruisers starting at CG-59. 3.66 m (12-foot) diameter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/ms2/pdf/SPY-1_Family_brochure_6-pager.pdf |title=LockMart brochure |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915180551/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/ms2/pdf/SPY-1_Family_brochure_6-pager.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-15 }}</ref>\n* AN/SPY-1B(V): Upgrade for the -1B version, retrofitted to CG-59 and up.\n* AN/SPY-1D: Variant of -1B designed for ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyers, Japanese {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|destroyer|1}}s and Spanish   {{sclass-|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n|frigate|1}}s (F-101-104).\n* AN/SPY-1D(V): Littoral Warfare Radar upgrade for the -1D variant applied to DDG 51 Flight IIA, Japanese {{sclass-|Atago|destroyer|1}}s, South Korean {{sclass-|Sejong the Great|destroyer|1}}s (KDX-III), Spanish F-105 frigate and the Australian {{sclass-|Hobart|destroyer|0}} air warfare destroyers (AWD).\n* AN/SPY-1F: Smaller version of the -1D designed to fit frigates.

SPY-1A has four antenna arrays in two separate deckhouses, with each antenna array containing 148 modules.<ref name=\"SPY-1\">{{cite book |authorlink=Norman Polmar |last=Polmar |first=Norman |year=2006 ||title=The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapon Systems |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4S3h8j_NEmkC&pg=PA316&lpg=PA316&dq=weight+of+SPY-1+antenna&source=bl&ots=hJRxRSZY9_&sig=HhSryUnB4DAJdxUdxYQ55DdvCeY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LIbrU5aiHs_8oASvgoCoCQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=weight%20of%20SPY-1%20antenna&f=false |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]] |isbn=978-1557502629 |pages=316\u2013317}}</ref> Each module contains up to 32 radiating element and [[phase shifter]]s, and modules are paired to form transmitting and receiving sub-arrays, which are grouped into 32 transmitting and 68 receiving arrays.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> Transmitting arrays are driven by eight transmitters, each with four [[crossed-field amplifier]]s (CFAs), and each CFA produces a peak power of 132&nbsp;kW.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> There are a total of 4,096 radiators, 4,352 receivers and 128 auxiliary elements on each antenna array.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> The power requirement of SPY-1A is four times that of [[AN/SPS-48]] and SPY-1 is controlled by [[AN/UYK-7]] computer.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1A''' upgrade is a development of SPY-1, resulting from the deployment of SPY-1-equipped {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|6}} off the Lebanese coast. It was discovered that the false alarm rate was high because the radar would pick up swarms of insects and clutter from mountainous terrain. The solution is to allow the operator to change the sensitivity profile of radar by periodically reducing attenuation, and to set threat and non threat sectors according to changing environment.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> The result is more efficient utilization of resources. About 10% of the software totaling thirty thousand lines had to be rewritten to accommodate the necessary upgrade.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> In 2003, the U.S. Navy donated a SPY-1A antenna to the National Severe Storms Laboratory in [[Norman, Oklahoma]], making it one of the first stationary phased arrays used in weather forecasting.\n\n'''SPY-1B''' is the model adopts [[VLSI]] resulting in increased performance and reduced size and weight. For example, the electronic cabinets area reduced from 11 to 5, with corresponding weight reduced from {{convert|14700|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10800|lb|abbr=on}}, and separate digital modules are reduced from 3,806 to 1,606.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> A 7-bit phase shifter replaced the 4-bit phase shifter in earlier models, with corresponding weight of phase shifters in face of the antenna reduced from {{convert|12000|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|7900|lb|abbr=on}}, and a reduction of side lobe by 15&nbsp;dB.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> There are 4,350 radiators with two side lobe cancellation antenna, each with two elements, and the radar uses eleven 16-bit microprocessors.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> Ability to counter steep diving missiles are improved with more energy at higher elevation or longer pulse.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1B(V)''' is development of earlier SPY-1B with [[moving target indication]] capability incorporated in 1997.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1D''' was first installed on {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} in 1991, with all antenna in a single [[deckhouse]]. It is a variant of the -1B to fit the {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|4}} using the UYK-43 computer, with the main antenna also used as missile uplinks, thus eliminate the need of separate missile uplink in earlier models, and the UYA-4 display in earlier models is replaced by UYQ-21 display.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1D(V)''', the Littoral Warfare Radar, was an upgrade introduced in 1998 with new track initiation processor for high clutter near-coast operations, where the earlier \"blue water\" systems were especially weak. The wave form is coded and signal processing is improved.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1E SBAR''' (S Band Active Array) is the only [[active phased array]] model in SPY-1 series, and it was later renamed as '''SPY-2''', subsequently developed into VSR. SPY-1E utilizes [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) subsystems and a single faced demonstration unit was built in 2004. The weight of antenna remains the same but weight below deck is greatly reduced.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1F FARS''' (frigate array radar system) is a smaller version of the 1D designed to fit [[frigate]]s. It is not used by the US Navy, but has been exported to Norway. The origin of the SPY-1F can be traced back to the FARS proposed to the [[German Navy]] in the 1980s. The size of the antenna of SPY-1F is reduced from the original {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} with 4,350 elements to {{convert|8|ft|m|0}} with 1,856 elements, and the range is 54% of the SPY-1D.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1F(V)''' is a derivative of SPY-1F with improved capability against littoral targets and cruise missiles, with better multi-mission capability.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/>\n\n'''SPY-1K''' is the smallest version of the radar currently offered, based on the same architecture as the 1D and 1F. It is intended for use on very small vessels such as [[corvette]]s, where the SPY-1F would be too large. The size of the antenna is further reduced to {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} with 912 elements.<ref name=\"SPY-1\"/> As of 2007, none are in service, although the radar is incorporated into the design of the yet-unbuilt AFCON Corvette.<ref>http://www.afconships.com/products.html</ref><ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/findPage.do?dsp=fec&ci=13584&rsbci=7&fti=0&ti=0&sc=400 ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n* AN/SPY-1: Prototypes, {{USS|Norton Sound|AVM-1|6}}.\n* AN/SPY-1A: {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s up to CG-58.\n* AN/SPY-1B: ''Ticonderoga''-class cruisers starting at CG-59. 3.66 m (12-foot) diameter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/ms2/pdf/SPY-1_Family_brochure_6-pager.pdf |title=LockMart brochure |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915180551/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/ms2/pdf/SPY-1_Family_brochure_6-pager.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-15 }}</ref>\n* AN/SPY-1B(V): Upgrade for the -1B version, retrofitted to CG-59 and up.\n* AN/SPY-1D: Variant of -1B designed for ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyers, Japanese {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|destroyer|1}}s and Spanish   {{sclass-|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n|frigate|1}}s (F-101-104).\n* AN/SPY-1D(V): Littoral Warfare Radar upgrade for the -1D variant applied to DDG 51 Flight IIA, Japanese {{sclass-|Atago|destroyer|1}}s, South Korean {{sclass-|Sejong the Great|destroyer|1}}s (KDX-III), Spanish F-105 frigate and the Australian {{sclass-|Hobart|destroyer|0}} air warfare destroyers (AWD).\n* AN/SPY-1F: Smaller version of the -1D designed to fit frigates.

Medals and, in some cases, money were awarded to individuals who achieved success in published challenges within the categories of Agriculture, Polite Arts, Manufacture, Colonies and Trade, Chemistry and Mechanics. Successful submission included agricultural improvements in the cultivation of crops and reforestation, devising new forms of machinery, including an extendable ladder to aid firefighting that has remained in use relatively unchanged, and artistic skill, through submissions by young students, many of whom developed into famous artists e.g. [[Edwin Landseer]] who at the age of 10 was awarded a silver medal for his drawing of a dog.\n\nThe RSA originally specifically precluded premiums for [[patent]]ed solutions.<ref>http://sitoc.biz/adelphicharter/pdfs/RSA_IP_Final.pdf</ref> Today the RSA continues to offer premiums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/enterprise-and-design/enterprise/premiums|title=RSA Premiums}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for \"those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'\".\n\nIn 1937 \"The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry\" was established as an association with the object of \"furthering excellence in design and its application to industrial purposes\": membership of the Faculty is automatic for (and exclusive to) all RDIs and HonRDIs. The Faculty currently has 120 Royal Designers (RDI) and 45 Honorary Royal Designers (non-UK citizens who are awarded the accolade of HonRDI): the number of designers who may hold the distinction of RDI at any one time is strictly limited.\n\nThe Faculty consists of the world's leading practitioners from fields as disparate as engineering, furniture, fashion and textiles, graphics, theater and film design. Early members include [[Eric Gill]], [[Enid Marx]], Sir [[Frank Whittle]] and numerous other household names.\n\n==RSA House==\n[[File:Mathew Taylor on the RSA.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the building by [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Mathew Taylor]]]]\nThe RSA moved to its current home in 1774. The House, situated in John Adam Street, near [[Strand, London|the Strand]] in central London, had been purpose-designed by the Adam Brothers ([[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and [[Robert Adam]]) as part of their innovative [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]] scheme. The original building (6\u20138 John Adam Street) includes the Great Room, which features a magnificent sequence of paintings by Irish artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] titled ''The Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture'' and portraits of the Society's first and second presidents, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] respectively.\n\nThe RSA has expanded into adjacent buildings, and now includes 2 and 4 John Adam Street and 18 Adam Street. The first occupant of 18 Adam Street was the Adelphi Tavern, which is mentioned in Dickens's ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. The former private dining room of the Tavern contains a magnificent Adam ceiling with painted roundels by the school of Kauffman and Zucchi.\n\nA major refurbishment in 2012 by Matthew Lloyd Architects won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] London Award in 2013, and a RIBA [[English Heritage]] Award for Sustaining the Historic Environment, also in 2013.<ref>[http://www.matthewlloyd.co.uk/projects/the-royal-society-of-arts/ The Royal Society of Arts], Matthew Lloyd Architects. Retrieved 11 January 2016.</ref>\n\nThe RSA devised a scheme for commemorating the links between famous people and buildings, by placing plaques on the walls \u2014 these continue today as \"[[blue plaque]]s\" which have been administered by a range of government bodies. The first of these plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta erected outside a former residence of [[Lord Byron]] (since demolished). The Society erected 36 plaques until, in 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the [[London County Council]] (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and, later, the [[Greater London Council]] (the G.L.C.) and, most recently, English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the [[Constituent countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==Associated organisations==\nThe origin of London's [[Royal Academy of Arts]] lies in an attempt in 1755 by members of the RSA (then simply known as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce), principally the sculptor [[Henry Cheere]], to found an autonomous academy of arts to teach painting and sculpture. Prior to this a number of artists were members of the RSA, including Cheere and [[William Hogarth]], or were involved in small-scale private art academies, such as the [[St Martin's Lane Academy]]. Although Cheere's attempt failed, the eventual [[charter]], called an 'Instrument', used to establish the Royal Academy of Arts over a decade later was almost identical to that drawn up by Cheere and the RSA in 1755.<ref>Gordon Sutton, ''Artisan or Artist?: A History of the Teaching of Art and Crafts in English Schools'' (London: Pergamon Press, 2014) p.297</ref> The RSA also hosted the first ''exhibition of contemporary art'' in 1760. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds were among those who exhibited at this first exhibition, and were subsequently founder members of The [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768.\n\nThe Society was a pioneer in examinations, offering the first national public examinations in 1882 that led to the formation of the RSA Examinations Board now included in the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations Board]].\n\nIn 1876, a predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]], the ''National Training School for Music'', was founded by the RSA.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41378132?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jstor.Org RSA Journal Vol 140 Page 203, February 1992] Retrieved 19 July 2018</ref>\n\nIn 1929 The Society purchased the entire village of [[West Wycombe]]. After extensive repairs, the village was legally conveyed by deed to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for \"those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'\".\n\n==Activities==\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, the RSA offers regional activities to encourage Fellows to address local topics of interest and to connect with other Fellows in their locality. The UK Regions are: London, Central, North, Scotland, South East, South West, Wales and, Ireland.

Medals and, in some cases, money were awarded to individuals who achieved success in published challenges within the categories of Agriculture, Polite Arts, Manufacture, Colonies and Trade, Chemistry and Mechanics. Successful submission included agricultural improvements in the cultivation of crops and reforestation, devising new forms of machinery, including an extendable ladder to aid firefighting that has remained in use relatively unchanged, and artistic skill, through submissions by young students, many of whom developed into famous artists e.g. [[Edwin Landseer]] who at the age of 10 was awarded a silver medal for his drawing of a dog.\n\nThe RSA originally specifically precluded premiums for [[patent]]ed solutions.<ref>http://sitoc.biz/adelphicharter/pdfs/RSA_IP_Final.pdf</ref> Today the RSA continues to offer premiums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/enterprise-and-design/enterprise/premiums|title=RSA Premiums}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for \"those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'\".\n\nIn 1937 \"The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry\" was established as an association with the object of \"furthering excellence in design and its application to industrial purposes\": membership of the Faculty is automatic for (and exclusive to) all RDIs and HonRDIs. The Faculty currently has 120 Royal Designers (RDI) and 45 Honorary Royal Designers (non-UK citizens who are awarded the accolade of HonRDI): the number of designers who may hold the distinction of RDI at any one time is strictly limited.\n\nThe Faculty consists of the world's leading practitioners from fields as disparate as engineering, furniture, fashion and textiles, graphics, theater and film design. Early members include [[Eric Gill]], [[Enid Marx]], Sir [[Frank Whittle]] and numerous other household names.\n\n==RSA House==\n[[File:Mathew Taylor on the RSA.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the building by [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Mathew Taylor]]]]\nThe RSA moved to its current home in 1774. The House, situated in John Adam Street, near [[Strand, London|the Strand]] in central London, had been purpose-designed by the Adam Brothers ([[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and [[Robert Adam]]) as part of their innovative [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]] scheme. The original building (6\u20138 John Adam Street) includes the Great Room, which features a magnificent sequence of paintings by Irish artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] titled ''The Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture'' and portraits of the Society's first and second presidents, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] respectively.\n\nThe RSA has expanded into adjacent buildings, and now includes 2 and 4 John Adam Street and 18 Adam Street. The first occupant of 18 Adam Street was the Adelphi Tavern, which is mentioned in Dickens's ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. The former private dining room of the Tavern contains a magnificent Adam ceiling with painted roundels by the school of Kauffman and Zucchi.\n\nA major refurbishment in 2012 by Matthew Lloyd Architects won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] London Award in 2013, and a RIBA [[English Heritage]] Award for Sustaining the Historic Environment, also in 2013.<ref>[http://www.matthewlloyd.co.uk/projects/the-royal-society-of-arts/ The Royal Society of Arts], Matthew Lloyd Architects. Retrieved 11 January 2016.</ref>\n\nThe RSA devised a scheme for commemorating the links between famous people and buildings, by placing plaques on the walls \u2014 these continue today as \"[[blue plaque]]s\" which have been administered by a range of government bodies. The first of these plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta erected outside a former residence of [[Lord Byron]] (since demolished). The Society erected 36 plaques until, in 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the [[London County Council]] (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and, later, the [[Greater London Council]] (the G.L.C.) and, most recently, English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the [[Constituent countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==Associated organisations==\nThe origin of London's [[Royal Academy of Arts]] lies in an attempt in 1755 by members of the RSA (then simply known as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce), principally the sculptor [[Henry Cheere]], to found an autonomous academy of arts to teach painting and sculpture. Prior to this a number of artists were members of the RSA, including Cheere and [[William Hogarth]], or were involved in small-scale private art academies, such as the [[St Martin's Lane Academy]]. Although Cheere's attempt failed, the eventual [[charter]], called an 'Instrument', used to establish the Royal Academy of Arts over a decade later was almost identical to that drawn up by Cheere and the RSA in 1755.<ref>Gordon Sutton, ''Artisan or Artist?: A History of the Teaching of Art and Crafts in English Schools'' (London: Pergamon Press, 2014) p.297</ref> The RSA also hosted the first ''exhibition of contemporary art'' in 1760. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds were among those who exhibited at this first exhibition, and were subsequently founder members of The [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768.\n\nThe Society was a pioneer in examinations, offering the first national public examinations in 1882 that led to the formation of the RSA Examinations Board now included in the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations Board]].\n\nIn 1876, a predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]], the ''National Training School for Music'', was founded by the RSA.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41378132?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jstor.Org RSA Journal Vol 140 Page 203, February 1992] Retrieved 19 July 2018</ref>\n\nIn 1929 The Society purchased the entire village of [[West Wycombe]]. After extensive repairs, the village was legally conveyed by deed to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for \"those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'\".\n\n==Activities==\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, the RSA offers regional activities to encourage Fellows to address local topics of interest and to connect with other Fellows in their locality.

The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism on Monday imposed a VND40 million (US$1,720) administrative fine on Hoan Khue Film Production JSC (HKFilm) - the production company behind \u2018Rom.' The culture ministry also gave the company ten days to destroy the film copy it sent to BIFF, or authorities will coercively enact \u201cspoliation of the evidence.\" \u2018Rom\u2019 is a coming-of-age drama revolving around the story of a young bookie in bustling [[Ho Chi Minh City]], where he tries everything he can to help the residents of an old apartment complex keep their homes and fulfill his dream of finding his parents. According to a source close to Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, the film was not licensed for screening in [[Vietnam]] as HKFilm failed to edit out some violent scenes as per the request from a national film evaluation council. Despite lacking a screening license, the production company sent the unabridged version of \u2018Rom\u2019 to [[Busan]] instead of completing the edit work as required and seeking re-evaluation from Vietnamese authorities, according to the source.

The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism on Monday imposed a VND40 million (US$1,720) administrative fine on Hoan Khue Film Production JSC (HKFilm) - the production company behind \u2018Rom.' The culture ministry also gave the company ten days to destroy the film copy it sent to BIFF, or authorities will coercively enact \u201cspoliation of the evidence.\" \u2018Rom\u2019 is a coming-of-age drama revolving around the story of a young bookie in bustling [[Ho Chi Minh City]], where he tries everything he can to help the residents of an old apartment complex keep their homes and fulfill his dream of finding his parents.

The group operated a [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories|territory system]] which  sanctioned various [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championships]], recognized one world champion, participated in talent exchanges, and collectively protected the territorial integrity of member promotions. Prior to the 1960s it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling.

However, none of them had backing or recognition outside of their own respective geographic areas.\n\nIn 1948, [[Paul \"Pinkie\" George]], a promoter from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], founded the original version of the National Wrestling Alliance with the backing of five other promoters: [[Al Haft]], Tony Strecher, [[Harry Light]], [[Orville Brown]], and [[Sam Muchnick]]. The concept of the NWA was to consolidate the championships of these regional companies into one true world championship of professional wrestling, whose holder would be recognized worldwide. This newly formed NWA Board of Directors decided on Brown to be the first-ever [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]].<ref name=sa8>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.8)</ref>\n\n[[File:NWA Professional Wrestling Territories.png|330px|thumb|The extinct [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories#NWA territory system|NWA territory system]] in North America]]\nNWA member promotions were divided up into [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories#territories|territories]] that each promoter would \"own\" and operate while the NWA President's territory usually served as the main territory of the entire alliance. Having a territory meant that no other NWA member promotion could promote wrestling in that area unless special arrangements were made between the promoters involved. Reportedly, threats of violence or physical retaliation were used against any promoter (and/or talent) who disregarded the territory system. If any NWA member promotion broke the rules, it faced expulsion and thus risked missing out on having nationally known wrestlers appear on their local shows. Promotions that were not members of the NWA were often labeled \"outlaw,\" and while they didn't have to adhere to NWA rules, they were still subject to members' retaliation if they tried to invade territories.\n\nEach territory received periodic guest visits from the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The champion did not have a \"home territory\" as such, but instead traveled from territory to territory, defending the title against the top stars of each territory. Many NWA member promotions would build-up to the appearance of the NWA World Heavyweight Champion weeks or months in advance, making the local world title matches that much more special, and the shows they headlined more lucrative. In addition, each NWA member promotion usually produced a TV show that aired in their territory only, meaning that the local fans only saw the world champion when he came to their area and not year-round.\n\nWrestlers from one territory could come into another territory (often the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#heels|heels]] or \"bad guys\") and run an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#angle|angle]] or two with its top local [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#faces|faces]] (\"good guys\"). If the local fans ever got tired of a wrestler, the wrestler could go to a whole new territory and perform the same act for new audiences who would think the act was brand-new. This storyline was often advanced in the territory from which the wrestler was departing as a result of an especially highly promoted \"loser leaves town\" match.\n\nFor most NWA member promotions, the benefits of membership were well worth the dues and the rules.\n\nIn 1949, [[Lou Thesz]] was the [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)#National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion|National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion]] when a deal was made to unify his title with Orville Brown\u2019s [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. On November 1, 1949, with just weeks before the scheduled bout, Brown was involved in an automobile accident that ended his career, and he was forced to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacate]] the [[Professional wrestling championship|championship]]. The NWA then awarded the unified titles to the No. 1 contender, Thesz.\n\n===As a Governing Body===\n====1950s====\n\nIn 1950, [[Sam Muchnick]], one of the original promoters of the NWA and Thesz\u2019s booker, was named the new NWA President, a position to which he was unanimously re-elected and held until 1960, making him one of the longest-tenured presidents in the organization\u2019s history.\n\nFollowing the advent of [[television]], professional wrestling matches began to be aired nationally during this time, reaching a larger fanbase than ever before. This was a time of enormous growth for professional wrestling, as rising demand and national expansion made it a much more popular and lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This was called a \"Golden Age\" for the wrestling industry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=101}}</ref><ref name=sex,lies>{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=10}}</ref> From 1948 to 1955, each of the three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest supporter being the [[DuMont Television Network]].<ref name=sex,lies/>\n\nUp through 1956, during Thesz\u2019s first reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion, the title was further unified with several more previously competing world titles including the American Wrestling Alliance\u2019s heavyweight title in [[Boston]] and the California World Heavyweight title from [[Baron Michele Leone]] in [[Los Angeles]]. As NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Thesz became the closest any wrestler had been to be the [[Undisputed championship|undisputed]] world heavyweight wrestling champion since [[Danno O'Mahony]] in 1936. This legitimized the NWA's claim that its title was a \"unified world title\" and its lineage continues to this day.\n\n[[File:1953 St.Paul Armory Wrestling Program - Lou Thesz.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Lou Thesz]]]] With Thesz as unified world champion, Muchnick as NWA President, and the power of television\u2019s reach, the NWA became the dominant governing body in pro wrestling during this time. Nearly every major wrestling promotion across the country joined the NWA in order to gain access to the treasure chest that was the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, who was universally recognized as the industry's premier star.\n\nThe NWA\u2019s presence in [[Japan]] was established in 1953, when Japanese wrestler/promoter [[Rikidozan]] founded the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance]], (JWA) which quickly became the main promotion in Japan later that year the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre]] became the NWA territory in [[Mexico]].\n\nThe NWA experienced their first major challenge in 1956 when allegations were made that the NWA was an illegal monopoly blocking competition. An extensive investigation led by the [[US Department of Justice]] resulted in the infamous NWA Consent Decree of 1956 (''The U.S. v. National Wrestling Alliance''). Sam Muchnick had strong political connections and was able to negotiate the consent decree which prevented the investigation from ultimately resulting in the dissolution of the NWA. The judgment marked the end to the Justice Department's concerns with the National Wrestling Alliance.<ref>United States vs. National Wrestling Alliance http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/consentdecree.html</ref>\n\nOther challenges soon appeared in the late-1950s. There were disputes over the number of dates wrestled by the champion in various parts of the country. There were also competing factions who wanted to replace Thesz as champion with different wrestlers, such as [[Verne Gagne]].\n\nIt was during this time that several promoters found reasons to leave the organization, managing to find niches in the United States. The first break within the organization occurred in 1957 when [[Montreal]] promoter [[Eddie Quinn]] walked out of the August NWA meeting in St. Louis. Quinn had fallen out with Muchnick over a number of issues. At the time Quinn walked out, a wrestler of his named [[\u00c9douard Carpentier]] was involved in an angle where he and Lou Thesz were both being presented around the NWA as world champion after Carpentier had a disputed win over Thesz on June 14, 1957.<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/carpentier.html|title=Canadian Hall of Fame: Edouard Carpentier|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=April 30, 2008}}</ref> The original idea was to build the \"disputed\" NWA World Heavyweight Championship title into a high-profile rematch. When Quinn left the NWA, Muchnick announced that Carpentier had never been an official champion and had no claim on the title. Afterward, Quinn saw the financial possibilities in the Carpentier situation and began to negotiate with NWA member promotions that continued to recognize Carpentier as champion. He offered to have Carpentier lose a title match to their prospective champion thus giving them a legitimate claim on the world title if they decided to break away from the NWA. While some took up Quinn\u2019s offer, and title switches took place in those territories, none would match the impact of the title change in Nebraska. Verne Gagne became world champion when he defeated Carpentier in Omaha on August 9, 1958 for what would become the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)|World Heavyweight Championship of Omaha]].\n\nAs the 1950s came to an close, professional wrestling had lost its high ratings, and producers, realizing that they had overexposed it, soon dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups.<ref name=sex,lies-pg11>{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=11}}</ref> The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows, which network producers placed as late-night fillers rather than signature programming.<ref name=sex,lies-pg13>{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|last=Assael|first=Shaun|page=13}}</ref> Promoters started using localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting some of them out of business.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=103}}</ref>\n\n====1960s====\n\n[[File:Verne Gagne 1964.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Verne Gagne]]]]\nChallenges continued for the NWA as it entered the 1960s. After defeating Carpentier in Omaha, Verne Gagne tried for two years to work things out with the NWA. Finally settling on breaking away from the NWA, the Minneapolis territory (as it was known) gave a \"story-line only\" edict to the NWA in May 1960: Unless [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)#Pat O'Connor|Pat O'Connor]], the NWA\u2019s world champion at the time, defended his title against Gagne in 90 days, then Gagne would become the recognized [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship#AWA World Heavyweight Champion|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] by default. Gagne\u2019s new [[American Wrestling Association]] unilaterally recognized O\u2019Connor as the first AWA world champion. There was never any intention of such a match taking place, and ninety days later, on August 16, 1960, the AWA recognized Gagne as the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion. The AWA would go on to be a dominant professional wrestling organization throughout the 1960s.\n\nIn the same month of 1960, Sam Muchnick stepped aside as NWA President. Three NWA Presidents followed over the next three years: [[Frank Tunney]] from the [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] promotion in the [[Toronto]] territory (1960-1961), [[Fred Kohler (wrestling promoter)#Fred Kohler|Fred Kohler]], owner of [[Fred Kohler Enterprises]] promotion in the [[Chicago]] territory and producer of the popular [[DuMont Television Network]] program ''[[Wrestling From Marigold]]'' (1961-1962), and [[Doc Sarpolis]] from the [[Western States Sports]] promotion in the [[Amarillo]] territory (1962-1963). During all three administrations, Muchnick served as the NWA\u2019s executive secretary.\n\nOn January 24, 1963, at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, Lou Thesz defeated [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] in a one-fall match and was declared NWA World Heavyweight Champion for the third and final time (official). However, after the event, [[Vincent J. McMahon]] and [[Toots Mondt]] from the [[Capital Wrestling Corporation]] promotion in the Northeast territory refused to recognize the title change since Thesz as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion was not a strong draw in their territory. They then withdrew CWC from the NWA.<ref name=won2011>{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011|title=NWA World Heavyweight Championship}}</ref> As a result, McMahon and Mondt formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now [[WWE]]) with Rogers as its first [[WWE Championship#world champion|world champion]] in April 1963. Although both Gagne and McMahon promoted their own world champions, their promotions continued to have representatives on the NWA Board of Directors and regularly exchanged talent with NWA promotions during this time.\n\nConsequently, Sam Muchnick was unanimously re-installed as NWA President in 1963 and held the office until 1975, thus contributing a total of 25 years as the industry's most influential promoter.  During his second reign, Muchnick maintained the NWA\u2019s position as wrestling's top power while he also displayed an uncanny eye for scouting future talent.\n\n====1970s====\n\nAs pro wrestling's popularity declined in the 1970s, Sam Muchnick\u2019s second reign as NWA President would prove beneficial for the organization\u2019s future. Muchnick scouted new talent through the rest of his tenure, grooming eventual champions such as [[Harley Race]], [[Dory Funk Jr.]], [[Terry Funk]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and many others in the process.  Moreover, he expanded the NWA globally by inking agreements with territories in [[Mexico]], the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], and the [[Caribbean]].\n\n[[File:Gordon Solie 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Gordon Solie]]]]\nThe [[WWE|WWWF]] quietly rejoined the NWA in 1971 after their biggest draw, [[Bruno Sammartino]], left the promotion. While still an NWA member in 1979, they changed their name from World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) to World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nIn 1972, the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance|JWA\u2019s]] two top draws [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] and [[Antonio Inoki]] left to form their own promotions, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) respectively. As a result, the JWA soon folded. AJPW became an NWA member upon its inception in 1973 and NJPW was also a member of the NWA at various points starting in 1975.\n\nBy the end of his tenure, Muchnick reportedly declared [[Atlanta, Georgia]] as the \u201cleading wrestling city\u201d for its \u201cdrawing capacity and near-capacity crowds at the City Auditorium or the Omni every Friday.\u201d<ref name=Sporskeeda>{{cite web|url= https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/georgia-championship-wrestling-gcw-the-holy-grail-of-wrestling-television-programs|title= Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), the Holy Grail of Wrestling Television Programs|last=Mileur|first=Ray|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=December 30, 2019|work=Sportskeeda}}</ref> Once Muchnick\u2019s second term ended, [[Fritz Von Erich]] (1975-1976), [[Eddie Graham]] (1976-1978), and [[Bob Geigel]] (1978-1980) would fill the role as NWA President for the remainder of the decade. However, it was Muchnick\u2019s declaration that would pay in dividends for the NWA when they made Atlanta their home base.\n\nWhile the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (WWWF/WWF) both faltered during the 1970s, the NWA once again took over as the top promotion and gained huge dominance with their program, [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], which would become the first nationally broadcast wrestling program on cable television, or more specifically the [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS Network]], in 1979. They brought in [[Gordon Solie]], dubbed \u201cThe Walter Cronkite of Professional Wrestling,\u201d from former NWA President Eddie Graham\u2019s Championship Wrestling from Florida territory to be lead commentator and host.<ref name=Sporskeeda/>\n\n====1980s====\n\nThe 1980s would prove not only to be a major turning point for the NWA but for the entire professional wrestling industry itself.\n\nVideotape trading and [[cable television]] paved the way for the eventual death of the NWA's inter-regional business model, as fans could now see for themselves the plot holes and inconsistencies between the different regional storylines. Also, the presence of stars like [[Ric Flair]] on TV every week made their special appearances in each region less of a draw.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years of mostly success, the NWA's territory system was dying.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png|title=WrestlingTerritories.png|author=|work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe WWF left the NWA for good in 1983. [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] (who bought the WWF from his father in 1982) saw the dying territory system as an opportunity to turn his family's Northeastern United States territory into the first truly national promotion. McMahon worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States, angering other promoters and disrupting the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions not seen since its inception.\n\n[[Image:Ric Flair in Seoul, South Korea.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Ric Flair]]]]\nIn 1983, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] and the NWA created its primary [[supercard]], [[Starrcade]], the first to be broadcast via [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit networks]] and regarded as their flagship event of the year on [[Thanksgiving Day]].\n\nOn Saturday, July 14, 1984, in what would become known as [[Black Saturday (professional wrestling)|Black Saturday]], McMahon bought NWA member [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) and merged it into the WWF, with the WWF taking over GCW's long-time TV slot on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] which had been home to GCW\u2019s flagship weekly program, ''World Championship Wrestling'', for 12 years.<ref>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.61)</ref> McMahon's purchase led to a longstanding rivalry between himself and WTBS owner [[Ted Turner]], who would later enter the professional wrestling promotion business by the end of the decade. This moved proved disastrous for the already established GCW audience and the new WWE/GCW program\u2019s ratings plummeted. Losing money on the deal and desperately looking for help, McMahon turned to Jim Barnett, who directed him to NWA President [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]], the owner of [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP), who then bought the ''World Championship Wrestling'' program from McMahon for $1 million (US) and returned NWA programming to TBS.\n\nWrestling promotions across the United States feared being forced into bankruptcy by the WWF. They began to unify and conglomerate under more centralized leadership rather than continue independently. Competing promotions aired better talent and attempted to regain their audiences.\n\nDuring this time, various NWA promoters and Verne Gagne\u2019s AWA attempted to co-promote shows under the [[Pro Wrestling USA]] brand to combat the national WWF threat. It didn\u2019t last long as disputes over control, power, and revenue led the brand to fall apart, leaving it with the AWA to own the timeslot on [[ESPN]] for AWA programming.\n\nIn early 1985, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) was becoming the center of the entire NWA. After the WWF gained huge dominance with Wrestlemania, Crockett responded by successfully acquiring time slots on TBS.<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs2-can.html End of an era on TBS: Crockett, Flair and 'The Clashes']</ref> JCP decided to unify certain NWA territories and \"go national\" itself. Accordingly, [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]] began buying out some of the other NWA member promotions or, in some cases, allowed them to quietly fold and moved into those territories. JCP controlled many NWA territories and limited championship matches to performers under contract with JCP thus making titles exclusive to the promotion. JCP continued to buy out NWA promotions between 1986 and 1987 as well.\n\nIn February 1986, promoter [[Fritz Von Erich]] withdrew Dallas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) from the NWA in a bid to become a national promotion. Abroad, [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) all seceded from the NWA in the mid-1980s.\n\n[[File:Ted Turner LF.JPG|200px|left|thumb|[[Ted Turner]]]]\nBy this time, the top three national promotions were WWF, NWA, and AWA. With NWA\u2019s [[Starrcade]], WWF\u2019s [[WrestleMania]], and AWA\u2019s [[SuperClash]], the professional wrestling industry entered what became known as the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|\u201cWrestling Boom\u201d or \u201cGolden Age.\u201d]]. All three also had network television programs and were now in direct competition with each other.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the position of NWA President would go back and forth between [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] of Jim Crockett Promotions based in Charlotte, North Carolina (1980-1982, 1985-1986, 1987-1991), and [[Bob Geigel]] of [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] based in Kansas City, Missouri (1982-1985, 1986-1987). As Geigel began his third term as NWA President, he would sell his promotion to Jim Crockett, Jr. By the time 1987 rolled around, and Geigel\u2019s final term ended when Crockett\u2019s third and final term began, Crockett\u2019s promotion had begun acquiring many territories and attempted to make the NWA a full national promotion. Geigel bought his promotion back, left the NWA and went on to create his own competing governing body: World Wrestling Alliance. It was too little, too late as the World Wrestling Alliance would fold by 1989.\n\nAfter WWF\u2019s massive [[WrestleMania III]] event in 1987, the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view, [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]], on Thanksgiving night to compete directly with NWA\u2019s Starrcade event, and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event. In order to prevent such a problem, Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around [[Christmas Day]], mostly in the days following, beginning in 1988. The WWF then scheduled their first [[Royal Rumble]] event in January 1988 to counterprogram against the NWA\u2019s [[Bunkhouse Stampede]].<ref>[http://www.bellaonline.org/articles/art53968.asp The Royal Rumble - Wrestling]</ref> The Royal Rumble originally aired on the USA cable networks the first year before finally transitioning to pay-per-view in subsequent years. The NWA responded by creating [[Clash of the Champions]] on TBS to compete against [[WrestleMania IV]]. The WWF also became an international success at this time.\n\nBy 1988, Jim Crockett Promotions was facing bankruptcy. JCP\u2019s ambition to have NWA compete directly with the WWF led to more detriment than success. Along with the acquisition spree, JCP failed to consistently match the WWF's ambitious marketing, TV production values, and merchandising. This left no viable option other than selling. On October 11, 1988, under the direction of owner [[Ted Turner]], TBS, which had replaced the WWF with JCP, bought the assets of JCP and renamed it [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) after the popular TV show on TBS.<ref name=eb60>{{cite book|author=Eric Bischoff|title=Eric Bischoff: Controversy Creates Cash|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/controversycreat00bisc/page/60 60]|isbn=1-4165-2729-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/controversycreat00bisc/page/60}}</ref>  Originally incorporated by TBS as the Universal Wrestling Corporation, Turner promised fans that WCW would be the athlete-oriented style of the NWA. The sale was completed on November 2, 1988, with a television taping of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|NWA World Championship Wrestling]]'' that very same date in WCW's hometown of Atlanta.<ref name=\"First date\">{{cite web|url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/jcp88.htm|title=JCP 1973|accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n\nTurner\u2019s NWA/WCW continued to challenge McMahon's monopoly of the sport. Turner promised a more athletic approach to the product, making [[Ric Flair]] the promotion's marquee wrestler and giving young stars big storylines and championship opportunities. With the backing of Turner\u2019s money, NWA/WCW grew into a national promotion as JCP had originally intended. WCW, like JCP before it, became the main NWA territory. Still a member of the NWA, WCW toured the entire country instead of staying within a confined territory. NWA/WCW would not only compete with the WWF on the national level, but it was about to compete with the WWF on the international level as well.\n\n====1990s====\n\nIn January 1991, WCW officially began to recognize a WCW World Champion, with Ric Flair, who had just defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, as the first title holder. Ric Flair was simultaneously recognized as the World champion of both the NWA and WCW until he left WCW over a dispute with WCW president [[Jim Herd]] (with the actual title belt in his possession) to join the [[WWE|WWF]]. Upon leaving, Flair was immediately stripped of the WCW World title but continued to be recognized as the NWA World champion, causing the separation of the WCW and NWA titles. He was officially stripped of the NWA World title upon his arrival in the WWF a few months later. Afterwards, the NWA World title lay dormant for a year until [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] hosted a tournament to crown a new champion. In September 1993, WCW withdrew completely from the NWA and despite Flair's possession of the physical belt made no mention of the NWA name on air after the split.\n\nIn August 1994, [[Philadelphia]]-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) withdrew their membership from the NWA in somewhat surprising fashion. As one of the most popular independent promotions of the early 1990s, they hosted a tournament to crown a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion after WCW had withdrawn from the NWA. The finals of the tournament saw [[Shane Douglas]] defeat [[2 Cold Scorpio]] for the world title. In a surprising turn, Douglas threw the title belt to the ground, claiming that he did not want to be the champion of a promotion that died \"seven years before\" (when JCP became WCW). Shane then grabbed the ECW Heavyweight Championship belt and declared himself the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Champion]]. ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]] then renamed the company to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and officially withdrew ECW from the NWA.\n\nAfter the secession of WCW in 1993, the NWA was not what it once was. Through the mid to late 1990s, the organization was left with a small collection of independent promotions during the peak of the [[Monday Night Wars]] between WCW and the WWF. In order to have joined the NWA, a promoter must have been operating for at least one year in a territory uncontested by any other NWA member, and their application had to be approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors \u2014 with some exceptions.\n\nIn 1998, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (now World Wrestling Entertainment) reached an agreement to use the likeness of the NWA world title and other titles, the NWA branding and its history, initially to create what was known as the NWA invasion storyline.<ref name=\"NWA Invasion\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewrestlinginsomniac.com/2015/04/the-1998-nwa-invasion-of-wwe.html|title=The 1998 NWA Invasion of the WWE|last=Labbe|first=Michael J.|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref> It was later claimed that WWE still owned the rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/former-president-claims-nwa-is-wwe-property/|title=Former President Claims NWA is WWE Property|website=Online World of Wrestling|language=en-US|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> (The sale of the NWA to [[Billy Corgan]] in 2017 was completed without any claims made by WWE).<ref name=PurchaseUpdate/> The NWA received international television publicity during this time of the late 1990s, however the storyline was considered a failure due to low viewer interests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/974859-pro-wrestling-jim-cornette-and-the-1998-nwa-invasion-of-the-wwf|title=Pro Wrestling: Jim Cornette and the 1998 NWA Invasion of the WWF|last=Blankenship|first=Hands of Stone|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ringthedamnbell.wordpress.com/2018/08/22/well-that-didnt-work-nwa-invades-wwf/|title=Well That Didn\u2019t Work: NWA Invades WWF|last=Editor|date=August 22, 2018|website=Ring the Damn Bell|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====2000s====\n\nIn June 2002, [[Jeff Jarrett|Jeff]] and [[Jerry Jarrett]] launched [[Impact Wrestling|NWA: Total Nonstop Action]] (NWA:TNA), a new promotion that aired a weekly, two-hour pay-per-view series. Due to the terms of TNA's agreement with the NWA, and despite not actually being an NWA member, NWA:TNA was given creative control over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team championships. In 2004, having been rebranded as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), the promotion launched a weekly television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', but continued to use the NWA titles until the relationship ended in 2007.\n\nThe NWA established the [[NWA Hall of Fame]], an American [[professional wrestling]] [[hall of fame]], in 2005 to honor select wrestling personalities, mostly alumni of the NWA.\n\nIn August 2005, the presidency of the NWA was dissolved and the duties of the office assumed by the Board of Directors, following the resignation of Ernie Todd (NWA: Canadian Wrestling Federation). It was announced on the NWA's website on Monday, October 10, 2005, that NWA legal counsel Bob Trobich would become its new [[Executive director|Executive Director]].\n\nIn January 2008, Colours TV on [[Dish Network]] and the NWA announced that they would begin airing an hour-long show entitled ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'', featuring the NWA's current lineup of stars in action. The show was hosted by David Marquez (with [[Rob Conway]] co-hosting the first four episodes) with match commentary by announcers Todd Kenneley, Kris Kloss and Rick Otazu. Ten episodes were shown before re-runs began. All the matches were taped at the [[Plaza Hotel & Casino|Plaza Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In January 2009, ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'' started airing new episodes, this time the tapings took place in Hollywood California.\n\nOn July 12, 2010, NWA Pro Wrestling, Inc. and [[KDOC-TV]] [[Los Angeles]] announced a partnership in producing National Wrestling Alliance branded television programming beginning September 2010. ''[[Championship Wrestling from Hollywood|NWA: Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]] (CWFH)'' would premiered on September 17, 2010.\n\nIn April 2012, North Carolina businessman and NWA Carolinas promoter David Baucom took over as the Executive Director after the resignation of Trobich.\n\n===Under Bruce Tharpe (2012-2016)===\n\nIn August 2012, International Wrestling Corp, LLC, a holding company run by Houston-based attorney and wrestling promoter R. Bruce Tharpe, sued Trobich, Baucom, the NWA, and its then-parent company, Trobich's Pro Wrestling Organization LLC, claiming insurance fraud regarding the NWA's liability insurance policy. A settlement was negotiated that transferred the rights to the NWA name and trademarks from Trobich's company to Tharpe's.<ref name=\"PWInsider.com\"/> The new organization moved from a membership model to a licensing model,<ref name=CorganPurchase/> which caused many promotions to immediately cut ties with the NWA, including [[Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]].

It remained the largest and most influential body in wrestling until the mid-1980s by which time most of the original member promotions went out of business as a result of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s [[Black Saturday (professional wrestling)|national expansion]]. \n\nIn September 1993, the largest remaining member promotion, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), left the NWA for the second and final time.<ref name=BleacherReport>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1009147-abandoned-the-history-of-the-wcw-international-heavyweight-championship|title=Abandoned: The History of the WCW International Heavyweight Championship|last=Schadler|first=Kyle|date=January 4, 2012|accessdate=December 29, 2019|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref> The NWA would continue as a loose coalition of independent promotions,<ref>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JrGwTebNiUIC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=nwa+a+shell+of+it%27s+former+self&source=bl&ots=vqplzj1-mN&sig=ACfU3U08bzV-wlQS9yU5-By6Mwi2eQJQJA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwisv7LcobbnAhXUbMAKHYcVDNsQ6AEwB3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=nwa%20a%20shell%20of%20it's%20former%20self&f=false</ref> with [[Impact Wrestling|NWA: Total Nonstop Action]] (NWA:TNA) given exclusivity over its [[NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight]] and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|Tag Team]] championships from June 2002 to May 2007.<ref name=\"The History of TNA: Year 1\">{{cite video|title=The History of TNA: Year 1|medium=DVD|publisher=TNA Home Video|date=2006}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, the NWA discontinued its memberships and started licensing its brand to wrestling promotions.<ref name=\"PWInsider.com\">{{cite web|title=NWA Lawsuit Settled, Promotion to Transfer to New Corporation|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/70396/nwa-lawsuit-settled-promotion-to-transfer-to-new-corporation.html|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref> As of 2019, the NWA is no longer a governing body and has since become a singular wrestling promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/report-nwa-roh-no-longer-working-together-nick-aldis-no-longer-advertised-summer-supercard|title=Report: NWA & ROH No Longer Working Together; Nick Aldis Not Advertised For Summer Supercard|accessdate=August 4, 2019|work=Fightful}}</ref><ref>{{cite |url=https://lastwordonprowrestling.com/2019/07/24/nwa-looking-to-join-weekly-tv-line-up/|title=NWA Looking To Join Weekly TV Line Up |publisher=Last Word on Wrestling|host=Jamie Greer|date=July 24, 2019|time=01:11:50|access-date=July 19, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite |url=https://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/nwa-tapings-planned-series-show/|title=NWA Announces First TV Tapings For Planned Series|date=August 7, 2019|access-date=August 13, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2020}}\n===Formation===\n\nBefore the NWA was founded, many regional [[professional wrestling promotion#professional wrestling promotions|professional wrestling promotions]] existed across North America with each promoting its own world champion. However, none of them had backing or recognition outside of their own respective geographic areas.\n\nIn 1948, [[Paul \"Pinkie\" George]], a promoter from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], founded the original version of the National Wrestling Alliance with the backing of five other promoters: [[Al Haft]], Tony Strecher, [[Harry Light]], [[Orville Brown]], and [[Sam Muchnick]]. The concept of the NWA was to consolidate the championships of these regional companies into one true world championship of professional wrestling, whose holder would be recognized worldwide. This newly formed NWA Board of Directors decided on Brown to be the first-ever [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]].<ref name=sa8>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.8)</ref>\n\n[[File:NWA Professional Wrestling Territories.png|330px|thumb|The extinct [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories#NWA territory system|NWA territory system]] in North America]]\nNWA member promotions were divided up into [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories#territories|territories]] that each promoter would \"own\" and operate while the NWA President's territory usually served as the main territory of the entire alliance. Having a territory meant that no other NWA member promotion could promote wrestling in that area unless special arrangements were made between the promoters involved. Reportedly, threats of violence or physical retaliation were used against any promoter (and/or talent) who disregarded the territory system. If any NWA member promotion broke the rules, it faced expulsion and thus risked missing out on having nationally known wrestlers appear on their local shows. Promotions that were not members of the NWA were often labeled \"outlaw,\" and while they didn't have to adhere to NWA rules, they were still subject to members' retaliation if they tried to invade territories.\n\nEach territory received periodic guest visits from the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The champion did not have a \"home territory\" as such, but instead traveled from territory to territory, defending the title against the top stars of each territory. Many NWA member promotions would build-up to the appearance of the NWA World Heavyweight Champion weeks or months in advance, making the local world title matches that much more special, and the shows they headlined more lucrative. In addition, each NWA member promotion usually produced a TV show that aired in their territory only, meaning that the local fans only saw the world champion when he came to their area and not year-round.\n\nWrestlers from one territory could come into another territory (often the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#heels|heels]] or \"bad guys\") and run an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#angle|angle]] or two with its top local [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#faces|faces]] (\"good guys\"). If the local fans ever got tired of a wrestler, the wrestler could go to a whole new territory and perform the same act for new audiences who would think the act was brand-new. This storyline was often advanced in the territory from which the wrestler was departing as a result of an especially highly promoted \"loser leaves town\" match.\n\nFor most NWA member promotions, the benefits of membership were well worth the dues and the rules.\n\nIn 1949, [[Lou Thesz]] was the [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)#National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion|National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion]] when a deal was made to unify his title with Orville Brown\u2019s [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. On November 1, 1949, with just weeks before the scheduled bout, Brown was involved in an automobile accident that ended his career, and he was forced to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacate]] the [[Professional wrestling championship|championship]]. The NWA then awarded the unified titles to the No. 1 contender, Thesz.\n\n===As a Governing Body===\n====1950s====\n\nIn 1950, [[Sam Muchnick]], one of the original promoters of the NWA and Thesz\u2019s booker, was named the new NWA President, a position to which he was unanimously re-elected and held until 1960, making him one of the longest-tenured presidents in the organization\u2019s history.\n\nFollowing the advent of [[television]], professional wrestling matches began to be aired nationally during this time, reaching a larger fanbase than ever before. This was a time of enormous growth for professional wrestling, as rising demand and national expansion made it a much more popular and lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This was called a \"Golden Age\" for the wrestling industry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=101}}</ref><ref name=sex,lies>{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=10}}</ref> From 1948 to 1955, each of the three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest supporter being the [[DuMont Television Network]].<ref name=sex,lies/>\n\nUp through 1956, during Thesz\u2019s first reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion, the title was further unified with several more previously competing world titles including the American Wrestling Alliance\u2019s heavyweight title in [[Boston]] and the California World Heavyweight title from [[Baron Michele Leone]] in [[Los Angeles]]. As NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Thesz became the closest any wrestler had been to be the [[Undisputed championship|undisputed]] world heavyweight wrestling champion since [[Danno O'Mahony]] in 1936. This legitimized the NWA's claim that its title was a \"unified world title\" and its lineage continues to this day.\n\n[[File:1953 St.Paul Armory Wrestling Program - Lou Thesz.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Lou Thesz]]]] With Thesz as unified world champion, Muchnick as NWA President, and the power of television\u2019s reach, the NWA became the dominant governing body in pro wrestling during this time. Nearly every major wrestling promotion across the country joined the NWA in order to gain access to the treasure chest that was the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, who was universally recognized as the industry's premier star.\n\nThe NWA\u2019s presence in [[Japan]] was established in 1953, when Japanese wrestler/promoter [[Rikidozan]] founded the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance]], (JWA) which quickly became the main promotion in Japan later that year the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre]] became the NWA territory in [[Mexico]].\n\nThe NWA experienced their first major challenge in 1956 when allegations were made that the NWA was an illegal monopoly blocking competition. An extensive investigation led by the [[US Department of Justice]] resulted in the infamous NWA Consent Decree of 1956 (''The U.S. v. National Wrestling Alliance''). Sam Muchnick had strong political connections and was able to negotiate the consent decree which prevented the investigation from ultimately resulting in the dissolution of the NWA. The judgment marked the end to the Justice Department's concerns with the National Wrestling Alliance.<ref>United States vs. National Wrestling Alliance http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/consentdecree.html</ref>\n\nOther challenges soon appeared in the late-1950s. There were disputes over the number of dates wrestled by the champion in various parts of the country. There were also competing factions who wanted to replace Thesz as champion with different wrestlers, such as [[Verne Gagne]].\n\nIt was during this time that several promoters found reasons to leave the organization, managing to find niches in the United States. The first break within the organization occurred in 1957 when [[Montreal]] promoter [[Eddie Quinn]] walked out of the August NWA meeting in St. Louis. Quinn had fallen out with Muchnick over a number of issues. At the time Quinn walked out, a wrestler of his named [[\u00c9douard Carpentier]] was involved in an angle where he and Lou Thesz were both being presented around the NWA as world champion after Carpentier had a disputed win over Thesz on June 14, 1957.<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/carpentier.html|title=Canadian Hall of Fame: Edouard Carpentier|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=April 30, 2008}}</ref> The original idea was to build the \"disputed\" NWA World Heavyweight Championship title into a high-profile rematch. When Quinn left the NWA, Muchnick announced that Carpentier had never been an official champion and had no claim on the title. Afterward, Quinn saw the financial possibilities in the Carpentier situation and began to negotiate with NWA member promotions that continued to recognize Carpentier as champion. He offered to have Carpentier lose a title match to their prospective champion thus giving them a legitimate claim on the world title if they decided to break away from the NWA. While some took up Quinn\u2019s offer, and title switches took place in those territories, none would match the impact of the title change in Nebraska. Verne Gagne became world champion when he defeated Carpentier in Omaha on August 9, 1958 for what would become the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)|World Heavyweight Championship of Omaha]].\n\nAs the 1950s came to an close, professional wrestling had lost its high ratings, and producers, realizing that they had overexposed it, soon dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups.<ref name=sex,lies-pg11>{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=11}}</ref> The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows, which network producers placed as late-night fillers rather than signature programming.<ref name=sex,lies-pg13>{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|last=Assael|first=Shaun|page=13}}</ref> Promoters started using localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting some of them out of business.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=103}}</ref>\n\n====1960s====\n\n[[File:Verne Gagne 1964.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Verne Gagne]]]]\nChallenges continued for the NWA as it entered the 1960s. After defeating Carpentier in Omaha, Verne Gagne tried for two years to work things out with the NWA. Finally settling on breaking away from the NWA, the Minneapolis territory (as it was known) gave a \"story-line only\" edict to the NWA in May 1960: Unless [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)#Pat O'Connor|Pat O'Connor]], the NWA\u2019s world champion at the time, defended his title against Gagne in 90 days, then Gagne would become the recognized [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship#AWA World Heavyweight Champion|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] by default. Gagne\u2019s new [[American Wrestling Association]] unilaterally recognized O\u2019Connor as the first AWA world champion. There was never any intention of such a match taking place, and ninety days later, on August 16, 1960, the AWA recognized Gagne as the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion. The AWA would go on to be a dominant professional wrestling organization throughout the 1960s.\n\nIn the same month of 1960, Sam Muchnick stepped aside as NWA President. Three NWA Presidents followed over the next three years: [[Frank Tunney]] from the [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] promotion in the [[Toronto]] territory (1960-1961), [[Fred Kohler (wrestling promoter)#Fred Kohler|Fred Kohler]], owner of [[Fred Kohler Enterprises]] promotion in the [[Chicago]] territory and producer of the popular [[DuMont Television Network]] program ''[[Wrestling From Marigold]]'' (1961-1962), and [[Doc Sarpolis]] from the [[Western States Sports]] promotion in the [[Amarillo]] territory (1962-1963). During all three administrations, Muchnick served as the NWA\u2019s executive secretary.\n\nOn January 24, 1963, at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, Lou Thesz defeated [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] in a one-fall match and was declared NWA World Heavyweight Champion for the third and final time (official). However, after the event, [[Vincent J. McMahon]] and [[Toots Mondt]] from the [[Capital Wrestling Corporation]] promotion in the Northeast territory refused to recognize the title change since Thesz as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion was not a strong draw in their territory. They then withdrew CWC from the NWA.<ref name=won2011>{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011|title=NWA World Heavyweight Championship}}</ref> As a result, McMahon and Mondt formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now [[WWE]]) with Rogers as its first [[WWE Championship#world champion|world champion]] in April 1963. Although both Gagne and McMahon promoted their own world champions, their promotions continued to have representatives on the NWA Board of Directors and regularly exchanged talent with NWA promotions during this time.\n\nConsequently, Sam Muchnick was unanimously re-installed as NWA President in 1963 and held the office until 1975, thus contributing a total of 25 years as the industry's most influential promoter.  During his second reign, Muchnick maintained the NWA\u2019s position as wrestling's top power while he also displayed an uncanny eye for scouting future talent.\n\n====1970s====\n\nAs pro wrestling's popularity declined in the 1970s, Sam Muchnick\u2019s second reign as NWA President would prove beneficial for the organization\u2019s future. Muchnick scouted new talent through the rest of his tenure, grooming eventual champions such as [[Harley Race]], [[Dory Funk Jr.]], [[Terry Funk]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and many others in the process.  Moreover, he expanded the NWA globally by inking agreements with territories in [[Mexico]], the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], and the [[Caribbean]].\n\n[[File:Gordon Solie 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Gordon Solie]]]]\nThe [[WWE|WWWF]] quietly rejoined the NWA in 1971 after their biggest draw, [[Bruno Sammartino]], left the promotion. While still an NWA member in 1979, they changed their name from World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) to World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nIn 1972, the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance|JWA\u2019s]] two top draws [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] and [[Antonio Inoki]] left to form their own promotions, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) respectively. As a result, the JWA soon folded. AJPW became an NWA member upon its inception in 1973 and NJPW was also a member of the NWA at various points starting in 1975.\n\nBy the end of his tenure, Muchnick reportedly declared [[Atlanta, Georgia]] as the \u201cleading wrestling city\u201d for its \u201cdrawing capacity and near-capacity crowds at the City Auditorium or the Omni every Friday.\u201d<ref name=Sporskeeda>{{cite web|url= https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/georgia-championship-wrestling-gcw-the-holy-grail-of-wrestling-television-programs|title= Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), the Holy Grail of Wrestling Television Programs|last=Mileur|first=Ray|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=December 30, 2019|work=Sportskeeda}}</ref> Once Muchnick\u2019s second term ended, [[Fritz Von Erich]] (1975-1976), [[Eddie Graham]] (1976-1978), and [[Bob Geigel]] (1978-1980) would fill the role as NWA President for the remainder of the decade. However, it was Muchnick\u2019s declaration that would pay in dividends for the NWA when they made Atlanta their home base.\n\nWhile the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (WWWF/WWF) both faltered during the 1970s, the NWA once again took over as the top promotion and gained huge dominance with their program, [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], which would become the first nationally broadcast wrestling program on cable television, or more specifically the [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS Network]], in 1979. They brought in [[Gordon Solie]], dubbed \u201cThe Walter Cronkite of Professional Wrestling,\u201d from former NWA President Eddie Graham\u2019s Championship Wrestling from Florida territory to be lead commentator and host.<ref name=Sporskeeda/>\n\n====1980s====\n\nThe 1980s would prove not only to be a major turning point for the NWA but for the entire professional wrestling industry itself.\n\nVideotape trading and [[cable television]] paved the way for the eventual death of the NWA's inter-regional business model, as fans could now see for themselves the plot holes and inconsistencies between the different regional storylines. Also, the presence of stars like [[Ric Flair]] on TV every week made their special appearances in each region less of a draw.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years of mostly success, the NWA's territory system was dying.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png|title=WrestlingTerritories.png|author=|work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe WWF left the NWA for good in 1983. [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] (who bought the WWF from his father in 1982) saw the dying territory system as an opportunity to turn his family's Northeastern United States territory into the first truly national promotion. McMahon worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States, angering other promoters and disrupting the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions not seen since its inception.\n\n[[Image:Ric Flair in Seoul, South Korea.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Ric Flair]]]]\nIn 1983, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] and the NWA created its primary [[supercard]], [[Starrcade]], the first to be broadcast via [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit networks]] and regarded as their flagship event of the year on [[Thanksgiving Day]].\n\nOn Saturday, July 14, 1984, in what would become known as [[Black Saturday (professional wrestling)|Black Saturday]], McMahon bought NWA member [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) and merged it into the WWF, with the WWF taking over GCW's long-time TV slot on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] which had been home to GCW\u2019s flagship weekly program, ''World Championship Wrestling'', for 12 years.<ref>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.61)</ref> McMahon's purchase led to a longstanding rivalry between himself and WTBS owner [[Ted Turner]], who would later enter the professional wrestling promotion business by the end of the decade. This moved proved disastrous for the already established GCW audience and the new WWE/GCW program\u2019s ratings plummeted. Losing money on the deal and desperately looking for help, McMahon turned to Jim Barnett, who directed him to NWA President [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]], the owner of [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP), who then bought the ''World Championship Wrestling'' program from McMahon for $1 million (US) and returned NWA programming to TBS.\n\nWrestling promotions across the United States feared being forced into bankruptcy by the WWF. They began to unify and conglomerate under more centralized leadership rather than continue independently. Competing promotions aired better talent and attempted to regain their audiences.\n\nDuring this time, various NWA promoters and Verne Gagne\u2019s AWA attempted to co-promote shows under the [[Pro Wrestling USA]] brand to combat the national WWF threat. It didn\u2019t last long as disputes over control, power, and revenue led the brand to fall apart, leaving it with the AWA to own the timeslot on [[ESPN]] for AWA programming.\n\nIn early 1985, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) was becoming the center of the entire NWA. After the WWF gained huge dominance with Wrestlemania, Crockett responded by successfully acquiring time slots on TBS.<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs2-can.html End of an era on TBS: Crockett, Flair and 'The Clashes']</ref> JCP decided to unify certain NWA territories and \"go national\" itself. Accordingly, [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]] began buying out some of the other NWA member promotions or, in some cases, allowed them to quietly fold and moved into those territories. JCP controlled many NWA territories and limited championship matches to performers under contract with JCP thus making titles exclusive to the promotion. JCP continued to buy out NWA promotions between 1986 and 1987 as well.\n\nIn February 1986, promoter [[Fritz Von Erich]] withdrew Dallas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) from the NWA in a bid to become a national promotion. Abroad, [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) all seceded from the NWA in the mid-1980s.\n\n[[File:Ted Turner LF.JPG|200px|left|thumb|[[Ted Turner]]]]\nBy this time, the top three national promotions were WWF, NWA, and AWA. With NWA\u2019s [[Starrcade]], WWF\u2019s [[WrestleMania]], and AWA\u2019s [[SuperClash]], the professional wrestling industry entered what became known as the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|\u201cWrestling Boom\u201d or \u201cGolden Age.\u201d]]. All three also had network television programs and were now in direct competition with each other.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the position of NWA President would go back and forth between [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] of Jim Crockett Promotions based in Charlotte, North Carolina (1980-1982, 1985-1986, 1987-1991), and [[Bob Geigel]] of [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] based in Kansas City, Missouri (1982-1985, 1986-1987). As Geigel began his third term as NWA President, he would sell his promotion to Jim Crockett, Jr. By the time 1987 rolled around, and Geigel\u2019s final term ended when Crockett\u2019s third and final term began, Crockett\u2019s promotion had begun acquiring many territories and attempted to make the NWA a full national promotion. Geigel bought his promotion back, left the NWA and went on to create his own competing governing body: World Wrestling Alliance. It was too little, too late as the World Wrestling Alliance would fold by 1989.\n\nAfter WWF\u2019s massive [[WrestleMania III]] event in 1987, the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view, [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]], on Thanksgiving night to compete directly with NWA\u2019s Starrcade event, and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event. In order to prevent such a problem, Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around [[Christmas Day]], mostly in the days following, beginning in 1988. The WWF then scheduled their first [[Royal Rumble]] event in January 1988 to counterprogram against the NWA\u2019s [[Bunkhouse Stampede]].<ref>[http://www.bellaonline.org/articles/art53968.asp The Royal Rumble - Wrestling]</ref> The Royal Rumble originally aired on the USA cable networks the first year before finally transitioning to pay-per-view in subsequent years. The NWA responded by creating [[Clash of the Champions]] on TBS to compete against [[WrestleMania IV]]. The WWF also became an international success at this time.\n\nBy 1988, Jim Crockett Promotions was facing bankruptcy. JCP\u2019s ambition to have NWA compete directly with the WWF led to more detriment than success. Along with the acquisition spree, JCP failed to consistently match the WWF's ambitious marketing, TV production values, and merchandising. This left no viable option other than selling. On October 11, 1988, under the direction of owner [[Ted Turner]], TBS, which had replaced the WWF with JCP, bought the assets of JCP and renamed it [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) after the popular TV show on TBS.<ref name=eb60>{{cite book|author=Eric Bischoff|title=Eric Bischoff: Controversy Creates Cash|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/controversycreat00bisc/page/60 60]|isbn=1-4165-2729-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/controversycreat00bisc/page/60}}</ref>  Originally incorporated by TBS as the Universal Wrestling Corporation, Turner promised fans that WCW would be the athlete-oriented style of the NWA. The sale was completed on November 2, 1988, with a television taping of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|NWA World Championship Wrestling]]'' that very same date in WCW's hometown of Atlanta.<ref name=\"First date\">{{cite web|url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/jcp88.htm|title=JCP 1973|accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n\nTurner\u2019s NWA/WCW continued to challenge McMahon's monopoly of the sport. Turner promised a more athletic approach to the product, making [[Ric Flair]] the promotion's marquee wrestler and giving young stars big storylines and championship opportunities. With the backing of Turner\u2019s money, NWA/WCW grew into a national promotion as JCP had originally intended. WCW, like JCP before it, became the main NWA territory. Still a member of the NWA, WCW toured the entire country instead of staying within a confined territory. NWA/WCW would not only compete with the WWF on the national level, but it was about to compete with the WWF on the international level as well.\n\n====1990s====\n\nIn January 1991, WCW officially began to recognize a WCW World Champion, with Ric Flair, who had just defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, as the first title holder. Ric Flair was simultaneously recognized as the World champion of both the NWA and WCW until he left WCW over a dispute with WCW president [[Jim Herd]] (with the actual title belt in his possession) to join the [[WWE|WWF]]. Upon leaving, Flair was immediately stripped of the WCW World title but continued to be recognized as the NWA World champion, causing the separation of the WCW and NWA titles. He was officially stripped of the NWA World title upon his arrival in the WWF a few months later. Afterwards, the NWA World title lay dormant for a year until [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] hosted a tournament to crown a new champion. In September 1993, WCW withdrew completely from the NWA and despite Flair's possession of the physical belt made no mention of the NWA name on air after the split.\n\nIn August 1994, [[Philadelphia]]-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) withdrew their membership from the NWA in somewhat surprising fashion. As one of the most popular independent promotions of the early 1990s, they hosted a tournament to crown a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion after WCW had withdrawn from the NWA. The finals of the tournament saw [[Shane Douglas]] defeat [[2 Cold Scorpio]] for the world title. In a surprising turn, Douglas threw the title belt to the ground, claiming that he did not want to be the champion of a promotion that died \"seven years before\" (when JCP became WCW). Shane then grabbed the ECW Heavyweight Championship belt and declared himself the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Champion]]. ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]] then renamed the company to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and officially withdrew ECW from the NWA.\n\nAfter the secession of WCW in 1993, the NWA was not what it once was. Through the mid to late 1990s, the organization was left with a small collection of independent promotions during the peak of the [[Monday Night Wars]] between WCW and the WWF. In order to have joined the NWA, a promoter must have been operating for at least one year in a territory uncontested by any other NWA member, and their application had to be approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors \u2014 with some exceptions.\n\nIn 1998, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (now World Wrestling Entertainment) reached an agreement to use the likeness of the NWA world title and other titles, the NWA branding and its history, initially to create what was known as the NWA invasion storyline.<ref name=\"NWA Invasion\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewrestlinginsomniac.com/2015/04/the-1998-nwa-invasion-of-wwe.html|title=The 1998 NWA Invasion of the WWE|last=Labbe|first=Michael J.|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref> It was later claimed that WWE still owned the rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/former-president-claims-nwa-is-wwe-property/|title=Former President Claims NWA is WWE Property|website=Online World of Wrestling|language=en-US|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> (The sale of the NWA to [[Billy Corgan]] in 2017 was completed without any claims made by WWE).<ref name=PurchaseUpdate/> The NWA received international television publicity during this time of the late 1990s, however the storyline was considered a failure due to low viewer interests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/974859-pro-wrestling-jim-cornette-and-the-1998-nwa-invasion-of-the-wwf|title=Pro Wrestling: Jim Cornette and the 1998 NWA Invasion of the WWF|last=Blankenship|first=Hands of Stone|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ringthedamnbell.wordpress.com/2018/08/22/well-that-didnt-work-nwa-invades-wwf/|title=Well That Didn\u2019t Work: NWA Invades WWF|last=Editor|date=August 22, 2018|website=Ring the Damn Bell|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====2000s====\n\nIn June 2002, [[Jeff Jarrett|Jeff]] and [[Jerry Jarrett]] launched [[Impact Wrestling|NWA: Total Nonstop Action]] (NWA:TNA), a new promotion that aired a weekly, two-hour pay-per-view series. Due to the terms of TNA's agreement with the NWA, and despite not actually being an NWA member, NWA:TNA was given creative control over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team championships. In 2004, having been rebranded as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), the promotion launched a weekly television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', but continued to use the NWA titles until the relationship ended in 2007.\n\nThe NWA established the [[NWA Hall of Fame]], an American [[professional wrestling]] [[hall of fame]], in 2005 to honor select wrestling personalities, mostly alumni of the NWA.\n\nIn August 2005, the presidency of the NWA was dissolved and the duties of the office assumed by the Board of Directors, following the resignation of Ernie Todd (NWA: Canadian Wrestling Federation). It was announced on the NWA's website on Monday, October 10, 2005, that NWA legal counsel Bob Trobich would become its new [[Executive director|Executive Director]].\n\nIn January 2008, Colours TV on [[Dish Network]] and the NWA announced that they would begin airing an hour-long show entitled ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'', featuring the NWA's current lineup of stars in action. The show was hosted by David Marquez (with [[Rob Conway]] co-hosting the first four episodes) with match commentary by announcers Todd Kenneley, Kris Kloss and Rick Otazu. Ten episodes were shown before re-runs began. All the matches were taped at the [[Plaza Hotel & Casino|Plaza Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In January 2009, ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'' started airing new episodes, this time the tapings took place in Hollywood California.\n\nOn July 12, 2010, NWA Pro Wrestling, Inc. and [[KDOC-TV]] [[Los Angeles]] announced a partnership in producing National Wrestling Alliance branded television programming beginning September 2010. ''[[Championship Wrestling from Hollywood|NWA: Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]] (CWFH)'' would premiered on September 17, 2010.\n\nIn April 2012, North Carolina businessman and NWA Carolinas promoter David Baucom took over as the Executive Director after the resignation of Trobich.\n\n===Under Bruce Tharpe (2012-2016)===\n\nIn August 2012, International Wrestling Corp, LLC, a holding company run by Houston-based attorney and wrestling promoter R. Bruce Tharpe, sued Trobich, Baucom, the NWA, and its then-parent company, Trobich's Pro Wrestling Organization LLC, claiming insurance fraud regarding the NWA's liability insurance policy. A settlement was negotiated that transferred the rights to the NWA name and trademarks from Trobich's company to Tharpe's.<ref name=\"PWInsider.com\"/> The new organization moved from a membership model to a licensing model,<ref name=CorganPurchase/> which caused many promotions to immediately cut ties with the NWA, including [[Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]].
