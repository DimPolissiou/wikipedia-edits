The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That's not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that's what it's about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \"groaning\" within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what's happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead. As the Spirit laments within us, so we become, even in our self-isolation, small shrines where the presence and healing love of God can dwell. And out of that there can emerge new possibilities, new acts of kindness, new scientific understanding, new hope. New wisdom for our leaders? Now there's a thought. \u2014[[N.T.

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That's not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that's what it's about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \"groaning\" within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what's happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead. As the Spirit laments within us, so we become, even in our self-isolation, small shrines where the presence and healing love of God can dwell. And out of that there can emerge new possibilities, new acts of kindness, new scientific understanding, new hope. New wisdom for our leaders? Now there's a thought. \u2014[[N.T.

S. Johar]], ''Chandni Chowk''. Naeem Hashmi was hero of this movie and Erika Rukhshi was the heroine. Just as the production of film was to start, riots broke out in [[Lahore]] and he and his family had to flee from the city. After the [[partition of India]] into [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, he moved to [[Delhi]]. He later moved to [[Mumbai]], where his first production, ''Karwat'', began in 1948, though it turned out to be a flop. His first film as a director, ''Afsana'', was released in 1951 and featured [[Ashok Kumar]] in a double role&nbsp;\u2013 the film was a hit and established his name in [[Bollywood]]. Chopra made ''[[Chandni Chowk (film)|Chandni Chowk]]'', with [[Meena Kumari]] as a lead, in 1954. In 1955, Chopra formed his own production house, ''B.R Films''. His first movie for this production house was Ek hi Raasta which was highly successful''he followed it up with [[Naya Daur (1957 film)|Naya Daur]]'' (1957) starring [[Dilip Kumar]] and [[Vyjayantimala Bali]], the film became a golden jubilee hit.His subsequent releases like [[Kanoon]], [[Gumrah (1963 film)|Gumrah]], [[Humraaz]] were major hits in the sixties.  In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"berlinale 1963\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1963/04_jury_1963/04_Jury_1963.html |title=Berlinale: Juries |accessdate=13 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100329093651/http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1963/04_jury_1963/04_Jury_1963.html| archivedate= 29 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> His second film with actor Dilip Kumar was [[Dastaan (1972 film)|Dastaan]] which became a flop in 1972.\n\nHe directed successful film across genres after 1972, with films like suspense thriller [[Dhund (1973 film)|Dhund]], drama [[Karma]] (1977), comedy film [[Pati Patni Aur Woh]], crime film in [[Insaaf Ka Tarazu]], Muslim social in ''Nikaah'' and the  political thriller [[Awam (film)|Awam]].\n\nHe was the producer for the films [[Dhool Ka Phool]], [[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]], [[Aadmi Aur Insaan]] and [[Ittefaq (1969 film)|Ittefaq]] directed by his younger brother Yash Chopra, and he also produced [[The Burning Train]], [[Aaj Ki Awaaz]],  [[Mazdoor]], [[Baghban]], [[Baabul]],[[Bhootnath]] which were directed by [[Ravi Chopra]].\n\nChopra was instrumental in developing the career of singer [[Mahendra Kapoor]], whom he employed in most of his movies. (Director-producer [[Yash Chopra]] cast Mahendra Kapoor's son in ''Faasle''.) One prominent thing about B. R. Chopra is the relatively low number of songs sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Mohammed Rafi]] in his films, with [[Asha Bhosle]] and [[Mahendra Kapoor]] being his preferred singers. The reason behind this was never revealed by him or the singers. Incidentally, both Chopra and Kapoor died within a gap of little longer than a month in 2008, with the latter dying first.\n\nChopra forayed into television with ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'', one of the most successful TV serials in Indian television history, where [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] played the role of [[Lord Krishna|Krishna]] and this was co-directed by him with his son.

S. Johar]], ''Chandni Chowk''. Naeem Hashmi was hero of this movie and Erika Rukhshi was the heroine. Just as the production of film was to start, riots broke out in [[Lahore]] and he and his family had to flee from the city. After the [[partition of India]] into [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, he moved to [[Delhi]]. He later moved to [[Mumbai]], where his first production, ''Karwat'', began in 1948, though it turned out to be a flop. His first film as a director, ''Afsana'', was released in 1951 and featured [[Ashok Kumar]] in a double role&nbsp;\u2013 the film was a hit and established his name in [[Bollywood]]. Chopra made ''[[Chandni Chowk (film)|Chandni Chowk]]'', with [[Meena Kumari]] as a lead, in 1954. In 1955, Chopra formed his own production house, ''B.R Films''. His first movie for this production house was Ek hi Raasta which was highly successful''he followed it up with [[Naya Daur (1957 film)|Naya Daur]]'' (1957) starring [[Dilip Kumar]] and [[Vyjayantimala Bali]], the film became a golden jubilee hit.His subsequent releases like [[Kanoon]], [[Gumrah (1963 film)|Gumrah]], [[Humraaz]] were major hits in the sixties.  In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"berlinale 1963\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1963/04_jury_1963/04_Jury_1963.html |title=Berlinale: Juries |accessdate=13 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100329093651/http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1963/04_jury_1963/04_Jury_1963.html| archivedate= 29 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> His second film with actor Dilip Kumar was [[Dastaan (1972 film)|Dastaan]] which became a flop in 1972.\n\nHe directed successful film across genres after 1972, with films like suspense thriller [[Dhund (1973 film)|Dhund]], drama [[Karma]] (1977), comedy film [[Pati Patni Aur Woh]], crime film in [[Insaaf Ka Tarazu]], Muslim social in ''Nikaah'' and the  political thriller [[Awam (film)|Awam]].\n\nHe was the producer for the films [[Dhool Ka Phool]], [[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]], [[Aadmi Aur Insaan]] and [[Ittefaq (1969 film)|Ittefaq]] directed by his younger brother Yash Chopra, and he also produced [[The Burning Train]], [[Aaj Ki Awaaz]],  [[Mazdoor]], [[Baghban]], [[Baabul]],[[Bhootnath]] which were directed by [[Ravi Chopra]].\n\nChopra was instrumental in developing the career of singer [[Mahendra Kapoor]], whom he employed in most of his movies. (Director-producer [[Yash Chopra]] cast Mahendra Kapoor's son in ''Faasle''.) One prominent thing about B. R. Chopra is the relatively low number of songs sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Mohammed Rafi]] in his films, with [[Asha Bhosle]] and [[Mahendra Kapoor]] being his preferred singers. The reason behind this was never revealed by him or the singers. Incidentally, both Chopra and Kapoor died within a gap of little longer than a month in 2008, with the latter dying first.\n\nChopra forayed into television with ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'', one of the most successful TV serials in Indian television history, where [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] played the role of [[Lord Krishna|Krishna]] and this was co-directed by him with his son.
