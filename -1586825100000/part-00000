Installation of the three [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s (SSMEs) on ''Atlantis'' was completed on 5 September 1995, as were closeout operations on the Russian docking module.\n\nOn 7 November, engineers determined that there was no additional work needed to verify the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] for flight, following discovery of small cracks in the hold-down posts attached to boosters that had flown earlier that year. Close inspections of the STS-74 stack determined that no such cracks were present on the boosters to be used for the mission.\n\nPad 39A was cleared on 9 November in preparation for loading of the onboard cryogenic tanks with the cryogenic [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] reactants that provided electricity through the three onboard fuel cells, and water for the flight as a by-product.\n\nThe initial launch attempt, scheduled for 11 November 1995 at 7:56&nbsp;am [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (12:56&nbsp;[[UTC]]) was postponed due to poor weather at the [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|Transatlantic Abort (TAL)]] site. The original launch window was 6&nbsp;min 57&nbsp;secs and the countdown had begun on schedule. The crew was on board when the postponement was called at the T-minus 5&nbsp;minute mark at approximately 7:51&nbsp;am EST (12:51&nbsp;UTC).<ref name=\"Summary\">\n{{cite web  | title = STS-74  | publisher=NASA| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-74/mission-sts-74.html}}\n</ref>\n\n==Mission timeline==\n\n===12 November (launch and flight day 1)===\n[[Image:STS-74 Launch.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' launches from pad 39A at the start of STS-74]]\nFollowing a poll of the mission management team at 7:12&nbsp;am EST in which all stations (with the exception of the Shuttle Range Officer) returned a \"go for launch\" and the eventual clearance of the range for launch at 7:20&nbsp;am EST, ''Atlantis'' raced into the sky at the beginning of a 10-minute, 9-second launch window following a flawless countdown with no unscheduled holds. The shuttle lifted off the pad at 7:30:43&nbsp;am EST; the main engines were shut down at 7:39&nbsp;am EST.\n\nAbout 43&nbsp;minutes after launch, a 2-minute and 13&nbsp;second engine firing changed the shuttle's path into a 162&nbsp;nautical mile circular orbit. Once on orbit, the five crew members began configuring ''Atlantis'' for on-orbit operations. ''Atlantis'''s payload bay doors were opened about 90&nbsp;minutes into the flight, followed by a \"go\" for on-orbit operations.\n\nApproximately three hours into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter's reaction control thrusters in the first of a series of rendezvous burns that refined ''Atlantis'''s path towards ''Mir''. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian mission specialist, Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built docking module, housed in the shuttle's payload bay, ready for the docking of the module with ''Atlantis''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Orbiter Docking System on flight day 2.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = STS-74 Day 1 Highlights\n  | publisher=NASA\n  | url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-74/sts-74-day-01-highlights.html}}\n</ref>\n\n===13 November (flight day 2)===\n\nThe five-member crew aboard the Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' spent the bulk of their first full day in space readying the orbiter and its payloads for the {{nowrap|14 November}} mating of the Russian docking module to the Orbiter Docking System in advance of the 15 November docking to ''Mir''. Both the module and the docking system were located in ''Atlantis'''s payload bay.\n\nMission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur inspected the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during the mating or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter's robot arm in preparation for the next day's transfer of the docking module over to ''Atlantis'''s docking system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.\n\nThe crew members also checked out the [[Advanced Space Vision System]], a precise alignment system for the robot arm that was tested on STS-74. The OSVS, which was used during the mating operation, consisted of a series of large dots placed on the exterior of the docking module and the docking system.\n\nThe day's schedule also included the installation and alignment of the centerline camera in the centre of the Orbiter Docking System. The camera later assisted Commander Ken Cameron in final piloting tasks as ''Atlantis'' moved towards and docked with Mir. At 5:00&nbsp;am [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CST]] (11:00&nbsp;UTC) on day 2, Atlantis was about 4,000&nbsp;statute miles behind ''Mir'', and was closing in to the space station at a rate of about 380&nbsp;statute miles per orbit.\n\nCameron, Hadfield and other available crew members also spent the morning answering questions posed by Canadian reporters located in Montreal and Toronto. Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut, was the fourth Canadian astronaut to fly on the shuttle.\n\nWith all of the systems that were to put the Russian Docking Module in place for a flight day 4 link-up with ''Mir'' checked out and ready to go, the STS-74 crew settled down for 8&nbsp;hours of sleep that afternoon.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = STS-74 Day 2 Highlights\n  | publisher=NASA\n  | url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-74/sts-74-day-02-highlights.html}}\n</ref>\n\n===14 November (flight day 3)===\n\n[[Image:Docking Module (STS-74).jpg|thumb|The ''Mir'' [[Mir Docking Module|Docking Module]], positioned in ''Atlantis'''s payload bay, ready to be docked to the ''[[Kristall]]'' module of space station ''Mir'']]\nOn flight day 3, the STS-74 crew members successfully mated the 15-foot Russian built docking module with the shuttle's Orbiter Docking System. No problems were reported during the mating operation.\n\nChris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut and STS-74 mission specialist, used the shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module out of the aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, and a series of hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.\n\nThe mating was confirmed at 1:17&nbsp;am CST, with ''Atlantis'' over eastern Europe on its 30th orbit. Shortly after the capture, Commander Ken Cameron expressed the crew's appreciation for the training that prepared them for the docking module installation.\n\nAt about 3:00&nbsp;am CST, the crew received a go from ground flight controllers to ungrapple the robot arm from the docking module. Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's cabin pressure from 10.2 pounds per square inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin's pressure was lowered in the event that a problem during the mating process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.\n\nCrew members also mounted a centerline camera into the top hatch of the docking module. The camera later provided the primary visual cue for Cameron as he maneuvered Atlantis to its docking with Mir on flight day four.\n\nBy 5:00&nbsp;am EST, Atlantis was trailing ''Mir'' by about 1,450 statute miles and closing at a rate of about 180 statute miles every orbit. A series of rendezvous jet firings later further refined the closing rate, leading up to a docking with Mir at 06:27:38&nbsp;UTC on 15 November.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = STS-74 Day 3 Highlights\n  | publisher=NASA\n  | url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-74/sts-74-day-03-highlights.html}}\n</ref>\n\n===15 November (flight day 4 and docking)===\n[[File:Mir-Shuttle diagram.svg|thumb|The final configuration of ''Mir'', showing the Docking Module with a docked Space Shuttle.]]\n''Atlantis'' finally docked to ''Mir's'' ''Kristall'' module using the docking module's top androgynous unit on flight day 4. The tension was high aboard ''Atlantis'' as Cameron maneuvered the shuttle towards ''Mir'' using the orbiter's thrusters. ''Atlantis'' docked with ''Mir'' at 06:27:38&nbsp;UTC following a faultless set of orbital maneuvers. After all the required checks had been completed and the hatches had been opened, the five shuttle astronauts moved into ''Mir'', ready to carry out three days of combined operations with ''Mir'''s resident crew, Russian cosmonauts [[Yuri Gidzenko]] and [[Sergei Avdeyev]] (carrying out the Mir EO-20 expedition) and ESA astronaut [[Thomas Reiter]] (flying on the [[Euromir]] 95 expedition).<ref>[[List of Mir Expeditions]]</ref> The two crews greeted each other with handshakes and hugs before carrying out a traditional gift exchange, with flowers and chocolates being swapped between the crews.<ref name=\"CSA Summary\"/>\n\n===16\u201319 November (flight days 5\u20138)===\n\nDuring the three days of combined Shuttle-Mir operations, ''Atlantis'''s crew transferred various items from the shuttle to the space station, including water, supplies, and equipment, along with two new solar arrays (one Russian and one jointly-developed) to upgrade ''Mir''.<ref>Due to a furlough of US government workers from 14\u201319 November 1995, mission status reports between those dates are not currently available, and as such specific information from [[NASA]] for flight days 4\u20138 is inaccessible.</ref>\n\nThe crew also transferred various experiment samples, equipment for repair and analysis and products manufactured on ''Mir'' back to ''Atlantis'' for transfer back to Earth, along with the [[University of California]] Berkeley Trek Experiment which had been flying on orbit aboard ''Mir'' for the previous four years.\n\nMeanwhile, flying aboard ''Atlantis'' was the GPP payload which consisted of two experiments \u2013 the GPP experiment and the Photogrammetric Appendage Structural Dynamics Experiment (PASDE). The payload was managed by [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]'s Special Payloads Division. The GPP studied the Earth's thermosphere, ionosphere and mesosphere energetics and dynamics using broadband spectroscopy. GPP also studied spacecraft interactions with the atmosphere by observing shuttle and ''Mir'' glow, shuttle engine firings, water dumps and fuel cell purges.\n\nThree PASDE canisters, located throughout the cargo bay, also photogrammetrically recorded structural response data of the ''Mir'' solar arrays during the docked phase of the mission. This data was later analyzed on the ground to verify the use of photogrammetric techniques to characterize the structural dynamics of the array, thus demonstrating that this technology would result in cost and risk reduction for the [[International Space Station]].\n\nAt 08:15:44&nbsp;UTC on 18 November, ''Atlantis'' undocked from the docking module's bottom androgynous unit, leaving the docking module permanently attached to the ''Kristall'' module, where it provided clearance between the shuttle and ''Mir'''s solar arrays during subsequent dockings.<ref name=\"Summary\"/>\n\n===20 November (flight day 9 and landing)===\n\nFlight day 9 consisted primarily of preparations for landing, and the landing itself. ''Atlantis'''s deorbit burn was performed on orbit 128 at around 11:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;EST (16:00&nbsp;UTC), leading to a landing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on Runway 33 of the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]].\n\n[[Image:STS-74 Landing.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' touches down at the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at the end of STS-74]]\n\nThe main landing gear touched down at 12:01:27&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EST (17:01:27&nbsp;UTC) on 20 November, a mission elapsed time (MET) of 8&nbsp;days 4&nbsp;hours 30&nbsp;minutes and 44&nbsp;seconds.

Installation of the three [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s (SSMEs) on ''Atlantis'' was completed on 5 September 1995, as were closeout operations on the Russian docking module.\n\nOn 7 November, engineers determined that there was no additional work needed to verify the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] for flight, following discovery of small cracks in the hold-down posts attached to boosters that had flown earlier that year. Close inspections of the STS-74 stack determined that no such cracks were present on the boosters to be used for the mission.\n\nPad 39A was cleared on 9 November in preparation for loading of the onboard cryogenic tanks with the cryogenic [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] reactants that provided electricity through the three onboard fuel cells, and water for the flight as a by-product.\n\nThe initial launch attempt, scheduled for 11 November 1995 at 7:56&nbsp;am [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (12:56&nbsp;[[UTC]]) was postponed due to poor weather at the [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|Transatlantic Abort (TAL)]] site. The original launch window was 6&nbsp;min 57&nbsp;secs and the countdown had begun on schedule. The crew was on board when the postponement was called at the T-minus 5&nbsp;minute mark at approximately 7:51&nbsp;am EST (12:51&nbsp;UTC).<ref name=\"Summary\">\n{{cite web  | title = STS-74  | publisher=NASA| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-74/mission-sts-74.html}}\n</ref>\n\n==Mission timeline==\n\n===12 November (launch and flight day 1)===\n[[Image:STS-74 Launch.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' launches from pad 39A at the start of STS-74]]\nFollowing a poll of the mission management team at 7:12&nbsp;am EST in which all stations (with the exception of the Shuttle Range Officer) returned a \"go for launch\" and the eventual clearance of the range for launch at 7:20&nbsp;am EST, ''Atlantis'' raced into the sky at the beginning of a 10-minute, 9-second launch window following a flawless countdown with no unscheduled holds. The shuttle lifted off the pad at 7:30:43&nbsp;am EST; the main engines were shut down at 7:39&nbsp;am EST.\n\nAbout 43&nbsp;minutes after launch, a 2-minute and 13&nbsp;second engine firing changed the shuttle's path into a 162&nbsp;nautical mile circular orbit. Once on orbit, the five crew members began configuring ''Atlantis'' for on-orbit operations. ''Atlantis'''s payload bay doors were opened about 90&nbsp;minutes into the flight, followed by a \"go\" for on-orbit operations.\n\nApproximately three hours into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter's reaction control thrusters in the first of a series of rendezvous burns that refined ''Atlantis'''s path towards ''Mir''. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian mission specialist, Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built docking module, housed in the shuttle's payload bay, ready for the docking of the module with ''Atlantis''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Orbiter Docking System on flight day 2.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = STS-74 Day 1 Highlights\n  | publisher=NASA\n  | url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-74/sts-74-day-01-highlights.html}}\n</ref>\n\n===13 November (flight day 2)===\n\nThe five-member crew aboard the Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' spent the bulk of their first full day in space readying the orbiter and its payloads for the {{nowrap|14 November}} mating of the Russian docking module to the Orbiter Docking System in advance of the 15 November docking to ''Mir''. Both the module and the docking system were located in ''Atlantis'''s payload bay.\n\nMission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur inspected the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during the mating or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter's robot arm in preparation for the next day's transfer of the docking module over to ''Atlantis'''s docking system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.\n\nThe crew members also checked out the [[Advanced Space Vision System]], a precise alignment system for the robot arm that was tested on STS-74. The OSVS, which was used during the mating operation, consisted of a series of large dots placed on the exterior of the docking module and the docking system.\n\nThe day's schedule also included the installation and alignment of the centerline camera in the centre of the Orbiter Docking System. The camera later assisted Commander Ken Cameron in final piloting tasks as ''Atlantis'' moved towards and docked with Mir. At 5:00&nbsp;am [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CST]] (11:00&nbsp;UTC) on day 2, Atlantis was about 4,000&nbsp;statute miles behind ''Mir'', and was closing in to the space station at a rate of about 380&nbsp;statute miles per orbit.\n\nCameron, Hadfield and other available crew members also spent the morning answering questions posed by Canadian reporters located in Montreal and Toronto. Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut, was the fourth Canadian astronaut to fly on the shuttle.\n\nWith all of the systems that were to put the Russian Docking Module in place for a flight day 4 link-up with ''Mir'' checked out and ready to go, the STS-74 crew settled down for 8&nbsp;hours of sleep that afternoon.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = STS-74 Day 2 Highlights\n  | publisher=NASA\n  | url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-74/sts-74-day-02-highlights.html}}\n</ref>\n\n===14 November (flight day 3)===\n\n[[Image:Docking Module (STS-74).jpg|thumb|The ''Mir'' [[Mir Docking Module|Docking Module]], positioned in ''Atlantis'''s payload bay, ready to be docked to the ''[[Kristall]]'' module of space station ''Mir'']]\nOn flight day 3, the STS-74 crew members successfully mated the 15-foot Russian built docking module with the shuttle's Orbiter Docking System. No problems were reported during the mating operation.\n\nChris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut and STS-74 mission specialist, used the shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module out of the aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, and a series of hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.\n\nThe mating was confirmed at 1:17&nbsp;am CST, with ''Atlantis'' over eastern Europe on its 30th orbit. Shortly after the capture, Commander Ken Cameron expressed the crew's appreciation for the training that prepared them for the docking module installation.\n\nAt about 3:00&nbsp;am CST, the crew received a go from ground flight controllers to ungrapple the robot arm from the docking module. Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's cabin pressure from 10.2 pounds per square inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin's pressure was lowered in the event that a problem during the mating process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.\n\nCrew members also mounted a centerline camera into the top hatch of the docking module. The camera later provided the primary visual cue for Cameron as he maneuvered Atlantis to its docking with Mir on flight day four.\n\nBy 5:00&nbsp;am EST, Atlantis was trailing ''Mir'' by about 1,450 statute miles and closing at a rate of about 180 statute miles every orbit. A series of rendezvous jet firings later further refined the closing rate, leading up to a docking with Mir at 06:27:38&nbsp;UTC on 15 November.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = STS-74 Day 3 Highlights\n  | publisher=NASA\n  | url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-74/sts-74-day-03-highlights.html}}\n</ref>\n\n===15 November (flight day 4 and docking)===\n[[File:Mir-Shuttle diagram.svg|thumb|The final configuration of ''Mir'', showing the Docking Module with a docked Space Shuttle.]]\n''Atlantis'' finally docked to ''Mir's'' ''Kristall'' module using the docking module's top androgynous unit on flight day 4. The tension was high aboard ''Atlantis'' as Cameron maneuvered the shuttle towards ''Mir'' using the orbiter's thrusters. ''Atlantis'' docked with ''Mir'' at 06:27:38&nbsp;UTC following a faultless set of orbital maneuvers. After all the required checks had been completed and the hatches had been opened, the five shuttle astronauts moved into ''Mir'', ready to carry out three days of combined operations with ''Mir'''s resident crew, Russian cosmonauts [[Yuri Gidzenko]] and [[Sergei Avdeyev]] (carrying out the Mir EO-20 expedition) and ESA astronaut [[Thomas Reiter]] (flying on the [[Euromir]] 95 expedition).<ref>[[List of Mir Expeditions]]</ref> The two crews greeted each other with handshakes and hugs before carrying out a traditional gift exchange, with flowers and chocolates being swapped between the crews.<ref name=\"CSA Summary\"/>\n\n===16\u201319 November (flight days 5\u20138)===\n\nDuring the three days of combined Shuttle-Mir operations, ''Atlantis'''s crew transferred various items from the shuttle to the space station, including water, supplies, and equipment, along with two new solar arrays (one Russian and one jointly-developed) to upgrade ''Mir''.<ref>Due to a furlough of US government workers from 14\u201319 November 1995, mission status reports between those dates are not currently available, and as such specific information from [[NASA]] for flight days 4\u20138 is inaccessible.</ref>\n\nThe crew also transferred various experiment samples, equipment for repair and analysis and products manufactured on ''Mir'' back to ''Atlantis'' for transfer back to Earth, along with the [[University of California]] Berkeley Trek Experiment which had been flying on orbit aboard ''Mir'' for the previous four years.\n\nMeanwhile, flying aboard ''Atlantis'' was the GPP payload which consisted of two experiments \u2013 the GPP experiment and the Photogrammetric Appendage Structural Dynamics Experiment (PASDE). The payload was managed by [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]'s Special Payloads Division. The GPP studied the Earth's thermosphere, ionosphere and mesosphere energetics and dynamics using broadband spectroscopy. GPP also studied spacecraft interactions with the atmosphere by observing shuttle and ''Mir'' glow, shuttle engine firings, water dumps and fuel cell purges.\n\nThree PASDE canisters, located throughout the cargo bay, also photogrammetrically recorded structural response data of the ''Mir'' solar arrays during the docked phase of the mission. This data was later analyzed on the ground to verify the use of photogrammetric techniques to characterize the structural dynamics of the array, thus demonstrating that this technology would result in cost and risk reduction for the [[International Space Station]].\n\nAt 08:15:44&nbsp;UTC on 18 November, ''Atlantis'' undocked from the docking module's bottom androgynous unit, leaving the docking module permanently attached to the ''Kristall'' module, where it provided clearance between the shuttle and ''Mir'''s solar arrays during subsequent dockings.<ref name=\"Summary\"/>\n\n===20 November (flight day 9 and landing)===\n\nFlight day 9 consisted primarily of preparations for landing, and the landing itself. ''Atlantis'''s deorbit burn was performed on orbit 128 at around 11:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;EST (16:00&nbsp;UTC), leading to a landing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on Runway 33 of the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]].\n\n[[Image:STS-74 Landing.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' touches down at the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at the end of STS-74]]\n\nThe main landing gear touched down at 12:01:27&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EST (17:01:27&nbsp;UTC) on 20 November, a mission elapsed time (MET) of 8&nbsp;days 4&nbsp;hours 30&nbsp;minutes and 44&nbsp;seconds.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Beilbacher", "label": "safe", "comment": "\"The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back.\" This sentence comes off in a strange manner.

He will have a mole on his cheek, the sign of the prophet on his shoulder, and be recognized by the caliphate while he sits in his own home.

The Mahdi will bring back worship of true Islamic values, and bring the [[Ark of the Covenant]] to light. He will conquer [[Istanbul]] and [[Gilan Province|Mount Daylam]] and will regard Jerusalem and the Dome as his home.

Historically, Sunni Islam considers religious authority as being derived from the caliph, who was appointed by the companions of Muhammad at his death and the [[sahaba|companions of Muhammad]]. The Sunnis view the Mahdi as the successor of Mohammad; the Mahdi is expected to arrive to rule the world and reestablish righteousness.<ref name=\"Arjomand 20072\">{{cite journal|last=Arjomand|first=Said Amir|date=Dec 2007|title=Islam in Iran vi., the Concept of Mahdi in Sunni Islam|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/islam-in-iran-vi-the-concept-of-mahdi-in-sunni-islam|journal=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=XIV|issue=Fasc. 2|pages=134\u2013136}}</ref> Some Sunnis share a belief that there may be no actual Mahdi, but that a series of mujaddid will instead lead to an Islamic revolution of a renewal of faith and avoidance of deviation from God's path. Sunni tradition has attributed such intellectual and spiritual attributes to numerous Muslims at the end of each Muslim century from the origin of Islam to the present day.<ref name=\"Waldman\"/> This classical interpretation is favored by Sunni scholars like [[Ghazali]].{{Citation needed|reason=How can we know, which was a favorite interpretation or which scholars represents the classical opinnion without scholars, who analized it?|date=February 2019}}\n\nContrarily, Shia Islam vested religious authority in those of the bloodline of Muhammad, favoring his cousin and son by marriage, Ali. Ali was appointed the first Imam; and according to [[Twelver]] interpretation, he was followed by eleven more. [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], otherwise known as the Twelfth Imam, went into hiding in 873 at the age of four. His father was [[Hasan al-Askari|al-`Askari]], who had been murdered; and so he was hidden from the authorities of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. He maintained contact with his followers until 940, when he entered [[the Occultation]]. Twelverism believes that al-Mahdi is the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|current Imam]], and will emerge at the end of the current age. Some scholars say that, although unnoticed by others present, the Mahdi of Twelver Islam continues to make an annual pilgrimage while he resides outside of Mecca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0223?_hi=0&_pos=1#TheMahd|title=Eschatology|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|work=Oxford Islamic Studies|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islamic Studies (subscription required).}}</ref>  In contradistinction, Sunni Islam foresees him as a separate and new person.<ref name=\"Red2\">{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00605KLP8/ref=docs-os-doi_0|title=Islam and the Last days|last=Rogers|first=Ed|date=26 Oct 2011|publisher=Connection Publishing}}</ref> The present Ayatollahs of Iran see themselves as joint caretakers of the office of the Imam until he returns.<ref>{{cite book|title=No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam|last1=Aslan|first1=Reza|publisher=Random House|year=2006|isbn=1-4000-6213-6|location=New York|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title-link=No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi is not described in the Quran, only in the hadith, with scholars suggesting he arose when Arabian tribes were settling in Syria under Muawiya. \"They anticipated 'the Mahdi who will lead the rising people of the Yemen back to their country' in order to restore the glory of their lost Himyarite kingdom.

While for Shias, the Mahdi will be the savior, some Sunnis tended to expect Jesus' return. During the early [[Abbasid Caliphate]], wearing crucifixes in proccesions and holding pigs in public, was forbidden. Otherwise, the breaking of the cross, might reflect general disapproval of this symbol by Muslims, and slaying pigs a reference to Jesus exorcism of [[Legion (demons)|Legion]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Shia eschatology ==\n{{Main|Shia eschatology}}\nVarious eschatological interpretations exist within Shia Islam.

It is directed to the individual and \"the basis of faith and deeds,\" not gender. This is consistent in the Qur'an. Amina Wadud goes on to discuss paradise, and how the Quran describes it with such detail in order to \"entice\" the readers and make it sound pleasing.

Historically, Sunni Islam considers religious authority as being derived from the caliph, who was appointed by the companions of Muhammad at his death and the [[sahaba|companions of Muhammad]]. The Sunnis view the Mahdi as the successor of Mohammad; the Mahdi is expected to arrive to rule the world and reestablish righteousness.<ref name=\"Arjomand 20072\">{{cite journal|last=Arjomand|first=Said Amir|date=Dec 2007|title=Islam in Iran vi., the Concept of Mahdi in Sunni Islam|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/islam-in-iran-vi-the-concept-of-mahdi-in-sunni-islam|journal=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=XIV|issue=Fasc. 2|pages=134\u2013136}}</ref> Some Sunnis share a belief that there may be no actual Mahdi, but that a series of mujaddid will instead lead to an Islamic revolution of a renewal of faith and avoidance of deviation from God's path. Sunni tradition has attributed such intellectual and spiritual attributes to numerous Muslims at the end of each Muslim century from the origin of Islam to the present day.<ref name=\"Waldman\"/> This classical interpretation is favored by Sunni scholars like [[Ghazali]].{{Citation needed|reason=How can we know, which was a favorite interpretation or which scholars represents the classical opinnion without scholars, who analized it?|date=February 2019}}\n\nContrarily, Shi'a Islam vested religious authority in those of the bloodline of Muhammad, favoring his cousin and son by marriage, Ali. Ali was appointed the first Imam; and according to [[Twelver]] interpretation, he was followed by eleven more. [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], otherwise known as the Twelfth Imam, went into hiding in 873 at the age of four. His father was [[Hasan al-Askari|al-`Askari]], who had been murdered; and so he was hidden from the authorities of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. He maintained contact with his followers until 940, when he entered [[the Occultation]]. Twelverism believes that al-Mahdi is the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|current Imam]], and will emerge at the end of the current age. Some scholars say that, although unnoticed by others present, the Mahdi of Twelver Islam continues to make an annual pilgrimage while he resides outside of Mecca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0223?_hi=0&_pos=1#TheMahd|title=Eschatology|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|work=Oxford Islamic Studies|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islamic Studies (subscription required).}}</ref>  In contradistinction, Sunni Islam foresees him as a separate and new person.<ref name=\"Red2\">{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00605KLP8/ref=docs-os-doi_0|title=Islam and the Last days|last=Rogers|first=Ed|date=26 Oct 2011|publisher=Connection Publishing}}</ref> The present Ayatollahs of Iran see themselves as joint caretakers of the office of the Imam until he returns.<ref>{{cite book|title=No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam|last1=Aslan|first1=Reza|publisher=Random House|year=2006|isbn=1-4000-6213-6|location=New York|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title-link=No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi is not described in the Quran, only in the hadith, with scholars suggesting he arose when Arabian tribes were settling in Syria under Muawiya. \"They anticipated 'the Mahdi who will lead the rising people of the Yemen back to their country' in order to restore the glory of their lost Himyarite kingdom.

Amina Wadud discusses Hell and Paradise in her book \"Qur'an and Woman\" very briefly. Wadud mentions that the Qur'an does not mention any specific gender when talking about Hell. All genders have an equal chance and consequence to experience hell and one is not over the other. The Qur'an 43:74-76 states that \"the guilty are immortal in hell's torment,\" not he or she. It is directed to the individual and \"the basis of faith and deeds,\" not gender. This is consistent in the Qur'an. Amina Wadud goes on to discuss paradise, and how the Quran describes it with such detail in order to \"entice\" the readers and make it sound pleasing. Wadud states what the Quran says about good earthly things, and eternal things which includes women. 3:14-15 states \"Beautiful of mankind is love of the joys (that come) from women and offspring...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Qur\u02bcan and woman : rereading the sacred text from a woman's perspective|last=Wadud, Amina|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198029434|edition= [2nd ed.]|location=New York|oclc=252662926}}</ref><ref>Qur\u02bcan and woman : rereading the sacred text from a woman's perspective ([2nd.] ed.).

This debate has been going on for centuries, however several Muslim theologicans agree that Islam is the only path, no other religion, even the other Abrahamic faiths, are proper paths to salvation.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although the Quran acknowledges the Bible as gospel, rejecting Muhammad and his message is seen as a rejection of salvation by them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Between heaven and hell : Islam, salvation, and the fate of others|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Khalil, Mohammad Hassan.|isbn=9780199945412|location=Oxford|pages=113|oclc=793726652}}</ref> Yet, Muslim scholars [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Rashid Rida]] disagree with the notion that the [[People of the Book]] are excluded from [[Jannah]], with reference to Quran 4:123-124.<ref name=\"khoury\">Der Koran, publ. and transl. by [[Adel Theodor Khoury]], G\u00fctersloh 2004, p. 67 (footnote).</ref>\n\n=== The fate of Jews ===\nThe Quran makes a variety of statements on the state of the Jewish community, praising their dedication to monotheism in one line and criticizing their rejection of Muhammad the next.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Between heaven and hell : Islam, salvation, and the fate of others|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Khalil, Mohammad Hassan.|isbn=9780199945412|location=Oxford|pages=207|oclc=793726652}}</ref> An example of a line criticizing the Jews can be found at 5:60-61: \"Say, 'Shall I inform you of something worse than that by way of recompense from God? Whomsoever God has cursed and upon whom is His Wrath, and among whom He has made some to be apes and swine, and who worship false deities, such are in a worse situation, and further astray from the right way.' When they come to you, they say, 'We believe.' But they are certainly entered with disbelief and they have certainly left with it, and God knows best what they were concealing.
