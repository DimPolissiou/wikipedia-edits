Announced on April 15, 2020, the iPhone SE serves as a successor to both the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]] and the [[iPhone 8]] series.\n\nThe second-generation SE shares the dimensions and form factor of the iPhone 8 (including its bezel and physical home button with [[Touch ID]]), but shares hardware components from the [[iPhone 11]] lineup, including the [[Apple A13]] processor (instead of the [[Apple A11|A11]] found in the iPhone 8). This follows the pattern set by the first-generation SE (which shared the dimensions and form factor of the older [[iPhone 5S]] but used the processor and camera of the newer [[iPhone 6S]]).\n\nAs with the previous SE, the new phone is positioned as an entry-level iPhone, lacking for instance the edge-to-edge display, gesture navigation, and [[Face ID]] of the higher-end models such as the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro|11 Pro/Pro Max]].\n\n== History ==\nA successor to the first-generation iPhone SE had been a source of rumour since 2017, the year after the device was released.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/22/iphone-se-2-release-date-first-half-2018/ |title = iPhone SE 2 Again Rumored to Launch in First Half of 2018 |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 }}</ref> The name was also subject to speculation.

Announced on April 15, 2020, the iPhone SE serves as a successor to both the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]] and the [[iPhone 8]] series.\n\nThe second-generation SE shares the dimensions and form factor of the iPhone 8 (including its bezel and physical home button with [[Touch ID]]), but shares hardware components from the [[iPhone 11]] lineup, including the [[Apple A13]] processor (instead of the [[Apple A11|A11]] found in the iPhone 8). This follows the pattern set by the first-generation SE (which shared the dimensions and form factor of the older [[iPhone 5S]] but used the processor and camera of the newer [[iPhone 6S]]).\n\nAs with the previous SE, the new phone is positioned as an entry-level iPhone, lacking for instance the edge-to-edge display, gesture navigation, and [[Face ID]] of the higher-end models such as the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro|11 Pro/Pro Max]].\n\n== History ==\nA successor to the first-generation iPhone SE had been a source of rumour since 2017, the year after the device was released.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/22/iphone-se-2-release-date-first-half-2018/ |title = iPhone SE 2 Again Rumored to Launch in First Half of 2018 |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 }}</ref> The name was also subject to speculation.

The album features an acoustic performance recorded at [[Sony Music Studios]] in New York City on November 18, 1993, for the television series ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. The show was directed by [[Beth McCarthy-Miller|Beth McCarthy]] and aired on the cable television network [[MTV]] on December 16, 1993. In a break with ''MTV Unplugged'' convention, Nirvana played mainly lesser-known material and covers of songs by the [[The Vaselines|Vaselines]], [[David Bowie]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Meat Puppets]], whose members [[Cris Kirkwood|Cris]] and [[Curt Kirkwood]] joined Nirvana onstage.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of another live album'', [[Verse Chorus Verse (Nirvana album)|Verse Chorus Verse]], MTV Unplugged in New York'' was the first Nirvana album released following the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain|death of Kurt Cobain]]. It debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and is Nirvana's most successful posthumous release, having been certified [[Platinum album|5x Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 1997.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=4&table=tblTop100&action= Search \"Nirvana\" -RIAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018181243/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=4&table=tblTop100&action= |date=2015-10-18 }} riaa.com.

The rehearsals were tense and difficult, with the band running into problems performing various songs. During the sessions, Cobain disagreed with MTV about the performance. Producer [[Alex Coletti]] recalled that the network was unhappy with the lack of hit Nirvana songs, and with the choice of the Meat Puppets as guests, saying: \"They wanted to hear the 'right' names - [[Eddie Vedder]] or [[Tori Amos]] or God knows who.\"<ref name=\"guitarworld95\">di Perna, Alan. \"Season Finale\". ''Guitar World''. March 1995.</ref> \n\nThe day before filming, Cobain refused to play, but he appeared at the studio the following afternoon. Cobain was suffering from [[drug withdrawal]] and nervousness at the time; one observer said, \"There was no joking, no smiles, no fun coming from him&nbsp;... everyone was more than a little worried about his performance.\"<ref name=\"Cross302\" />\n\n== Recording ==\nNirvana taped their performance on November 18, 1993, at Sony Studios in New York City. Cobain suggested that the stage be decorated with [[Lilium 'Stargazer'|stargazer lilies]], black candles, and a crystal [[chandelier]]. The show's producer asked him, \"You mean like a funeral?\", to which Cobain replied, \"Exactly. Like a funeral.\"<ref name=\"Cross304\">Cross, p. 304</ref> \n\nNirvana was augmented by guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and cellist [[Lori Goldston]], who had been touring with the band. Despite the show's acoustic premise, Cobain insisted on running his acoustic guitar through his [[amplifier]] and [[effects pedals]].

The album features an acoustic performance recorded at [[Sony Music Studios]] in New York City on November 18, 1993, for the television series ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. The show was directed by [[Beth McCarthy-Miller|Beth McCarthy]] and aired on the cable television network [[MTV]] on December 16, 1993. In a break with ''MTV Unplugged'' convention, Nirvana played mainly lesser-known material and covers of songs by the [[The Vaselines|Vaselines]], [[David Bowie]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Meat Puppets]], whose members [[Cris Kirkwood|Cris]] and [[Curt Kirkwood]] joined Nirvana onstage.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of another live album'', [[Verse Chorus Verse (Nirvana album)|Verse Chorus Verse]], MTV Unplugged in New York'' was the first Nirvana album released following the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain|death of Kurt Cobain]]. It debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and is Nirvana's most successful posthumous release, having been certified [[Platinum album|5x Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 1997.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=4&table=tblTop100&action= Search \"Nirvana\" -RIAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018181243/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=4&table=tblTop100&action= |date=2015-10-18 }} riaa.com.

Among the ideas the band members came up with included covering [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[The Man Who Sold the World (song)#Nirvana version|The Man Who Sold the World]]\" and inviting members of the Meat Puppets to join them on stage.<ref>Scaggs, Austin. \"[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7483596/on_an_honor_roll On an Honor Roll] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409032451/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7483596/on_an_honor_roll |date=2010-04-09 }}\".

The rehearsals were tense and difficult, with the band running into problems performing various songs. During the sessions, Cobain disagreed with MTV about the performance. Producer [[Alex Coletti]] recalled that the network was unhappy with the lack of hit Nirvana songs, and with the choice of the Meat Puppets as guests, saying: \"They wanted to hear the 'right' names - [[Eddie Vedder]] or [[Tori Amos]] or God knows who.\"<ref name=\"guitarworld95\">di Perna, Alan. \"Season Finale\". ''Guitar World''. March 1995.</ref> \n\nThe day before filming, Cobain refused to play, but he appeared at the studio the following afternoon. Cobain was suffering from [[drug withdrawal]] and nervousness at the time; one observer said, \"There was no joking, no smiles, no fun coming from him&nbsp;... everyone was more than a little worried about his performance.\"<ref name=\"Cross302\" />\n\n== Recording ==\nNirvana taped their performance on November 18, 1993, at Sony Studios in New York City. Cobain suggested that the stage be decorated with [[Lilium 'Stargazer'|stargazer lilies]], black candles, and a crystal [[chandelier]]. The show's producer asked him, \"You mean like a funeral?\", to which Cobain replied, \"Exactly. Like a funeral.\"<ref name=\"Cross304\">Cross, p. 304</ref> \n\nNirvana was augmented by guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and cellist [[Lori Goldston]], who had been touring with the band. Despite the show's acoustic premise, Cobain insisted on running his acoustic guitar through his [[amplifier]] and [[effects pedals]]. Coletti built a fake box in front of the amplifier to disguise it as a [[stage monitor system|monitor wedge]]. Coletti said, \"It was Kurt's security blanket. He was used to hearing this guitar through his [[Fender amplifier|Fender]]. He wanted those effects. You can hear it on 'The Man Who Sold the World'. It's an acoustic guitar, but he's obviously going through an amp.\"<ref name=\"guitarworld95\" />\n\nUnlike many artists who appeared on the show, Nirvana filmed the entire performance in a single take.<ref name=\"Witness\">\"Bare Witness: Nirvana Unplugged\".

The set ended with a performance of the traditional song \"[[In the Pines#Mark Lanegan/Nirvana|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]]\", following the arrangement of [[blues]] musician [[Lead Belly]], whom Cobain described before the song as \"his favorite performer ever\". After the band finished, Cobain argued with the show's producers, who wanted an encore.
