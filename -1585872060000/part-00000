The Fairfax County School Board, citing costs and declining enrollment as causes, decided to close Fort Hunt and combine the schools on Groveton's site under a new name.\n\nThe school's facilities have been expanded significantly since the merger, with two wings added to the main building over the intervening years. The old Groveton High School on Popkins Lane (opened in 1956) houses the [[Bryant Alternative High School]]; the site of Fort Hunt High school (opened in 1963) became [[Carl Sandburg Middle School]], which is the middle school that feeds into West Potomac. The new Groveton High School was built on the site of the former Bryant Intermediate School and opened in 1976. \n\nIn its inaugural year, the school adopted the motto \"The Tradition Begins Now.\" After several years, it was modified to \"Excellence is a Tradition\". A rivalry with neighboring [[Mount Vernon High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Mount Vernon High School]] exists because of their close proximity. Historically Groveton and Ft. Hunt were rivals, Groveton also was an athletic rival with nearby [[T. C. Williams High School]] in Alexandria; their football games for a very long time were only scheduled on Saturday afternoons rather than Friday nights partly because the field at T.C. Williams had no lights. The 1971 Groveton vs T.C. Williams game was portrayed in the movie ''[[Remember the Titans]]''.\n\nThe West Potomac school mascot is a wolverine. The school's colors are blue, white, and silver.\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the 2017-18 school year, West Potomac High School's student body was 38.65% White, 16.31% Black, 34.76% Hispanic or Latino, 6.75% Asian and 3.53% Other. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://schoolprofiles.fcps.edu/schlprfl/f?p=108:13:::NO::P0_CURRENT_SCHOOL_ID,P0_EDSL:200,0|title=FCPS - School Profiles - West Potomac HS - Demographics|website=schoolprofiles.fcps.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nIn the 2003 season, the Boys and Girls Crew team had their 1st and 2nd 4 man boat place 1st in the Virginia state championship.\n\nIn the 2004-05 season, the Boys Track team won the regional title.

A 18-year-old teenager who used to live at an orphanage before the caretakers threw him out. Their words condemning him as \"worthless\" have since left trauma on him and drive his will to fight in order to find a reason to live, slowly gaining confidence as the series progresses. His ability is named {{nihongo|Beast Beneath the Moonlight|\u6708\u4e0b\u7363|Gekkaj\u016b}}, which allows him to turn into a large white tiger with incredible strength, speed, regenerative capabilities and durability, although he has no control over it and retains no memory if he fully transforms (this lack of control is however repressed when he joins the Agency and the ability of the Agency's president causes Atsushi to regain control over the tiger). Later, he learns to change his limbs to that of a tiger to enhance his physical abilities.

Under his carefree and relaxed demeanor, however, Dazai is extremely cunning, intelligent, skilled and brutal, once having been a feared executive of Port Mafia.

Dazai's partner, known for his meticulous planning, organisation and perfectionistic tendencies. He has a habit of writing and planning everything ahead in his signature notebook, with the front cover labelled \"Ideals\". This notebook is linked to his ability, {{nihongo|Lone Poet|\u72ec\u6b69\u541f\u5ba2|Doppo Ginkaku}}, which allows him to bring into existence any object he writes inside, as long as it isn't larger than the notebook itself.\n\n===Ranpo Edogawa===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Ranpo Edogawa]]|\u6c5f\u6238\u5ddd \u4e71\u6b69|Edogawa Ranpo}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]]<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Vic Mignogna]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/FUNimation/status/947923638086459393|title=We're also excited to share that Rampo Edogawa will be voiced by @vicmignogna! #BungoStrayDogs|last=Funimation|website=@FUNimation|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref><ref name=\"MainDubCast\"/> (seasons 1-2), Landon McDonald (season 3; ''Dead Apple'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/05/14/bungo-stray-dogs-3rd-season-dub-is-coming-to-crunchyroll|title=Bungo Stray Dogs 3rd Season Dub is Coming to Crunchyroll!|last=Author|first=Guest|website=Crunchyroll|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>}}\n:Named after [[Edogawa Ranpo]]. The only Agency member without an ability and a self-proclaimed detective. Although he is one of the oldest in the office, he lacks basic everyday skills, preferring to focus his intelligence on solving cases instead. His prodigious observational and deduction skills are nicknamed {{nihongo|Super Deduction|\u8d85\u63a8\u7406|Ch\u014d suiri}} by him, which are supposedly activated when he puts on his glasses.\n\n===Junichir\u014d Tanizaki===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Junichir\u014d Tanizaki]]|\u8c37\u5d0e \u6f64\u4e00\u90ce|Tanizaki Jun'ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Toyonaga]]<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Spike Spencer]]<ref name=\"MainDubCast\"/>}}\n: Named after [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]]. An 18-year-old assistant at the Agency who mainly focuses on gathering information as his ability, {{nihongo|Light Snow|\u7d30\u96ea|[[Sasameyuki]]}}, allows him to project illusions within a certain area, which is not extremely suited for combat. He cohabits with his younger sister Naomi and treasures her dearly, despite finding some of her antics annoying.\n\n===Kenji Miyazawa===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Kenji Miyazawa]]|\u5bae\u6ca2 \u8ce2\u6cbb|Miyazawa Kenji}}\n:{{voiced by|Hiroyuki Kagura<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Lucien Dodge]]<ref name=\"MainDubCast\"/>}}\n: Named after [[Kenji Miyazawa]]. A 14-year-old optimistic and carefree boy hailing from the countryside, he is extremely popular among Yokohama residents due to his honesty and cheerful attitude. This makes him the Agency's primary data collector from eyewitnesses. His ability is called {{nihongo|Undefeated by the Rain|\u96e8\u30cb\u30e2\u30de\u30b1\u30ba|[[Ame ni mo Makezu]]}}, which grants him superhuman strength when he's hungry.\n\n===Akiko Yosano===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Akiko Yosano]]|\u4e0e\u8b1d\u91ce \u6676\u5b50|Yosano Akiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]]<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Erica Lindbeck]]<ref name=\"MainDubCast\"/>}}\n: Named after [[Yosano Akiko]].

His ability is {{nihongo|All Men Are Created Equal|\u4eba\u4e0a\u4eba\u4e0d\u9020|Hito no Ue ni Hito wo Tsukurazu}}, which allows him to control the abilities of his subordinates. This ability is especially useful for those who lack control over their abilities like Atsushi and Ky\u014dka.\n\n===Ky\u014dka Izumi===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Ky\u014dka Izumi]]|\u6cc9 \u93e1\u82b1|Izumi Ky\u014dka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Sumire Morohoshi]]<ref name=\"ann-96831\"/>|[[Cherami Leigh]]}}\n:Named after [[Ky\u014dka Izumi]]. A 14-year-old orphan girl who was taken in by the Port Mafia and became their youngest assassin. Her ability, {{nihongo|Demon Snow|\u591c\u53c9\u767d\u96ea|Yasha Shirayuki}}, materializes Demon Snow, a ruthless sword-wielding phantom that only follows orders coming from her mobile phone, which allowed Akutagawa to control her ability in the past. Her parents used to be assassins as well until an enemy attempted to use a body manipulation ability on them. Ky\u014dka's mother, who at that time owned Demon Snow, killed her husband and subsequently herself as she was gradually succumbing to the ability, her last words ordering the phantom to protect her daughter and passing on this ability. However, this technique of doing so was incomplete, which resulted in Demon Snow only listening to orders from the phone.\n\n===Kirako Haruno===\n;{{Nihongo|Kirako Haruno|\u6625\u91ce \u7dba\u7f85\u5b50|Haruno Kirako}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mina (voice actress)|Mina]]|Abby Trott}}\n: A clerk working at the Armed Detective Agency.\n\n===Naomi Tanizaki===\n;{{Nihongo|Naomi Tanizaki|\u8c37\u5d0e \u30ca\u30aa\u30df|Tanizaki Naomi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Chiaki Omigawa]]<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Erica Lindbeck]]}}\n: Junichir\u014d's sister who has a brother complex and frequently likes to tease him.

Her parents used to be assassins as well until an enemy attempted to use a body manipulation ability on them. Ky\u014dka's mother, who at that time owned Demon Snow, killed her husband and subsequently herself as she was gradually succumbing to the ability, her last words ordering the phantom to protect her daughter and passing on this ability.
