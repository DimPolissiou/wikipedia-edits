Formis was a pioneer of the German amateur radio movement. During the period of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule in Germany]], he transmitted anti-Nazi radio broadcasts from [[Czechoslovakia]] for the [[Black Front]] organisation, using a self-built [[shortwave radio]]. Formis was murdered by the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] on the orders of [[Reinhard Heydrich]].<ref name=\"MEM\">{{cite web |title=Rudolf Formis |url=https://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/biographie/view-bio/rudolf-formis/?no_cache=1 |website=Gedenkst\u00e4tte Deutscher Widerstand |publisher=Memorial of German Resistance |accessdate=2 July 2018 |date=1996}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nFormis came from a middle-class Stuttgart family. His grandfather, [[Christian Friedrich von Leins]], was a well-known architect, who designed the [[Villa Berg]] in [[Stuttgart]], among others. In [[World War I]], Formis belonged to the German [[Asia Corps]] and fought alongside [[Ottoman Empire]] troops in [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. After the war, Formis demonstrated his advanced capabilities in the field of [[Wireless telegraphy|radiotelegraphy]] when he built a short-wave transmitter that was capable of communicating with the United States. In the spring of 1923, this enabled Formis to gain employment at S\u00dcRAG, where he built the first transmission systems for the company. He worked at the company for over 10 years and reached the position of technical director for South German Radio<ref name=\"MEM\"/>\n\nIn 1925 Formis introduced the German amateur radio designation DE (DE = German receiving station). Formis himself had the mark ''DE 0100''. His call sign as a broadcast amateur was ''K-Y4''. In 1928, at [[Castle Solitude]] near Stuttgart, he built a remote receiving station for S\u00dcRAG, which supplied the transmission of reports from overseas. From January 1932 Formis was head of the S\u00dcRAG technical department.<ref>{{cite web |title=Organizational charts of broadcasting in the Weimar Republic 1924-1933 - S\u00fcddeutsche Rundfunk AG (S\u00dcRAG) |url=http://www.dra.de/rundfunkgeschichte/radiogeschichte/organisation/pdf/SUERAG_1924-1933.pdf |website=German Radio Archive |publisher=DRA |accessdate=3 July 2018 |page=10 |language=German |format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power, Formis became a member of the [[Sturmabteilung]] on 7 March 1933, and as an SA member took part in the occupation of the [[:de:Stuttgarter Funkhaus|Stuttgart Radio House]]. He gave a speech in support of the National Socialists without previously being publicly known as a national socialist, and turned against the previous director Bofinger. Formis later came into conflict with the Nazis, as his grandmother, the wife of Christian Friedrich von Leins, was [[Jews|Jewish]]. One account also cited that he became disillusioned during the course of the Nazi revolution and that, as a dramatic protest, he cut the landline of the radio broadcasting one of Hitler's public addresses so that the transmission of his three-hour speech to millions of Germans listening at home went dead.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heydrich, Hitler's Most Evil Henchman|last=Wighton|first=Charles|publisher=Arcole Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9781787206809|location=|pages=}}</ref> For this action, he was arrested and beaten by the [[Gestapo]].

Formis directed the distribution of Strasser's newspaper, ''Die Deutsche Revolution'' (The German Revolution) and built an underground broadcasting station in the former Hotel Z\u00e1ho\u0159\u00ed near [[Slapy nad Vltavou]] in November 1934. The shortwave transmitter had been built by Formis and was brought from his Stuttgart workshop to [[Czechoslovakia]] by himself or his friends.

The program included appeals against the Nazi regime, replies to Nazi propaganda and calls for resistance and sabotage. In addition, management reports from Strasser were broadcast, in which he also tried to ridicule the [[Nazi Party]]. Strasser used his knowledge of leading Nazis from the time of his party membership before 1930, a circumstance that should have put Hitler in a special position.

The German-language ''[[Parisian Tageblatt]]'' newspaper cited the Prague-based newspaper ''[[Venkov]]'', stating it was \"crimes of this kind which unmask the true soul of Hitler's Germany\". Writer [[Fritz Erpenbeck]] attacked the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' for the murder in his 1939 novel ''[[Emigranten]]'' and portrayed Formis under the name \"Dormler\". On 18 July 1941, the [[BBC]] broadcast a radio play about the murder. Formis is considered a hero within the community of amateur Czech radio operators.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe radio station used by Rudolf Formis was preserved for posterity.

Naujocks was interned after the war, and later interrogated by a British-Czech commission, but escaped internment in 1946.{{clarify|reason=Did he escape internment, or was he interned after the war?|date=August 2018}} In 1961, the German authorities investigated Formis' death, but never charged Naujocks with Formis's death in April 1966.{{clarify|reason=What happened in 1966?

The German-language ''[[Parisian Tageblatt]]'' newspaper cited the Prague-based newspaper ''[[Venkov]]'', stating it was \"crimes of this kind which unmask the true soul of Hitler's Germany\". Writer [[Fritz Erpenbeck]] attacked the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' for the murder in his 1939 novel ''[[Emigranten]]'' and portrayed Formis under the name \"Dormler\". On 18 July 1941, the [[BBC]] broadcast a radio play about the murder. Formis is considered a hero within the community of amateur Czech radio operators.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe radio station used by Rudolf Formis was preserved for posterity.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''').

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

restrictive RKI testing criteria, Germans without any or unspecific symptoms could not be tested until late March.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020 |work=Die Welt |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.

Fairchild purchased property on the south side of Route 24-Conklin Street and had the airport's original layout plan prepared on November 3, 1927.\n\nThe {{convert|77.967|acre|m2|adj=on}} flying field was developed in the late winter and early spring of 1928 and was originally owned and operated by [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild Engine & Airplane Manufacturing Company]]. The first flights from the Fairchild Flying Field took place in late spring of 1928 after the Fairchild Airplane and Airplane Engine factories and hangar were completed and aircraft were produced in the new factories. After Fairchild moved to Hagerstown, Maryland in 1931, [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering]] built planes at the airport from 1932 until the spring of 1937.\n\nSeversky Aircraft moved there in January 1935 from College Point in Queens, and became [[Republic Aviation]] in 1939. Republic built more than 9,000 [[P-47 Thunderbolts]] in Farmingdale during [[World War II]] and expanded Republic Field, erected three hangars and a control tower and lengthened and hardened the runways. Republic built the straight-wing [[F-84 Thunderjet]] and the swept-wing [[F-84 Thunderstreak]] during the [[Korean War]] ([https://www.flickr.com/photos/12530375@N08/14978664222 1952 airport diagram]) and extended runway 14-32 to the southeast over the objections of [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|Long Island State Parks Commissioner]] [[Robert Moses]].\n\nRepublic Aviation produced over 800 [[F-105 Thunderchief]] [[fighter bombers]] during the Vietnam Era. Republic Aviation was acquired by the Fairchild-Hiller Corp. in 1965 for $24.5 million and Fairchild stock. Flight Safety Inc. ran the Republic Airport as a general aviation airport beginning on December 7, 1966 for the Mailman brothers'{{clarification needed|date=February 2020}} Farmingdale Corporation, which had purchased the field from Fairchild Hiller for $8 million in 1965.\n\nRepublic Airport was acquired by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) on March 31, 1969. The MTA installed an instrument landing system (ILS) on runway 14-32, built the Republic Airport Terminal building, cooperated with the Federal Aviation Administration, which built the new 100' high control tower and got the US Government to transfer {{convert|94|acre|m2}} to the airport in 1971 and purchased the {{convert|77|acre|m2|adj=on}} Lambert property on the north side of [[New York State Route 109|Route 109]] and the Breslau Gardens property between New Highway and Route 109 in 1972.\n\nAfter complaints that the MTA was not contributing taxes to local governments and questions about the MTA spending at Republic, ownership of the airport was transferred to the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT) by the New York State Legislature in April 1983, to promote economic development in the surrounding Long Island region. The Republic Airport Commission was created by the New York State Legislature in 1982 (Chap. 370, L.1982) \"as an advisory council to the Commissioner of Transportation in the administration and management of the Republic Airport facilities and its surrounding areas with respect to projects to be undertaken at such airport.\" Fairchild went out of business in 1987, and much of its historic Fairchild-Republic factory complex was sold and developed as the Airport Plaza shopping mall.\n\nThe Long Island Republic Airport Historical Society, formed in 1984, and chartered by the Board of Regents of the State of New York in 1987, maintains sixteen photographic exhibits illustrating the history of aviation, and historical archives, on the first floor of the Republic Airport terminal building behind the FAA tower on the east side of [[New York State Route 110|Route 110]].\n\nThe most recent exhibit illustrates: \"The Origins of Airplane Manufacturing in Farmingdale, NY: The Foundation Years: 1917-1928,\" which documents airplanes built by Lawrence Sperry, Sydney Breese and Sherman Fairchild.
