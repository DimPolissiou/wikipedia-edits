At the time of his death, FitzGerald was the President of the [[Institute of International and European Affairs]], had a column in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and made occasional appearances on television programmes.\n\n==Early life==\nGarret FitzGerald was born in [[Dublin]] in 1926, into a very politically active family. His mother [[Mabel McConnell Fitzgerald]] was involved in politics and it was through her that his father became political.\n\n[[Desmond FitzGerald (politician)|Desmond FitzGerald]] was born and raised in London. He was Minister for External Affairs at the time of his son's birth.<ref name=\"BBC-obit\" /> FitzGerald senior, whose father had emigrated as a labourer, from [[Skeheenarinky]] in County Tipperary, had joined the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1914 and fought during the [[Easter Rising|1916 Easter Rising]]. Desmond FitzGerald had been active in [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]], and had been one of the founders of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]]. The party was formed to support the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, which created the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', \"[http://www.economist.com/node/18740946 Garret FitzGerald]\", 28 May 2011, p. 91.</ref>\n\nAlthough a senior figure on the pro-treaty side of Ireland's political divide, Desmond FitzGerald had remained friendly with anti-Treaty [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], such as Belfast man [[Se\u00e1n MacEntee]], a Minister, in [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s government, and father-in-law of [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]]. The families of [[Patrick McGilligan]] and [[Ernest Blythe]], were also frequent visitors to the FitzGerald household. FitzGerald's mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] and republican of [[Protestantism|Ulster Protestant]] descent, although some sources {{Which|date=November 2010}} indicate that she became a Catholic on her marriage. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Her son would later describe his political objective as the creation of a pluralist Ireland where the northern Protestants of his mother's family tradition and the southern Catholics of his father's could feel equally at home. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nFitzGerald was educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Belvedere College]] and [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946, later returning to complete a PhD which he obtained in 1968. He was deeply interested in the politics of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[World War II]]. A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD, his future political rival, [[Charles Haughey]], who also knew Joan O'Farrell (the Liverpool-born daughter of a British army officer, Richard O'Farrell) a fellow student, whom FitzGerald married in 1947.

FitzGerald was elected to Seanad \u00c9ireann, for the [[Industrial and Commercial Panel]] in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the [[1969 Irish general election|1969 general election]], for the [[Dublin South-East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin South-East]] constituency,<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=2881|title=Garret FitzGerald|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref> the same year he obtained his PhD for a thesis later published under the title \"Planning in Ireland\". He became an important figure almost immediately in the parliamentary party and his liberal ideas were seen as a counterweight to the conservative leader, [[Liam Cosgrave]]. Difference in political outlook, and FitzGerald's ambitions for the Fine Gael leadership resulted in profound tensions{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} between the two men. In his leadership address to the 1972 Fine Gael ard fheis in Cork, {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Cosgrave referred to the 'mongrel foxes' who should be rooted out of the party, a reference seen by many as an attack on FitzGerald's efforts to unseat him as leader.\n\nFitzgerald was an opponent of the US bombing of Vietnam.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 30001965|title = Irish Perspectives on the Vietnam War|journal = Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume = 14|pages = 75\u201394|last1 = McNamara|first1 = Robert|year = 2003|doi = 10.3318/ISIA.2003.14.1.75}}</ref>\n\n==Minister for Foreign Affairs==\nAfter the [[1973 Irish general election|1973 general election]], Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped<ref name=\"Independent-Obit\" /> that he would take over as Minister for Finance, particularly after a good performance in a pre-election debate with the then Minister for Finance [[George Colley]]. However the position went to [[Richie Ryan (politician)|Richie Ryan]], with FitzGerald becoming [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]]. It was a case of history repeating itself as FitzGerald's father had held that post in a government led by Liam Cosgrave's father [[W. T. Cosgrave]], fifty years earlier. His appointment to [[Iveagh House]] (the headquarters of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]]) would have a huge effect on FitzGerald's own career and the future of Fine Gael. Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGerald's liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership. During his period at Foreign Affairs, Fitzgerald developed a good relationship with [[Liam Cosgrave]] and all the tension that had existed between them in opposition disappeared.\n\n[[File:US Pres Ford & Taoiseach Cosgrave-Patricks Day 1976 .jpg|thumb|FitzGerald (l&ndash;r) with Taoiseach [[Liam Cosgrave]], US President [[Gerald Ford]] and US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in the [[Oval Office]] on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1976]]\nThe Minister's role had changed substantially since his father's day. Ireland was no longer a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but had in 1973, joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), the organisation which would later become the [[European Union]] (EU). FitzGerald, firmly ensconced as Foreign Minister, was free from any blame due to other Ministers' mishandling of the economy. If anything, his tenure at the Department of Foreign Affairs helped him to eventually achieve the leadership of the party. His innovative views, energy and fluency in French won him \u2013 and through him, Ireland \u2013 a status in European affairs far exceeding the country's size and ensured that the first Irish Presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/ireland_in_the_eu/impact_of_ireland_on_eu/index_en.htm|title=Impact of Ireland on EU policy|publisher=European Union|accessdate=21 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031011140/http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/ireland_in_the_eu/impact_of_ireland_on_eu/index_en.htm|archivedate=31 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFitzGerald's policy towards [[Northern Ireland]], however, brought him into confrontation with the Roman Catholic church, whose \"special position\" in the Republic had been enshrined in the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] until the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Referendum]] of December 1972. FitzGerald in 1973 met [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Agostino Casaroli]], and proposed to further modify the Republic's Constitution to remove laws with overtly Catholic foundations, such as the bans on divorce and contraception, as well as to relax the public stigmas in Northern Ireland towards mixed religious marriages and integrated education. Casaroli at first seemed receptive, and the Government formally submitted the proposal to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. FitzGerald's vision caused great consternation among the church's hierarchy, however, and in 1977, [[Pope Paul VI]] personally met with FitzGerald to tell him that \"Ireland was a Catholic country \u2013 perhaps the only one left \u2013 and it should stay that way. Laws should not be changed in any way that would make the country less Catholic.\"<ref name=newhistory>{{cite book|title=A New History of Ireland, Vol. 7: Ireland, 1921\u201384|last=Moody|first=Theodore William|author2=Francis X.

He immediately appointed a General-Secretary to oversee all of this, a tactic copied from Fianna F\u00e1il. Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. After the November 1982 election it held only five seats fewer than Fianna F\u00e1il (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna F\u00e1il was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the [[Oireachtas]] ''bigger'' than Fianna F\u00e1il, who had been the dominant force in Irish politics for 40 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/26/fianna-fail-irish-general-election|title=Fianna F\u00e1il trounced as Fine Gael and Labour set to form coalition|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 February 2011|accessdate=21 May 2011|location=London|first=Henry|last=McDonald}}</ref>\n\n==8th Taoiseach (1981\u20131982)==\nBy the time of the [[1981 Irish general election|1981 general election]], Fine Gael had a party machine that could easily match Fianna F\u00e1il's.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The party won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach, on 30 June 1981. To the surprise of many Fitzgerald excluded Richie Ryan, [[Richard Burke (politician)|Richard Burke]] and [[Tom O'Donnell]], former Fine Gael stalwarts, from the cabinet.\n\nTwo fundamental problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: [[Northern Ireland]] and the worsening economic situation. A protest march in support of the [[Maze (HM Prison)|H-Block]] [[1981 Irish hunger strike|hunger strikers]] in July 1981, was harshly dealt with by FitzGerald. On one occasion where he met with relatives of the hunger strikers, he refused to meet the family of [[Bobby Sands]], a [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] and [[Officer Commanding|O/C]] of the [[Provisional IRA]] hunger strikers, and the first to die on this strike, along with the sister of [[Raymond McCreesh]], who had died on 21 May. During the meeting, two of [[Thomas McElwee]]'s sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting. Mary McElwee stated to the media outside that \"he's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions\". Fitzgerald then ordered Garda\u00ed to remove the families from the meeting. Fitzgerald's response was, in the words of Eamonn Sweeney, to \"lay all the blame for the hunger strikers on the republican movement and to suggest an immediate unilateral end to their military campaign\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nCSmcQAACAAJ&dq=Down%20Down%20Deeper%20and%20Down:%20Ireland%20in%20the%2070s%20and%2080s |title=Down Down Deeper and Down: Ireland in the 70s and 80s |first=Eamonn|last=Sweeney |date=1 January 2010 |page=231 |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |via=Google Books|isbn=9780717146338 }}</ref>\n\nThe economic crisis was also much worse than FitzGerald had feared. Fine Gael had to jettison its plans for tax cuts in the run-up to the election and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Government's defeat in the D\u00e1il on the evening of 27 January 1982.\n\nIn light of this [[loss of supply]], FitzGerald went to [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]] to request an immediate dissolution of the D\u00e1il from the President, [[Patrick Hillery]]. When he got there, he was informed that a series of telephone calls had been made by senior opposition figures (and some Independent TDs), including the [[List of Irish Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] (and ex-Taoiseach) Charles Haughey, [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] and [[Sylvester Barrett]] demanding that the President refuse the dissolution, as he was constitutionally allowed to do when it was advised by a Taoiseach who has \"ceased to retain the support of a majority in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\" Had Hillery done so, it would have forced FitzGerald's resignation as Taoiseach and enabled the D\u00e1il to nominate someone else for the post\u2014presumably Haughey. Hillery is said to have angrily rejected such pressure, regarding it as gross misconduct. He granted FitzGerald the dissolution.<ref>These events came back to haunt one of the callers, Brian Lenihan, when his differing accounts of his role that night led to his dismissal from Haughey's cabinet in 1990, during his own unsuccessful [[1990 Irish presidential election|presidential election]] campaign.</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent [[February 1982 Irish general election|general election]] in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats but were out of power. However, a third [[November 1982 Irish general election|general election]] within eighteen months in November 1982, resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael-Labour coalition with a working majority.\n\n==2nd term as Taoiseach (1982\u20131987)==\n[[File:An Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald at the Wang facility, Plassey Technological Park (9307630326).jpg|thumb|FitzGerald (left) at the official opening of the [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] facility in Plassey Technological Park, [[Limerick]], 1984 ]]\n\nDeep economic recession dominated FitzGerald's second term as well as his first. The pursuit of 'fiscal rectitude' to reduce a high national debt required a firmer control of public spending than Labour found easy to accept. The harmonious relationship the Taoiseach developed with [[T\u00e1naiste]], [[Dick Spring]] successfully avoided a collapse of the coalition for more than four years, despite tensions between other Ministers, and enabled the Government to survive. Fine Gael wanted to revive the economy by controlling public spending and imposing cutbacks to reduce the public budget deficit. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe measures proposed by FitzGerald's Minister for Finance, [[Alan Dukes]], were completely unacceptable to the Labour Party which was under enormous pressure from its support base to maintain public services. The two parties in Government found themselves in a stalemate position. They stopped the financial crisis from worsening but could not take the decisive action that would generate economic growth. With negligible economic growth and large scale unemployment, the FitzGerald Government was deeply unpopular with the public. The Fianna F\u00e1il opposition added to the woes of the Government by taking a decidedly opportunistic and populist line in opposing every suggested reform and cutback. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nWhen FitzGerald attended a meeting of the [[Bilderberg Group]] in 1985, his rival Charles Haughey suggested it had links with [[NATO]], thus contravening Ireland's official position of neutrality.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/noonan-attends-annual-conference-of-bilderberg-group-1.1063369|title=Noonan attends annual conference of Bilderberg group |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=2 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608201943/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/noonan-attends-annual-conference-of-bilderberg-group-1.1063369 |archivedate=8 June 2015}}</ref> It was not his only participation.

With 6 participations in total he is thus the third Irishmen after [[Peter Sutherland]] (24 conferences) and [[Dermot Gleeson]] with 8 conferences.\n\n===Constitutional reform===\nAs Taoiseach for a second time, FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society, to create what he called the non-sectarian nation of \"[[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Tone]] and [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Davis]]\". His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws.<ref name=\"Independent-Obit\" /> A controversial [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Pro-Life Amendment]] (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the 'Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother' was added to the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]], against FitzGerald's advice, in a national referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/Referenda/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad,1894,en.pdf |title=Referendum on the right to life of the unborn (1983) |page=32 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224084849/http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/Referenda/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad%2C1894%2Cen.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nFitzGerald set up The [[New Ireland Forum]] in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] from Northern Ireland. Although the Unionist parties declined his invitation to join, and the Forum's conclusions proposing various forms of association between Northern Ireland and the Republic were rejected outright by [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], the Forum provided the impetus for the resumption of serious negotiations between the Irish and [[Her Majesty's Government|British governments]], which culminated in the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] of November 1985. This agreement provided for a mechanism by which the Republic of Ireland could be consulted by the British Government under Margaret Thatcher regarding the governance of Northern Ireland,<ref name=\"BBC-obit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13451945|title=Obituary: Irish statesman Garret FitzGerald|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref> and was bitterly opposed by Unionists in Northern Ireland, whose MPs all resigned their seats in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in protest. New elections were required to be held in Northern Ireland, in which the unionists lost the seat of ([[Newry and Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry and Armagh]]) to [[Seamus Mallon]] of the SDLP. During this period, on 15 March 1984, he was also invited to address a joint session of the US Congress, the fourth Irish leader to do so.<ref>The six Irish leaders who have addressed [[List of joint sessions of the United States Congress|joint sessions of the U.S. Congress]] are [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] (18 March 1959), [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] (28 May 1964), [[Liam Cosgrave]] (17 March 1976), Garret Fitzgerald (15 March 1984), [[John Bruton]] (11 September 1996), and [[Bertie Ahern]] (30 April 2008).</ref>\n\nHis government had also passed the Extradition Act of 1987, which ended the long-standing defence against [[extradition]] of suspects who could plead that an act of violence in Northern Ireland or Britain was a political offence.<ref>Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, section 3</ref>\n\nWhile the Agreement was repudiated and condemned by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the governments, which in time would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993, and the subsequent republican and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] cease-fires.<ref name=\"Independent-Obit\" />\n\n===Infighting and declining support===\nIn 1986, FitzGerald attempted to reshuffle his cabinet but certain Ministers, including notably [[Barry Desmond]], refused to move from his Health and Social Welfare portfolio. The eventual outcome of the cabinet changes further undermined FitzGerald's authority. The new [[Progressive Democrats]] party was launched at the same time by Desmond O'Malley, out of the divisions within Fianna F\u00e1il. Ironically, it struck an immediate chord with many disenchanted Fine Gael supporters who had tired of the failure to fully address the economic crisis and who yearned for a coherent rightwing policy from FitzGerald. Seeing its support base under attack from the right only strengthened the resolve of FitzGerald's Fine Gael colleagues to break with the Labour Party approach, despite their leader's close empathy with that party.\n\nStymied by economic crisis, FitzGerald tried to rescue some of his ambitions to reform the State and he proposed, in the middle of 1986, [[Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986|a referendum to change the Constitution to allow for divorce]]. The proposed amendment was mired in controversy and the many accompanying legal changes needed were not clearly presented. Haughey skilfully opposed the referendum along with the Roman Catholic Church and landed interests worried about property rights. The defeat of the referendum sealed the fate of the Government. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach, heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna F\u00e1il returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]]. The Progressive Democrats won some 14 seats mainly from [[Fine Gael]]. Although Haughey did not have an overall majority when it came to a vote the Independent Socialist TD [[Tony Gregory]] voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the \"lesser of two evils\" . The reason for this was Gregory's opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement along with his strong personal dislike for Fitzgerald. Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the [[Ceann Comhairle]].\n\n== Post-Taoiseach period ==\nFitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election by the D\u00e1il of [[Charles Haughey]] as Taoiseach,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/queen-pays-tribute-to-former-taoiseach-garret-fitzgerald-16002334.html |title=Queen pays tribute to former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald |publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref> to be replaced by [[Alan Dukes]]. His autobiography ''All in a Life'' appeared in 1991, immediately becoming a best-seller. He retired completely from politics at the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]]. His wife, Joan, predeceased him, dying in 1999<ref name=\"Tel obit\"/> after a long illness.\n\nAfter that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in [[The Irish Times]], and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs. In a leading article on his death the [[Irish Times]] said that <blockquote>''He was an extraordinary Irishman who fashioned our future in so many ways.''</blockquote> and that he was the papers longest-serving contributor and columnist, for over 57 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0520/1224297354007.htm |date=20 May 2011 |title=Garret FitzGerald |newspaper=Irish Times }}</ref> He came out of retirement to campaign for a \"yes\" vote in the second Irish referendum on the EU's [[Treaty of Nice]], held in 2002. He held the post of Chancellor of the [[National University of Ireland]] from 1997 to 2009. In March 2000, Fitzgerald was on the board of directors of Election.com, when it conducted the world's first public election ever held over the Internet, which was the Arizona Democratic Primary, which was won by [[Al Gore]]; in that primary, voter turnout increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/&#91;2&#93;+Arizona+Democratic+Party+Selects+Votation.com+to+Hold+World's...-a058487613 thefreelibrary.com]</ref>\n\n[[File:Garret FitzGerald Lisbon 2009 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|FitzGerald arriving for the [[Lisbon Treaty]] count in 2009]]\nFitzGerald took a leading part in the campaign for the second referendum on the EU's [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2009. He argued for Ireland to continue with European integration. FitzGerald had been scathing of the record of the Fianna F\u00e1il led Government since 1997, on the economy and the national finances. He was a frequent critic in his column in ''The Irish Times'', of the loss of competitiveness that occurred and the inflation caused by the tax cuts and excessive public spending increases of the Celtic Tiger era. In 2009, FitzGerald received a new ministerial car, the first and only one to be purchased by the state since an economic recession hit the country in 2008.<ref>Conor Lally Crime Correspondent.

The [[Moriarty Tribunal]] investigated this matter, and compared the treatment by AIB of FitzGerald, with their treatment of Charles Haughey. They found no evidence of any wrongdoing, indeed the tribunal heard evidence as to the considerable hardship that FitzGerald went to \u2013 to the extent of selling of his family home \u2013 to repay the debt to the best of his ability.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded in their report:\n<blockquote>In summary it would appear that in compromising his indebtedness with the Bank, Dr Fitzgerald disposed of his only substantial asset, namely, his family home at Palmerston Road, a property which would now be worth a considerable sum of money. As in Mr Haughey's case, there was a substantial discounting or forbearance shown in Dr Fitzgerald's case. However, in contrast with Mr Haughey's case, Dr Fitzgerald's case involved the effective exhaustion of his assets in order to achieve a settlement whereas Mr Haughey's assets were retained virtually intact.<ref>Report of the Tribunal on Payments to Politicians and Related Matters \u2013 Part 1, Chapter 3, par. 66; {{cite web|url=http://www.moriarty-tribunal.ie/images/SITECONTENT_26.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519021238/http://www.moriarty-tribunal.ie/images/sitecontent_26.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\n{{Over-quotation|section|date=March 2020}}\nOn 5 May 2011, it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital.

Desmond FitzGerald had been active in [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]], and had been one of the founders of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]]. The party was formed to support the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, which created the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', \"[http://www.economist.com/node/18740946 Garret FitzGerald]\", 28 May 2011, p. 91.</ref>\n\nAlthough a senior figure on the pro-treaty side of Ireland's political divide, Desmond FitzGerald had remained friendly with anti-Treaty [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], such as Belfast man [[Se\u00e1n MacEntee]], a Minister, in [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s government, and father-in-law of [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]]. The families of [[Patrick McGilligan]] and [[Ernest Blythe]], were also frequent visitors to the FitzGerald household. FitzGerald's mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] and republican of [[Protestantism|Ulster Protestant]] descent, although some sources {{Which|date=November 2010}} indicate that she became a Catholic on her marriage. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Her son would later describe his political objective as the creation of a pluralist Ireland where the northern Protestants of his mother's family tradition and the southern Catholics of his father's could feel equally at home. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nFitzGerald was educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Belvedere College]] and [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946, later returning to complete a PhD which he obtained in 1968. He was deeply interested in the politics of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[World War II]].

FitzGerald hoped<ref name=\"Independent-Obit\" /> that he would take over as Minister for Finance, particularly after a good performance in a pre-election debate with the then Minister for Finance [[George Colley]]. However the position went to [[Richie Ryan (politician)|Richie Ryan]], with FitzGerald becoming [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]]. It was a case of history repeating itself as FitzGerald's father had held that post in a government led by Liam Cosgrave's father [[W. T. Cosgrave]], fifty years earlier. His appointment to [[Iveagh House]] (the headquarters of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]]) would have a huge effect on FitzGerald's own career and the future of Fine Gael. Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGerald's liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership. During his period at Foreign Affairs, Fitzgerald developed a good relationship with [[Liam Cosgrave]] and all the tension that had existed between them in opposition disappeared.\n\n[[File:US Pres Ford & Taoiseach Cosgrave-Patricks Day 1976 .jpg|thumb|FitzGerald (l&ndash;r) with Taoiseach [[Liam Cosgrave]], US President [[Gerald Ford]] and US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in the [[Oval Office]] on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1976]]\nThe Minister's role had changed substantially since his father's day. Ireland was no longer a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but had in 1973, joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), the organisation which would later become the [[European Union]] (EU). FitzGerald, firmly ensconced as Foreign Minister, was free from any blame due to other Ministers' mishandling of the economy. If anything, his tenure at the Department of Foreign Affairs helped him to eventually achieve the leadership of the party. His innovative views, energy and fluency in French won him \u2013 and through him, Ireland \u2013 a status in European affairs far exceeding the country's size and ensured that the first Irish Presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/ireland_in_the_eu/impact_of_ireland_on_eu/index_en.htm|title=Impact of Ireland on EU policy|publisher=European Union|accessdate=21 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031011140/http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/ireland_in_the_eu/impact_of_ireland_on_eu/index_en.htm|archivedate=31 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFitzGerald's policy towards [[Northern Ireland]], however, brought him into confrontation with the Roman Catholic church, whose \"special position\" in the Republic had been enshrined in the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] until the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Referendum]] of December 1972. FitzGerald in 1973 met [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Agostino Casaroli]], and proposed to further modify the Republic's Constitution to remove laws with overtly Catholic foundations, such as the bans on divorce and contraception, as well as to relax the public stigmas in Northern Ireland towards mixed religious marriages and integrated education. Casaroli at first seemed receptive, and the Government formally submitted the proposal to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. FitzGerald's vision caused great consternation among the church's hierarchy, however, and in 1977, [[Pope Paul VI]] personally met with FitzGerald to tell him that \"Ireland was a Catholic country \u2013 perhaps the only one left \u2013 and it should stay that way. Laws should not be changed in any way that would make the country less Catholic.\"<ref name=newhistory>{{cite book|title=A New History of Ireland, Vol. 7: Ireland, 1921\u201384|last=Moody|first=Theodore William|author2=Francis X.

He immediately appointed a General-Secretary to oversee all of this, a tactic copied from Fianna F\u00e1il. Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. After the November 1982 election it held only five seats fewer than Fianna F\u00e1il (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna F\u00e1il was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the [[Oireachtas]] ''bigger'' than Fianna F\u00e1il, who had been the dominant force in Irish politics for 40 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/26/fianna-fail-irish-general-election|title=Fianna F\u00e1il trounced as Fine Gael and Labour set to form coalition|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 February 2011|accessdate=21 May 2011|location=London|first=Henry|last=McDonald}}</ref>\n\n==8th Taoiseach (1981\u20131982)==\nBy the time of the [[1981 Irish general election|1981 general election]], Fine Gael had a party machine that could easily match Fianna F\u00e1il's.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The party won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach, on 30 June 1981. To the surprise of many Fitzgerald excluded Richie Ryan, [[Richard Burke (politician)|Richard Burke]] and [[Tom O'Donnell]], former Fine Gael stalwarts, from the cabinet.\n\nTwo fundamental problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: [[Northern Ireland]] and the worsening economic situation. A protest march in support of the [[Maze (HM Prison)|H-Block]] [[1981 Irish hunger strike|hunger strikers]] in July 1981, was harshly dealt with by FitzGerald. On one occasion where he met with relatives of the hunger strikers, he refused to meet the family of [[Bobby Sands]], a [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] and [[Officer Commanding|O/C]] of the [[Provisional IRA]] hunger strikers, and the first to die on this strike, along with the sister of [[Raymond McCreesh]], who had died on 21 May. During the meeting, two of [[Thomas McElwee]]'s sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting. Mary McElwee stated to the media outside that \"he's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions\". Fitzgerald then ordered Garda\u00ed to remove the families from the meeting. Fitzgerald's response was, in the words of Eamonn Sweeney, to \"lay all the blame for the hunger strikers on the republican movement and to suggest an immediate unilateral end to their military campaign\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nCSmcQAACAAJ&dq=Down%20Down%20Deeper%20and%20Down:%20Ireland%20in%20the%2070s%20and%2080s |title=Down Down Deeper and Down: Ireland in the 70s and 80s |first=Eamonn|last=Sweeney |date=1 January 2010 |page=231 |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |via=Google Books|isbn=9780717146338 }}</ref>\n\nThe economic crisis was also much worse than FitzGerald had feared. Fine Gael had to jettison its plans for tax cuts in the run-up to the election and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Government's defeat in the D\u00e1il on the evening of 27 January 1982.\n\nIn light of this [[loss of supply]], FitzGerald went to [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]] to request an immediate dissolution of the D\u00e1il from the President, [[Patrick Hillery]]. When he got there, he was informed that a series of telephone calls had been made by senior opposition figures (and some Independent TDs), including the [[List of Irish Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] (and ex-Taoiseach) Charles Haughey, [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] and [[Sylvester Barrett]] demanding that the President refuse the dissolution, as he was constitutionally allowed to do when it was advised by a Taoiseach who has \"ceased to retain the support of a majority in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\" Had Hillery done so, it would have forced FitzGerald's resignation as Taoiseach and enabled the D\u00e1il to nominate someone else for the post\u2014presumably Haughey. Hillery is said to have angrily rejected such pressure, regarding it as gross misconduct. He granted FitzGerald the dissolution.<ref>These events came back to haunt one of the callers, Brian Lenihan, when his differing accounts of his role that night led to his dismissal from Haughey's cabinet in 1990, during his own unsuccessful [[1990 Irish presidential election|presidential election]] campaign.</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent [[February 1982 Irish general election|general election]] in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats but were out of power. However, a third [[November 1982 Irish general election|general election]] within eighteen months in November 1982, resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael-Labour coalition with a working majority.\n\n==2nd term as Taoiseach (1982\u20131987)==\n[[File:An Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald at the Wang facility, Plassey Technological Park (9307630326).jpg|thumb|FitzGerald (left) at the official opening of the [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] facility in Plassey Technological Park, [[Limerick]], 1984 ]]\n\nDeep economic recession dominated FitzGerald's second term as well as his first. The pursuit of 'fiscal rectitude' to reduce a high national debt required a firmer control of public spending than Labour found easy to accept. The harmonious relationship the Taoiseach developed with [[T\u00e1naiste]], [[Dick Spring]] successfully avoided a collapse of the coalition for more than four years, despite tensions between other Ministers, and enabled the Government to survive. Fine Gael wanted to revive the economy by controlling public spending and imposing cutbacks to reduce the public budget deficit. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe measures proposed by FitzGerald's Minister for Finance, [[Alan Dukes]], were completely unacceptable to the Labour Party which was under enormous pressure from its support base to maintain public services. The two parties in Government found themselves in a stalemate position. They stopped the financial crisis from worsening but could not take the decisive action that would generate economic growth. With negligible economic growth and large scale unemployment, the FitzGerald Government was deeply unpopular with the public. The Fianna F\u00e1il opposition added to the woes of the Government by taking a decidedly opportunistic and populist line in opposing every suggested reform and cutback. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nWhen FitzGerald attended a meeting of the [[Bilderberg Group]] in 1985, his rival Charles Haughey suggested it had links with [[NATO]], thus contravening Ireland's official position of neutrality.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/noonan-attends-annual-conference-of-bilderberg-group-1.1063369|title=Noonan attends annual conference of Bilderberg group |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=2 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608201943/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/noonan-attends-annual-conference-of-bilderberg-group-1.1063369 |archivedate=8 June 2015}}</ref> It was not his only participation.

With 6 participations in total he is thus the third Irishmen after [[Peter Sutherland]] (24 conferences) and [[Dermot Gleeson]] with 8 conferences.\n\n===Constitutional reform===\nAs Taoiseach for a second time, FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society, to create what he called the non-sectarian nation of \"[[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Tone]] and [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Davis]]\". His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws.<ref name=\"Independent-Obit\" /> A controversial [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Pro-Life Amendment]] (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the 'Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother' was added to the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]], against FitzGerald's advice, in a national referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/Referenda/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad,1894,en.pdf |title=Referendum on the right to life of the unborn (1983) |page=32 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224084849/http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/Referenda/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad%2C1894%2Cen.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nFitzGerald set up The [[New Ireland Forum]] in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] from Northern Ireland. Although the Unionist parties declined his invitation to join, and the Forum's conclusions proposing various forms of association between Northern Ireland and the Republic were rejected outright by [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], the Forum provided the impetus for the resumption of serious negotiations between the Irish and [[Her Majesty's Government|British governments]], which culminated in the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] of November 1985. This agreement provided for a mechanism by which the Republic of Ireland could be consulted by the British Government under Margaret Thatcher regarding the governance of Northern Ireland,<ref name=\"BBC-obit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13451945|title=Obituary: Irish statesman Garret FitzGerald|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref> and was bitterly opposed by Unionists in Northern Ireland, whose MPs all resigned their seats in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in protest. New elections were required to be held in Northern Ireland, in which the unionists lost the seat of ([[Newry and Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry and Armagh]]) to [[Seamus Mallon]] of the SDLP. During this period, on 15 March 1984, he was also invited to address a joint session of the US Congress, the fourth Irish leader to do so.<ref>The six Irish leaders who have addressed [[List of joint sessions of the United States Congress|joint sessions of the U.S. Congress]] are [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] (18 March 1959), [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] (28 May 1964), [[Liam Cosgrave]] (17 March 1976), Garret Fitzgerald (15 March 1984), [[John Bruton]] (11 September 1996), and [[Bertie Ahern]] (30 April 2008).</ref>\n\nHis government had also passed the Extradition Act of 1987, which ended the long-standing defence against [[extradition]] of suspects who could plead that an act of violence in Northern Ireland or Britain was a political offence.<ref>Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, section 3</ref>\n\nWhile the Agreement was repudiated and condemned by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the governments, which in time would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993, and the subsequent republican and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] cease-fires.<ref name=\"Independent-Obit\" />\n\n===Infighting and declining support===\nIn 1986, FitzGerald attempted to reshuffle his cabinet but certain Ministers, including notably [[Barry Desmond]], refused to move from his Health and Social Welfare portfolio. The eventual outcome of the cabinet changes further undermined FitzGerald's authority. The new [[Progressive Democrats]] party was launched at the same time by Desmond O'Malley, out of the divisions within Fianna F\u00e1il. Ironically, it struck an immediate chord with many disenchanted Fine Gael supporters who had tired of the failure to fully address the economic crisis and who yearned for a coherent rightwing policy from FitzGerald. Seeing its support base under attack from the right only strengthened the resolve of FitzGerald's Fine Gael colleagues to break with the Labour Party approach, despite their leader's close empathy with that party.\n\nStymied by economic crisis, FitzGerald tried to rescue some of his ambitions to reform the State and he proposed, in the middle of 1986, [[Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986|a referendum to change the Constitution to allow for divorce]]. The proposed amendment was mired in controversy and the many accompanying legal changes needed were not clearly presented. Haughey skilfully opposed the referendum along with the Roman Catholic Church and landed interests worried about property rights. The defeat of the referendum sealed the fate of the Government. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach, heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna F\u00e1il returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]]. The Progressive Democrats won some 14 seats mainly from [[Fine Gael]]. Although Haughey did not have an overall majority when it came to a vote the Independent Socialist TD [[Tony Gregory]] voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the \"lesser of two evils\" . The reason for this was Gregory's opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement along with his strong personal dislike for Fitzgerald. Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the [[Ceann Comhairle]].\n\n== Post-Taoiseach period ==\nFitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election by the D\u00e1il of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/queen-pays-tribute-to-former-taoiseach-garret-fitzgerald-16002334.html |title=Queen pays tribute to former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald |publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref> to be replaced by Alan Dukes.

It belongs to the [[Eich (Verbandsgemeinde)|''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Eich]], whose seat is in the [[Eich, Rhineland-Palatinate|like-named municipality]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nYearly [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in Mettenheim amounts to 558&nbsp;mm, which is low, falling into the lowest fourth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Only at 12% of the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|German Weather Service\u2019s]] weather stations are even lower figures recorded. The driest month is January. The most rainfall comes in July. In that month, precipitation is twice what it is in January. Precipitation varies moderately. At 51% of the weather stations, lower seasonal [[:File:METTENHEIM nieder.svg|swings]] are recorded.\n\n== History ==\nMettenheim was mentioned as early as 873 in the ''Annales Wormatienses'' as a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony. It was originally held by the Bishop of Worms, but, still in early times, the [[House of Leiningen|Counts of Leiningen]] were enfeoffed with it, later counting it as being among their ancestral holdings. Towards the end of the 17th century, the village ended up in the Frankfurt merchant Canpoing\u2019s ownership, from whom it then passed to the Counts of Wartenberg. In 1393, a castle at Mettenheim was mentioned, whose owners, the Chamberlains and Knights of Fleckenstein, sold it at that time to the City of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]].\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:<ref>[http://wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2009/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/3310204500.html Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat]</ref>\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"500\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n| || [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || [[Free Voters|FWG]] || Loibl || BLM || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2009 || 2 || 6 || 2 || 6 || 16 seats\n|}\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Pupillin]], [[Jura (department)|Jura]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Mettenheim]], [[Bavaria]]\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe municipality\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Argent a talon barwise lopped, the toes to chief, azure.\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n=== Buildings ===\nIn 2007, the [[crypt]] of the Counts of Wartenberg was opened to the public after renovation.\n[[File:Mettenheim Hauptstrasse.jpg|thumb|left|Mettenheim town hall]]\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAbout half of the usable agricultural land of 540&nbsp;ha in Mettenheim is planted with vineyards. The vineyards are sheltered from the wind on the typical Wonnegau terraces. There are 34 businesses that earn their living wholly from [[winegrowing]]. Mettenheim lies in the Nierstein zone of the [[Rheinhessen (wine region)|Rhenish Hesse]] wine region and bears the winemaking appellations Michelsberg, Schlo\u00dfberg and Goldberg.\n\n=== Transport ===\n*Running right near the municipality is ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 9, which links [[Ludwigshafen|Ludwigshafen am Rhein]] with [[Mainz]].\n*Mettenheim has a [[railway station]] on the Mainz\u2013Ludwigshafen line with very good connections.\n[[File:Mettenheimer Bahnhof- Richtung Nord (Mainz) 12.5.2008.jpg|thumb|center|Mettenheim station]]\n\n== Famous people ==\nJacob Best, Sr. (1786\u20131861) was born in Hesse-Darmstadt where he learned the brewing trade, later running a small [[brewery]] in Mettenheim.
