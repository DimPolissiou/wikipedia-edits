[[Torii]] mark the entrance to a Shinto shrine and are recognizable symbols of the religion.]]\n\n'''Shinto''',{{efn|{{lang|ja|\u795e\u9053}}, ''Shint\u014d'', {{IPA-ja|\u0255i\ua71cnto\u02d0}}}} also known as '''kami-no-michi''',{{efn|{{lang|ja|\u795e\u306e\u9053}}, ''Kami no michi''}} is a religion originating from [[Japan]]. Classified as an [[East Asian religions|East Asian religion]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]], its practitioners often regard it as Japan's [[indigenous religion]] and as a [[nature religion]]. Scholars sometimes call its practitioners ''Shintoists'', although adherents rarely use that term themselves. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners.\n\nShinto is [[polytheism|polytheistic]] and revolves around the ''[[kami]]'' (\"gods\" or \"spirits\"), supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things. The link between the ''kami'' and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered [[animism|animistic]] and [[pantheism|pantheistic]]. The kami are worshiped at ''[[kamidana]]'' household shrines, family shrines, and [[Shinto shrine|public shrines]]. The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as [[amulet]]s to the religion's adherents. Other common rituals include the ''[[kagura]]'' ritual dances, age specific celebrations, and seasonal festivals. These festivals and rituals are collectively called ''[[Matsuri|matsuri]]''. A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing. Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity, reverence for ''kami'', and regular communion following seasonal practices. Shinto has no single creator or specific doctrinal text, but exists in a diverse range of localized and regionalised forms.\n\nBelief in kami can be traced to the [[Yayoi period]] (300 BCE \u2013 300 CE), although similar concepts existed during the late [[J\u014dmon period]]. At the end of the [[Kofun period]] (300 to 538 CE), [[Buddhism]] entered Japan and influenced kami veneration. Through Buddhist influence, kami came to be depicted anthropomorphically and were situated within [[Buddhist cosmology]]. Religious syncretisation made kami worship and Buddhism functionally inseparable, a process called ''[[shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]''. The earliest written tradition regarding kami worship was recorded in the eighth-century ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''. In ensuing centuries, ''shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d'' was adopted by Japan's Imperial household. During the [[Meiji era]] (1868 \u2013 1912 CE), Japan's leadership expelled Buddhist influence from Shinto and formed [[State Shinto]], which they utilized as a method for fomenting nationalism and imperial worship. Shrines came under growing government influence, and the [[Emperor of Japan]] was elevated to a particularly high position as a kami. With the formation of the [[Japanese Empire]] in the early 20th century, Shinto was exported to other areas of East Asia. Following Japan's defeat in [[World War II]], Shinto was formally [[Separation of church and state|separated from the state]]. \n\nShinto is primarily found in Japan, where there are around 80,000 public shrines; the country's shrine organization claims 113 million adherents. Shinto is also practiced elsewhere, in smaller numbers. Only a minority of Japanese people identify as religious, although most of the population take part in Shinto matsuri and Buddhist activities, especially festivals, and seasonal events. This reflects a common view in Japanese culture that the beliefs and practices of different religions need not be exclusive. Aspects of Shinto have also been incorporated into various Japanese [[new religious movements]].\n\n==Definition== \n[[File:YobitoTorii.jpg|thumb|right|A torii gateway to the Yobito Shrine (''Yobito-jinja'') in Abashiri City, Hokkaido]]\n\nThere is no universally agreed definition of Shinto.{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=viii|2a1=Rots|2y=2015|2p=211}} However, the authors Joseph Cali and John Dougill stated that if there was \"one single, broad definition of Shinto\" that could be put forward, it would be that \"Shinto is a belief in ''[[kami]]''\", the supernatural entities at the centre of the religion.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} The Japanologist [[Helen Hardacre]] stated that \"Shinto encompasses doctrines, institutions, ritual, and communal life based on kami worship\",{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}} while the scholar of religion [[Inoue Nobutaka]] observed the term was \"often used\" in \"reference to kami worship and related theologies, rituals and practices.\"{{sfn|Inoue|2003|p=1}}\n\nVarious scholars have referred to practitioners of Shinto as ''Shintoists''.{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xviii}} The philosopher [[Stuart D. B. Picken]] thought this term to be \"untranslatable\" and \"meaningless\" in the Japanese language.{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xviii}} Some people prefer to view Shinto not as a religion but as a \"way\",{{sfnm|1a1=Picken|1y=1994|1p=xxiv|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=13}} partly as a pretence for attempting to circumvent the modern Japanese [[separation of religion and state]] and restore the historical links between Shinto and the Japanese state.{{sfn|Picken|1994|pp=xxiv\u2013xxv}} \n\nScholars have debated at what point in history it is legitimate to start talking about Shinto as a specific phenomenon. The scholar of religion [[Ninian Smart]] for instance suggested that one could \"speak of the ''kami'' religion of Japan, which lived symbiotically with organized Buddhism, and only later was institutionalized as Shinto.\"{{sfn|Smart|1998|p=135}} The scholar of religion Brian Bocking stressed that the term should \"be approached with caution\", particularly when it was applied to periods before the Meiji era,{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=174}} Inoue Nobutaka stated that \"Shinto cannot be considered as a single religious system that existed from the ancient to the modern period\",{{sfn|Inoue|2003|p=5}} while the historian [[Kuroda Toshio]] noted that \"before modern times Shinto did not exist as an independent religion\".{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=3}}\n\n===Categorization===\n\nMany scholars refer to Shinto as a [[religion]].{{sfnm|1a1=Picken|1y=1994|1p=xvii|2a1=Nelson|2y=1996|2p=26}} However, religion as a concept arose in Europe and many of the connotations that the term has in [[Western world|Western culture]] \"do not readily apply\" to Shinto.{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xix}} Unlike religions familiar in Western countries, such as [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], Shinto has no single founder,{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=191|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Cali|3a2=Dougill|3y=2013|3p=13}} nor any single canonical text.{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=191}} Western religions have tended to stress exclusivity, but in Japan, it has long been considered acceptable to practice different religious traditions simultaneously.{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xxx}} Japanese religion is therefore highly [[Religious pluralism|pluralistic]].{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=48}} Shinto is often cited alongside [[Buddhism]] as one of the two main religions of Japan,{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=7}} and the two often differ in focus, with Buddhism emphasising the idea of transcending the cosmos, which it regards as being replete with suffering, while Shinto focuses on adapting to the pragmatic requirements of life.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=30}} Shinto incorporates elements borrowed from religious traditions imported into Japan from mainland Asia, such as Buddhism, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese fortune telling|Chinese divination]] practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitagawa|1y=1987|1p=139|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=13}} It bears many similarities with other [[East Asian religions]], in particular through its belief in many different deities.{{sfn|Inoue|2003|p=7}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Some scholars suggest we talk about types of Shint\u014d such as popular Shint\u014d, folk Shint\u014d, domestic Shint\u014d, sectarian Shint\u014d, imperial house Shint\u014d, shrine Shint\u014d, state Shint\u014d, new Shint\u014d religions, etc. rather than regard Shint\u014d as a single entity. This approach can be helpful but begs the question of what is meant by 'Shint\u014d' in each case, particularly since each category incorporates or has incorporated Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist, folk religious and other elements.\n| source=\u2014 Scholar of religion Brian Bocking{{sfn|Bocking|1997|pp=173\u2013174}}\n| align = left\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nScholars of religion have debated how best to classify Shinto.

Earhart noted that Shinto's history, which involved incorporating a great deal of Buddhist and Chinese influence, was \"too complex to be labelled simply\" as an \"indigenous religion\".{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=31}} \n\nShinto is internally diverse; Nelson noted it was \"not a unified, monolithic entity that has a single center and system all its own\".{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=7}} There is substantial localised variation in how Shinto is practiced.{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=215}} In representing \"a portmanteau term for widely varying types and aspects of religion\", Bocking drew comparisons between the word \"Shinto\" and the term \"[[Hinduism]]\", which is also applied to a varied range of beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=viii}} \n[[Shinto sects and schools|Various different types of Shinto]] have been identified. \"Shrine Shinto\" refers to the practices centred around shrines.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=192|2a1=Nelson|2y=1996|2p=7}} Some scholars have used the term \"Folk Shinto\" to designate localised Shinto practices,{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} or the practices of individuals outside of an institutionalised setting,{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=7}} and \"Domestic Shinto\" to the ways in which ''kami'' are venerated in the home.{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=192}} In various eras of the past, there was also a \"[[State Shinto]]\", in which Shinto beliefs and practices were closely interwoven with the operations of the Japanese state.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=192|2a1=Nelson|2y=1996|2p=7}}\n\n===Etymology===\n[[File:Takachiho-gawara Kirishima City Kagoshima Pref02n4050.jpg|thumb|''[[Takachiho-gawara]]''.

Here, it may simply be used in reference to popular belief, and not merely that of Japan.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|pp=4\u20135}} Alternatively, it is possible that in this Japanese context, the early uses of ''Shinto'' were also a reference to Taoism, as many Taoist practices had recently been imported to Japan.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=6}} It is apparent that in these early Japanese uses, the word ''Shinto'' did not apply to a distinct religious tradition nor to anything seen as being uniquely Japanese.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=7}} In the ''[[Konjaku Monogatarish\u016b|Konjaku monogatarishui]]'', composed in the eleventh-century, references are made to a woman in China practicing ''Shinto'' rather than Buddhism, indicating that at this time the term ''Shinto'' was not used in reference to purely Japanese traditions.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|pp=9\u201310}} The same text also referred to people in India worshipping ''kami'', reflecting use of that term to describe localised deities outside of Japan.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nIn medieval Japan, ''kami''-worship was generally seen as being part of [[Japanese buddhism|Japanese Buddhism]], with the ''kami'' themselves often being interpreted as [[Buddhas]].{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|pp=11, 12}} At this point, the term ''Shinto'' increasingly referred to \"the authority, power, or activity of a ''kami'', being a ''kami'', or, in short, the state or attributes of a ''kami''.\"{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=10}} It appears in this form in texts such as ''[[Nakatomi no harai kunge]]'' and ''[[Shint\u014dsh\u016b]]'' tales.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=10}} In the ''[[Nippo Jisho|Japanese Portuguese Dictionary]]'' of 1603, ''Shinto'' is defined as referring to \"''kami'' or matters pertaining to ''kami''.\"{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn the seventeenth century, under the influence of Edo period thinkers, the practice of ''kami'' worship came to be seen as distinct from Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=19}} The term ''Shinto'' only gained common use from the early twentieth century onward, when is superseded the term ''taiky\u014d'' ('great religion') as the name for the Japanese state religion.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=viii}} The term ''Shinto'' has been used in different ways throughout Japanese history.{{sfnm|1a1=Kuroda|1y=1981|1p=4|2a1=Bocking|2y=1997|2p=viii}}\n\nA range of other terms have been used as synonyms for ''Shinto''. These include ''kami no michi'' (\"Way of the Kami\"), ''kannagara no michi'' (\"way of the divine transmitted from time immemorial\"), ''Kod\u014d'' (\"the ancient way\"), ''Daid\u014d'' (\"the great way\"), and ''Teid\u014d'' (\"the imperial way\").{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xxiv}}\n\n==Beliefs==\n\n===''Kami''===\n{{Main|Kami}}\n[[File:A man confronted with an apparition of the Fox goddess.jpg|thumb|200px|An artistic depiction of the kami Inari appearing to a man]]\n\nShinto is a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] belief system involving the veneration of many deities, known as ''kami'',{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} or sometimes as ''jingi''.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=70}} As is often the case in the [[Japanese language]], no distinction is made here between singular and plural, and hence the term ''kami'' refers both to individual kami and the collective group of kami.{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd|1a2=Williams|1y=2005|1p=35|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=13}} This term has varyingly been translated into English as \"god\" or \"spirit\".{{sfnm|1a1=Earhart|1y=2004|1p=2|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=13}} However, Earhart noted that there was \"no exact English equivalent\" for the word ''kami'',{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=8}} and Kitagawa stated that such English translations were \"quite unsatisfactory and misleading\".{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=36}} Several scholars have argued against translating ''kami'' into English.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=194|2a1=Bocking|2y=1997|2p=84}} According to [[Japanese mythology]], there are eight million kami,{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=29}} and Shinto practitioners believe that they are present everywhere.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}} They are not regarded as [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[omniscience|omniscient]], or necessarily [[immortality|immortal]].{{sfn|Boyd|Williams|2005|p=35}} Some kami, referred to as the ''magatsuhi-no-kami'' or ''araburu kami'', are regarded as being essentially malevolent and destructive.{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=114|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=42}}\n\nThe term ''kami'' is \"conceptually fluid\",{{sfn|Boyd|Williams|2005|p=35}} and \"vague and imprecise\".{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=194}} In Japanese it is often applied to the power of phenomena that inspire a sense of wonder and awe in the beholder.{{sfnm|1a1=Picken|1y=1994|1p=xxi|2a1=Boyd|2a2=Williams|2y=2005|2p=35}} Kitagawa referred to this as \"the ''kami'' nature\", stating that he thought it \"somewhat analogous\" to the Western ideas of the [[numinous]] and the [[sacred]].{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=36}} Kami are seen to inhabit both the living and the dead, organic and inorganic matter, and natural disasters like earthquakes, droughts, and plagues;{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} their presence is seen in natural forces such as the wind, rain, fire, and sunshine.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} Accordingly, Nelson commented that Shinto regards \"the ''actual phenomena'' of the world itself\" as being \"divine\".{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=26}} The Shinto understanding of kami has also been characterised as being both [[pantheism|pantheistic]],{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} and [[animism|animistic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=7|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=40|3a1=Cali|3a2=Dougill|3y=2013|3p=13}}\n\nIn Japan, kami have been venerated since prehistory,{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}} and in the [[Yayoi period]] were regarded as being formless and invisible.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=19}} It was only under the influence of Buddhism that they were depicted anthropomorphically.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}}\n\nKami are often associated with a specific place, often one that is noted as a prominent feature in the landscape such as a waterfall, volcano, large rock, or distinctive tree.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} The kami is seen as being represented in the shrine by the ''go-[[shintai]]'',{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=202|2a1=Nelson|2y=1996|2p=144}} objects commonly chosen for this purpose include mirrors, swords, stones, beads, and inscribed tablets.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=202|2a1=Earhart|2y=2004|2pp=36\u201337}} Many practitioners visiting the shrine never see the ''go-shintai'', which is concealed from their view.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=202|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=44}} Kami are believed to be capable of both benevolent and destructive deeds.{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=27|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=13}} Offerings and prayers are given to the kami to gain their blessings and to dissuade them from engaging in destructive actions.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} Shinto seeks to cultivate and ensure a harmonious relationship between humans and the kami and thus with the natural world.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|pp=7\u20138}} More localised kami may be subject to feelings of intimacy and familiarity from members of the local community that are not directed towards more widespread kami like Amaterasu.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=33}}\n\nKami are not understood as being [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] different from humanity,{{sfn|Boyd|Williams|2005|p=35}} and in Shinto it is seen as possible for humans to become kami.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=8}} \nDead humans are sometimes venerated as kami, being regarded as protector or ancestral figures.{{sfnm|1a1=Cali|1a2=Dougill|1y=2013|1p=13|2a1=Hardacre|2y=2017|2p=1}} One of the most prominent examples is that of the [[Emperor \u014cjin]], who on his death was enshrined as the kami [[Hachiman]], believed to be a protector of Japan and a ''kami'' of war.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} In Japanese culture, ancestors can be viewed as a form of kami.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=10}} In Western Japan, the term ''[[jigami]]'' is used to describe the enshrined kami of a village founder.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=69}} In some cases, living human beings were also viewed as kami;{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} these were called ''akitsumi kami''{{sfn|Picken|2011|pp=35\u201336}} or ''arahito-gami''.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=42}} In the State Shinto system of the Meiji era, the Emperor of Japan was declared to be a kami,{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=8}} while several Shinto sects have also viewed their leaders as living kami.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=8}}\n\n[[File:Hokora in Takeo no Okusu.jpg|thumb|left|A 3000 year old sacred tree ([[shintai]]) of [[Takeo Shrine]]]]\n\nAlthough some kami are venerated only in a single location, others have shrines devoted to them across many areas of Japan.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} Hachiman for instance has around 25,000 shrines dedicated to him.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} The act of establishing a new shrine to a kami who already has one is called ''[[bunrei]]'' (\"dividing the spirit\").{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=13|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=15}} As part of this, the kami is invited to enter a new place, where it can be venerated, with the instalment ceremony being known as a ''[[kanjo]]''.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} The new, subsidiary shrine is known as a ''bunsha''.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=13}} Individual kami are not believed to have their power diminished by their residence in multiple locations, and there is no limit on the number of places a kami can be enshrined.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} In some periods, fees were charged for the right to enshrine a particular kami in a new place.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} Shrines are not necessarily always designed as permanent structures.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}}\n\nMany kami are believed to have messengers, known as ''kami no tsukai'' or ''tsuka washime'', and these are generally depicted as taking animal form.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} The messenger of Inari, for example, is depicted as a fox (''[[kitsune]]''),{{sfnm|1a1=Picken|1y=2011|1p=40|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=15}} while the messenger of Hachiman is a dove.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}}\nShinto cosmology also includes ''[[bakemono]]'', spirits who cause malevolent acts.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=8}} ''Bakemono'' include ''[[oni]]'', ''[[tengu]]'', ''[[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]]'', ''[[mononoke]]'', and ''[[Yama-uba|yamanba]]''.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=8}} Japanese folklore also incorporates belief in the ''gory\u014d'' or ''onry\u014d'', unquiet or vengeful spirits, particularly of those who have died violently and without appropriate funerary rites.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=37}} These are believed to inflict suffering on the living, meaning that they must be pacified, usually through Buddhist rites but sometimes through enshrining them as a kami.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=37}}\n\n===Cosmology and afterlife===\n{{Main|Amenominakanushi|Japanese creation myth}}\n\n[[File:Kobayashi Izanami and Izanagi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Izanami|Izanami-no-Mikoto]] and [[Izanagi|Izanagi-no-Mikoto]], by

Shoki]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=195|2a1=Kitagawa|2y=1987|2p=142|3a1=Earhart|3y=2004|3p=32|4a1=Cali|4a2=Dougill|4y=2013|4p=18}} These were texts commissioned by ruling elites to legitimize and consolidate their rule,{{sfnm|1a1=Earhart|1y=2004|1pp=33\u201334|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2pp=18\u201319}} and drew heavily upon Chinese influence.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=195|2a1=Kitagawa|2y=1987|2p=142|3a1=Earhart|3y=2004|3p=33}} These texts were never of great importance to the religious life of the Japanese.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=33}} Views regarding the truth of the cosmological stories recounted in these texts have varied. In the early twentieth century, for instance, the Japanese government proclaimed that it was irrefutable history.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=19}}\n\nThese texts recount that the universe started with ''ame-tsuchi'', the separation of light and pure elements (''ame'', \"heaven\") from heavy elements (''tsuchi'', \"earth\").{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=5|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=38|3a1=Cali|3a2=Dougill|3y=2013|3p=19}} Three kami then appeared: [[Amenominakanushi]], [[Takamimusuhi no Mikoto]], and [[Kamimusuhi no Mikoto]]. Other kami followed, including a brother and sister, [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]].{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=19}} The kami instructed Izanagi and Izanami to create land on earth. To this end, the siblings stirred the briny sea with a jewelled spear, from which [[Onogoro Island]] was formed.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitagawa|1y=1987|1p=143|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2pp=19\u201320}} Izanagi and Izanami then descended to Earth, where she gave birth to further kami. One of these was a fire kami, whose birth killed Izanami.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitagawa|1y=1987|1p=143|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=20}} Izanagi then descended to the netherworld (''yomi'') to retrieve his sister, but there he saw her body putrefying. Embarrassed to be seen in this state, she chased him out of yomi, and he closed its entrance with a boulder.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitagawa|1y=1987|1p=143|2a1=Bocking|2y=1997|2p=67|3a1=Cali|3a2=Dougill|3y=2013|3p=20}}\n\nIzanagi bathed in the sea to rid himself from the pollution brought about by witnessing Izanami's putrefaction. Through this act, further kami emerged from his body: [[Amaterasu]] (the sun kami) was born from his left eye, [[Tsukiyomi]] (the moon kami) from his right eye, and [[Susanoo]] (the storm kami) from his nose.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=196|2a1=Kitagawa|2y=1987|2p=143|3a1=Bocking|3y=1997|3p=67|4a1=Cali|4a2=Dougill|4y=2013|4p=20}} Susanoo behaved in a destructive manner, and to escape him Amaterasu hid herself within a cave, plunging the earth into darkness. The other kami eventually succeeded in coaxing her out.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|!pp=196\u2013197|2a1=Kitagawa|2y=1987|2p=144|3a1=Bocking|3y=1997|3p=3|4a1=Cali|4a2=Dougill|4y=2013|4p=21}} Susanoo was then banished to earth, where he married and had children.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=22}} With humans now living on Earth, the \"age of the gods\" came to an end.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=22}} According to these texts, Amaterasu then sent her grandson, [[Ninigi]], to rule Japan, giving him curved beads, a mirror, and a sword: the symbols of Japanese imperial authority.{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=144}}\n\nIn Shinto, the creative principle permeating all life is known as ''[[mutsubi]]''.{{sfn|Boyd|Williams|2005|p=34}} Within traditional Japanese thought, there is no concept of an overarching duality between good and evil.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=36}} The concept of ''aki'' encompasses misfortune, unhappiness, and disaster, although does not correspond precisely with the Western concept of evil.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=36}} \n\nTexts such as the ''Kojiki'' and ''Nihon Shoki'' attest to the presence of multiple realms in Shinto cosmology.{{sfn|Doerner|1977|pp=153\u2013154}} These present a universe divided into three parts: the Plain of High Heaven (''Takama-no-hara''), where the ''kami'' live; the Phenomenal or Manifested World (''Utsushi-yo''), where humans dwell; and the Nether World (''Yomotsu-kuni''), where unclean spirits reside.{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=143}} The mythological texts nevertheless do not draw firm demarcations between these realms.{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=143}}\nShinto places greater emphasis on this life than on any afterlife.{{sfn|Doerner|1977|p=153}} As the historian of religion [[Joseph Kitagawa]] noted, \"Japanese religion has been singularly preoccupied with ''this'' world, with its emphasis on finding ways to cohabit with the ''kami'' and with other human beings\".{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=xii}} A common view among Shinto priests is that the dead continue to inhabit our world and work towards the prosperity of their descendants and the land.{{sfn|Doerner|1977|p=157}} One traditional belief formerly widespread in Japan was that the spirits of the dead resided in the mountains, from where they would descend to take part in agricultural events.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=39}}\n\n===Purity and impurity===\n\nA key theme in Shinto thought is the importance of avoiding ''[[kegare]]'' (\"pollution\" or \"impurity\"),{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=93|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=20}} while ensuring ''[[harae]]'' (\"purity\").{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=101|2a1=Bocking|2y=1997|2p=45|3a1=Cali|3a2=Dougill|3y=2013|3p=21}} In Japanese thought, humans are seen as fundamentally pure.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=45}} ''Kegare'' is therefore seen as being a temporary condition that can be corrected through achieving ''harae''.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=93}} Rites of purification are conducted so as to restore an individual to \"spiritual\" health and render them useful to society.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=102}}\n\n[[File:Karasuzumo purification ritual.jpg|thumb|left|Shinto purification rite after a ceremonial children's [[sumo]] tournament at the [[Kamigamo Jinja]] in [[Kyoto]]]]\n\nThis notion of purity is present in many facets of Japanese culture, such as the focus it places on bathing.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=38}} Purification is for instance regarded as important in preparation for the planting season,{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=63}} while performers of [[noh]] theatre undergo a purification rite before they carry out their performances.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=7}} Among the things regarded as particular pollutants in Shinto are death, disease, witchcraft, the flaying alive of an animal, incest, bestiality, excrement, and blood associated with either menstruation or childbirth.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=206|2a1=Nelson|2y=1996|2p=104}} To avoid ''kegare'', priests and other practitioners may engage in abstinence and avoid various activities prior to a festival or ritual.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=93}}\nVarious words, termed ''imi-kotoba'', are also regarded as taboo, and people avoid speaking them when at a shrine; these include ''shi'' (death), ''by\u014d'' (illness), and ''shishi'' (meat).{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=58}}\n\nFull immersion in the sea is often regarded as the most ancient and efficacious form of purification.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=140}} This act links with the mythological tale in which Izanagi immersed himself in the sea to purify himself after discovering his deceased wife; it was from this act that other kami sprang from his body.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=141}} An alternative is immersion beneath a waterfall.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=45}}\n\nSalt is often regarded as a purifying substance;{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=141|2a1=Earhart|2y=2004|2p=11}} some Shinto practitioners will for instance sprinkle salt on themselves after a funeral,{{sfn|Nelson|1996|pp=141\u2013142}} while those running restaurants may put a small pile of salt outside before business commences each day.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=6}} Fire, also, is perceived as a source of purification.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=11}}\n\n===''Kannagara'', morality, and ethics===\n\nIn Shinto, ''kannagara'' (\"way of the kami\") describes the law of the [[cosmos|natural order]].{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xxiii}} Shinto incorporates morality tales and myths but no overarching, codified ethical doctrine;{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} Offner noted that Shinto specified no \"unified, systematized code of behaviour\".{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=191}} Its views of ''kannagara'' influence certain ethical views, focused on sincerity (''makoto'') and honesty (''tadashii'').{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xxiii}} Shint\u014d sometimes includes reference to four virtues known as the ''akaki kiyoki kokoro'' or ''sei-mei-shin''.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=34}} ''Makoto'' is regarded as a cardinal virtue in Japanese religion more broadly.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=115}} Offner believed that in Shinto, ideas about goodness linked to \"that which possesses, or relates to, beauty, brightness, excellence, good fortune, nobility, purity, suitability, harmony, conformity, [and] productivity.\"{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=198}} Shinto's flexibility regarding morality and ethics has been a source of frequent criticism, especially from those arguing that Shinto can readily become a pawn for those wishing to use it to legitimise their authority and power.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=198}}\n\nThroughout Japanese history, the notion of ''saisei-itchi'', or the union of religious authority and political authority, has long been prominent.{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=xvii}}\nCali and Dougill noted that Shinto had long been associated with \"an insular and protective view\" of Japanese society.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=10}} They added that in the modern world, Shinto tends toward conservatism and nationalism.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=10}} In the late 1990s, Bocking noted that \"an apparently regressive nationalism still seems the natural ally of some central elements\" of Shinto.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=ix}} As a result of these associations, Shinto is still viewed suspiciously by various [[civil liberties]] groups in Japan and by many of Japan's neighbours.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=ix}}\n\n[[File:Yasukuni Shrine 2012.JPG|thumb|right|The actions of priests at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo have generated controversy across East Asia]]\n\nThe priests of Shinto shrines may face various ethical conundrums. In the 1980s, for instance, the priests at the [[Suwa Shrine (Nagasaki)|Suwa Shrine]] in [[Nagasaki]] debated whether to invite the crew of a U.S. Navy vessel docked at the port city to their festival celebrations given the sensitivities surrounding the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Nagasaki|1945 U.S. use of the atomic bomb on the city]].{{sfn|Nelson|1996|pp=66\u201367}} In other cases, priests have opposed construction projects on shrine-owned land, sometimes putting them at odds with other interest groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Ueda|1y=1979|1p=317|2a1=Rots|2y=2015|2p=221}} At [[Kaminoseki]] in the early 2000s, a priest opposed the sale of shrine lands to build a [[nuclear power plant]]; he was eventually pressured to resign over the issue.{{sfn|Rots|2015|p=221}} Another issue of considerable debate has been the activities of the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo. The shrine is devoted to Japan's war dead, and in 1979 it enshrined 14 men, including [[Hideki Tojo]], who were declared Class-A defendants at the [[Tokyo War Crimes Trials]].

Everything from the setup of the instruments to the most subtle sounds and the arrangement of the music is crucial to encouraging the kami to come down and dance. The songs are used as magical devices to summon the ''kami'' and as prayers for blessings. Rhythm patterns of five and seven are common, possibly relating to the Shinto belief of the twelve generations of heavenly and earthly deities. There is also vocal accompaniment called ''kami uta'' in which the drummer sings sacred songs to the ''kami''. Often the vocal accompaniment is overshadowed by the drumming and instruments, reinforcing that the vocal aspect of the music is more for [[incantation]] rather than [[aesthetics]].<ref>[[Averbuch]], [[Irit]], ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nIn both ancient Japanese collections, the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Nihon Shoki'', Ame-no-uzeme's dance is described as ''asobi'', which in the old Japanese language means a ceremony that is designed to appease the spirits of the departed, and which was conducted at funeral ceremonies. Therefore, ''kagura'' is a rite of ''tama shizume'', of pacifying the spirits of the departed. In the [[heian period]], this was one of the important rites at the Imperial Court and had found its fixed place in the ''tama shizume'' festival in the eleventh month. At this festival people sing as accompaniment to the dance: \"Depart! Depart! Be cleansed and go! Be purified and leave!\"<ref>Kobayashi, Kazushige; Knecht, Peter, \"On the Meaning of Masked Dances in Kagura\", ''Asian Folklore Studies'' 40 (1): 1, 1981, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\nThis rite of purification is also known as ''chinkon''. It was used for securing and strengthening the soul of a dying person. It was closely related to the ritual of ''tama furi'' (shaking the spirit), to call back the departed soul of the dead or to energize a weakened spirit. Spirit pacification and rejuvenation were usually achieved by songs and dances, also called ''asobi''. The ritual of ''chinkon'' continued to be performed on the emperors of Japan, thought to be descendants of Amaterasu. It is possible that this ritual is connected with the ritual to revive the sun ''kami'' during the low point of the winter solstice.<ref>Averbuch, Irit, ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\n\n[[File:Aoi Matsuri.jpg|thumb|right|Participants in a procession for Aoi Matsuri in Kyoto]]\nPublic festivals are known as ''[[matsuri]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd|1a2=Williams|1y=2005|1p=36|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=9}}\nPicken suggested that the festival was \"the central act of Shinto worship\" because Shinto was a \"community- and family-based\" religion.{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xxvi}} According to a traditional view of the [[lunar calendar]], Shinto shrines should hold their festival celebrations on ''hare-no-hi'' or \"clear\" days\", the days of the new, full, and half moons.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=46}} Other days, known as ''ke-no-hi'', were generally avoided for festivities.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=46}} However, since the late 20th century, many shines have held their festival celebrations on the Saturday or Sunday closest to the date so that fewer individuals will be working and will be able to attend the festivities.{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=224|2a1=Earhart|2y=2004|2p=222}}\n\nSpring festivals are called ''haru-matsuri'' and often incorporate prayers for a good harvest.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=46}} They sometimes incorporate ''ta-asobi'' ceremonies, in which rice is ritually planted.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=46}} \nAutumn festivals are known as ''aki-matsuri'' and primarily focus on thanking the kami for the rice or other harvest.{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=2|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=35}} The ''[[Niiname-sai]]'', or festival of new rice, is held across many Shinto shrines on 23 November.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=170}} The Emperor also conducts a ceremony to mark this festival, at which he presents the first fruits of the harvest to the kami at midnight.{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=205}} Winter festivals, called ''fuyu no matsuri'' often feature on welcoming in the spring, expelling evil, and calling in good influences for the future.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=32}} There is little difference between winter festivals and specific new year festivals.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Tomioka hachimangu10.jpg|thumb|left|Procession of the kami as part of the [[Fukagawa Matsuri]] festival in Tokyo]]\n\nMany people visit shrines to celebrate new year;{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=205|2a1=Nelson|2y=1996|2p=199}} this \"first visit\" of the year is known as ''hatsum\u014dde'' or ''hatsumairi''.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=47}} There, they buy amulets and talismans to bring them good fortune over the coming year.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=208}} To celebrate this festival, many Japanese put up rope known as ''[[shimenawa]]'' on their hopes and places of business.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=206}} Some also put up ''[[kadomatsu]]'' (\"gateway pine\"), an arrangement of pine branches, plum tree, and bamboo sticks.{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=206|2a1=Bocking|2y=1997|2p=81}} Also displayed are ''[[kazari]]'', which are smaller and more colourful; their purpose is to keep away misfortune and attract good fortune.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=93}} In many places, new year celebrations incorporate ''[[hadaka matsuri]]'' (\"naked festivals\") in which men dressed only in a ''[[fundoshi]]'' loincloth, engage in a particular activity, such as fighting over a specific object or immersing themselves in a river.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=41}} \n\nMany festivals are specific to particular shrines or regions.

According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', in 587 [[Emperor Y\u014dmei]] converted to Buddhism and under his sponsorship Buddhism spread.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=28}}\n\nFrom the eighth century, Shinto and Buddhism were thoroughly intertwined in Japanese society.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=8}}\n\n===Kofun period===\nThe great bells and drums, [[Kofun]] burial mounds, and the founding of the imperial family are important to this period. This is the period of the development of the feudal state, and the Yamato and Izumo cultures. Both of these dominant cultures have a large and central shrine which still exists today, [[Ise Shrine]] in the North East and [[Izumo Taisha]] in the South West. This time period is defined by the increase of central power in Naniwa, now [[Osaka]], of the feudal lord system. Also there was an increasing influence of Chinese culture which profoundly changed the practices of government structure, social structure, burial practices, and warfare. The Japanese also held close alliance and trade with the [[Gaya confederacy]] which was in the south of the peninsula. The [[Paekche]] in the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] had political alliances with Yamato, and in the 5th century imported the Chinese writing system to record Japanese names and events for trade and political records. In 513 they sent a Confucian scholar to the court to assist in the teachings of Confucian thought. In 552 or 538 a [[Buddhism|Buddha]] image was given to the Yamato leader which profoundly changed the course of Japanese religious history, especially in relation to the undeveloped native religious conglomeration that was Shinto. In the latter 6th century, there was a breakdown of the alliances between Japan and Paekche but the influence led to the codification of Shinto as the native religion in opposition to the extreme outside influences of the mainland. Up to this time Shinto had been largely a clan ('uji') based religious practice, exclusive to each clan.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\n===Asuka period===\n[[Yin and Yang|The Theory of Five Elements in Yin and Yang philosophy]] of [[Taoism]] and the [[Vajrayana|esoteric Buddhism]] had a profound impact on the development of a unified system of Shinto beliefs. In the early [[Nara period]], the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Nihon Shoki'' were written by compiling existing myths and legends into a unified account of [[Japanese mythology]]. These accounts were written with two purposes in mind: the introduction of [[Taoist]], [[Confucian]], and Buddhist themes into Japanese religion; and garnering support for the legitimacy of the Imperial house, based on its lineage from the sun ''kami'', Amaterasu. Much of modern Japan was under only fragmentary control by the Imperial family, and rival ethnic groups. The mythological anthologies, along with other poetry anthologies like the ''Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves'' (''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'') and others, were intended to impress others with the worthiness of the Imperial family and their divine mandate to rule.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\nIn particular the Asuka rulers of 552\u2013645 saw disputes between the more major families of the clan Shinto families. There were disputes about who would ascend to power and support the imperial family between the Soga and Mononobe/Nakatomi Shinto families. The Soga family eventually prevailed and supported [[Empress Suiko]] and Prince Sh\u014dtoku, who helped impress Buddhist faith into Japan. However, it was not until the [[Hakuh\u014d period]] of 645\u2013710 that Shinto was installed as the imperial faith along with the Fujiwara Clan and reforms that followed.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\n===Hakuh\u014d period===\nBeginning with [[Emperor Tenmu]] (672\u2013686), continuing through [[Empress Jit\u014d]] (686\u2013697) and [[Emperor Monmu]] (697\u2013707), Court Shinto rites are strengthened and made parallel to Buddhist beliefs in court life. Prior to this time clan Shinto had dominated and a codification of \"Imperial Shinto\" did not exist as such. The Nakatomi family are made the chief court Shinto chaplains and chief priests at Ise Daijing\u016b which held until 1892. Also the practice of sending imperial princesses to the Ise shrine begins.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/> This marks the rise of Ise Daijing\u016b as the main imperial shrine historically. Due to increasing influence from Buddhism and mainland Asian thought, codification of the \"Japanese\" way of religion and laws begins in earnest. This culminates in three major outcomes: [[Taih\u014d Code]] (701 but started earlier), the ''Kojiki'' (712), and the ''Nihon Shoki'' (720).<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\nThe Taiho Code also called {{Nihongo|[[Ritsury\u014d]]|\u5f8b\u4ee4}} was an attempt to create a bulwark to dynamic external influences and stabilize the society through imperial power. It was a liturgy of rules and codifications, primarily focused on regulation of religion, government structure, land codes, criminal and civil law. All priests, monks, and nuns were required to be registered, as were temples. The Shinto rites of the imperial line were codified, especially seasonal cycles, lunar calendar rituals, harvest festivals, and purification rites. The creation of the imperial [[Jingi-kan]] or Shinto Shrine office was completed.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\n===Nara period===\nThis period hosted many changes to the country, government, and religion. The capital is moved again to [[Heij\u014d-ky\u014d]] (modern-day [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]), in AD 710 by [[Empress Genmei]] due to the death of the Emperor. This practice was necessary due to the Shinto belief in the impurity of death and the need to avoid this pollution. However, this practice of moving the capital due to \"death impurity\" is then abolished by the [[Taih\u014d Code]] and rise in Buddhist influence.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/> The establishment of the imperial city in partnership with Taih\u014d Code is important to Shinto as the office of the Shinto rites becomes more powerful in assimilating local clan shrines into the imperial fold. New shrines are built and assimilated each time the city is moved. All of the grand shrines are regulated under [[Taih\u014d Code|Taih\u014d]] and are required to account for incomes, priests, and practices due to their national contributions.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\nDuring this time, Buddhism becomes structurally established within Japan by [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]] (r. 724\u2013749), and several large building projects are undertaken. The Emperor lays out plans for the Buddha Dainichi (Great Sun Buddha), at T\u014ddai-ji assisted by the Priest Gyogi (or Gyoki) Bosatsu. The priest Gyogi went to Ise Daijingu Shrine for blessings to build the Buddha Dainichi. They identified the statue of Viarocana with Amaterasu (the sun ''kami'') as the manifestation of the supreme expression of universality.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\nThe priest Gyogi is known for his belief in assimilation of Shinto Kami and Buddhas. Shinto kami are commonly being seen by Buddhist clergy as guardians of manifestation, guardians, or pupils of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/> The priest Gyogi conferred boddhisattva precepts on the Emperor in 749 effectively making the Imperial line the head of state and divine to Shinto while beholden to Buddhism.<ref name=\"ShapersofBuddhism\">{{cite book|title=The Shapers Of Japanese Buddhism |publisher=Kosei Publishing Co.|location=Tokyo, Japan|first=Kashiwahara|last=Yusen|edition=1st|year=1994|isbn=978-4-333-01630-3|pages=3\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Syncretism with Buddhism===\n{{main|Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d}}\n[[File:Inari-Jogyo-ji.jpg|thumb|Shown here is the syncretism between Buddhism and kami worship known as ''[[shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]'', once common in [[feudal Japan]]. [[Kitsune|Foxes]] sacred to Shinto kami [[Inari \u014ckami|Inari]], a ''[[torii]]'', a Buddhist [[t\u014d|stone pagoda]], and Buddhist figures are placed together at J\u014dgy\u014d-ji.]]\n\nWith the introduction of Buddhism and its rapid adoption by the court in the 6th century, it was necessary to explain the apparent differences between native Japanese beliefs and Buddhist teachings. One Buddhist explanation saw the ''kami'' as supernatural beings still caught in the cycle of birth and rebirth ([[reincarnation]]). The ''kami'' are born, live, die, and are reborn like all other beings in the [[karmic]] cycle. However, the ''kami'' played a special role in protecting Buddhism and allowing its teachings of compassion to flourish.\n\nThis explanation was later challenged by {{Nihongo|[[K\u016bkai]]|\u7a7a\u6d77|extra=774\u2013835}}, who saw the ''kami'' as different embodiments of the [[Buddhas]] themselves (''[[honji suijaku]]'' theory). For example, he linked [[Amaterasu]] (the sun ''kami'' and ancestor of the Imperial family) with [[Vairocana|Dainichi Nyorai]], a central manifestation of the Buddhists, whose name means literally \"Great Sun Buddha\". In his view, the ''kami'' were just Buddhas by another name.\n\nFrom the eighth century onward up until the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]], the ''kami'' were incorporated into a Buddhist cosmology in various ways.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=9}} One view is that the ''kami'' realised that like all other life-forms, they too were trapped in the cycle of [[samsara]] (rebirth) and that to escape this they had to follow Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=9}} Alternative approaches viewed the ''kami'' as benevolent entities who protected Buddhism, or that the ''kami'' were themselves [[Buddhas]], or beings who had achieved enlightenment. In this, they could be either ''[[hongaku]]'', the pure spirits of the Buddhas, or ''[[honji suijaku]]'', transformations of the Buddhas in their attempt to help all sentient beings.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=9}}\n\n===''Kokugaku''===\nBuddhism and Shinto coexisted and were amalgamated in the ''[[shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]'' and K\u016bkai's [[Syncretism|syncretic]] view held wide sway up until the end of the [[Edo period]]. There was no theological study that could be called \"Shinto\" during medieval and early modern Japanese history, and a mixture of Buddhist and popular beliefs proliferated. At that time, there was a renewed interest in \"Japanese studies\" (''[[kokugaku]]''), perhaps as a result of the [[Sakoku|closed country policy]].\n\nIn the 18th century, various Japanese scholars, in particular {{Nihongo|[[Motoori Norinaga]]|\u672c\u5c45 \u5ba3\u9577|extra=1730\u20131801}}, tried to isolate ideas and beliefs that were uniquely Japanese, which included tearing apart the \"real\" Shinto from various foreign influences, especially Buddhism. The attempt was largely unsuccessful; however, the attempt did set the stage for the arrival of [[State Shinto]], following the [[Meiji Restoration]] (c. 1868), when Shinto and Buddhism were separated (''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'').\n\n===State Shinto===\n{{Main|State Shinto}}\n[[File:Chosen Jingu.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ch\u014dsen Jing\u016b]] in [[Seoul]]]]\nFridell argues that scholars call the period 1868\u20131945 the \"State Shinto period\" because, \"during these decades, Shinto elements came under a great deal of overt state influence and control as the Japanese government systematically utilized shrine worship as a major force for mobilizing imperial loyalties on behalf of modern nation-building.\"<ref>Wilbur M. Fridell, \"A Fresh Look at State Shint\u014d\", ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 44.3 (1976), 547\u2013561 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1462824 in JSTOR]; quote p. 548</ref> However, the government had already been treating shrines as an extension of government before Meiji; see for example the [[Tenp\u014d Reforms]]. Moreover, according to the scholar Jason \u0100nanda Josephson, It is inaccurate to describe shrines as constituting a \"state religion\" or a \"theocracy\" during this period since they had neither organization, nor doctrine, and were uninterested in conversion.<ref>Josephson, Jason \u0100nanda (2012). ''The Invention of Religion in Japan''. University of Chicago Press. p. 133. {{ISBN|0226412342}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Meiji Restoration]] reasserted the importance of the Emperor and the ancient chronicles to establish the [[Empire of Japan]], and in 1868 the government attempted to recreate the ancient imperial Shinto by separating shrines from the temples that housed them. During this period, numerous scholars of ''kokugaku'' believed that this national Shinto could be the unifying agent of the country around the Emperor while the process of modernization was undertaken with all possible speed. The psychological shock of the Western \"[[Black Ships]]\" and the subsequent collapse of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] convinced many that the nation needed to unify in order to resist being colonized by outside forces.\n\nIn 1871, a [[Jingi-kan|Ministry of Rites]] (''jingi-kan)'' was formed and Shinto shrines were divided into twelve levels with the [[Ise Shrine]] (dedicated to Amaterasu, and thus symbolic of the legitimacy of the Imperial family) at the peak and small sanctuaries of humble towns at the base. The following year, the ministry was replaced with a new Ministry of Religion, charged with leading instruction in \"''shushin''\" (moral courses). As part of the [[Great Promulgation Campaign]], [[Kannushi|priests]] were officially nominated and organized by the state, and they instructed the youth in a form of Shinto theology based on the official [[dogma]] of the divinity of Japan's national origins and its Emperor. However, this propaganda did not succeed, and the unpopular Ministry of Rites was dissolved in the mid-1870s.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1882, the Meiji government designated 13 religious movements that were neither Buddhist nor Christian to be forms of \"[[Sect Shinto]]\".{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=215}} The number and name of the sects given this formal designation varied.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=112}}\n\nAlthough the government sponsorship of shrines declined, [[Japanese nationalism]] remained closely linked to the legends of foundation and emperors, as developed by the ''kokugaku'' scholars. In 1890, the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]] was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to \"offer yourselves courageously to the State\" as well as to protect the Imperial family. Such processes continued to deepen throughout the early [[Sh\u014dwa era]], coming to an abrupt end in August 1945 when Japan lost [[World War II|the war in the Pacific]]. On 1 January 1946, [[Hirohito|Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] issued the [[Ningen-sengen]], in which he quoted the [[Charter Oath|Five Charter Oath]] of [[Emperor Meiji]] and declared that he was not an ''[[Ningen-sengen|akitsumikami]]'' (a deity in human form).\n\n===Post-war===\n\n[[File:Association of Shinto Shrines 2010.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the Association of Shinto Shrines in [[Shibuya]], [[Tokyo]].]]\n\nDuring the U.S. occupation, a new constitution was drawn up. This both enshrined [[freedom of religion]] in Japan and initiated the [[separation of church and state]], a measure designed to eradicate \"state Shinto\" (''kokka shinto'').{{sfnm|1a1=Ueda|1y=1979|1p=304|2a1=Kitagawa|2y=1987|2p=171|3a1=Bocking|3y=1997|3p=18|4a1=Earhart|4y=2004|4p=207}} As part of this, the Emperor formally declared that he was not a kami;{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=207}} any Shinto rituals performed by the imperial family became their own private affair.{{sfn|Ueda|1979|p=304}} This disestablishment meant that the government subsidies to shrines ceased, although it also provided shrines with renewed freedom to organise their own affairs.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=207}} In 1946 many shrines then formed a voluntary organisation, the [[Association of Shinto Shrines]] (Jinja Honch\u014d), through which they could coordinate their efforts.{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=75|2a1=Earhart|2y=2004|2pp=207\u2013208}} In 1956 the association issued a creedal statement, the ''keishin seikatsu no k\u014dry\u014d'' (\"general characteristics of a life lived in reverence of the kami\"), to summarise what they regarded as the principles of Shinto practice.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=94}} By the late 1990s around 80% of Japan's Shinto shrines were part of this association.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=76}}\n\nIn the post-war decades, many Japanese blamed Shinto for encouraging the militaristic policy which had resulted in defeat and occupation.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=207}} Conversely, many Shinto practitioners remained nostalgic for the State Shinto system,{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=172}} and concerns were repeatedly expressed that sectors of Japanese society were conspiring to restore it.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=18}} Post-war, various legal debates have occurred over the involvement of public officials in Shinto.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=18}} In 1965, for instance, the city of [[Tsu, Mie|Tsu]], Mie Prefecture paid four Shinto priests to purify the site where the municipal athletic hall was to be built. Critics brought the case to court, claiming it contravened the constitutional separation of church and state; in 1971 the high court ruled that the city administration's act had been unconstitutional.{{sfn|Ueda|1979|p=307}} In the post-war period, Shinto themes were often blended into Japanese [[new religious movement]]s;{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=180}} of the Sect Shinto groups, [[Tenrikyo]] was probably the most successful in the post-war decades,{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=172}} although in 1970 it repudiated its Shinto identity.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=113}}\n\nShinto has also spread abroad to a limited extent, and a few non-Japanese Shinto priests have been ordained. A relatively small number of people practice Shinto in America. There are several [[List of Shinto shrines in the United States|Shinto shrines in America]]. Shrines were also established in [[List of Shinto shrines in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and Korea during the period of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese imperial rule]], but following the war, they were either destroyed or converted into some other use.{{Fact|date=October 2019}}\nThe [[Tsubaki Grand Shrine]] in [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]], [[Mie Prefecture]], was the first to establish a branch abroad: the [[Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America]], initially located in California and then moved to [[Granite Falls, Washington]].{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=32}}\nShinto perspectives also exerted an influence on popular culture.

Part of his analysis is that this obfuscation was a cloak for Japanese ethnic nationalism used by state institutions especially in the Meiji and post war era to underpin the Japanese national identity.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=4}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* [[Ame-no-Uzume]]\n* [[Chinese folk religion]]\n* [[Culture of Japan]]\n* [[Department of Divinities]]\n* [[Dol hareubang]] (Korean spirit)\n* [[D\u014dsojin]]\n* [[Hari-Kuyo]]\n* [[History of Japan]]\n* [[Iwakura (Shinto)]] \u2013 rock formation where a [[kami]] is invited to descend\n* [[Kodama (spirit)]]\n* [[Korean shamanism]]\n* [[List of Japanese deities]]\n* [[Raijin]]\n* [[Ryukyuan religion]] (Ryukyu Shinto)\n* [[Shide (Shinto)]]\n* [[Shinto shrine]]\n* [[Shinto in popular culture]]\n* [[Shinto architecture]]\n* [[Shinto in Taiwan]]\n* [[Shinto music]]\n* [[Twenty-Two Shrines]]\n* [[Women in Shinto]]\n* [[Y\u014dsei]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|1}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bocking |first=Brian |title=A Popular Dictionary of Shinto |edition=revised |location=Richmond |publisher=Curzon |year=1997 |isbn=9780700710515 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=James W. |last2=Williams |first2=Ron G. |title=Japanese Shinto: An Interpretation of a Priestly Perspective |journal=Philosophy East and West |year=2005 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201363 |doi=10.1353/pew.2004.0039 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=James W. |last2=Nishimura |first2=Tetsuya |year=2016 |title=Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film ''Spirited Away'' |journal=Journal of Religion and Film |volume=8 |issue=33 |url=https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol8/iss3/4 |pages=1\u201314 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |last1=Cali |first1=Joseph |last2=Dougill |first2=John |title=Shinto Shrines: A Guide to the Sacred Sites of Japan's Ancient Religion |location=Honolulu |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0824837136 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite article |last=Doerner |first=David L. |title=Comparative Analysis of Life after Death in Folk Shinto and Christianity |year=1977 |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=151-182 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Earhart |first=H.

Classified as an [[East Asian religions|East Asian religion]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]], its practitioners often regard it as Japan's [[indigenous religion]] and as a [[nature religion]]. Scholars sometimes call its practitioners ''Shintoists'', although adherents rarely use that term themselves. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners.\n\nShinto is [[polytheism|polytheistic]] and revolves around the ''[[kami]]'' (\"gods\" or \"spirits\"), supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things. The link between the ''kami'' and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered [[animism|animistic]] and [[pantheism|pantheistic]]. The kami are worshiped at ''[[kamidana]]'' household shrines, family shrines, and [[Shinto shrine|public shrines]]. The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as [[amulet]]s to the religion's adherents. Other common rituals include the ''[[kagura]]'' ritual dances, age specific celebrations, and seasonal festivals. These festivals and rituals are collectively called ''[[Matsuri|matsuri]]''. A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing. Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity, reverence for ''kami'', and regular communion following seasonal practices. Shinto has no single creator or specific doctrinal text, but exists in a diverse range of localized and regionalised forms.\n\nBelief in kami can be traced to the [[Yayoi period]] (300 BCE \u2013 300 CE), although similar concepts existed during the late [[J\u014dmon period]]. At the end of the [[Kofun period]] (300 to 538 CE), [[Buddhism]] entered Japan and influenced kami veneration. Through Buddhist influence, kami came to be depicted anthropomorphically and were situated within [[Buddhist cosmology]]. Religious syncretisation made kami worship and Buddhism functionally inseparable, a process called ''[[shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]''. The earliest written tradition regarding kami worship was recorded in the eighth-century ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''. In ensuing centuries, ''shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d'' was adopted by Japan's Imperial household. During the [[Meiji era]] (1868 \u2013 1912 CE), Japan's leadership expelled Buddhist influence from Shinto and formed [[State Shinto]], which they utilized as a method for fomenting nationalism and imperial worship. Shrines came under growing government influence, and the [[Emperor of Japan]] was elevated to a particularly high position as a kami. With the formation of the [[Japanese Empire]] in the early 20th century, Shinto was exported to other areas of East Asia. Following Japan's defeat in [[World War II]], Shinto was formally [[Separation of church and state|separated from the state]]. \n\nShinto is primarily found in Japan, where there are around 80,000 public shrines; the country's shrine organization claims 113 million adherents. Shinto is also practiced elsewhere, in smaller numbers. Only a minority of Japanese people identify as religious, although most of the population take part in Shinto matsuri and Buddhist activities, especially festivals, and seasonal events. This reflects a common view in Japanese culture that the beliefs and practices of different religions need not be exclusive. Aspects of Shinto have also been incorporated into various Japanese [[new religious movements]].\n\n==Definition== \n[[File:YobitoTorii.jpg|thumb|right|A torii gateway to the Yobito Shrine (''Yobito-jinja'') in Abashiri City, Hokkaido]]\n\nThere is no universally agreed definition of Shinto.{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=viii|2a1=Rots|2y=2015|2p=211}} However, the authors Joseph Cali and John Dougill stated that if there was \"one single, broad definition of Shinto\" that could be put forward, it would be that \"Shinto is a belief in ''[[kami]]''\", the supernatural entities at the centre of the religion.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} The Japanologist [[Helen Hardacre]] stated that \"Shinto encompasses doctrines, institutions, ritual, and communal life based on kami worship\",{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}} while the scholar of religion [[Inoue Nobutaka]] observed the term was \"often used\" in \"reference to kami worship and related theologies, rituals and practices.\"{{sfn|Inoue|2003|p=1}}\n\nVarious scholars have referred to practitioners of Shinto as ''Shintoists''.{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xviii}} The philosopher [[Stuart D. B. Picken]] thought this term to be \"untranslatable\" and \"meaningless\" in the Japanese language.{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xviii}} Some people prefer to view Shinto not as a religion but as a \"way\",{{sfnm|1a1=Picken|1y=1994|1p=xxiv|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=13}} partly as a pretence for attempting to circumvent the modern Japanese [[separation of religion and state]] and restore the historical links between Shinto and the Japanese state.{{sfn|Picken|1994|pp=xxiv\u2013xxv}} \n\nScholars have debated at what point in history it is legitimate to start talking about Shinto as a specific phenomenon.

''kami'',{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=8}} and Kitagawa stated that such English translations were \"quite unsatisfactory and misleading\".{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=36}} Several scholars have argued against translating ''kami'' into English.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=194|2a1=Bocking|2y=1997|2p=84}} According to [[Japanese mythology]], there are eight million kami,{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=29}} and Shinto practitioners believe that they are present everywhere.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}} They are not regarded as [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[omniscience|omniscient]], or necessarily [[immortality|immortal]].{{sfn|Boyd|Williams|2005|p=35}} Some kami, referred to as the ''magatsuhi-no-kami'' or ''araburu kami'', are regarded as being essentially malevolent and destructive.{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=114|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=42}}\n\nThe term ''kami'' is \"conceptually fluid\",{{sfn|Boyd|Williams|2005|p=35}} and \"vague and imprecise\".{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=194}} In Japanese it is often applied to the power of phenomena that inspire a sense of wonder and awe in the beholder.{{sfnm|1a1=Picken|1y=1994|1p=xxi|2a1=Boyd|2a2=Williams|2y=2005|2p=35}} Kitagawa referred to this as \"the ''kami'' nature\", stating that he thought it \"somewhat analogous\" to the Western ideas of the [[numinous]] and the [[sacred]].{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=36}} Kami are seen to inhabit both the living and the dead, organic and inorganic matter, and natural disasters like earthquakes, droughts, and plagues;{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} their presence is seen in natural forces such as the wind, rain, fire, and sunshine.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} Accordingly, Nelson commented that Shinto regards \"the ''actual phenomena'' of the world itself\" as being \"divine\".{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=26}} The Shinto understanding of kami has also been characterised as being both [[pantheism|pantheistic]],{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} and [[animism|animistic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=7|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=40|3a1=Cali|3a2=Dougill|3y=2013|3p=13}}\n\nIn Japan, kami have been venerated since prehistory,{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}} and in the [[Yayoi period]] were regarded as being formless and invisible.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=19}} It was only under the influence of Buddhism that they were depicted anthropomorphically.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}}\n\nKami are often associated with a specific place, often one that is noted as a prominent feature in the landscape such as a waterfall, volcano, large rock, or distinctive tree.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} The kami is seen as being represented in the shrine by the ''go-[[shintai]]'',{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=202|2a1=Nelson|2y=1996|2p=144}} objects commonly chosen for this purpose include mirrors, swords, stones, beads, and inscribed tablets.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=202|2a1=Earhart|2y=2004|2pp=36\u201337}} Many practitioners visiting the shrine never see the ''go-shintai'', which is concealed from their view.{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=202|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=44}} Kami are believed to be capable of both benevolent and destructive deeds.{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=27|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=13}} Offerings and prayers are given to the kami to gain their blessings and to dissuade them from engaging in destructive actions.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} Shinto seeks to cultivate and ensure a harmonious relationship between humans and the kami and thus with the natural world.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|pp=7\u20138}} More localised kami may be subject to feelings of intimacy and familiarity from members of the local community that are not directed towards more widespread kami like Amaterasu.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=33}}\n\nKami are not understood as being [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] different from humanity,{{sfn|Boyd|Williams|2005|p=35}} and in Shinto it is seen as possible for humans to become kami.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=8}} \nDead humans are sometimes venerated as kami, being regarded as protector or ancestral figures.{{sfnm|1a1=Cali|1a2=Dougill|1y=2013|1p=13|2a1=Hardacre|2y=2017|2p=1}} One of the most prominent examples is that of the [[Emperor \u014cjin]], who on his death was enshrined as the kami [[Hachiman]], believed to be a protector of Japan and a ''kami'' of war.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} In Japanese culture, ancestors can be viewed as a form of kami.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=10}} In Western Japan, the term ''[[jigami]]'' is used to describe the enshrined kami of a village founder.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=69}} In some cases, living human beings were also viewed as kami;{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} these were called ''akitsumi kami''{{sfn|Picken|2011|pp=35\u201336}} or ''arahito-gami''.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=42}} In the State Shinto system of the Meiji era, the Emperor of Japan was declared to be a kami,{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=8}} while several Shinto sects have also viewed their leaders as living kami.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=8}}\n\n[[File:Hokora in Takeo no Okusu.jpg|thumb|left|A 3000 year old sacred tree ([[shintai]]) of [[Takeo Shrine]]]]\n\nAlthough some kami are venerated only in a single location, others have shrines devoted to them across many areas of Japan.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} Hachiman for instance has around 25,000 shrines dedicated to him.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=14}} The act of establishing a new shrine to a kami who already

be venerated, with the instalment ceremony being known as a ''[[kanjo]]''.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} The new, subsidiary shrine is known as a ''bunsha''.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=13}} Individual kami are not believed to have their power diminished by their residence in multiple locations, and there is no limit on the number of places a kami can be enshrined.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} In some periods, fees were charged for the right to enshrine a particular kami in a new place.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} Shrines are not necessarily always designed as permanent structures.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=1}}\n\nMany kami are believed to have messengers, known as ''kami no tsukai'' or ''tsuka washime'', and these are generally depicted as taking animal form.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}} The messenger of Inari, for example, is depicted as a fox (''[[kitsune]]''),{{sfnm|1a1=Picken|1y=2011|1p=40|2a1=Cali|2a2=Dougill|2y=2013|2p=15}} while the messenger of Hachiman is a dove.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=15}}\nShinto cosmology also includes ''[[bakemono]]'', spirits who cause malevolent acts.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=8}} ''Bakemono'' include ''[[oni]]'', ''[[tengu]]'', ''[[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]]'', ''[[mononoke]]'', and ''[[Yama-uba|yamanba]]''.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=8}} Japanese folklore also incorporates belief in the ''gory\u014d'' or ''onry\u014d'', unquiet or vengeful spirits, particularly of those who have died violently and without appropriate funerary rites.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=37}} These are believed to inflict suffering on the living, meaning that they must be pacified, usually through Buddhist rites but sometimes through enshrining them as a kami.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=37}}\n\n===Cosmology and

these include ''shi'' (death), ''by\u014d'' (illness), and ''shishi'' (meat).{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=58}}\n\nFull immersion in the sea is often regarded as the most ancient and efficacious form of purification.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=140}} This act links with the mythological tale in which Izanagi immersed himself in the sea to purify himself after discovering his deceased wife; it was from this act that other kami sprang from his body.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=141}} An alternative is immersion beneath a waterfall.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=45}}\n\nSalt is often regarded as a purifying substance;{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=141|2a1=Earhart|2y=2004|2p=11}} some Shinto practitioners will for instance sprinkle salt on themselves after a funeral,{{sfn|Nelson|1996|pp=141\u2013142}} while those running restaurants may put a small pile of salt outside before business commences each day.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=6}} Fire, also, is perceived as a source of purification.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=11}}\n\n===''Kannagara'', morality, and ethics===\n\nIn Shinto, ''kannagara'' (\"way of the kami\") describes the law of the [[cosmos|natural order]].{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xxiii}} Shinto incorporates morality tales and myths but no overarching, codified ethical doctrine;{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=13}} Offner noted that Shinto specified no \"unified, systematized code of behaviour\".{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=191}} Its views of ''kannagara'' influence certain ethical views, focused on sincerity (''makoto'') and honesty (''tadashii'').{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xxiii}} Shint\u014d sometimes includes reference to four virtues known as the ''akaki kiyoki kokoro'' or ''sei-mei-shin''.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=34}} ''Makoto'' is regarded as a cardinal virtue in Japanese religion more broadly.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=115}} Offner believed that in Shinto, ideas about goodness linked to \"that which possesses, or relates to, beauty, brightness, excellence, good fortune, nobility, purity, suitability, harmony, conformity, [and] productivity.\"{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=198}} Shinto's flexibility regarding morality and ethics has been a source of frequent criticism, especially from those arguing that Shinto can readily become a pawn for those wishing to use it to legitimise their authority and power.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=198}}\n\nThroughout Japanese history, the notion of ''saisei-itchi'', or the union of religious authority and political authority, has long been prominent.{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=xvii}}\nCali and Dougill noted that Shinto had long been associated with \"an insular and protective view\" of Japanese society.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=10}} They added that in the modern world, Shinto tends toward conservatism and nationalism.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=10}} In the late 1990s, Bocking noted that \"an apparently regressive nationalism still seems the natural ally of some central elements\" of Shinto.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=ix}} As a result of these associations, Shinto is still viewed suspiciously by various [[civil liberties]] groups in Japan and by many of Japan's neighbours.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=ix}}\n\n[[File:Yasukuni Shrine 2012.JPG|thumb|right|The actions of priests at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo have generated controversy across East Asia]]\n\nThe priests of Shinto shrines may face various ethical conundrums. In the 1980s, for instance, the priests at the [[Suwa Shrine (Nagasaki)|Suwa Shrine]] in [[Nagasaki]] debated whether to invite the crew of a U.S. Navy vessel docked at the port city to their festival celebrations given the sensitivities surrounding the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Nagasaki|1945 U.S. use of the atomic bomb on the city]].{{sfn|Nelson|1996|pp=66\u201367}} In other cases, priests have opposed construction projects on shrine-owned land, sometimes putting them at odds with other interest groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Ueda|1y=1979|1p=317|2a1=Rots|2y=2015|2p=221}} At [[Kaminoseki]] in the early 2000s, a priest opposed the sale of shrine lands to build a [[nuclear power plant]]; he was eventually pressured to resign over the issue.{{sfn|Rots|2015|p=221}} Another issue of considerable debate has been the activities of the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo. The shrine is devoted to Japan's war dead, and in 1979 it enshrined 14 men, including [[Hideki Tojo]], who were declared Class-A defendants at the [[Tokyo War Crimes Trials]]. This generated both domestic and international condemnation, particularly from China and Korea.{{sfn|Picken|2011|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nIn the 21st century, Shinto has increasingly been portrayed as a [[Nature religion|nature-centred spirituality]] with [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] credentials.{{sfn|Rots|2015|pp=205, 207}} Shinto shrines have increasingly emphasised the preservation of the forests surrounding many of them,{{sfn|Rots|2015|p=209}} and several shrines have collaborated with local environmentalist campaigns.{{sfn|Rots|2015|p=223}} In 2014, an international interreligious conference on environmental sustainability was held at the Ise shrine, attended by [[United Nations]] representatives and around 700 Shinto priests.{{sfn|Rots|2015|pp=205\u2013206}} Critical commentators have characterised the presentation of Shinto as an environmentalist movement as a rhetorical ploy rather than a concerted effort by Shinto institutions to become environmentally sustainable.{{sfn|Rots|2015|p=208}} The scholar Aike P.

Depending on the style, it is performed by ''miko'' or by actors wearing masks to portray various mythological figures.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=82}} These actors are accompanied by a ''hayashi'' band using flutes and drums.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=82}} There are also other, regional types of kagura.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=82}}\n\nMusic plays a very important role in the ''kagura'' performance. Everything from the setup of the instruments to the most subtle sounds and the arrangement of the music is crucial to encouraging the kami to come down and dance. The songs are used as magical devices to summon the ''kami'' and as prayers for blessings. Rhythm patterns of five and seven are common, possibly relating to the Shinto belief of the twelve generations of heavenly and earthly deities. There is also vocal accompaniment called ''kami uta'' in which the drummer sings sacred songs to the ''kami''. Often the vocal accompaniment is overshadowed by the drumming and instruments, reinforcing that the vocal aspect of the music is more for [[incantation]] rather than [[aesthetics]].<ref>[[Averbuch]], [[Irit]], ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nIn both ancient Japanese collections, the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Nihon Shoki'', Ame-no-uzeme's dance is described as ''asobi'', which in the old Japanese language means a ceremony that is designed to appease the spirits of the departed, and which was conducted at funeral ceremonies. Therefore, ''kagura'' is a rite of ''tama shizume'', of pacifying the spirits of the departed. In the [[heian period]], this was one of the important rites at the Imperial Court and had found its fixed place in the ''tama shizume'' festival in the eleventh month. At this festival people sing as accompaniment to the dance: \"Depart! Depart! Be cleansed and go! Be purified and leave!\"<ref>Kobayashi, Kazushige; Knecht, Peter, \"On the Meaning of Masked Dances in Kagura\", ''Asian Folklore Studies'' 40 (1): 1, 1981, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\nThis rite of purification is also known as ''chinkon''. It was used for securing and strengthening the soul of a dying person. It was closely related to the ritual of ''tama furi'' (shaking the spirit), to call back the departed soul of the dead or to energize a weakened spirit. Spirit pacification and rejuvenation were usually achieved by songs and dances, also called ''asobi''. The ritual of ''chinkon'' continued to be performed on the emperors of Japan, thought to be descendants of Amaterasu. It is possible that this ritual is connected with the ritual to revive the sun ''kami'' during the low point of the winter solstice.<ref>Averbuch, Irit, ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\n\n[[File:Aoi Matsuri.jpg|thumb|right|Participants in a procession for Aoi Matsuri in Kyoto]]\nPublic festivals are known as ''[[matsuri]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd|1a2=Williams|1y=2005|1p=36|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=9}}\nPicken suggested that the festival was \"the central act of Shinto worship\" because Shinto was a \"community- and family-based\" religion.{{sfn|Picken|1994|p=xxvi}} According to a traditional view of the [[lunar calendar]], Shinto shrines should hold their festival celebrations on ''hare-no-hi'' or \"clear\" days\", the days of the new, full, and half moons.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=46}} Other days, known as ''ke-no-hi'', were generally avoided for festivities.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=46}} However, since the late 20th century, many shines have held their festival celebrations on the Saturday or Sunday closest to the date so that fewer individuals will be working and will be able to attend the festivities.{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=224|2a1=Earhart|2y=2004|2p=222}}\n\nSpring festivals are called ''haru-matsuri'' and often incorporate prayers for a good harvest.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=46}} They sometimes incorporate ''ta-asobi'' ceremonies, in which rice is ritually planted.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=46}} \nAutumn festivals are known as ''aki-matsuri'' and primarily focus on thanking the kami for the rice or other harvest.{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=2|2a1=Picken|2y=2011|2p=35}} The ''[[Niiname-sai]]'', or festival of new rice, is held across many Shinto shrines on 23 November.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=170}} The Emperor also conducts a ceremony to mark this festival, at which he presents the first fruits of the harvest to the kami at midnight.{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=205}} Winter festivals, called ''fuyu no matsuri'' often feature on welcoming in the spring, expelling evil, and calling in good influences for the future.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=32}} There is little difference between winter festivals and specific new year festivals.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Tomioka hachimangu10.jpg|thumb|left|Procession of the kami as part of the [[Fukagawa Matsuri]] festival in Tokyo]]\n\nMany people visit shrines to celebrate new year;{{sfnm|1a1=Offner|1y=1979|1p=205|2a1=Nelson|2y=1996|2p=199}} this \"first visit\" of the year is known as ''hatsum\u014dde'' or ''hatsumairi''.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=47}} There, they buy amulets and talismans to bring them good fortune over the coming year.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=208}} To celebrate this festival, many Japanese put up rope known as ''[[shimenawa]]'' on their hopes and places of business.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=206}} Some also put up ''[[kadomatsu]]'' (\"gateway pine\"), an arrangement of pine branches, plum tree, and bamboo sticks.{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=1996|1p=206|2a1=Bocking|2y=1997|2p=81}} Also displayed are ''[[kazari]]'', which are smaller and more colourful; their purpose is to keep away misfortune and attract good fortune.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=93}} In many places, new year celebrations incorporate ''[[hadaka matsuri]]'' (\"naked festivals\") in which men dressed only in a ''[[fundoshi]]'' loincloth, engage in a particular activity, such as fighting over a specific object or immersing themselves in a river.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=41}} \n\nMany festivals are specific to particular shrines or regions.

After this, the kami becomes her tutelary spirit and she will henceforth be able to call upon it, and a range of other spirits, in future. Through contacting these spirits, she is able to convey their messages to the living.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=63}} ''Itako'' usually carry our their rituals independent of the shrine system.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nToday, ''itako'' are most commonly associated with [[Mount Osore]] in Aomori Prefecture.

According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', in 587 [[Emperor Y\u014dmei]] converted to Buddhism and under his sponsorship Buddhism spread.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=28}}\n\nFrom the eighth century, Shinto and Buddhism were thoroughly intertwined in Japanese society.{{sfn|Cali|Dougill|2013|p=8}}\n\n===Kofun period===\nThe great bells and drums, [[Kofun]] burial mounds, and the founding of the imperial family are important to this period. This is the period of the development of the feudal state, and the Yamato and Izumo cultures. Both of these dominant cultures have a large and central shrine which still exists today, [[Ise Shrine]] in the North East and [[Izumo Taisha]] in the South West. This time period is defined by the increase of central power in Naniwa, now [[Osaka]], of the feudal lord system. Also there was an increasing influence of Chinese culture which profoundly changed the practices of government structure, social structure, burial practices, and warfare. The Japanese also held close alliance and trade with the [[Gaya confederacy]] which was in the south of the peninsula. The [[Paekche]] in the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] had political alliances with Yamato, and in the 5th century imported the Chinese writing system to record Japanese names and events for trade and political records. In 513 they sent a Confucian scholar to the court to assist in the teachings of Confucian thought. In 552 or 538 a [[Buddhism|Buddha]] image was given to the Yamato leader which profoundly changed the course of Japanese religious history, especially in relation to the undeveloped native religious conglomeration that was Shinto. In the latter 6th century, there was a breakdown of the alliances between Japan and Paekche but the influence led to the codification of Shinto as the native religion in opposition to the extreme outside influences of the mainland. Up to this time Shinto had been largely a clan ('uji') based religious practice, exclusive to each clan.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\n===Asuka period===\n[[Yin and Yang|The Theory of Five Elements in Yin and Yang philosophy]] of [[Taoism]] and the [[Vajrayana|esoteric Buddhism]] had a profound impact on the development of a unified system of Shinto beliefs. In the early [[Nara period]], the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Nihon Shoki'' were written by compiling existing myths and legends into a unified account of [[Japanese mythology]]. These accounts were written with two purposes in mind: the introduction of [[Taoist]], [[Confucian]], and Buddhist themes into Japanese religion; and garnering support for the legitimacy of the Imperial house, based on its lineage from the sun ''kami'', Amaterasu. Much of modern Japan was under only fragmentary control by the Imperial family, and rival ethnic groups. The mythological anthologies, along with other poetry anthologies like the ''Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves'' (''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'') and others, were intended to impress others with the worthiness of the Imperial family and their divine mandate to rule.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\nIn particular the Asuka rulers of 552\u2013645 saw disputes between the more major families of the clan Shinto families. There were disputes about who would ascend to power and support the imperial family between the Soga and Mononobe/Nakatomi Shinto families. The Soga family eventually prevailed and supported [[Empress Suiko]] and Prince Sh\u014dtoku, who helped impress Buddhist faith into Japan. However, it was not until the [[Hakuh\u014d period]] of 645\u2013710 that Shinto was installed as the imperial faith along with the Fujiwara Clan and reforms that followed.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\n===Hakuh\u014d period===\nBeginning with [[Emperor Tenmu]] (672\u2013686), continuing through [[Empress Jit\u014d]] (686\u2013697) and [[Emperor Monmu]] (697\u2013707), Court Shinto rites are strengthened and made parallel to Buddhist beliefs in court life. Prior to this time clan Shinto had dominated and a codification of \"Imperial Shinto\" did not exist as such. The Nakatomi family are made the chief court Shinto chaplains and chief priests at Ise Daijing\u016b which held until 1892. Also the practice of sending imperial princesses to the Ise shrine begins.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/> This marks the rise of Ise Daijing\u016b as the main imperial shrine historically. Due to increasing influence from Buddhism and mainland Asian thought, codification of the \"Japanese\" way of religion and laws begins in earnest. This culminates in three major outcomes: [[Taih\u014d Code]] (701 but started earlier), the ''Kojiki'' (712), and the ''Nihon Shoki'' (720).<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\nThe Taiho Code also called {{Nihongo|[[Ritsury\u014d]]|\u5f8b\u4ee4}} was an attempt to create a bulwark to dynamic external influences and stabilize the society through imperial power. It was a liturgy of rules and codifications, primarily focused on regulation of religion, government structure, land codes, criminal and civil law. All priests, monks, and nuns were required to be registered, as were temples. The Shinto rites of the imperial line were codified, especially seasonal cycles, lunar calendar rituals, harvest festivals, and purification rites. The creation of the imperial [[Jingi-kan]] or Shinto Shrine office was completed.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\n===Nara period===\nThis period hosted many changes to the country, government, and religion. The capital is moved again to [[Heij\u014d-ky\u014d]] (modern-day [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]), in AD 710 by [[Empress Genmei]] due to the death of the Emperor. This practice was necessary due to the Shinto belief in the impurity of death and the need to avoid this pollution. However, this practice of moving the capital due to \"death impurity\" is then abolished by the [[Taih\u014d Code]] and rise in Buddhist influence.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/> The establishment of the imperial city in partnership with Taih\u014d Code is important to Shinto as the office of the Shinto rites becomes more powerful in assimilating local clan shrines into the imperial fold. New shrines are built and assimilated each time the city is moved. All of the grand shrines are regulated under [[Taih\u014d Code|Taih\u014d]] and are required to account for incomes, priests, and practices due to their national contributions.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\nDuring this time, Buddhism becomes structurally established within Japan by [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]] (r. 724\u2013749), and several large building projects are undertaken. The Emperor lays out plans for the Buddha Dainichi (Great Sun Buddha), at T\u014ddai-ji assisted by the Priest Gyogi (or Gyoki) Bosatsu. The priest Gyogi went to Ise Daijingu Shrine for blessings to build the Buddha Dainichi. They identified the statue of Viarocana with Amaterasu (the sun ''kami'') as the manifestation of the supreme expression of universality.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/>\n\nThe priest Gyogi is known for his belief in assimilation of Shinto Kami and Buddhas. Shinto kami are commonly being seen by Buddhist clergy as guardians of manifestation, guardians, or pupils of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.<ref name=\"JapaneseReligion1985\"/> The priest Gyogi conferred boddhisattva precepts on the Emperor in 749 effectively making the Imperial line the head of state and divine to Shinto while beholden to Buddhism.<ref name=\"ShapersofBuddhism\">{{cite book|title=The Shapers Of Japanese Buddhism |publisher=Kosei Publishing Co.|location=Tokyo, Japan|first=Kashiwahara|last=Yusen|edition=1st|year=1994|isbn=978-4-333-01630-3|pages=3\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Syncretism with Buddhism===\n{{main|Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d}}\n[[File:Inari-Jogyo-ji.jpg|thumb|Shown here is the syncretism between Buddhism and kami worship known as ''[[shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]'', once common in [[feudal Japan]].

One Buddhist explanation saw the ''kami'' as supernatural beings still caught in the cycle of birth and rebirth ([[reincarnation]]). The ''kami'' are born, live, die, and are reborn like all other beings in the [[karmic]] cycle. However, the ''kami'' played a special role in protecting Buddhism and allowing its teachings of compassion to flourish.\n\nThis explanation was later challenged by {{Nihongo|[[K\u016bkai]]|\u7a7a\u6d77|extra=774\u2013835}}, who saw the ''kami'' as different embodiments of the [[Buddhas]] themselves (''[[honji suijaku]]'' theory). For example, he linked [[Amaterasu]] (the sun ''kami'' and ancestor of the Imperial family) with [[Vairocana|Dainichi Nyorai]], a central manifestation of the Buddhists, whose name means literally \"Great Sun Buddha\". In his view, the ''kami'' were just Buddhas by another name.\n\nFrom the eighth century onward up until the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]], the ''kami'' were incorporated into a Buddhist cosmology in various ways.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=9}} One view is that the ''kami'' realised that like all other life-forms, they too were trapped in the cycle of [[samsara]] (rebirth) and that to escape this they had to follow Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=9}} Alternative approaches viewed the ''kami'' as benevolent entities who protected Buddhism, or that the ''kami'' were themselves [[Buddhas]], or beings who had achieved enlightenment. In this, they could be either ''[[hongaku]]'', the pure spirits of the Buddhas, or ''[[honji suijaku]]'', transformations of the Buddhas in their attempt to help all sentient beings.{{sfn|Kuroda|1981|p=9}}\n\n===''Kokugaku''===\nBuddhism and Shinto coexisted and were amalgamated in the ''[[shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]'' and K\u016bkai's [[Syncretism|syncretic]] view held wide sway up until the end of the [[Edo period]]. There was no theological study that could be called \"Shinto\" during medieval and early modern Japanese history, and a mixture of Buddhist and popular beliefs proliferated. At that time, there was a renewed interest in \"Japanese studies\" (''[[kokugaku]]''), perhaps as a result of the [[Sakoku|closed country policy]].\n\nIn the 18th century, various Japanese scholars, in particular {{Nihongo|[[Motoori Norinaga]]|\u672c\u5c45 \u5ba3\u9577|extra=1730\u20131801}}, tried to isolate ideas and beliefs that were uniquely Japanese, which included tearing apart the \"real\" Shinto from various foreign influences, especially Buddhism. The attempt was largely unsuccessful; however, the attempt did set the stage for the arrival of [[State Shinto]], following the [[Meiji Restoration]] (c. 1868), when Shinto and Buddhism were separated (''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'').\n\n===State Shinto===\n{{Main|State Shinto}}\n[[File:Chosen Jingu.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ch\u014dsen Jing\u016b]] in [[Seoul]]]]\nFridell argues that scholars call the period 1868\u20131945 the \"State Shinto period\" because, \"during these decades, Shinto elements came under a great deal of overt state influence and control as the Japanese government systematically utilized shrine worship as a major force for mobilizing imperial loyalties on behalf of modern nation-building.\"<ref>Wilbur M. Fridell, \"A Fresh Look at State Shint\u014d\", ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 44.3 (1976), 547\u2013561 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1462824 in JSTOR]; quote p. 548</ref> However, the government had already been treating shrines as an extension of government before Meiji; see for example the [[Tenp\u014d Reforms]]. Moreover, according to the scholar Jason \u0100nanda Josephson, It is inaccurate to describe shrines as constituting a \"state religion\" or a \"theocracy\" during this period since they had neither organization, nor doctrine, and were uninterested in conversion.<ref>Josephson, Jason \u0100nanda (2012). ''The Invention of Religion in Japan''. University of Chicago Press. p. 133. {{ISBN|0226412342}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Meiji Restoration]] reasserted the importance of the Emperor and the ancient chronicles to establish the [[Empire of Japan]], and in 1868 the government attempted to recreate the ancient imperial Shinto by separating shrines from the temples that housed them. During this period, numerous scholars of ''kokugaku'' believed that this national Shinto could be the unifying agent of the country around the Emperor while the process of modernization was undertaken with all possible speed. The psychological shock of the Western \"[[Black Ships]]\" and the subsequent collapse of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] convinced many that the nation needed to unify in order to resist being colonized by outside forces.\n\nIn 1871, a [[Jingi-kan|Ministry of Rites]] (''jingi-kan)'' was formed and Shinto shrines were divided into twelve levels with the [[Ise Shrine]] (dedicated to Amaterasu, and thus symbolic of the legitimacy of the Imperial family) at the peak and small sanctuaries of humble towns at the base. The following year, the ministry was replaced with a new Ministry of Religion, charged with leading instruction in \"''shushin''\" (moral courses). As part of the [[Great Promulgation Campaign]], [[Kannushi|priests]] were officially nominated and organized by the state, and they instructed the youth in a form of Shinto theology based on the official [[dogma]] of the divinity of Japan's national origins and its Emperor. However, this propaganda did not succeed, and the unpopular Ministry of Rites was dissolved in the mid-1870s.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1882, the Meiji government designated 13 religious movements that were neither Buddhist nor Christian to be forms of \"[[Sect Shinto]]\".{{sfn|Offner|1979|p=215}} The number and name of the sects given this formal designation varied.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=112}}\n\nAlthough the government sponsorship of shrines declined, [[Japanese nationalism]] remained closely linked to the legends of foundation and emperors, as developed by the ''kokugaku'' scholars. In 1890, the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]] was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to \"offer yourselves courageously to the State\" as well as to protect the Imperial family. Such processes continued to deepen throughout the early [[Sh\u014dwa era]], coming to an abrupt end in August 1945 when Japan lost [[World War II|the war in the Pacific]]. On 1 January 1946, [[Hirohito|Emperor Sh\u014dwa]] issued the [[Ningen-sengen]], in which he quoted the [[Charter Oath|Five Charter Oath]] of [[Emperor Meiji]] and declared that he was not an ''[[Ningen-sengen|akitsumikami]]'' (a deity in human form).\n\n===Post-war===\n\n[[File:Association of Shinto Shrines 2010.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the Association of Shinto Shrines in [[Shibuya]], [[Tokyo]].]]\n\nDuring the U.S. occupation, a new constitution was drawn up. This both enshrined [[freedom of religion]] in Japan and initiated the [[separation of church and state]], a measure designed to eradicate \"state Shinto\" (''kokka shinto'').{{sfnm|1a1=Ueda|1y=1979|1p=304|2a1=Kitagawa|2y=1987|2p=171|3a1=Bocking|3y=1997|3p=18|4a1=Earhart|4y=2004|4p=207}} As part of this, the Emperor formally declared that he was not a kami;{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=207}} any Shinto rituals performed by the imperial family became their own private affair.{{sfn|Ueda|1979|p=304}} This disestablishment meant that the government subsidies to shrines ceased, although it also provided shrines with renewed freedom to organise their own affairs.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=207}} In 1946 many shrines then formed a voluntary organisation, the [[Association of Shinto Shrines]] (Jinja Honch\u014d), through which they could coordinate their efforts.{{sfnm|1a1=Bocking|1y=1997|1p=75|2a1=Earhart|2y=2004|2pp=207\u2013208}} In 1956 the association issued a creedal statement, the ''keishin seikatsu no k\u014dry\u014d'' (\"general characteristics of a life lived in reverence of the kami\"), to summarise what they regarded as the principles of Shinto practice.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=94}} By the late 1990s around 80% of Japan's Shinto shrines were part of this association.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=76}}\n\nIn the post-war decades, many Japanese blamed Shinto for encouraging the militaristic policy which had resulted in defeat and occupation.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=207}} Conversely, many Shinto practitioners remained nostalgic for the State Shinto system,{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=172}} and concerns were repeatedly expressed that sectors of Japanese society were conspiring to restore it.{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=18}} Post-war, various legal debates have occurred over the involvement of public officials in Shinto.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=18}} In 1965, for instance, the city of [[Tsu, Mie|Tsu]], Mie Prefecture paid four Shinto priests to purify the site where the municipal athletic hall was to be built. Critics brought the case to court, claiming it contravened the constitutional separation of church and state; in 1971 the high court ruled that the city administration's act had been unconstitutional.{{sfn|Ueda|1979|p=307}} In the post-war period, Shinto themes were often blended into Japanese [[new religious movement]]s;{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=180}} of the Sect Shinto groups, [[Tenrikyo]] was probably the most successful in the post-war decades,{{sfn|Kitagawa|1987|p=172}} although in 1970 it repudiated its Shinto identity.{{sfn|Bocking|1997|p=113}}\n\nShinto has also spread abroad to a limited extent, and a few non-Japanese Shinto priests have been ordained. A relatively small number of people practice Shinto in America. There are several [[List of Shinto shrines in the United States|Shinto shrines in America]]. Shrines were also established in [[List of Shinto shrines in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and Korea during the period of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese imperial rule]], but following the war, they were either destroyed or converted into some other use.{{Fact|date=October 2019}}\nThe [[Tsubaki Grand Shrine]] in [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]], [[Mie Prefecture]], was the first to establish a branch abroad: the [[Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America]], initially located in California and then moved to [[Granite Falls, Washington]].{{sfn|Picken|2011|p=32}}\nShinto perspectives also exerted an influence on popular culture. The film director [[Hayao Miyazaki]] of [[Studio Ghibli]] for instance acknowledged Shinto influences on his creation of films such as ''[[Spirited Away]]''.{{sfn|Boyd|Nishimura|2016|p=3}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Guji Francesco Brigante.jpg|thumb|right|A Shinto rite carried out at a ''jinja'' in [[San Marino]], Europe]]\n\nShinto is primarily found in Japan, although the period of the empire it was introduced to various Japanese colonies and in the present is also practiced by members of the Japanese diaspora.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=31}}\n\nMost Japanese people participate in several religious traditions.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|pp=4, 214}} The main exceptions to this are members of smaller, minority religious groups, including Christianity and several new religions, which promote exclusivist worldviews.{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=215}}\nDetermining the proportions of the country's population who engage in Shinto activity is hindered by the fact that, if asked, Japanese people will often say \"I have no religion\".{{sfn|Earhart|2004|p=215}} Many Japanese people avoid the term \"religion\", in part because they dislike the connotations of the word which most closely matches it in the Japanese language, ''sh\u016bky\u014d''. The latter term derives from ''sh\u016b'' ('sect') and ''ky\u014d'' ('doctrine').{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=8}}\n\nAs much as nearly 80% of the population in Japan participates in Shinto practices or rituals, but only a small percentage of these identify themselves as \"Shintoists\" in surveys.<ref>Breen, Teeuwen. 2010. p. 1</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url = http://www.stat.go.jp/data/nenkan/back64/zuhyou/y2322a00.xls|title = \u5b97\u6559\u56e3\u4f53\u6570\uff0c\u6559\u5e2b\u6570\u53ca\u3073\u4fe1\u8005\u6570|date = 2015|accessdate = August 25, 2015|website = Statistical Yearbook of Japan|publisher = Statistics Japan, [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications]]|last = |first = }}</ref> This is because ''Shinto'' has different meanings in Japan.

The result of this practice was to depict the actual history of a dynamic and diverse set of beliefs interacting with knowledge and religion from mainland China as static and unchanging formed by the imperial family centuries ago.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=3}} Some secular scholars accused these individuals of blurring theology with historical analysis.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=4}} In the late 1970s and 1980s the work of a secular historian [[Kuroda Toshio]] attempted to frame the prior held historical views of Shinto not as a timeless \"indigenous\" entity, but rather an amalgam of various local beliefs infused over time with outside influences through waves of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. Part of his analysis is that this obfuscation was a cloak for Japanese ethnic nationalism used by state institutions especially in the Meiji and post war era to underpin the Japanese national identity.{{sfn|Hardacre|2017|p=4}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* [[Ame-no-Uzume]]\n* [[Chinese folk religion]]\n* [[Culture of Japan]]\n* [[Department of Divinities]]\n* [[Dol hareubang]] (Korean spirit)\n* [[D\u014dsojin]]\n* [[Hari-Kuyo]]\n* [[History of Japan]]\n* [[Iwakura (Shinto)]] \u2013 rock formation where a [[kami]] is invited to descend\n* [[Kodama (spirit)]]\n* [[Korean shamanism]]\n* [[List of Japanese deities]]\n* [[Raijin]]\n* [[Ryukyuan religion]] (Ryukyu Shinto)\n* [[Shide (Shinto)]]\n* [[Shinto shrine]]\n* [[Shinto in popular culture]]\n* [[Shinto architecture]]\n* [[Shinto in Taiwan]]\n* [[Shinto music]]\n* [[Twenty-Two Shrines]]\n* [[Women in Shinto]]\n* [[Y\u014dsei]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|1}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bocking |first=Brian |title=A Popular Dictionary of Shinto |edition=revised |location=Richmond |publisher=Curzon |year=1997 |isbn=9780700710515 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=James W. |last2=Williams |first2=Ron G. |title=Japanese Shinto: An Interpretation of a Priestly Perspective |journal=Philosophy East and West |year=2005 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201363 |doi=10.1353/pew.2004.0039 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=James W. |last2=Nishimura |first2=Tetsuya |year=2016 |title=Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film ''Spirited Away'' |journal=Journal of Religion and Film |volume=8 |issue=33 |url=https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol8/iss3/4 |pages=1\u201314 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |last1=Cali |first1=Joseph |last2=Dougill |first2=John |title=Shinto Shrines: A Guide to the Sacred Sites of Japan's Ancient Religion |location=Honolulu |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0824837136 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite article |last=Doerner |first=David L. |title=Comparative Analysis of Life after Death in Folk Shinto and Christianity |year=1977 |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=151-182 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Earhart |first=H.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations.

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

Both [[U.S. Route 43|U.S. Highway 43]] and [[U.S. Route 72|U.S. Highway 72]] merge just east of the city limits in [[Killen, Alabama|Killen]], and are co-signed their entire length through the city. Highway 43, running north and south, helps connect the city to [[Lawrenceburg, Tennessee|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]] to the north in [[Tennessee]], as well as [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to the south. Highway 72 helps connect the city to [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] to the east and [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to the west. [[Interstate 65]] is accessible about forty-five minutes east on Highway 72.

The bridge is part of a new corridor that will eventually see the widening of Wilson Dam Road in Muscle Shoals to Alabama 20, and the construction of a new road from the bridge to Florence Blvd. in Florence. State Route 157, a road to Florence and the Shoals area, serves  as a four-lane link to [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] in [[Cullman, Alabama|Cullman]]. the project was completed in the summer of 2007. The road is known as the \"University of North Alabama Highway\".\n\nFlorence and the Shoals area does not have a direct link to an Interstate highway. One solution discussed has been the Memphis to Atlanta Highway, proposed to connect the two cities via a freeway through north Alabama. However, in recent years Mississippi has concentrated its funding on U.S. 78 ([[Interstate 22]]), also known as \"Corridor X\". Though U.S. 72 through Mississippi is four lanes, there are no plans to upgrade it to freeway status. The state of Georgia has also not committed to the necessary work to connect the freeway from the Alabama state line to Atlanta. The highway remains in the planning stages with the Alabama Department of Transportation.\n\nAnother plan recently discussed is extending [[Interstate 565]] west from its current terminus just outside [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]], along Alabama 20/Alternate U.S. 72. The plan has received support from Decatur officials.\n\nFlorence is served by the [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] in Muscle Shoals. The airport is used for commercial and general aviation, It is served commercially by [[Boutique Air]] which provides several daily flights to Atlanta and Nashville. [[Huntsville International Airport]], another option for Florence residents, offers service to eleven domestic destinations, and is an hour's drive from Florence.\n\nLocal industry is served by the [[Tennessee Southern Railroad]] (TSRR), which runs from Florence to Columbia, Tennessee, and the Port of Florence on Pickwick Lake.\n\n==Media==\n\n[[TimesDaily]]\n\n[http://quadcitiesdaily.com/ Quad-Cities Daily]\n\n[http://pennswordtwo.com/ Pen-N-Sword]\n\n''Courier-Journal''\n\n[[WAFF (TV)|WAFF-TV]] ([[NBC]]), [[WHNT-TV]] ([[CBS]]), [[WAAY-TV]] ([[ABC Studios|ABC]]), [[WZDX|WZDX-TV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]), and [[WHDF|WHDF-TV]] ([[The CW]]).\n\nNumerous radio, television and low-power FM radio stations and translators serve Florence and the greater area, all of which are in the greater Florence MSA.

Area restaurants offer live music, and artists often perform in Wilson Park or along streets downtown. Though the focus was originally on blues and jazz, the musical selection now includes rock, country, gospel and others. The festival, the largest in the Shoals area, also includes educational events, art shows,mans athletic competitions.\n*Every September, Florence is the termination point for riders in the annual [http://www.trailoftears-remembrance.org/ Trail of Tears Remembrance Motorcycle Ride], which terminates in nearby McFarland Park.

Both [[U.S. Route 43|U.S. Highway 43]] and [[U.S. Route 72|U.S. Highway 72]] merge just east of the city limits in [[Killen, Alabama|Killen]], and are co-signed their entire length through the city. Highway 43, running north and south, helps connect the city to [[Lawrenceburg, Tennessee|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]] to the north in [[Tennessee]], as well as [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to the south. Highway 72 helps connect the city to [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] to the east and [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to the west. [[Interstate 65]] is accessible about forty-five minutes east on Highway 72. Both of these roads cross the Tennessee River on O'Neal Bridge, connecting Florence to Sheffield.\n\nAlabama state highways that serve the city include [[Alabama State Route 13|State Route 13]], [[Alabama State Route 17|State Route 17]], [[Alabama State Route 20|State Route 20]], [[Alabama State Route 133|State Route 133]], and [[Alabama State Route 157|State Route 157]]. Alabama 133 connected Florence and Muscle Shoals via Wilson Dam until 2002, when the new six-lane \"Patton Island Bridge\" finished construction. The bridge is part of a new corridor that will eventually see the widening of Wilson Dam Road in Muscle Shoals to Alabama 20, and the construction of a new road from the bridge to Florence Blvd. in Florence. State Route 157, a road to Florence and the Shoals area, serves  as a four-lane link to [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] in [[Cullman, Alabama|Cullman]]. the project was completed in the summer of 2007. The road is known as the \"University of North Alabama Highway\".\n\nFlorence and the Shoals area does not have a direct link to an Interstate highway. One solution discussed has been the Memphis to Atlanta Highway, proposed to connect the two cities via a freeway through north Alabama. However, in recent years Mississippi has concentrated its funding on U.S. 78 ([[Interstate 22]]), also known as \"Corridor X\". Though U.S. 72 through Mississippi is four lanes, there are no plans to upgrade it to freeway status. The state of Georgia has also not committed to the necessary work to connect the freeway from the Alabama state line to Atlanta. The highway remains in the planning stages with the Alabama Department of Transportation.\n\nAnother plan recently discussed is extending [[Interstate 565]] west from its current terminus just outside [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]], along Alabama 20/Alternate U.S. 72. The plan has received support from Decatur officials.\n\nFlorence is served by the [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] in Muscle Shoals. The airport is used for commercial and general aviation, It is served commercially by [[Boutique Air]] which provides several daily flights to Atlanta and Nashville. [[Huntsville International Airport]], another option for Florence residents, offers service to eleven domestic destinations, and is an hour's drive from Florence.\n\nLocal industry is served by the [[Tennessee Southern Railroad]] (TSRR), which runs from Florence to Columbia, Tennessee, and the Port of Florence on Pickwick Lake.\n\n==Media==\n\n[[TimesDaily]]\n\n[http://quadcitiesdaily.com/ Quad-Cities Daily]\n\n[http://pennswordtwo.com/ Pen-N-Sword]\n\n''Courier-Journal''\n\n[[WAFF (TV)|WAFF-TV]] ([[NBC]]), [[WHNT-TV]] ([[CBS]]), [[WAAY-TV]] ([[ABC Studios|ABC]]), [[WZDX|WZDX-TV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]), and [[WHDF|WHDF-TV]] ([[The CW]]).\n\nNumerous radio, television and low-power FM radio stations and translators serve Florence and the greater area, all of which are in the greater Florence MSA.

From 1842, the river was the regular means of transport between Brisbane and Ipswich. The [[Seventeen Mile Rocks, Queensland|Seventeen Mile Rocks]] caused delays to laden vessels until the tide rose sufficiently to pass. From the 1860s, local selectors transported produce by river to Ipswich and Brisbane with tide times influencing the lifestyle of the early farmers.

The flooded Brisbane River destroyed houses, outbuildings along with farm animals destroying the railway bridge at Oxley Point. As a result of the flood, there was created a beach at Oxley Point, known as \u2018The Sands\u2019 becoming a popular swimming area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brisbanehistory.com/1893_brisbane_flood_intro.html|title=The 1893 flood|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 183451 Rural scene in Oxley Road, Chelmer, Brisbane, in 1906.jpg|thumb|Chelmer Swamp and Oxley Road]]\n\n==== Land Features ====\nSeveral hills, part of a system of low ridges extending from Spring Mountain sixteen miles to the south-west, ranged from 100 to 200 feet. Two of these hills in the now residential suburbs of Corinda and Oxley, lay close to a bend of the river downstream from [[Seventeen Mile Rocks, Queensland|Seventeen Mile Rocks]]. From these hills, several seasonal steams coursed towards Oxley Creek forming swamps and lagoons. The largest of these swamps was situated south of Oxley Point in present day [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]]. In the 1940s it was designated a municipal rubbish dump and the swamp was filled in. It lay where the current sporting grounds are now situated on the eastern side of the Chelmer Station. The hills and ridges on the southern boundary fed other streams such as Bullock Head Creek and Sandy Creek which combined to form Wolston Creek.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nExplorers and early selectors in the area recorded descriptions of the original flora. Oxley\u2019s made account of rich brush along the river, and the settlers of the 1860s referred to the dense scrub which clothed the river and creek banks and giant fig trees grew abundantly. The land\u2019s natural features influenced the lifestyle of the local Aborigines being from Jagarra tribe. This tribe\u2019s habitat lay along the Brisbane River, westwards almost to the Great Dividing Range. They referred to the land on either side of Oxley Creek as Bennawarra. The wildlife of swamps and attracted a section of the tribe known as Yerongapan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n  \nOccasionally, white contact with Aborigines led to clashes. In 1828, at Seventeen Mile Rocks, Aborigines attacked a boat from Limestone Hill, (Ipswich), killing a soldier and a convict. ln 1832, there was a massacre of a convict fishing party on the Brisbane River. By the 1860s, hostilities had ceased in the local area with white settlers being permitted to witness a [[corroboree]] near Oxley Creek. Early selectors found evidence of Aboriginal sites, believing a circular floating island in the large Oxley Point (Chelmer) swamp was a [[Bora (Australian)|bora ring]]. There were other reported areas used as borra rings one being between the Anglican Cemetery and Oxley Creek, and on the site of the [[Corinda railway station]].

Between 1825 and 1829, convicts quarried a portion of Corinda Hill for [[sandstone]], which was used in the construction of the [[Commissariat Store, Brisbane|Commissariat]] and [[The Old Windmill, Brisbane|Windmill]] in the penal colony. This quarry is located at the western point of Quarry Street. In 1851, Thomas Boyland leased land of what became the Shire, where he grazed cattle and sheep. The land became to then be known as Boyland\u2019s Pocket. After Queensland became a colony in 1859, Boyland declined and offer to purchase the land.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Corinda_to_Chelmer_Initial_Landowners_1860s.jpg|thumb|Corinda to Chelmer Initial Landowners 1860s]]\nIn May 1860, the land was subdivided into 25 portions. Each portion averaged 60 acres and initially sold for \u00a31 an acre, the area being eventually known as Oxley West. Between 1861 and 1864, 96 portions of land, were offered for sale in the area known as [[Oxley, Queensland|Oxley]]. In 1851, Lands Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Simpson leased 5,500 acres of land in the south-western section and purchased 640 acres where he erected his home [[Wolston House]], near Wolston Creek. After using the property as a horse stud, he returned to England in 1860 after the death of his nephew, James Ommaney, killed when thrown from a horse while riding on the Wolston property. A hill close to where the fatality occurred was named Mt. Ommaney.

There were three categories of land purchasers during the 1860s: the speculators the immigrant; and immigrants arriving after most of the land had been sold. Speculators included Governor Bowen\u2019s secretary, [[John Bramston (Australian politician)|John Bramston]], who purchased land at Oxley Point and [[Charles Blakeney (politician)|Charles Blakeney]], Frank McDougall and [[Arnold Wienholt]], who served in either the upper or lower houses of the colonial legislature during the 1860s, but did not reside locally.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral immigrants paid their fare to Australia from Britain and on arrival received land orders which equaled the cost of their fares. However, the [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4604131 initial price of land], \u00a31 per acre rose to \u00a33, then to \u00a36, thereby reducing the purchasing power of land orders. Original land purchasers such as Alexander Boyd, William Gray and [[Arthur Francis (politician)|Arthur Francis]] settled on or near elevated land now known as Corinda Hill.\nDespite their farming intentions, Boyd, Gray and Francis lacked experience. Having persevered, their contribution lay outside the local area: Boyd, a school inspector; Gray, a Congregational minister; and Francis, a magistrate. Other original land purchasers being the Strong and Orr families, (Oxley West), and the Lucock and Brodie families, (Oxley), continued to earn their living in the local area as farmers. They instead chose the fertile river and creek flats.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThe third category of land purchaser acquired their land from either speculators or selectors. The Berry and [[Sinnamon Farm|Sinnamon]] families who financed their trip from Northern Ireland, initially worked for original settlers, William Gray and William Dart.

Only half the acreage under cane was harvested, because of the effect of severe winters and accompanying frosts. By 1874 however, a disease [[Puccinia melanocephala|referred to as rust]], caused problems having devastated cane crops in Southern Queensland and consequently cane farming in the Oxley Creek district waned. Local farmers, like Joseph Tainton depended on reliable cereal crops and by the 1890s, farmers had added [[Dairy|dairying]] to their activities, continuing into the early 1900s. The number of farmers was 58 by 1900.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThere were summer heatwaves of the 1860s which contrasted with the severe winters of the 1870s which had adversely affected cane farming. New settlers experienced the humid conditions typical of a semi-tropical climate. Thomas Berry senior noted the hot summer of 1863, when the temperature in Fahrenheit averaged 95 degrees in the shade and 135 degrees outside. There was a drought in 1877 and pressure was put on the State Government to build a water reservoir in the Sherwood area. In 1878 a reservoir was built to dam watercourses at the rear of the Oxley West (Sherwood) State School.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article181819614|title=OXLEY.|date=1 June 1878|newspaper=[[The Week]]|access-date=3 March 2020|location=Queensland, Australia|page=22|via=Trove}}</ref> The most severe drought occurred between 1899 and 1902 when many of the Sinnamon family\u2019s stock perished.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThe characteristics of generosity, stubbornness and self-determination were attributed to William Gray, who settled locally in 1861.

The tragic and depressing aspect of pioneering life involved the loss of children at birth or in the months following. This was put down to the lack of pre-natal care and the scarcity of milk which contributed to problems after the birth of a child. The loss of children in infancy had a prolonged effect on Angela Francis. She was motivated to establish a mid-wife training scheme for women in isolated areas. On another occasion, to prevent the possibility of naive female migrants succumbing to the adverse influences of urban life, Angela Francis trained several young females as governesses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1863 the residents presented a petition to government signed by 30 residents, called for the construction of a bridge over Oxley Creek which had the effect of halving the distance to the Brisbane markets. The creek had recently been bridged upstream at Oxley during the construction of a new road from Ipswich to Brisbane. The government responded by building another bridge from Sherwood over Oxley Creek in 1864, one mile from its mouth and in 1865, a road linked this bridge to Rocky Waterholes ([[Rocklea, Queensland|Rocklea]]).

In 1873, a new hotel was constructed at the intersection of present day Ipswich and Oxley Roads. In 1889, 23 residents, in their petition expressed their objection that the new Oxley hotel, in addition to its Liquor licence, also had a [[Music hall|Music Hall]] licence.

By 1870, 137 out of the 193 school age children living in the district of Oxley West had enrolled, but only 50% of those attended the school regularly.

St. Joseph\u2019s convent, administered by an order of nuns, the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, had opened at Corinda in 1917 with 47 enrolments and by the early 1920s annual enrollments averaged 60.\n\nIn an effort to boost school attendance in 1900, the government enforced the compulsory clauses of the Education Act of 1875 which required children from 6 to 12 years to attend at least 60 days out of the 110 days of the school\u2019s half year. To ensure that this was adhered to, police acted as attendance officers. There were amendments to the Education Act which raised school leaving age to 14 if a child had not reached Class 5. Primary schools in Queensland were subjected to a government curriculum containing character forming elements. During the early 1900s, the School Paper, religious instruction and lessons in civics and morals were included in the curriculum. Between 1892 and 1920, Queensland primary schools used the Royal Reader.
