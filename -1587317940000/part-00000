It is located between Bangalore and Mangalore. \n\nHassan District contains the cities of Hassan and [[Arsikere]]. It has 4 other smaller towns of  [[Channarayapatna]], [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], [[Holenarasipura]], and [[Sakleshpur]]. It has two small villages [[Alur, Hassan|Alur]] and [[Arkalgud]]. \n\nCurrent Member of Parliament from Hassan is [[Prajwal Revanna]] who is also one of the youngest Lok Sabha member and is grandson of former Prime Minister of India [[H. D. Deve Gowda]].  \n\n==History==\nHassan district was the seat of the [[Hoysala Empire]] which at its peak ruled large parts of south India from [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] as its early capital and [[Halebidu]] as its later capital during the period 1000 - 1334 CE.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hassan |volume=13 |page=51}}</ref>\n\nThe district is named Hassan after the Goddess \"Haasanamba\", the goddess and presiding deity of the town. The history of Hassan district is essentially the history of two of the well known dynasties that have ruled Karnataka, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] of Talkad (350 - 999 CE) and the [[Hoysala Empire]] (1000 - 1334 CE). In the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] kings patronised Chennakesava of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] as their family deity. It was also ruled by [[Adilshahi]]s of [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] and [[Mughal Empire]] after decline of the Vijayanagar. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hassan became a land of contention between the [[Keladi Nayaka]]s of Shimoga and the [[Mysore Kingdom]]. It finally merged as an independent [[Mysore kingdom]].\n\n===Modern===\nDuring the 14th century, invasions by the [[Sultanate of Delhi]] weakened the Hoysala state, and the district became part of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].<ref name=\"Meyer, Sir William Stevenson 1931. p. 64\">Meyer, Sir William Stevenson.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hassan became a land of contention between the [[Keladi Nayaka]]s of Shimoga and the [[Mysore Kingdom]]. In 1648 the Mysore rulers built [[Channarayapatna]] fort by treaty with the sultans of Bijapur. A peace treaty was concluded between the Mysore and Keladi rulers in 1694.<ref name=\"Meyer, Sir William Stevenson 1931. p. 64\"/>  The district remained part of the Mysore Kingdom at the conclusion of the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] in 1799.\n\nHassan District and its current boundaries date to the 1860s, when the Mysore Kingdom was organized into 8 districts, and the districts further divided into [[taluk]]s.<ref>Meyer, Sir William Stevenson, et al. ''The Imperial Gazetteer of India''. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908-1931. v. 18, p. 228.</ref> The district had a population of 518,987 in the 1871 census. A famine from 1876 to 1878 reduced the population to 428,344 by 1881. The population was 511,975 in 1891, and 568,919 in 1901. The 1901 census recorded 541,531 Hindus, 16,668 Muslims, 5035 Animists, 3795 Christians, 1874 Jains, and 16 others. The district had 14 towns, and 2546 villages.<ref>Meyer, Sir William Stevenson.

The forests, with their area in square miles, were: Kempuhole Ghat (16), Kaganeri Ghati (2), Kabbinale Ghat (23), [[Bisle Reserve Forest|Bisale Ghat]] (23), Vijayapur (5), Hirikalgudda (92), Doddabetta (3), Burdalbore (3), Hagare (3), Byaba (2), Sige-gudda (8), Baisur (1), Mallappan-betta (1), and Vantigudda (1). The state established five [[sandalwood]] forests, totaling three square miles: Kemmanbore (232 acres), Gubbi (428 acres), Gadagere (554 acres), Gubbi (1000 acres), and Nakalgud (185 acres).<ref>Rice, B.

There are some areas of degraded forest ranges in central portion of the district.\n\nThe district is surrounded by [[Chikmagalur District]] to the north west, [[Chitradurga District]] to the north, [[Tumkur District]] to the east, [[Mandya District]] to the south east, [[Mysore]] to the south, [[Kodagu District]] to the south west and [[Dakshina Kannada]] district to the west.\n\nHassan and Belur stand around {{convert|3,215|ft|m}} and {{convert|3210|ft|m}} above sea level, respectively.\n\nMost of the district lies in the watershed of the [[Hemavathi River]], a tributary of the [[Kaveri River]]. The general level of Hassan district slopes with the course of the Hemavati, from the peaks of the [[Western Ghats]] downwards to the southeast. The chief tributary of the Hemavathi is the [[Yagachi River]], which flows southward from Belur taluk to join the Hemavathi near Gorur. In 1981 the Hemavathi Dam was completed near Gorur, downstream from the confluence with the Yagachi, creating a reservoir of 8000 hectares.<ref>Sugunan, V. V. (1995). ''Reservoir Fisheries of India'' Issue 345 of FAO fisheries technical paper, Food and Agriculture Organization. ISSN 0429-9345.  p. 155</ref> The Hemavathi passes through Holenarsipur taluk in a southerly direction and joins with the Kaveri near Hampapura in Mysore district, close to the border of Hassan district. The Kaveri flows through the southernmost part of the District.\n\nWestern portions of the district are drained by the headwaters of the [[Netravati River]], which flows northwestward to empty into the Arabian Sea. Portions of Asikere taluk in the northeast are drained by the Hogari River, a tributary of the [[Tungabhadra River]]. The basins of the Kaveri and Tungabhadra are separated by a range of low granitic hills extending through Belur, Hassan, and Arsikere taluks.\n\nThe Bisle Ghat, or Bisale Ghat, is a portion of the Western Ghats range in the western part of the district. Main peaks include Jenkalbetta ({{convert|4558|ft|m}}), the highest peak in the district, Murkangudda ({{convert|4265|ft|m}}), and Devarbetta ({{convert|4206|ft|m}}).

It is located between Bangalore and Mangalore. \n\nHassan District contains the cities of Hassan and [[Arsikere]]. It has 4 other smaller towns of  [[Channarayapatna]], [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], [[Holenarasipura]], and [[Sakleshpur]]. It has two small villages [[Alur, Hassan|Alur]] and [[Arkalgud]] \n\n==History==\nHassan district was the seat of the [[Hoysala Empire]] which at its peak ruled large parts of south India from [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] as its early capital and [[Halebidu]] as its later capital during the period 1000 - 1334 CE.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hassan |volume=13 |page=51}}</ref>\n\nThe district is named Hassan after the Goddess \"Haasanamba\", the goddess and presiding deity of the town. The history of Hassan district is essentially the history of two of the well known dynasties that have ruled Karnataka, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] of Talkad (350 - 999 CE) and the [[Hoysala Empire]] (1000 - 1334 CE). In the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] kings patronised Chennakesava of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] as their family deity. It was also ruled by [[Adilshahi]]s of [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] and [[Mughal Empire]] after decline of the Vijayanagar. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hassan became a land of contention between the [[Keladi Nayaka]]s of Shimoga and the [[Mysore Kingdom]]. It finally merged as an independent [[Mysore kingdom]].\n\n===Modern===\nDuring the 14th century, invasions by the [[Sultanate of Delhi]] weakened the Hoysala state, and the district became part of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].<ref name=\"Meyer, Sir William Stevenson 1931. p. 64\">Meyer, Sir William Stevenson.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hassan became a land of contention between the [[Keladi Nayaka]]s of Shimoga and the [[Mysore Kingdom]]. In 1648 the Mysore rulers built [[Channarayapatna]] fort by treaty with the sultans of Bijapur. A peace treaty was concluded between the Mysore and Keladi rulers in 1694.<ref name=\"Meyer, Sir William Stevenson 1931. p. 64\"/>  The district remained part of the Mysore Kingdom at the conclusion of the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] in 1799.\n\nHassan District and its current boundaries date to the 1860s, when the Mysore Kingdom was organized into 8 districts, and the districts further divided into [[taluk]]s.<ref>Meyer, Sir William Stevenson, et al. ''The Imperial Gazetteer of India''. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908-1931. v. 18, p. 228.</ref> The district had a population of 518,987 in the 1871 census. A famine from 1876 to 1878 reduced the population to 428,344 by 1881. The population was 511,975 in 1891, and 568,919 in 1901. The 1901 census recorded 541,531 Hindus, 16,668 Muslims, 5035 Animists, 3795 Christians, 1874 Jains, and 16 others. The district had 14 towns, and 2546 villages.<ref>Meyer, Sir William Stevenson.

The forests, with their area in square miles, were: Kempuhole Ghat (16), Kaganeri Ghati (2), Kabbinale Ghat (23), [[Bisle Reserve Forest|Bisale Ghat]] (23), Vijayapur (5), Hirikalgudda (92), Doddabetta (3), Burdalbore (3), Hagare (3), Byaba (2), Sige-gudda (8), Baisur (1), Mallappan-betta (1), and Vantigudda (1).

The general level of Hassan district slopes with the course of the Hemavati, from the peaks of the [[Western Ghats]] downwards to the southeast. The chief tributary of the Hemavathi is the [[Yagachi River]], which flows southward from Belur taluk to join the Hemavathi near Gorur. In 1981 the Hemavathi Dam was completed near Gorur, downstream from the confluence with the Yagachi, creating a reservoir of 8000 hectares.<ref>Sugunan, V. V. (1995).

ISSN 0429-9345.  p. 155</ref> The Hemavathi passes through Holenarsipur taluk in a southerly direction and joins with the Kaveri near Hampapura in Mysore district, close to the border of Hassan district. The Kaveri flows through the southernmost part of the District.\n\nWestern portions of the district are drained by the headwaters of the [[Netravati River]], which flows northwestward to empty into the Arabian Sea. Portions of Asikere taluk in the northeast are drained by the Hogari River, a tributary of the [[Tungabhadra River]]. The basins of the Kaveri and Tungabhadra are separated by a range of low granitic hills extending through Belur, Hassan, and Arsikere taluks.\n\nThe Bisle Ghat, or Bisale Ghat, is a portion of the Western Ghats range in the western part of the district. Main peaks include Jenkalbetta ({{convert|4558|ft|m}}), the highest peak in the district, Murkangudda ({{convert|4265|ft|m}}), and Devarbetta ({{convert|4206|ft|m}}).
