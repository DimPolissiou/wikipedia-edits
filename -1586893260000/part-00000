It was filmed with [[Technicolor]] sequences: four of the film's ten reels were originally photographed in Technicolor.\n\n''Paris'' was the fourth color film released by [[Warner Bros.]]; the first three were ''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'', ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' and ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'', all released in 1929. (''[[Song of the West]]'' was actually completed by June 1929 but had its release delayed until March 1930). The film was adapted from the [[Cole Porter]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical of the same name. The musical was Porter's first Broadway hit. No film elements of ''Paris'' are known to exist, although the complete soundtrack survives on [[Vitaphone]] disks. The sound tape reels for this film survives at [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].\n\n''Paris'' was the fourth film Warner Brothers had made with their Technicolor contract. The filmmakers used a color (Technicolor) process of red and green, at the time it was the third process of Technicolor.<ref>''The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30'' by The American Film Institute, c. 1971</ref><ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/P/Paris1929.html Progressive Silent Film List : ''Paris''] at silentera.com</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/mediahistory&tab=collection?and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Motion%20pictures%20--%20Catalogues%22 1957 MOVIES FROM AAP Warner Bros Features & Cartoons SALES BOOK DIRECTED AT TV]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIr\u00e8ne Bordoni is cast as Vivienne Rolland, a Parisian chorus girl in love with Massachusetts boy Andrew Sabbot (Jason Robards Sr.) Andrew's snobbish mother Cora (Louise Closser Hale) tries to break up the romance.

While this film was being shot, the studio was in the process of completing their all-star revue ''[[The Show of Shows]]'' (1929), so they had Bordoni film a number for the revue. Their initial intention was to have Bordoni star in two musical features, but due to the poor box-office reception of ''Paris'', they decided not to make any more films with her.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=10737 ''Paris'', original Broadway production at the Music Box Theatre, October 8 1928 to March 23 1929 totaling 195 performances; IBDb.com]</ref>\n\n==Songs==\n{| width=\"65%\"\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\" |\n*\"My Lover\"\n*\"Paris\"\n*\"Somebody Mighty Like You\"\n*\"An' Furthermore\"\n*\"Wob-a-ly Walk\"\n*\"Don't Look at Me That Way\"\n*\"Crystal Girl\"\n*\"I'm a Little Negative\"\n*\"I Wonder What is Really on his Mind\"\n*\"Miss Wonderful\"\n*\"Among My Souvenirs\"\n*\"The Land of Going to Be\"\n| width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\" |\n|}\n\n==Advertisement==\n''Paris'' utilized advertisements of a type which were common for its time, featuring the talking in the film and Ir\u00e8ne Bordoni starring.

It was filmed with [[Technicolor]] sequences: four of the film's ten reels were originally photographed in Technicolor.\n\n''Paris'' was the fourth color film released by [[Warner Bros.]]; the first three were ''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'', ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' and ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'', all released in 1929. (''[[Song of the West]]'' was actually completed by June 1929 but had its release delayed until March 1930). The film was adapted from the [[Cole Porter]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical of the same name. The musical was Porter's first Broadway hit. No film elements of ''Paris'' are known to exist, although the complete soundtrack survives on [[Vitaphone]] disks. The sound tape reels for this film survives at [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].\n\n''Paris'' was the fourth film Warner Brothers had made with their Technicolor contract. The filmmakers used a color (Technicolor) process of red and green, at the time it was the third process of Technicolor.<ref>''The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30'' by The American Film Institute, c. 1971</ref><ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/P/Paris1929.html Progressive Silent Film List : ''Paris''] at silentera.com</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/mediahistory&tab=collection?and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Motion%20pictures%20--%20Catalogues%22 1957 MOVIES FROM AAP Warner Bros Features & Cartoons SALES BOOK DIRECTED AT TV]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIr\u00e8ne Bordoni is cast as Vivienne Rolland, a Parisian chorus girl in love with Massachusetts boy Andrew Sabbot (Jason Robards Sr.) Andrew's snobbish mother Cora (Louise Closser Hale) tries to break up the romance.

While this film was being shot, the studio was in the process of completing their all-star revue ''[[The Show of Shows]]'' (1929), so they had Bordoni film a number for the revue. Their initial intention was to have Bordoni star in two musical features, but due to the poor box-office reception of ''Paris'', they decided not to make any more films with her.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=10737 ''Paris'', original Broadway production at the Music Box Theatre, October 8 1928 to March 23 1929 totaling 195 performances; IBDb.com]</ref>\n\n==Songs==\n{| width=\"65%\"\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\" |\n*\"My Lover\"\n*\"Paris\"\n*\"Somebody Mighty Like You\"\n*\"An' Furthermore\"\n*\"Wob-a-ly Walk\"\n*\"Don't Look at Me That Way\"\n*\"Crystal Girl\"\n*\"I'm a Little Negative\"\n*\"I Wonder What is Really on his Mind\"\n*\"Miss Wonderful\"\n*\"Among My Souvenirs\"\n*\"The Land of Going to Be\"\n| width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\" |\n|}\n\n==Advertisement==\n''Paris'' utilized advertisements of a type which were common for its time, featuring the talking in the film and Ir\u00e8ne Bordoni starring.

The notification will include a description of the vulnerability and the vulnerable products or systems, together with the agency's recommendation to either disseminate or restrict the vulnerability information.\n\nThe secretariat will then notify all participants of the submission within one business day, requesting them to respond if they have an relevant interest.<ref name=VEP2017/>\n\n=== Equity and discussions ===\n\nAn agency expressing an interest must indicate whether it concurs with the original recommendation to disseminate or restrict within five business days. If it does not, it will hold discussions with the submitting agency and the VEP secretariat within seven business days to attempt to reach consensus. If no consensus is reached, the participants will suggest options for the Equities Review Board.<ref name=VEP2017/>\n\n===Determination to disseminate or restrict ===\n\nDecisions whether to disclose or restrict a vulnerability should be made quickly, in full consultation with all concerned agencies, and in the overall best interest of the competing interests of the missions of the U.S. government. As far as possible, determinations should be based on rational, objective methodologies, taking into account factors such as prevalence, reliance, and severity.  \n\nIf the review board members cannot reach consensus, they will vote on a preliminary determination. If an agency with an equity disputes that decision, they may, by providing notice to the VEP secretariat, elect to contest the preliminary determination.  If no agency contests a preliminary determination, it will be treated as a final decision.<ref name=VEP2017/>\n\n=== Handling and follow-on actions ===\n\nIf vulnerability information is released, this will be done as quickly as possible, preferably within seven business days.  \n\nDisclosure of vulnerabilities will be conducted according to guidelines agreed on by all members. The submitting agency is presumed to be most knowledgeable about the vulnerability and, as such, will be responsible for disseminating vulnerability information to the vendor. The submitting agency may elect to delegate dissemination responsibility to another agency on its behalf.\n\nThe releasing agency will promptly provide a copy of the disclosed information to the VEP secretariat for record keeping.  Additionally, the releasing agency is expected to follow-up so the ERB can determine whether the vendor's action meets government requirements.
