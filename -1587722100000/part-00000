This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air. A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their air pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.

(Iron lungs must move larger quantities of air for every breath, because they must change the pressure of the air in the entire vessel, not just inflate the lungs).\n* Electrical power failure can result in prompt patient death. (Most iron lungs and similar devices lack backup power supplies. Manual power is an option on some units, but requires multiple attendants, working alternately, to provide direct, continuous physical pumping of the iron lung's pump or diaphragm.)\n* Physical hazard to people and things in the immediate vicinity, because of exposed moving parts (Not true of all iron lungs).\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

Since an invention must be novel to be patentable, prior publication/use of the invention meant it was not novel and therefore unpatentable. Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.\n\nThe United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions,<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /> such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

(Iron lungs must move larger quantities of air for every breath, because they must change the pressure of the air in the entire vessel, not just inflate the lungs).\n* Electrical power failure can result in prompt patient death. (Most iron lungs and similar devices lack backup power supplies. Manual power is an option on some units, but require multiple attendants, working alternately, to provide direct, continuous physical pumping of the iron lung's pump or diaphragm.)\n* Physical hazard to people and things in the immediate vicinity, because of exposed moving parts (Not true of all iron lungs).\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions,<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /> such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

He was the son of Alphonse E. Gagnon, a milling manager, and a cultured English mother, who was interested in literature.  Part of his childhood was spent in Sainte Rose, a village north of Montreal. Early in life, his mother had encouraged him to learn drawing and painting, but his father wanted him to become a businessman.\n\nHe studied with William Bremner at the Art Association of Montreal in 1897.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=1932 | title=Clarence Gagnon | publisher=www.gallery.ca | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref> Desiring to improve his knowledge about art, he went to the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in [[Paris]], and studied under [[Jean-Paul Laurens]] from 1904 to 1905. Before returning to Canada in 1909, Gagnon spent time painting in France and Italy.<ref name=Reid>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Dennis|title=A Concise History of Canadian Painting|url=https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00reid_0|url-access=registration|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0195402065|page=[https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00reid_0/page/127 127]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=1932 National Gallery of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00069674?rskey=2NbQCm&result=1 Benezit Dictionary of Artists]</ref><ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.T030394?rskey=2NbQCm&result=2 Grove Art Online]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe then lived in [[Baie-Saint-Paul]], where he produced many paintings depicting nature and the Canadian people. He invented a new kind of winter landscape that consisted of mountains, valleys, sharp contrasts, vivid colours, and sinuous lines. He became a member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]] in 1922.<ref name=RCA1880>{{cite web|title=Members since 1880 |url=http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts |accessdate=September 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526215339/http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |archivedate=May 26, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nGagnon took trips to [[Venice]], [[Rouen]], [[Saint-Malo]] and the [[Laurentian Mountains|Laurentians]] in Quebec to paint landscapes. He illustrated the pages of the novel ''[[Maria Chapdelaine]]'' by [[Louis H\u00e9mon]]. As well, he was the illustrator for Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rouquette in 1929 in ''Le Grand silence blanc''. He lived in [[France]] from 1924 to 1936.\n\nIn 1919 Gagnon married Lucile Rodier, also a pupil of William Bremner. Gagnon advanced [[modernist]] painting within Canada. One of his disciples was the painter [[Ren\u00e9 Richard]]. Gagnon's works were exhibited at Gallery [[L'Art fran\u00e7ais]].<ref>\"L'Art Fran\u00e7ais in Montreal\", Gallery Profile, in Le Collectionneur, Vol.1, n\u00b02, 1978, \"L'Art Fran\u00e7ais also sold the paintings of more \"classical\" painters such as (...)

Laurence was a member of the electronic music duo [[Big Bang (British band)|Big Bang]] when he opened Trade. Trade initially took around 3-4 months to grow in popularity. At the time, other clubs such as [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]], [[G-A-Y]] and [[The Fridge (nightclub)|The Fridge]] closed at around 2{{nbsp}}am to 3{{nbsp}}am on Sunday mornings, an hour or so before Trade opened at 3{{nbsp}}am.

Each improvement made resulted in more people enjoying the music, that was the ethic. The sound system played an important part in the club's success, there were multiple sound systems, each to cover an area and it was equalised (tone controls) in real time for each record to maximise sound quality and enjoyment.  This was a unique approach at the time and paid great dividends.\n\nAn air cooled, single colour laser was installed to complement the dance floor.  John Newman (AKA Big John), the owner of Turnmills, was often seen in the DJ booth operating the light show & laser with a wide smile on his face.\n\nTurnmill's dance floor was originally constructed of metal and the walls where covered in Athena and film poster. Laurence would spend all week washing and fire-retarding heavy black wool fabric, which was used to cover the tacky d\u00e9cor of the venue. Mr Newman would turn up at his venue prior to the Trade party, produce a lighter from his pocket and try and burn the fabric. This was a tedious weekly ceremony. After many many months, Mr Newman ditched the ceremony, dumped his kitsch decoration and painted the walls with black paint to create a \"theatrical\" (infinite) background. Using this blank canvas, Trade produced fluorescent banners and wall hangings illuminated by ultra violet lighting. These were created by Tim, Martin Brown and TradeMark (the artist who became closely associated with the club, later becoming Trade's manager). The banner and decoration themes changed regularly, usually on the special events parties held at Easter and on the Trade birthday party each October with spectacular fluorescent mobiles and effects projections.\n\nSmall video clips of the Trade dance floor appeared in the 1993 video 'Trance Vision Dance Volume 1' to accompany the 11th track on the video 'Let's Rock' by E. Trax.\n[[File:Outside Turnmills Jan 2008.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Turnmills - Trade's London home.]]\n\nAround 1993/4 a water-cooled white-light laser was installed. This was a substantial investment. With  a 3-phase 415-volt electricity supply and a constant supply of cold water running through it from the water mains.  The term \"white light\" can be confusing. It actually means that the light generated can be filtered to provide the full colour (rainbow) spectrum.\n\n==1995 - 2001==\nFrom about 1995 onwards Trade started to export their brand of music and clubbing experience and over the next few years, held events throughout the [[UK]] and worldwide, in addition to releasing a number of [[Compact Disc|CDs]].\n\nTrade were unable to hold their (by now legendary) New Year's Eve party at Turnmills in 1995. This was because New Year's Eve 1995 fell on a Sunday and the usual Turnmills Sunday night club - FF - held their NYE night at Turnmills. Trade held a successful New Years Day party at the Leisure Lounge in Holborn, London instead.\n\nAround 1995 Turnmills commissioned Peter Lynes again to design a totally new bespoke sound system for the main dance floor and balcony.  This was designed from scratch, every last loudspeaker cabinet was hand built to deliver surreal sound quality at unsurpassed volume levels without distortion.  The system design was based on the very best recording studio loudspeaker technology, but ramped up in scale 1000 fold & modified to cope. Ground breaking Digital processing equipment was used to enable consistent quality.  There was a sub-bass cabinet that used four 21-inch loudspeakers in front of the DJ booth. The result was that the club grew further in popularity as the club took sound quality so seriously.\n\nTrade suffered a setback on 2 July 1998 when popular [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] [[Tony De Vit]] died.\n\nDue to the global success of Trade, UK [[Channel 4]] television commissioned an hour-long documentary ''Trade the all-night bender'' which was broadcast on 9 August 1998 as part of the ''Queer Street'' series of programmes.<ref name=\"queer street\">{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/596306 |title=Queer Street |date=1998-08-01 |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> It featured in the [[BBC2]] programme \"Gaytime TV\" and also had a regular weekly radio show on [[Atlantic252]].\n\nOn 27 May 1999 Turnmills ended Trade's residency due to security problems at the previous weeks event. Trade negotiated a 4-week run at LA2 in the [[London Astoria]]. During this time the management of Trade and Turnmills resolved the issues. Trade returned to Turnmills on 3 July 1999 for the post Mardi Gras (the renamed London Gay Pride) party. The following month on 7 August 1999 Trade had a dance tent at Summer Rites in [[Brockwell Park]], the first time they had a tent at the festival.\n\nTowards the end of the 1990s, as Turnmills opened up and fit out more space in the venue, Trade was able to open up a second room named the 'Trade lite lounge' playing a lighter funkier style of house music which quickly gained a big following.\n\nIn 2000 Trade hosted one of the two  main stages (the other [[BBC Radio 1]]) for the first UK [[Love Parade]] festival held at [[Roundhay Park]], [[Leeds]] the event was attended by 500,000

Laurence was a member of the electronic music duo [[Big Bang (British band)|Big Bang]] when he opened Trade. Trade initially took around 3-4 months to grow in popularity. At the time, other clubs such as [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]], [[G-A-Y]] and [[The Fridge (nightclub)|The Fridge]] closed at around 2{{nbsp}}am to 3{{nbsp}}am on Sunday mornings, an hour or so before Trade opened at 3{{nbsp}}am. It took a while for clubbers to cotton on to the fact that they were able to go straight on to Trade to continue clubbing all night after the other clubs had closed. <ref name=\"tradehistory\"/><ref name=\"igougo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.igougo.com/entertainment-reviews-b35557-London-Heaven_Nightclub.html |title=IgoUgo Heaven review |date=2001-09-01 |publisher=IgoUgo |accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> Once they did, Trade exploded into the phenomena it became.\nAt the time many guys went [[Gay cruising in England and Wales|cruising]] in the parks after leaving other clubs. The name [[Trade (gay slang)|'Trade']] and the opening hours was to encourage guys to go to the club as a safer alternative.<ref name=\"circuit chat\">{{cite web |url=http://www.westhollywood.com/cc/trade/ |title=An Interview with Laurence Malice |publisher=Circuit Chat |accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref>\n\nTurnmills was the first club in the UK to be given a 24-hour \"Music & Dance\" licence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=Marcus|title=Laurence Malice on after-hours partying|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/10/24/laurence-malice-on-after-hours-partying-being-kidnapped-and-turning-away-axl-rose/|work=21 October 2011|publisher=London Independent Newspaper|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> This was gained after Laurence Malice had for a long period of time tried to convince Mr Newman that there was a need for people to be able to party in a safe environment after 3{{nbsp}}am.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=Marcus|title=Laurence Malice in conversation|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/10/24/laurence-malice-on-after-hours-partying-being-kidnapped-and-turning-away-axl-rose/|work=October 24th 2011|publisher=Independent Newspaper|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> \nDue to this licensing advantage, the venue's role was crucial to the success of Trade.\n\nSoon after Trade launched, the small original sound system had to be rapidly improved to cope with the tough demands being made of it. Each improvement made resulted in more people enjoying the music, that was the ethic. The sound system played an important part in the club's success, there were multiple sound systems, each to cover an area and it was equalised (tone controls) in real time for each record to maximise sound quality and enjoyment.  This was a unique approach at the time and paid great dividends.\n\nAn air cooled, single colour laser was installed to complement the dance floor.  John Newman (AKA Big John), the owner of Turnmills, was often seen in the DJ booth operating the light show & laser with a wide smile on his face.\n\nTurnmill's dance floor was originally constructed of metal and the walls where covered in Athena and film poster. Laurence would spend all week washing and fire-retarding heavy black wool fabric, which was used to cover the tacky d\u00e9cor of the venue. Mr Newman would turn up at his venue prior to the Trade party, produce a lighter from his pocket and try and burn the fabric. This was a tedious weekly ceremony. After many many months, Mr Newman ditched the ceremony, dumped his kitsch decoration and painted the walls with black paint to create a \"theatrical\" (infinite) background. Using this blank canvas, Trade produced fluorescent banners and wall hangings illuminated by ultra violet lighting. These were created by Tim, Martin Brown and TradeMark (the artist who became closely associated with the club, later becoming Trade's manager). The banner and decoration themes changed regularly, usually on the special events parties held at Easter and on the Trade birthday party each October with spectacular fluorescent mobiles and effects projections.\n\nSmall video clips of the Trade dance floor appeared in the 1993 video 'Trance Vision Dance Volume 1' to accompany the 11th track on the video 'Let's Rock' by E. Trax.\n[[File:Outside Turnmills Jan 2008.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Turnmills - Trade's London home.]]\n\nAround 1993/4 a water-cooled white-light laser was installed. This was a substantial investment. With  a 3-phase 415-volt electricity supply and a constant supply of cold water running through it from the water mains.  The term \"white light\" can be confusing. It actually means that the light generated can be filtered to provide the full colour (rainbow) spectrum.\n\n==1995 - 2001==\nFrom about 1995 onwards Trade started to export their brand of music and clubbing experience and over the next few years, held events throughout the [[UK]] and worldwide, in addition to releasing a number of [[Compact Disc|CDs]].\n\nTrade were unable to hold their (by now legendary) New Year's Eve party at Turnmills in 1995. This was because New Year's Eve 1995 fell on a Sunday and the usual Turnmills Sunday night club - FF - held their NYE night at Turnmills. Trade held a successful New Years Day party at the Leisure Lounge in Holborn, London instead.\n\nAround 1995 Turnmills commissioned Peter Lynes again to design a totally new bespoke sound system for the main dance floor and balcony.  This was designed from scratch, every last loudspeaker cabinet was hand built to deliver surreal sound quality at unsurpassed volume levels without distortion.  The system design was based on the very best recording studio loudspeaker technology, but ramped up in scale 1000 fold & modified to cope. Ground breaking Digital processing equipment was used to enable consistent quality.  There was a sub-bass cabinet that used four 21-inch loudspeakers in front of the DJ booth. The result was that the club grew further in popularity as the club took sound quality so seriously.\n\nTrade suffered a setback on 2 July 1998 when popular [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] [[Tony De Vit]] died.\n\nDue to the global success of Trade, UK [[Channel 4]] television commissioned an hour-long documentary ''Trade the all-night bender'' which was broadcast on 9 August 1998 as part of the ''Queer Street'' series of programmes.<ref name=\"queer street\">{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/596306 |title=Queer Street |date=1998-08-01 |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> It featured in the [[BBC2]] programme \"Gaytime TV\" and also had a regular weekly radio show on [[Atlantic252]].\n\nOn 27 May 1999 Turnmills ended Trade's residency due to security problems at the previous weeks event. Trade negotiated a 4-week run at LA2 in the [[London Astoria]]. During this time the management of Trade and Turnmills resolved the issues. Trade returned to Turnmills on 3 July 1999 for the post Mardi Gras (the renamed London Gay Pride) party. The following month on 7 August 1999 Trade had a dance tent at Summer Rites in [[Brockwell Park]], the first time they had a tent at the festival.\n\nTowards the end of the 1990s, as Turnmills opened

Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline. The group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and released their debut single album, ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'' (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] entries ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'' (2015), ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016), and ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. ''Wings'' became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single \"[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]\". The band is the first Korean act to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018), ''[[Map of the Soul: Persona]]'' (2019) and ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]'' (2020), making BTS the fastest group since [[the Beatles]] to earn four number one albums in less than two years. ''Love Yourself: Answer'' also broke South Korea's [[Gaon Album Chart]]'s all-time monthly record previously set by ''Love Yourself: Tear'' and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nHaving sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''Map of the Soul: 7''. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the [[IFPI]]'s Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won [[Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist|Top Social Artist]] three years in a row and [[Billboard Music Award for Top Duo/Group|Top Duo/Group]] at the [[2019 Billboard Music Awards|26th ''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. Featured on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and ''Time''<nowiki/>'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princes of Pop]]\". ''[[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Forbes Korea]]'' named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. BTS are ranked #4 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their [[Love Yourself World Tour]], BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out [[Wembley Stadium]]; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] history. ''Billboard'' ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list. As of 2019, BTS are purportedly worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP. BTS attracted one in every 13 foreign tourists that visited South Korea and were cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018.\n\nFollowing the establishment of their [[Love Myself (campaign)|Love Myself]] anti-violence campaign in partnership with [[UNICEF]], BTS addressed the [[United Nations]] 73rd [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and became the youngest ever recipients of the [[Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)|Order of Cultural Merit]] from the [[President of South Korea]] due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.\n\n==Name==\nThe group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression ''Bangtan Sonyeondan'' ({{korean|hangul=\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8|hanja={{linktext|\u9632\u5f48|\u5c11\u5e74|\u5718}}}}), literally meaning \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\".

|accessdate=25 January 2020 |work=Vulture |date=18 October 2018}}</ref> The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline. The group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and released their debut single album, ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'' (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] entries ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'' (2015), ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016), and ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. ''Wings'' became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single \"[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]\". The band is the first Korean act to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018), ''[[Map of the Soul: Persona]]'' (2019) and ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]'' (2020), making BTS the fastest group since [[the Beatles]] to earn four number one albums in less than two years. ''Love Yourself: Answer'' also broke South Korea's [[Gaon Album Chart]]'s all-time monthly record previously set by ''Love Yourself: Tear'' and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nHaving sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''Map of the Soul: 7''. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the [[IFPI]]'s Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won [[Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist|Top Social Artist]] three years in a row and [[Billboard Music Award for Top Duo/Group|Top Duo/Group]] at the [[2019 Billboard Music Awards|26th ''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. Featured on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and ''Time''<nowiki/>'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princes of Pop]]\". ''[[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Forbes Korea]]'' named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. BTS are ranked #4 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their [[Love Yourself World Tour]], BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out [[Wembley Stadium]]; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] history. ''Billboard'' ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list. As of 2019, BTS are purportedly worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP. BTS attracted one in every 13 foreign tourists that visited South Korea and were cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018.\n\nFollowing the establishment of their [[Love Myself (campaign)|Love Myself]] anti-violence campaign in partnership with [[UNICEF]], BTS addressed the [[United Nations]] 73rd [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and became the youngest ever recipients of the [[Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)|Order of Cultural Merit]] from the [[President of South Korea]] due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.\n\n==Name==\nThe group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression ''Bangtan Sonyeondan'' ({{korean|hangul=\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8|hanja={{linktext|\u9632\u5f48|\u5c11\u5e74|\u5718}}}}), literally meaning \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\".

{"title_page": "Demographics of Eswatini", "text_new": "This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Eswatini]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\n[[File:Ssa clem 48.jpg|thumb|Swazi people dancing in a cultural village show.]] \nThe majority of [[Eswatini]]'s population is ethnic [[Swazi people|Swazi]], mixed with a small number of [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s and white Africans, predominantly of [[British diaspora in Africa|British]] and [[Afrikaner]] origin. This population also includes a small segment within it that is mixed with any number of these ancestries.\n\nTraditionally Swazis have been subsistence farmers and herders, but most now work in the growing urban formal economy and in government. Some Swazis work in the mines in [[South Africa]]. Eswatini also received [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers and black refugees from [[Mozambique]]. [[Christianity]] in Eswatini is sometimes mixed with traditional beliefs and practices. Most Swazis ascribe a special spiritual role to the [[Swazi Royal Family]]. \n\nThe country's official languages are [[Siswati]] (a language related to Zulu) and [[English language|English]]. Government and commercial business is conducted mainly in English. Asians, Afrikaners, Portuguese, and black Mozambicans speak their own languages.\n\n==Population==\n[[Image:Eswatini-demography.png|thumb|250px|right|Demographics of then-Swaziland, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]\nEswatini's population is 1,467,152 according to the 2017 estimate from the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]. \nThe 2007 Census put the nation's population at 912,229. This number is lower than the 1997 Census, which gave 929,718 residents. The small difference is believed to be the result of massive emigration of Swazis to South Africa in search of work.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20071222.SWAZII22/TPStory/TPInternational/Africa/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226145953/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/where-have-all-the-swazis-gone/article141841/protected/ |archivedate=December 26, 2015 |access-date=2015-12-26|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|title=Where have all the Swazis gone?|first1=Stephanie|last1=Nolen|date=2009-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2010 revision of the World Population Prospects the total population was 1,186,000 in 2010, compared to only 273,000 in 1950.

This population also includes a small segment within it that is mixed with any number of these ancestries.\n\nTraditionally Swazis have been subsistence farmers and herders, but most now work in the growing urban formal economy and in government. Some Swazis work in the mines in [[South Africa]]. Eswatini also received [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers and black refugees from [[Mozambique]]. [[Christianity]] in Eswatini is sometimes mixed with traditional beliefs and practices. Most Swazis ascribe a special spiritual role to the [[Swazi Royal Family]]. \n\nThe country's official languages are [[Siswati]] (a language related to Zulu) and [[English language|English]]. Government and commercial business is conducted mainly in English. Asians, Afrikaners, Portuguese, and black Mozambicans speak their own languages.\n\n==Population==\n[[Image:Swaziland-demography.png|thumb|250px|right|Demographics of then-Swaziland, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]\nEswatini's population is 1,467,152 according to the 2017 estimate from the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]. \nThe 2007 Census put the nation's population at 912,229. This number is lower than the 1997 Census, which gave 929,718 residents. The small difference is believed to be the result of massive emigration of Swazis to South Africa in search of work.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20071222.SWAZII22/TPStory/TPInternational/Africa/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226145953/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/where-have-all-the-swazis-gone/article141841/protected/ |archivedate=December 26, 2015 |access-date=2015-12-26|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|title=Where have all the Swazis gone?|first1=Stephanie|last1=Nolen|date=2009-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2010 revision of the World Population Prospects the total population was 1,186,000 in 2010, compared to only 273,000 in 1950.

In the video Cher wore a big red flamenco dress and she sat in a red room while singing and petting a [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] dog. The concept of the song and video was considered{{by whom|date=March 2014}} an attempt to ride into the wave of the rising Latin influence in music at the time of its release, having both a Spanish genre, and Italian lyrics.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe track used for the original \"Dov'\u00e8 l'amore\" video was the [[Emilio Estefan, Jr.]] Radio Edit mix instead of the album version which is slightly slower and lasts nearly 30 seconds longer.\n\nIn late 1999, Dan-O-Rama remixed the \"Dov'\u00e8 l'amore\" video, but instead of using a remix of the song he left the \"Dov'\u00e8 l'amore\" (Emilio Estefan Jr. Radio Edit) in it and only remixed some video clips. In the year 2000, this video was released as a promo on [[VHS]] tape in the UK. In 2004, it was officially released on DVD in the video compilation, ''[[The Very Best of Cher: The Video Hits Collection]]''.\n\n==Live performances==\n[[Cher]] performed the song on the following concert tour:\n\n*[[Do You Believe?

During the course of the video many people are shown dancing to [[flamenco]], others are shown playing guitars and some people are just enjoying watching the dancers. In the video Cher wore a big red flamenco dress and she sat in a red room while singing and petting a [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] dog. The concept of the song and video was considered{{by whom|date=March 2014}} an attempt to ride into the wave of the rising Latin influence in music at the time of its release, having both a Spanish genre, and Italian lyrics.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe track used for the original \"Dov'\u00e8 l'amore\" video was the [[Emilio Estefan, Jr.]] Radio Edit mix instead of the album version which is slightly slower and lasts nearly 30 seconds longer.\n\nIn late 1999, Dan-O-Rama remixed the \"Dov'\u00e8 l'amore\" video, but instead of using a remix of the song he left the \"Dov'\u00e8 l'amore\" (Emilio Estefan Jr. Radio Edit) in it and only remixed some video clips. In the year 2000, this video was released as a promo on [[VHS]] tape in the UK. In 2004, it was officially released on DVD in the video compilation, ''[[The Very Best of Cher: The Video Hits Collection]]''.\n\n==Live performances==\n[[Cher]] performed the song on the following concert tour:\n\n*[[Do You Believe?

They were largely replaced by the [[Nguni people|Nguni]] during the great [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]]. These peoples originated from the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]]s of eastern and central Africa. Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the 4th century. People speaking languages ancestral to the current [[Sotho languages|Sotho]] and [[Nguni languages]] began settling no later than the 11th century.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\"/>\n\n===Swazi settlers (18th and 19th centuries)===\nThe Swazi settlers, then known as ''the Ngwane'' (or ''bakaNgwane'') before entering Eswatini, had been settled on the banks of the [[Pongola River]]. Before that, they were settled in the area of the Tembe River near present-day [[Maputo]], [[Mozambique]]. Continuing conflict with the [[Ndwandwe]] people pushed them further north, with [[Ngwane III]] establishing his capital at Shiselweni at the foot of the Mhlosheni hills.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\"/>\n\nUnder [[Sobhuza I]], the Ngwane people eventually established their capital at [[Zombodze]] in the heartland of present-day Eswatini. In this process, they conquered and incorporated the long-established clans of the country known to the Swazi as ''Emakhandzambili''.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\">Bonner, Philip (1983).

''KaNgwane'', named for Ngwane III, is an alternative name for Eswatini, the surname of whose [[dynasty|royal house]] remains ''Nkhosi [[House of Dlamini|Dlamini]]''. ''Nkhosi'' literally means \"king\". Mswati II was the greatest of the fighting kings of Eswatini, and he greatly extended the area of the country to twice its current size. The ''Emakhandzambili'' clans were initially incorporated into the kingdom with wide [[autonomy]], often including grants of special [[ritual]] and political status. The extent of their autonomy, however, was drastically curtailed by Mswati, who attacked and subdued some of them in the 1850s.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\" />\n\nWith his power, Mswati greatly reduced the influence of the ''Emakhandzambili'' while incorporating more people into his kingdom either through conquest or by giving them refuge. These later arrivals became known to the Swazis as ''Emafikamuva''. The clans who accompanied the Dlamini kings were known as the ''Bemdzabuko'' or ''true Swazi''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Johnston, W. and A.K. - South African Republic. Orange Free State, Natal, Basuto Land, Etc..jpg|thumb|right|In this map of Southern Africa from 1896, Eswatini is labelled as \"SWAZILAND\"]]\n\nThe autonomy of the Swazi nation was influenced by British and Dutch rule of southern Africa in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1881, the British government signed a convention recognising Swazi independence despite the [[Scramble for Africa]] that was taking place at the time. This independence was also recognised in the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention of 1884]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nBecause of controversial land/mineral rights and other concessions, Swaziland had a [[Triumvirate|triumviral]] administration in 1890 following the death of King [[Mbandzeni]] in 1889. This government represented the British, the Dutch republics, and the Swazi people. In 1894, a convention placed Swaziland under the [[South African Republic]] as a [[protectorate]]. This continued under the rule of [[Ngwane V]] until the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nKing Ngwane V died in December 1899, during [[incwala]], after the outbreak of the Second Boer War. His successor, [[Sobhuza II]], was four months old. Swaziland was indirectly involved in the war with various skirmishes between the British and the Boers occurring in the country until 1902.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===British rule over Swaziland (1906\u20131968)===\nIn 1903, after the British victory in the Second Boer War, Swaziland became a [[British protectorate]]. Much of its early administration (for example, postal services) was carried out from South Africa until 1906 when the [[Transvaal Colony]] was granted self-government. Following this, Swaziland was partitioned into European and non-European (or native reserves) areas with the former being two-thirds of the total land. Sobhuza's official coronation was in December 1921 after the regency of [[Labotsibeni Mdluli|Labotsibeni]], after which he led an unsuccessful deputation to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in London in 1922 regarding the issue of the land.<ref name=Vail91>{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Leroy|title=The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520074203|pages=295\u2013296|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X4VmAWdXPD0C&dq=Sobhuza+deputation+london}}</ref>\n\nIn the period between 1923 and 1963, Sobhuza II established the Swazi Commercial Amadoda which was to grant licences to small businesses on the Swazi reserves and also established the Swazi National School to counter the dominance of the missions in education.

Several rivers flow through the country, such as the [[Great Usutu River]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAlong the eastern border with Mozambique is the Lubombo, a mountain ridge, at an altitude of around {{convert|600|m}}. The mountains are broken by the [[canyon]]s of three rivers, the Ngwavuma, the [[Maputo River|Usutu]] and the [[Mbuluzi River]]. This is cattle ranching country. The western border of Eswatini, with an average altitude of {{convert|1200|m}}, lies on the edge of an [[escarpment]]. Between the mountains rivers rush through deep gorges. Mbabane, the capital, is on the Highveld.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Swaziland landscape.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Landscape in Eswatini]]\nThe [[Veld|Middleveld]], lying at an average {{convert|700|m}} above sea level is the most densely populated region of Eswatini with a lower rainfall than the mountains. Manzini, the principal commercial and industrial city, is situated in the Middleveld.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe [[Lowveld]] of Eswatini, at around {{convert|250|m}}, is less populated than other areas and presents a typical African bush country of thorn trees and grasslands. Development of the region was inhibited, in early days, by the scourge of [[malaria]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{further|Climate of Eswatini}}\nEswatini is divided into four climatic regions: the Highveld, Middleveld, Lowveld and Lubombo plateau. The seasons are the reverse of those in the Northern Hemisphere with December being mid-summer and June mid-winter. Generally speaking, rain falls mostly during the summer months, often in the form of thunderstorms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nWinter is the dry season. Annual rainfall is highest on the Highveld in the west, between {{convert|1000|and|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} depending on the year. The further east, the less rain, with the Lowveld recording {{convert|500|to|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per annum.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nVariations in temperature are also related to the altitude of the different regions. The Highveld temperature is temperate and seldom uncomfortably hot, while the Lowveld may record temperatures around {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in summer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe average temperatures at Mbabane, according to season:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Spring || September\u2013October || {{convert|18|\u00b0C|1}}\n|-\n| Summer || November\u2013March || {{convert|20|\u00b0C}}\n|-\n| Autumn || April\u2013May || {{convert|17|\u00b0C|1}}\n|-\n| Winter || June\u2013August || {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}}\n|}\n\n===Climate change===\nClimate change in Eswatini is mainly evident in changing precipitation - including variability, persistent drought and heightened storm intensity. In turn, this leads to desertification, increased food insecurity and reduced river flows. Despite being responsible for a negligible portion of total global greenhouse gas emissions Eswatini is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The government of Eswatini has expressed concern that climate change is exacerbating existing social challenges such as poverty, a high HIV prevalence and food insecurity and will drastically restrict the country's ability to develop, as per Vision 2022.<ref>https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Eswatini%20First/Eswatini%27s%20INDC.pdf Retrieved 5 March 2020</ref> Economically, climate change has already adversely impacted Eswatini. For instance, the 2015-2016 drought decreased sugar and soft drink concentrate production export (Eswatini's largest economic export). Many of Eswatini's major exports are raw, agricultural products and are therefore vulnerable to a changing climate.<ref>https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Eswatini%20First/Eswatini%27s%20INDC.pdf Retrieved 5 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Eswatini}}\n{{See also|Category: Flora of Swaziland}}\n[[File:\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 - Grewia villosa.jpg|thumb|''[[Grewia villosa]]'']]\n\nThere are known to be [[List of birds of Swaziland|507 bird species]] in Eswatini, including 11 globally threatened species and four introduced species, and [[List of mammals of Swaziland|107 mammal species]] endemic to Eswatini, including the critically endangered [[South-central black rhinoceros]] and seven other endangered or vulnerable species.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[Protected areas of Eswatini]] include seven nature reserves, four frontier conservation areas and three wildlife or game reserves.

[[Land tenure|Title Deed]] Lands (TDLs), where the bulk of high value crops are grown (sugar, forestry, and citrus) are characterised by high levels of investment and irrigation, and high productivity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAbout 75% of the population is employed in [[subsistence agriculture]] upon [[Swazi Nation Land]] (SNL). In contrast with the commercial farms, Swazi Nation Land suffers from low productivity and investment. This dual nature of the Swazi economy, with high productivity in textile manufacturing and in the industrialised agricultural TDLs on the one hand, and declining productivity subsistence agriculture (on SNL) on the other, may well explain the country's overall low growth, high inequality and unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEconomic growth in Eswatini has lagged behind that of its neighbours. Real GDP growth since 2001 has averaged 2.8%, nearly 2 percentage points lower than growth in other [[Southern African Customs Union]] (SACU) member countries. Low agricultural productivity in the SNLs, repeated droughts, the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS and an overly large and inefficient government sector are likely contributing factors. Eswatini's public finances deteriorated in the late 1990s following sizeable surpluses a decade earlier. A combination of declining revenues and increased spending led to significant budget deficits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Central bank swazi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Central Bank in Mbabane]]\n\nThe considerable spending did not lead to more growth and did not benefit the poor.  Much of the increased spending has gone to current expenditures related to wages, transfers, and subsidies.  The wage bill today constitutes over 15% of GDP and 55% of total public spending; these are some of the highest levels on the African continent.  The recent rapid growth in SACU revenues has, however, reversed the fiscal situation, and a sizeable surplus was recorded since 2006. [[SACU]] revenues today account for over 60% of total government revenues.  On the positive side, the external debt burden has declined markedly over the last 20 years, and domestic debt is almost negligible; external debt as a percent of GDP was less than 20% in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini's economy is very closely linked to the [[economy of South Africa]], from which it receives over 90% of its imports and to which it sends about 70% of its exports. Eswatini's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU, from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports (under the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]&nbsp;\u2013 AGOA&nbsp;\u2013 to the US) and for sugar (to the EU).  Under these agreements, both apparel and sugar exports did well, with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment.  Textile exports grew by over 200% between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50% over the same period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Southern African Customs Union.svg|thumb|Eswatini is part of the [[Southern African Customs Union]] (green).]]\n\nThe continued vibrancy of the export sector is threatened by the removal of trade preferences for textiles, the accession to similar preferences for East Asian countries, and the phasing out of preferential prices for sugar to the EU market. Eswatini will thus have to face the challenge of remaining competitive in a changing global environment. A crucial factor in addressing this challenge is the investment climate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe recently concluded Investment Climate Assessment provides some positive findings in this regard, namely that Eswatini firms are among the most productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, although they are less productive than firms in the most productive middle-income countries in other regions. They compare more favourably with firms from lower middle income countries, but are hampered by inadequate governance arrangements and infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini's currency, the [[Swazi lilangeni|lilangeni]], is pegged to the [[South African rand]], subsuming Eswatini's monetary policy to South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union, which may equal as much as 70% of government revenue this year, and worker [[remittance]]s from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income. Eswatini is not poor enough to merit an [[IMF]] programme; however, the country is struggling to reduce the size of the civil service and control costs at public enterprises. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for [[foreign direct investment]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Society==\n\n===Demographics===\n{{main|Demographics of Eswatini}}\n[[File:Eswatini-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Eswatini's population in thousands (1961\u20132013)]]\n\nThe majority of Eswatini's population is ethnically [[Swazi people|Swazi]], mixed with a small number of [[Zulus|Zulu]] and [[White Africans]], mostly people of British and [[Afrikaner]] descent. Traditionally Swazi have been [[subsistence farmers]] and herders, but most now mix such activities with work in the growing urban formal economy and in government. Some Swazi work in the mines in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini also received [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers and African refugees from [[Mozambique]]. Christianity in Eswatini is sometimes mixed with traditional beliefs and practices. Many traditionalists believe that most Swazi ascribe a special spiritual role to the monarch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Population centres===\n{{further|List of cities in Eswatini}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nThis is a list of major cities and towns in Eswatini.

In a polygamous homestead, each wife has her own hut and yard surrounded by reed fences. There are three structures for sleeping, cooking, and storage (brewing beer). In larger homesteads there are also structures used as bachelors' quarters and guest accommodation.\n\nCentral to the traditional homestead is the cattle [[byre]], a circular area enclosed by large logs, interspaced with branches. The cattle byre has ritual as well as practical significance as a store of wealth and symbol of prestige. It contains sealed grain pits. Facing the cattle byre is the great hut which is occupied by the mother of the headman.\n\nThe headman is central to all homestead affairs and he is often [[polygamous]]. He leads through example and advises his wives on all social affairs of the home as well as seeing to the larger survival of the family. He also spends time socialising with the young boys, who are often his sons or close relatives, advising them on the expectations of growing up and manhood.\n\nThe [[Sangoma]] is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family. The training of the Sangoma is called \"kwetfwasa\". At the end of the training, a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing. The diviner is consulted for various purposes, such as determining the cause of sickness or even death. His diagnosis is based on \"kubhula\", a process of communication, through trance, with the natural superpowers. The [[Inyanga]] (a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms) possesses the bone throwing skill (\"kushaya ematsambo\") used to determine the cause of the sickness.\n\nThe most important cultural event in Eswatini is the [[Incwala]] ceremony. It is held on the fourth day after the full moon nearest the longest day, 21 December. Incwala is often translated in English as \"first fruits ceremony\", but the King's tasting of the new harvest is only one aspect among many in this long pageant. Incwala is best translated as \"Kingship Ceremony\": when there is no king, there is no Incwala. It is [[high treason]] for any other person to hold an Incwala.\n\nEvery Swazi may take part in the public parts of the Incwala. The climax of the event is the fourth day of the Big Incwala. The key figures are the King, Queen Mother, royal wives and children, the royal governors ([[induna]]s), the chiefs, the regiments, and the \"bemanti\" or \"water people\".\n\nEswatini's most well-known cultural event is the annual [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga Reed Dance]]. In the eight-day ceremony, girls cut reeds and present them to the queen mother and then dance. (There is no formal competition.) It is done in late August or early September. Only childless, unmarried girls can take part. The aims of the ceremony are to preserve girls' chastity, provide tribute labour for the Queen mother, and to encourage solidarity by working together. The royal family appoints a commoner maiden to be \"induna\" (captain) of the girls and she announces over the radio the dates of the ceremony. She will be an expert dancer and knowledgeable on royal protocol. One of the King's daughters will be her counterpart.\n\nThe Reed Dance today is not an ancient ceremony but a development of the old \"[[umchwasho]]\" custom. In \"umchwasho\", all young girls were placed in a female age-regiment. If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid a fine of one cow to the local chief. After a number of years, when the girls had reached a marriageable age, they would perform labour service for the Queen Mother, ending with dancing and feasting. The country was under the [[Sexual abstinence|chastity]] [[rite]] of \"umchwasho\" until 19 August 2005.\n\nEswatini is also known for a strong presence in the handcrafts industry. The formalised handcraft businesses of Eswatini employ over 2,500 people, many of whom are women (per ''TechnoServe Swaziland Handcrafts Impact Study'', February 2011). The products are unique and reflect the culture of Eswatini, ranging from housewares, to artistic decorations, to complex glass, stone, or wood artwork.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\">\nFile:Princess Swaziland 015.jpg|Princess [[Sikhanyiso Dlamini]] at the [[Reed Dance|reed dance (umhlanga)]] festival\nFile:Swaziland - Traditional homes.jpg|A traditional Swazi homestead\nFile:Swazi Warriors.jpg|Swazi warriors at the [[incwala]] ceremony\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Africa}}\n* [[Index of Eswatini-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Eswatini]]\n*[[HIV/AIDS in Eswatini]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|wikt=eSwatini|voy=Swaziland|c=Category:Swaziland|n=Category:Swaziland|v=no|b=no|s=Portal:Swaziland}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|wz|Eswatini}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090521105240/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/swaziland.htm Swaziland] from ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* {{curlie|Regional/Africa/Swaziland}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14095303 eSwatini] from the [[BBC News]]\n* {{wikiatlas|Eswatini}}\n* [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_CountryProfile.aspx?Country=SZ Key Development Forecasts for Swaziland] from [[International Futures]]\n* [http://www.gov.sz/ Government of Eswatini]\n* [http://www.thekingdomofeswatini.com/ Welcome to Eswatini | The Kingdom of Eswatini] (Official Eswatini tourism website)\n\n{{Swaziland topics}}\n{{Navboxes\n | title =Related articles \n | list =\n{{Southern African Development Community}}\n{{African Union}}\n{{Commonwealth of Nations}}\n{{Countries of Africa}}\n{{Somali Plate}}\n{{Monarchies |collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Eswatini| ]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Swaziland]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth monarchies]]\n[[Category:Countries in Africa]]\n[[Category:English-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Kingdoms]]\n[[Category:Landlocked countries]]\n[[Category:Member states of the African Union]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Southern African countries]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1968]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Landlocked kingdom in southern Africa}}\n{{Use Commonwealth English|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2018}}\n<!--\n*** Don't edit this article to change the name of the country to Swaziland without reading the consensus on this article's talk page first.

''KaNgwane'', named for Ngwane III, is an alternative name for Eswatini, the surname of whose [[dynasty|royal house]] remains ''Nkhosi [[House of Dlamini|Dlamini]]''. ''Nkhosi'' literally means \"king\". Mswati II was the greatest of the fighting kings of Eswatini, and he greatly extended the area of the country to twice its current size. The ''Emakhandzambili'' clans were initially incorporated into the kingdom with wide [[autonomy]], often including grants of special [[ritual]] and political status. The extent of their autonomy, however, was drastically curtailed by Mswati, who attacked and subdued some of them in the 1850s.<ref name=\"BonnerPhilip\" />\n\nWith his power, Mswati greatly reduced the influence of the ''Emakhandzambili'' while incorporating more people into his kingdom either through conquest or by giving them refuge. These later arrivals became known to the Swazis as ''Emafikamuva''. The clans who accompanied the Dlamini kings were known as the ''Bemdzabuko'' or ''true Swazi''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Johnston, W. and A.K. - South African Republic.

In 1881, the British government signed a convention recognising Swazi independence despite the [[Scramble for Africa]] that was taking place at the time. This independence was also recognised in the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention of 1884]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nBecause of controversial land/mineral rights and other concessions, Swaziland had a [[Triumvirate|triumviral]] administration in 1890 following the death of King [[Mbandzeni]] in 1889. This government represented the British, the Dutch republics, and the Swazi people. In 1894, a convention placed Swaziland under the [[South African Republic]] as a [[protectorate]]. This continued under the rule of [[Ngwane V]] until the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nKing Ngwane V died in December 1899, during [[incwala]], after the outbreak of the Second Boer War. His successor, [[Sobhuza II]], was four months old. Swaziland was indirectly involved in the war with various skirmishes between the British and the Boers occurring in the country until 1902.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===British rule over Swaziland (1906\u20131968)===\nIn 1903, after the British victory in the Second Boer War, Swaziland became a [[British protectorate]]. Much of its early administration (for example, postal services) was carried out from South Africa until 1906 when the [[Transvaal Colony]] was granted self-government. Following this, Swaziland was partitioned into European and non-European (or native reserves) areas with the former being two-thirds of the total land. Sobhuza's official coronation was in December 1921 after the regency of [[Labotsibeni Mdluli|Labotsibeni]], after which he led an unsuccessful deputation to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in London in 1922 regarding the issue of the land.<ref name=Vail91>{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Leroy|title=The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520074203|pages=295\u2013296|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X4VmAWdXPD0C&dq=Sobhuza+deputation+london}}</ref>\n\nIn the period between 1923 and 1963, Sobhuza II established the Swazi Commercial Amadoda which was to grant licences to small businesses on the Swazi reserves and also established the Swazi National School to counter the dominance of the missions in education. His stature grew with time and the Swazi royal leadership was successful in resisting the weakening power of the British administration and the incorporation of Swaziland into the [[Union of South Africa]].<ref name=Vail91 />\n\nThe constitution for independent Swaziland was promulgated by Britain in November 1963 under the terms of which legislative and executive councils were established. This development was opposed by the Swazi National Council (''liqoqo''). Despite such opposition, elections took place and the first ''Legislative Council of Swaziland'' was constituted on 9 September 1964. Changes to the original constitution proposed by the Legislative Council were accepted by Britain and a new constitution providing for a House of Assembly and Senate was drawn up. Elections under this constitution were held in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Independence (1968\u2013present)===\nFollowing the 1967 elections, Swaziland was a protected state until independence was regained in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/56/enacted?view=plain|title=Swaziland Independence Act 1968|website=legislation.gov.uk|access-date=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the elections of 1973, the constitution of Swaziland was suspended by King Sobhuza II who thereafter ruled the country by [[decree]] until his death in 1982.

Several rivers flow through the country, such as the [[Great Usutu River]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAlong the eastern border with Mozambique is the Lubombo, a mountain ridge, at an altitude of around {{convert|600|m}}. The mountains are broken by the [[canyon]]s of three rivers, the Ngwavuma, the [[Maputo River|Usutu]] and the [[Mbuluzi River]]. This is cattle ranching country. The western border of Eswatini, with an average altitude of {{convert|1200|m}}, lies on the edge of an [[escarpment]]. Between the mountains rivers rush through deep gorges.

Development of the region was inhibited, in early days, by the scourge of [[malaria]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{further|Climate of Eswatini}}\nEswatini is divided into four climatic regions: the Highveld, Middleveld, Lowveld and Lubombo plateau. The seasons are the reverse of those in the Northern Hemisphere with December being mid-summer and June mid-winter. Generally speaking, rain falls mostly during the summer months, often in the form of thunderstorms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nWinter is the dry season.

In turn, this leads to desertification, increased food insecurity and reduced river flows. Despite being responsible for a negligible portion of total global greenhouse gas emissions Eswatini is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The government of Eswatini has expressed concern that climate change is exacerbating existing social challenges such as poverty, a high HIV prevalence and food insecurity and will drastically restrict the country's ability to develop, as per Vision 2022.<ref>https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Eswatini%20First/Eswatini%27s%20INDC.pdf Retrieved 5 March 2020</ref> Economically, climate change has already adversely impacted Eswatini. For instance, the 2015-2016 drought decreased sugar and soft drink concentrate production export (Eswatini's largest economic export). Many of Eswatini's major exports are raw, agricultural products and are therefore vulnerable to a changing climate.<ref>https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Eswatini%20First/Eswatini%27s%20INDC.pdf Retrieved 5 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Eswatini}}\n{{See also|Category: Flora of Swaziland}}\n[[File:\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 - Grewia villosa.jpg|thumb|''[[Grewia villosa]]'']]\n\nThere are known to be [[List of birds of Swaziland|507 bird species]] in Eswatini, including 11 globally threatened species and four introduced species, and [[List of mammals of Swaziland|107 mammal species]] endemic to Eswatini, including the critically endangered [[South-central black rhinoceros]] and seven other endangered or vulnerable species.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[Protected areas of Eswatini]] include seven nature reserves, four frontier conservation areas and three wildlife or game reserves.

[[Land tenure|Title Deed]] Lands (TDLs), where the bulk of high value crops are grown (sugar, forestry, and citrus) are characterised by high levels of investment and irrigation, and high productivity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAbout 75% of the population is employed in [[subsistence agriculture]] upon [[Swazi Nation Land]] (SNL). In contrast with the commercial farms, Swazi Nation Land suffers from low productivity and investment. This dual nature of the Swazi economy, with high productivity in textile manufacturing and in the industrialised agricultural TDLs on the one hand, and declining productivity subsistence agriculture (on SNL) on the other, may well explain the country's overall low growth, high inequality and unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEconomic growth in Eswatini has lagged behind that of its neighbours. Real GDP growth since 2001 has averaged 2.8%, nearly 2 percentage points lower than growth in other [[Southern African Customs Union]] (SACU) member countries. Low agricultural productivity in the SNLs, repeated droughts, the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS and an overly large and inefficient government sector are likely contributing factors. Eswatini's public finances deteriorated in the late 1990s following sizeable surpluses a decade earlier. A combination of declining revenues and increased spending led to significant budget deficits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Central bank swazi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Central Bank in Mbabane]]\n\nThe considerable spending did not lead to more growth and did not benefit the poor.  Much of the increased spending has gone to current expenditures related to wages, transfers, and subsidies.  The wage bill today constitutes over 15% of GDP and 55% of total public spending; these are some of the highest levels on the African continent.  The recent rapid growth in SACU revenues has, however, reversed the fiscal situation, and a sizeable surplus was recorded since 2006. [[SACU]] revenues today account for over 60% of total government revenues.  On the positive side, the external debt burden has declined markedly over the last 20 years, and domestic debt is almost negligible; external debt as a percent of GDP was less than 20% in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini's economy is very closely linked to the [[economy of South Africa]], from which it receives over 90% of its imports and to which it sends about 70% of its exports. Eswatini's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU, from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports (under the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]&nbsp;\u2013 AGOA&nbsp;\u2013 to the US) and for sugar (to the EU).  Under these agreements, both apparel and sugar exports did well, with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment.  Textile exports grew by over 200% between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50% over the same period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Southern African Customs Union.svg|thumb|Eswatini is part of the [[Southern African Customs Union]] (green).]]\n\nThe continued vibrancy of the export sector is threatened by the removal of trade preferences for textiles, the accession to similar preferences for East Asian countries, and the phasing out of preferential prices for sugar to the EU market. Eswatini will thus have to face the challenge of remaining competitive in a changing global environment. A crucial factor in addressing this challenge is the investment climate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe recently concluded Investment Climate Assessment provides some positive findings in this regard, namely that Eswatini firms are among the most productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, although they are less productive than firms in the most productive middle-income countries in other regions. They compare more favourably with firms from lower middle income countries, but are hampered by inadequate governance arrangements and infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini's currency, the [[Swazi lilangeni|lilangeni]], is pegged to the [[South African rand]], subsuming Eswatini's monetary policy to South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union, which may equal as much as 70% of government revenue this year, and worker [[remittance]]s from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income. Eswatini is not poor enough to merit an [[IMF]] programme; however, the country is struggling to reduce the size of the civil service and control costs at public enterprises. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for [[foreign direct investment]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Society==\n\n===Demographics===\n{{main|Demographics of Eswatini}}\n[[File:Swaziland-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Eswatini's population in thousands (1961\u20132013)]]\n\nThe majority of Eswatini's population is ethnically [[Swazi people|Swazi]], mixed with a small number of [[Zulus|Zulu]] and [[White Africans]], mostly people of British and [[Afrikaner]] descent. Traditionally Swazi have been [[subsistence farmers]] and herders, but most now mix such activities with work in the growing urban formal economy and in government. Some Swazi work in the mines in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEswatini also received [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers and African refugees from [[Mozambique]].

In a polygamous homestead, each wife has her own hut and yard surrounded by reed fences. There are three structures for sleeping, cooking, and storage (brewing beer). In larger homesteads there are also structures used as bachelors' quarters and guest accommodation.\n\nCentral to the traditional homestead is the cattle [[byre]], a circular area enclosed by large logs, interspaced with branches. The cattle byre has ritual as well as practical significance as a store of wealth and symbol of prestige. It contains sealed grain pits. Facing the cattle byre is the great hut which is occupied by the mother of the headman.\n\nThe headman is central to all homestead affairs and he is often [[polygamous]]. He leads through example and advises his wives on all social affairs of the home as well as seeing to the larger survival of the family. He also spends time socialising with the young boys, who are often his sons or close relatives, advising them on the expectations of growing up and manhood.\n\nThe [[Sangoma]] is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family. The training of the Sangoma is called \"kwetfwasa\". At the end of the training, a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing. The diviner is consulted for various purposes, such as determining the cause of sickness or even death. His diagnosis is based on \"kubhula\", a process of communication, through trance, with the natural superpowers. The [[Inyanga]] (a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms) possesses the bone throwing skill (\"kushaya ematsambo\") used to determine the cause of the sickness.\n\nThe most important cultural event in Eswatini is the [[Incwala]] ceremony. It is held on the fourth day after the full moon nearest the longest day, 21 December. Incwala is often translated in English as \"first fruits ceremony\", but the King's tasting of the new harvest is only one aspect among many in this long pageant. Incwala is best translated as \"Kingship Ceremony\": when there is no king, there is no Incwala. It is [[high treason]] for any other person to hold an Incwala.\n\nEvery Swazi may take part in the public parts of the Incwala. The climax of the event is the fourth day of the Big Incwala. The key figures are the King, Queen Mother, royal wives and children, the royal governors ([[induna]]s), the chiefs, the regiments, and the \"bemanti\" or \"water people\".\n\nEswatini's most well-known cultural event is the annual [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga Reed Dance]]. In the eight-day ceremony, girls cut reeds and present them to the queen mother and then dance. (There is no formal competition.) It is done in late August or early September. Only childless, unmarried girls can take part. The aims of the ceremony are to preserve girls' chastity, provide tribute labour for the Queen mother, and to encourage solidarity by working together. The royal family appoints a commoner maiden to be \"induna\" (captain) of the girls and she announces over the radio the dates of the ceremony. She will be an expert dancer and knowledgeable on royal protocol. One of the King's daughters will be her counterpart.\n\nThe Reed Dance today is not an ancient ceremony but a development of the old \"[[umchwasho]]\" custom. In \"umchwasho\", all young girls were placed in a female age-regiment. If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid a fine of one cow to the local chief. After a number of years, when the girls had reached a marriageable age, they would perform labour service for the Queen Mother, ending with dancing and feasting. The country was under the [[Sexual abstinence|chastity]] [[rite]] of \"umchwasho\" until 19 August 2005.\n\nEswatini is also known for a strong presence in the handcrafts industry. The formalised handcraft businesses of Eswatini employ over 2,500 people, many of whom are women (per ''TechnoServe Swaziland Handcrafts Impact Study'', February 2011). The products are unique and reflect the culture of Eswatini, ranging from housewares, to artistic decorations, to complex glass, stone, or wood artwork.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\">\nFile:Princess Swaziland 015.jpg|Princess [[Sikhanyiso Dlamini]] at the [[Reed Dance|reed dance (umhlanga)]] festival\nFile:Swaziland - Traditional homes.jpg|A traditional Swazi homestead\nFile:Swazi Warriors.jpg|Swazi warriors at the [[incwala]] ceremony\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Africa}}\n* [[Index of Eswatini-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Eswatini]]\n*[[HIV/AIDS in Eswatini]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|wikt=eSwatini|voy=Swaziland|c=Category:Swaziland|n=Category:Swaziland|v=no|b=no|s=Portal:Swaziland}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|wz|Eswatini}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090521105240/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/swaziland.htm Swaziland] from ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* {{curlie|Regional/Africa/Swaziland}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14095303 eSwatini] from the [[BBC News]]\n* {{wikiatlas|Eswatini}}\n* [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_CountryProfile.aspx?Country=SZ Key Development Forecasts for Swaziland] from [[International Futures]]\n* [http://www.gov.sz/ Government of Eswatini]\n* [http://www.thekingdomofeswatini.com/ Welcome to Eswatini | The Kingdom of Eswatini] (Official Eswatini tourism website)\n\n{{Swaziland topics}}\n{{Navboxes\n | title =Related articles \n | list =\n{{Southern African Development Community}}\n{{African Union}}\n{{Commonwealth of Nations}}\n{{Countries of Africa}}\n{{Somali Plate}}\n{{Monarchies |collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Eswatini| ]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Swaziland]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth monarchies]]\n[[Category:Countries in Africa]]\n[[Category:English-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Kingdoms]]\n[[Category:Landlocked countries]]\n[[Category:Member states of the African Union]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Southern African countries]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1968]]\n", "name_user": "TommyG", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:Swaziland-demography.png\u2192File:Eswatini-demography.pngCriterion 3(obvious error) \u00b7 The new official name \"Eswatini\" has been officially recognized by the United Nations since August 2018 (UN M49 standard).
