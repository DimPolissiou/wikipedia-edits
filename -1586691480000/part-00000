In his third speech on the war, Robespierre countered <!--on 25 January 1792--> in the Jacobin club, \"A revolutionary war must be waged to free subjects and slaves from unjust tyranny, not for the traditional reasons of defending dynasties and expanding frontiers...\" Indeed, argued Robespierre, such a war could only favour the forces of counter-revolution, since it would play into the hands of those who opposed the sovereignty of the people. The risks of [[Caesarism]] were clear, for, in wartime, the powers of the generals would grow at the expense of ordinary soldiers, and the power of the king and court at the expense of the Assembly. These dangers should not be overlooked, he reminded his listeners; \"...in troubled periods of history, generals often became the arbiters of the fate of their countries.\"{{sfn|Haydon|Doyle|2006|loc= in \"Robespierre, the war and its organization\" by Forrest, A}} <!--Robespierre spoke for many deputies when queried the wisdom of spreading France's commitments too widely, or of risking the uncertainties of foreign war when there were enemies to be rooted out at home.<ref>A.

This compulsion hardly belongs to the man who enunciates them; it belongs to universal reason and to all men who wish to listen to its voice. It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality...

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], a former colonel in the National Guard, who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability.

Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the [[Dauphin of France]], Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

On the day after the emancipation decree, Robespierre delivered a speech to the National Convention in which he praised the French as the first to \"summon all men to equality and liberty, and their full rights as citizens,\" using the word slavery twice but without specifically mentioning the French colonies.{{sfn|Popkin|2010|pp=350\u201370}} Despite petitions from the slaveholding delegation, Robespierre and the Committee decided to endorse the decree in full.{{sfn|Popkin|2010|pp=350\u201370}}\n\nSeveral weeks later, in a speech before the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre linked the cruelty of slavery with serfdom:\n\n{{quote|Ask a merchant of human flesh what is property; he will answer by showing you that long coffin he calls a ship...

On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the [[existence of God]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]''.\n\nIn the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of [[Pentecost]]) a \"Festival of the Supreme Being\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the [[Bastille]]. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the [[Tuileries]].{{sfn | Moore | 2007 | p=291}} ([[Joachim Vilate]] had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.)\n\nThe festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the Convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=308}} Witnesses state that throughout the \"Festival of the Supreme Being\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\"<ref>Michelet, J.

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-supreme.asp|title=Robespierre, M. \"The Cult of the Supreme Being\", in Modern History Sourcebook, 1997|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRobespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled [[Moses]] as the leader of the people.

He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution.

There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]]. This returned to public view Robespierre\u2019s only surviving contemporary sculpted portrait. A plaster cast of it is displayed at the Conciergerie in Paris, and a bronze cast is in the Place de la R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise in [[Montpellier]], with bronzes of other figures of the time.<ref>See Nella Buscot, sculpteur, ''Sculptures \u00e0 Montpellier'': http://www.nella-buscot.com/jardins_montpellier_prf_2.php</ref>\n\n==== Resistance units ====\nIn the Second World War, several Resistance groups took his name: the Robespierre Company in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], commanded by Lieutenant Aurin, alias Mar\u00e9chal; the Robespierre Batallion in the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], under Captain Laplace; and a [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]] formed by Marcel Claeys in the [[Ain]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources (selection)==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Andress |first1=David |title=The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France |date=2006 |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux |isbn=978-0374273415 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDfxQDcQzJ0C |language=en |ref=harv}}\n* Aulard, Fran\u00e7ois-Alphonse (1897).

It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty.

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], a former colonel in the National Guard, who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability. On 20 November, opinion turned sharply against Louis following the discovery of a [[Armoire de fer|secret cache of 726 documents]] consisting of Louis's personal communications with bankers and ministers.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|loc= in \"Armoir de Fer\" by Grendron, F.|p=42}} At his trial, he claimed not to recognize documents clearly signed by himself.<ref>Hardman, John (2016) The life of Louis XVI, p. ?</ref>\n\nWith the question of the king's fate now occupying public discourse, Robespierre delivered on 3 December a speech that would define the rhetoric and course of Louis's trial.{{sfn|Thompson|1988|pp=292\u2013300}} All the deputies from the Mountain were asked to attend. Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the [[Dauphin of France]], Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes.

Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony.

He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession.

Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]].

The line was extended to its present terminus of \u014cminato Station by September 25 1921. In 1922 the line was nationalised, and renamed the \u014cminato Line of the [[Japanese Government Railway]] (JGR, later [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]]).\n\nExpress ''Natsudomari'' operations began from [[Aomori Station]] on a seasonal basis in 1968. The express was later downgraded to rapid service and renamed the ''Usori'', and later the [[Shimokita (train)|''Shimokita'']]. All freight operations ceased on February 1 1984. With the dissolution and privatization of the JNR on April 1 1984 the line came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company. On December 4 1999 a new [[centralized traffic control]] (CTC) system became operational. In 2002, seasonal excursion train ''Kirakira Michinoku'' operations commenced and a limited number of ''Shimokita'' trains were extended to terminate at [[Hachinohe Station]] instead of Noheji. The ''Shimokita'' service operates a daily round trip to Aomori and 3 round trips to Hachinohe in conjunction with the [[Aoimori Railway]].<ref name=\"Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jreast-timetable.jp/1802/train/015/016891.html|title=Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)|website=www.jreast.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nThe [[T\u014dhoku Main Line]], including Noheji was transferred from JR East to Aoimori Railway on December 4 2010 following the extension of the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] from Hachinohe to Shin-Aomori.<ref>Tetsudo Hobidas: [http://rail.hobidas.com/news/info/article/109792.html \"JR\u6771\u65e5\u672c \u6771\u5317\u672c\u7dda\u516b\u6238\u2015\u9752\u68ee\u9593\u306e\u5ec3\u6b62\u3092\u5c4a\u51fa \" (November 27, 2009)].

The line was extended to its present terminus of \u014cminato Station by September 25 1921. In 1922 the line was nationalised, and renamed the \u014cminato Line of the [[Japanese Government Railway]] (JGR, later [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]]).\n\nExpress ''Natsudomari'' operations began from [[Aomori Station]] on a seasonal basis in 1968. The express was later downgraded to rapid service and renamed the ''Usori'', and later the [[Shimokita (train)|''Shimokita'']]. All freight operations ceased on February 1 1984. With the dissolution and privatization of the JNR on April 1 1984 the line came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company. On December 4 1999 a new [[centralized traffic control]] (CTC) system became operational. In 2002, seasonal excursion train ''Kirakira Michinoku'' operations commenced and a limited number of ''Shimokita'' trains were extended to terminate at [[Hachinohe Station]] instead of Noheji. The ''Shimokita'' service operates a daily round trip to Aomori and 3 round trips to Hachinohe in conjunction with the [[Aoimori Railway]].<ref name=\"Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jreast-timetable.jp/1802/train/015/016891.html|title=Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)|website=www.jreast.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nThe [[T\u014dhoku Main Line]], including Noheji was transferred from JR East to Aoimori Railway on December 4 2010 following the extension of the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] from Hachinohe to Shin-Aomori.<ref>Tetsudo Hobidas: [http://rail.hobidas.com/news/info/article/109792.html \"JR\u6771\u65e5\u672c \u6771\u5317\u672c\u7dda\u516b\u6238\u2015\u9752\u68ee\u9593\u306e\u5ec3\u6b62\u3092\u5c4a\u51fa \" (November 27, 2009)].
