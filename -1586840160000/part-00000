The route begins at the mouth of [[Parley's Canyon]] at a junction with [[I-80 (UT)|I-80]] east of the city center, and heads south through the edge of the [[Salt Lake City metropolitan area]]'s eastern suburbs of [[Millcreek, Utah|Millcreek]], [[Holladay, Utah|Holladay]], and [[Cottonwood Heights, Utah|Cottonwood Heights]]. It continues west through [[Murray, Utah|Murray]] before turning north again, passing through the city's first-ring western suburbs of [[Taylorsville, Utah|Taylorsville]] and [[West Valley City, Utah|West Valley City]]. It then enters [[North Salt Lake, Utah|North Salt Lake]] and [[Davis County, Utah|Davis County]] for a short distance before reaching [[I-15 (UT)|I-15]] northwest of the city center.\n\nThe interstate was proposed in the mid-1950s, along with I-15 and I-80 through Salt Lake City. At the time, only the western portion of the belt route was assigned as I-215. The eastern portion of the belt route was designated ''Interstate 415''. However, the I-415 designation was scrapped to provide a single route number for the entire route in 1969, with the I-215 designation covering the complete belt route. The freeway was constructed in segments, beginning with a section completed in 1963 from Redwood Road in North Salt Lake to 2100 North near the [[Salt Lake City International Airport|airport]]. Originally planned to be complete in the mid-1970s, challenges from citizens' groups over environmental impact statements led to the completion of the last section of I-215 in 1989 between 6200 South and 4500 South in Holladay.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2015-09-29 11 22 09 View east along Interstate 80 about 127 miles east of the Nevada state line at the junction with Interstate 215 in Salt Lake City, Utah.jpg|thumb|left|The terminus of I-215 at I-80, to the east of Salt Lake City.]]\nI-215 begins at an interchange at the mouth of [[Parley's Canyon]] in [[Millcreek, Utah|Millcreek]] near the southeast corner of [[Salt Lake City]] that connects [[I-80 (UT)|I-80]], Foothill Drive ([[Utah State Route 186|State Route 186]], or SR-186) and Parleys Way. At this point, I-215 splits into three legs, connecting I-80 toward Salt Lake City, Foothill Drive and Parleys Way, and I-80 through Parley's Canyon. From here, the freeway travels southeast along the [[Salt Lake Valley]]'s east bench with three lanes in each direction. The route enters a residential area of [[East Millcreek, Utah|East Millcreek]] and turns south. Then, the first exit appears, an incomplete [[diamond interchange]] with 3300 South ([[SR-171 (UT)|SR-171]]) that lacks an off-ramp from northbound I-215. Past this interchange, an on-ramp connects 3800&nbsp;South to northbound I-215. A block further south is a partial interchange lacking an off-ramp from northbound I-215 onto 3900&nbsp;South. Entering [[Holladay, Utah|Holladay]], I-215 is heading south but soon turns southwest. An off-ramp here allows northbound motorists to connect to Wasatch Boulevard. However, this exit is signed as 3900&nbsp;South and 3300&nbsp;South because of the incomplete interchanges on both roads. Past an interchange at 4500 South ([[SR-266 (UT)|SR-266]]) that serves southbound I-215, the road turns south again and begins descending toward [[Knudsen's Corner, Utah|Knudsen's Corner]] and [[Cottonwood Heights, Utah|Cottonwood Heights]]. At this point, the southbound lanes are lower than the parallel northbound lanes. The belt route flattens out upon reaching an interchange at 6200 South at Knudsen's Corner.<ref name=\"gmaps\">{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=salt+lake+city,+ut&ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ll=40.736332,-111.86554&spn=0.215398,0.703125&z=11 |title=Interstate 215 Overview |accessdate=August 10, 2008 }}</ref>\n[[Image:I-215past21stNorth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|I-215 northbound approaching Legacy Parkway, to the northwest of Salt Lake City.]]\nAs the freeway enters Cottonwood Heights, it turns west and becomes a sunken freeway. Then it reaches an interchange at Highland Drive, signed as 2000 East ([[SR-152 (UT)|SR-152]]). This interchange features a grade-separated ramp from northbound 2000 East to eastbound I-215. Past this junction, another interchange at Union Park Avenue appears. Another grade-separated ramp from Union Park Avenue is present. The freeway enters Murray as an interchange serving westbound motorists connects to 280&nbsp;East and State Street ([[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. Route 89]], or US-89). Eastbound travelers connect to State Street further west at a separate exit. The road turns northwest for a short time to approach a junction at [[I-15 (UT)|I-15]] (often called the South Interchange). Approaching the interchange, the route gains two lanes and reverts to a ground-level freeway. The freeway crosses I-15 and loses one lane as it enters [[Taylorsville, Utah|Taylorsville]] and curves to the northwest, crossing the [[Jordan River (Utah)|Jordan River]] in the process. Right before a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]] at Redwood Road ([[SR-68 (UT)|SR-68]]) the route turns west one final time before turning north after the interchange. The freeway continues north and has another partial cloverleaf interchange at 4700 South (SR-266). The route enters [[West Valley City, Utah|West Valley City]] and encounters 3500 South (SR-171), where its eastbound lanes have a grade-separated ramp to northbound I-215. The road turns northeast and enters an industrial area of western Salt Lake City. After reaching a [[cloverleaf interchange]] at [[SR-201 (UT)|SR-201]], the route turns north again. Beyond a [[single-point urban interchange]] at California Avenue, the freeway continues north.<ref name=\"gmaps\"/>\n\n[[File:2015-11-03 11 13 03 View east from an airplane along the southern portion of Interstate 215 as it crosses the cities of Taylorsville, Murray and Midvale, Utah and interchanges with Interstate 15.jpg|thumb|left|View east along the southern portion of I-215]]\nA partial [[stack interchange]] involving I-80, Redwood Road, and the access road to [[Salt Lake City International Airport]] is next. The freeway loses one lane in each direction as the interstate passes the airport to the east. Two diamond interchanges at 700&nbsp;North and 2100&nbsp;North occur as the freeway approaches [[Davis County, Utah|Davis County]]. Past 2100&nbsp;North, the freeway enters rural [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]], and the road curves to the northwest.

However, the I-415 designation was scrapped to provide a single route number for the entire route in 1969, with the I-215 designation covering the complete belt route. The freeway was constructed in segments, beginning with a section completed in 1963 from Redwood Road in North Salt Lake to 2100 North near the [[Salt Lake City International Airport|airport]]. Originally planned to be complete in the mid-1970s, challenges from citizens' groups over environmental impact statements led to the completion of the last section of I-215 in 1989 between 6200 South and 4500 South in Holladay.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2015-09-29 11 22 09 View east along Interstate 80 about 127 miles east of the Nevada state line at the junction with Interstate 215 in Salt Lake City, Utah.jpg|thumb|left|The terminus of I-215 at I-80, to the east of Salt Lake City.]]\nI-215 begins at an interchange at the mouth of [[Parley's Canyon]] in [[Millcreek, Utah|Millcreek]] near the southeast corner of [[Salt Lake City]] that connects [[I-80 (UT)|I-80]], Foothill Drive ([[Utah State Route 186|State Route 186]], or SR-186) and Parleys Way. At this point, I-215 splits into three legs, connecting I-80 toward Salt Lake City, Foothill Drive and Parleys Way, and I-80 through Parley's Canyon. From here, the freeway travels southeast along the [[Salt Lake Valley]]'s east bench with three lanes in each direction. The route enters a residential area of [[East Millcreek, Utah|East Millcreek]] and turns south. Then, the first exit appears, an incomplete [[diamond interchange]] with 3300 South ([[SR-171 (UT)|SR-171]]) that lacks an off-ramp from northbound I-215. Past this interchange, an on-ramp connects 3800&nbsp;South to northbound I-215. A block further south is a partial interchange lacking an off-ramp from northbound I-215 onto 3900&nbsp;South. Entering [[Holladay, Utah|Holladay]], I-215 is heading south but soon turns southwest. An off-ramp here allows northbound motorists to connect to Wasatch Boulevard. However, this exit is signed as 3900&nbsp;South and 3300&nbsp;South because of the incomplete interchanges on both roads. Past an interchange at 4500 South ([[SR-266 (UT)|SR-266]]) that serves southbound I-215, the road turns south again and begins descending toward [[Knudsen's Corner, Utah|Knudsen's Corner]] and [[Cottonwood Heights, Utah|Cottonwood Heights]]. At this point, the southbound lanes are lower than the parallel northbound lanes. The belt route flattens out upon reaching an interchange at 6200 South at Knudsen's Corner.<ref name=\"gmaps\">{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=salt+lake+city,+ut&ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ll=40.736332,-111.86554&spn=0.215398,0.703125&z=11 |title=Interstate 215 Overview |accessdate=August 10, 2008 }}</ref>\n[[Image:I-215past21stNorth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|I-215 northbound approaching Legacy Parkway, to the northwest of Salt Lake City.]]\nAs the freeway enters Cottonwood Heights, it turns west and becomes a sunken freeway. Then it reaches an interchange at Highland Drive, signed as 2000 East ([[SR-152 (UT)|SR-152]]). This interchange features a grade-separated ramp from northbound 2000 East to eastbound I-215. Past this junction, another interchange at Union Park Avenue appears. Another grade-separated ramp from Union Park Avenue is present. The freeway enters Murray as an interchange serving westbound motorists connects to 280&nbsp;East and State Street ([[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. Route 89]], or US-89). Eastbound travelers connect to State Street further west at a separate exit. The road turns northwest for a short time to approach a junction at [[I-15 (UT)|I-15]] (often called the South Interchange). Approaching the interchange, the route gains two lanes and reverts to a ground-level freeway. The freeway crosses I-15 and loses one lane as it enters [[Taylorsville, Utah|Taylorsville]] and curves to the northwest, crossing the [[Jordan River (Utah)|Jordan River]] in the process. Right before a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]] at Redwood Road ([[SR-68 (UT)|SR-68]]) the route turns west one final time before turning north after the interchange. The freeway continues north and has another partial cloverleaf interchange at 4700 South (SR-266). The route enters [[West Valley City, Utah|West Valley City]] and encounters 3500 South (SR-171), where its eastbound lanes have a grade-separated ramp to northbound I-215. The road turns northeast and enters an industrial area of western Salt Lake City. After reaching a [[cloverleaf interchange]] at [[SR-201 (UT)|SR-201]], the route turns north again. Beyond a [[single-point urban interchange]] at California Avenue, the freeway continues north.<ref name=\"gmaps\"/>\n\n[[File:2015-11-03 11 13 03 View east from an airplane along the southern portion of Interstate 215 as it crosses the cities of Taylorsville, Murray and Midvale, Utah and interchanges with Interstate 15.jpg|thumb|left|View east along the southern portion of I-215]]\nA partial [[stack interchange]] involving I-80, Redwood Road, and the access road to [[Salt Lake City International Airport]] is next.

Two diamond interchanges at 700&nbsp;North and 2100&nbsp;North occur as the freeway approaches [[Davis County, Utah|Davis County]]. Past 2100&nbsp;North, the freeway enters rural [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]], and the road curves to the northwest. An interchange at [[Legacy Parkway]] gives northbound I-215 motorists and southbound Legacy Parkway motorists their respective connections. The road turns east and loses one lane in each direction.

The [[House of Courtenay]] was a significant French family with close association with both the French, and thereby, English royal lines; in England the Courtenays were [[Earls of Devon]].\n\nSecondly, in some cases, bearers of the surname may be of Irish descent, since Courtney is also an Anglicized form of the Gaelic \"O'Curnain\", descendant of Curnan, from an Old Irish personal name of obscure origins.

An early [[coat of arms]] granted to the family depicts a blue fesse between three torteaux on a gold shield. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Reginald de Curtenay, which was dated 1164, in \"Feudal Documents from the Abbey of [[Bury St Edmunds]]\", Suffolk, during the reign of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]].\n\n==People with the surname==\n\n* [[Brendan Courtney]], Irish television presenter\n* [[Charles E.

This curve is unusual (inverted) in that long-term rates are lower than short-term ones.]]\n\nYield curves are usually upward sloping [[asymptotically]]: the longer the maturity, the higher the yield, with diminishing marginal increases (that is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens out). \n\nThere are two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, it may be that the market is anticipating a rise in the [[risk-free rate]]. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the [[arbitrage pricing theory]], investors who are willing to lock their money in now need to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates\u2014thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments. Another explanation is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A [[risk premium]] is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends on the notion that the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect is referred to as the [[liquidity spread]]. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.\n\nThe opposite position (short-term interest rates higher than long-term) can also occur. For instance, in November 2004, the yield curve for [[Gilt-edged securities|UK Government bonds]] was partially ''inverted''. The yield for the 10-year bond stood at 4.68%, but was only 4.45% for the 30-year bond. The market's anticipation of falling interest rates causes such incidents. Negative [[liquidity premium]]s can also exist if long-term investors dominate the market, but the prevailing view is that a positive liquidity premium dominates, so only the anticipation of falling interest rates will cause an inverted yield curve. Strongly inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic recessions.\n\nThe shape of the yield curve is influenced by [[supply and demand]]: for instance, if there is a large demand for long bonds, for instance from [[pension fund]]s to match their fixed liabilities to pensioners, and not enough bonds in existence to meet this demand, then the yields on long bonds can be expected to be low, irrespective of market participants' views about future events.\n\nThe yield curve may also be flat or hump-shaped, due to anticipated interest rates being steady, or short-term volatility outweighing long-term volatility.\n\nYield curves continually move all the time that the markets are open, reflecting the market's reaction to news. A further \"[[stylized fact]]\" is that yield curves tend to move in parallel (i.e., the yield curve shifts up and down as interest rate levels rise and fall: a \"parallel shift\").\n\n===Types of yield curve===\nThere is no single yield curve describing the cost of money for everybody. The most important factor in determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their [[creditworthiness]]. \n\nThe yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government bond yield curve (government curve). Banks with high [[Bond credit rating|credit ratings]] (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the [[LIBOR]] rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the [[LIBOR]] curve or the [[swap (finance)|swap]] curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.\n\nBesides the government curve and the LIBOR curve, there are [[corporation|corporate]] (company) curves. These are constructed from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Since corporations have less [[creditworthiness]] than most governments and most large banks, these yields are typically higher. Corporate yield curves are often quoted in terms of a \"credit spread\" over the relevant swap curve. For instance the five-year yield curve point for [[Vodafone]] might be quoted as LIBOR +0.25%, where 0.25% (often written as 25 [[basis point]]s or 25{{Not a typo|bps}}) is the credit spread.\n\n====Normal yield curve====\n[[File:U.S. Treasury Yield Curves - v1.png|thumb|400px|right|U.S. Treasury yield curves for different dates. The July 2000 yield curve (red line, top) is inverted.]]\nFrom the post-[[Great Depression]] era to the present, the yield curve has usually been \"normal\" meaning that yields rise as maturity lengthens (i.e., the slope of the yield curve is positive). This positive slope reflects investor expectations for the economy to grow in the future and, importantly, for this growth to be associated with a greater expectation that inflation will rise in the future rather than fall. This expectation of higher inflation leads to expectations that the [[central bank]] will tighten monetary policy by raising short-term interest rates in the future to slow economic growth and dampen inflationary pressure. It also creates a need for a risk premium associated with the uncertainty about the future rate of inflation and the risk this poses to the future value of cash flows. Investors price these risks into the yield curve by demanding higher yields for maturities further into the future. In a positively sloped yield curve, lenders profit from the passage of time since yields decrease as bonds get closer to maturity (as yield decreases, price ''increases''); this is known as '''rolldown''' and is a significant component of profit in fixed-income investing (i.e., buying and selling, not necessarily holding to maturity), particularly if the investing is [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/04868cd6-d7b2-11e0-a06b-00144feabdc0.html 'Helicopter Ben' risks destroying credit creation], September 6, 2011, [[Financial Times]], by [[Bill H. Gross|Bill Gross]]</ref>\n\nHowever, a positively sloped yield curve has not always been the norm. Through much of the 19th century and early 20th century the US economy experienced trend growth with persistent [[deflation]], not inflation. During this period the yield curve was typically inverted, reflecting the fact that deflation made current cash flows less valuable than future cash flows. During this period of persistent deflation, a 'normal' yield curve was negatively sloped.\n\n====Steep yield curve====\nHistorically, the 20-year [[Treasury bond]] yield has averaged approximately two percentage points above that of three-month Treasury bills. In situations when this gap increases (e.g. 20-year Treasury yield rises much higher than the three-month Treasury yield), the economy is expected to improve quickly in the future. This type of curve can be seen at the beginning of an economic expansion (or after the end of a recession). Here, economic stagnation will have depressed short-term interest rates; however, rates begin to rise once the demand for capital is re-established by growing economic activity.\n\nIn January 2010, the gap between yields on two-year Treasury notes and 10-year notes widened to 2.92 percentage points, its highest ever.\n\n====Flat or humped yield curve====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:flat-yield-curve.gif|thumb|100px|Flat Yield Curve]] -->\nA flat yield curve is observed when all maturities have similar yields, whereas a humped curve results when short-term and long-term yields are equal and medium-term yields are higher than those of the short-term and long-term. A flat curve sends signals of uncertainty in the economy. This mixed signal can revert to a normal curve or could later result into an inverted curve. It cannot be explained by the Segmented Market theory discussed below.\n\n====Inverted yield curve====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:inverted-yield-curve.gif|thumb|100px|Inverted Yield Curve]] -->\n\n[[File:10-year minus 3-month US Treasury Yields.png|thumb|right|400px|Yield curve becomes inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates]]\nAn inverted yield curve occurs when long-term yields fall below short-term yields.\n\nUnder unusual circumstances, investors will settle for lower yields associated with low-risk long term debt if they think the economy will enter a recession in the near future. For example, the [[S&P 500 Index|S&P 500]] experienced a dramatic fall in mid 2007, from which it recovered completely by early 2013. Investors who had purchased 10-year Treasuries in 2006 would have received a safe and steady yield until 2015, possibly achieving better returns than those investing in equities during that volatile period.\n\nEconomist [[Campbell Harvey]]'s 1986 dissertation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Thesis/Thesis.htm|title=Campbell R. Harvey's Dissertation|website=faculty.fuqua.duke.edu}}</ref> showed that an inverted yield curve accurately forecasts U.S. recessions. An inverted curve has indicated a worsening economic situation in the future 7 times since 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Term_structure/|title=Index of /~charvey/Term_structure|website=faculty.fuqua.duke.edu}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to potentially signaling an economic decline, inverted yield curves also imply that the market believes inflation will remain low. This is because, even if there is a recession, a low bond yield will still be offset by low inflation. However, technical factors, such as a [[flight to quality]] or global economic or currency situations, may cause an increase in demand for bonds on the long end of the yield curve, causing long-term rates to fall. Falling long-term rates in the presence of rising short-term rates is known as \"Greenspan's Conundrum\".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Daniel L.

A positively sloped yield curve is often a harbinger of [[inflation]]ary growth. Work by Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian has established the predictive power of an inverted yield curve to signal a recession. Their models show that when the difference between short-term interest rates (they use 3-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (10-year Treasury bonds) at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive, a rise in unemployment usually occurs.<ref>Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian, ''[http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr397.pdf FRB of New York Staff Report No. 397]'', 2009</ref> The [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York Fed]] publishes a [http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/capital_markets/ycfaq.html monthly recession probability prediction] derived from the yield curve and based on Estrella's work.\n\nAll the recessions in the US since 1970 (up through 2018) have been preceded by an inverted yield curve (10-year vs 3-month).

Therefore, the table shows the 2019 inversion beginning from May-2019. Likewise, daily inversions in Sep-1998 did not result in negative term spreads on a month average basis and thus do not constitute a false alarm.\n\nEstrella and others have postulated that the yield curve affects the [[business cycle]] via the balance sheet of banks (or [[Shadow banking system|bank-like financial institutions]]).<ref>Arturo Estrella, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1532309 FRB of New York Staff Report No. 421]'', 2010</ref> When the yield curve is inverted, banks are often caught paying more on short-term deposits (or [[Repurchase agreement|other forms]] of short-term wholesale funding) than they are making on new long-term loans leading to a loss of profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a [[credit crunch]]. When the yield curve is upward sloping, banks can profitably take-in short term deposits and make new long-term loans so they are eager to supply credit to borrowers. This eventually leads to a [[Economic bubble|credit bubble]].\n\n{{see also|Net interest margin}}\n\n==Theory==\n\nThere are three main economic theories attempting to explain how yields vary with maturity. Two of the theories are extreme positions, while the third attempts to find a middle ground between the former two.\n\n===Market expectations (pure expectations) hypothesis===\n{{main|Expectations hypothesis}}\n\nThis [[hypothesis]] assumes that the various maturities are [[Substitute good|perfect substitutes]] and suggests that the shape of the yield curve depends on market participants' expectations of future interest rates. It assumes that market forces will cause the interest rates on various terms of bonds to be such that the expected final value of a sequence of short-term investments will equal the known final value of a single long-term investment. If this did not hold, the theory assumes that investors would quickly demand more of the current short-term or long-term bonds (whichever gives the higher expected long-term yield), and this would drive down the return on current bonds of that term and drive up the yield on current bonds of the other term, so as to quickly make the assumed equality of expected returns of the two investment approaches hold.\n\nUsing this, [[futures contract|futures rates]], along with the assumption that [[arbitrage]] opportunities will be minimal in future markets, and that futures rates are unbiased estimates of forthcoming spot rates, provide enough information to construct a complete expected yield curve. For example, if investors have an expectation of what 1-year interest rates will be next year, the current 2-year interest rate can be calculated as the compounding of this year's 1-year interest rate by next year's expected 1-year interest rate. More generally, returns (1+ yield) on a long-term instrument are assumed to equal the [[geometric mean]] of the expected returns on a series of short-term instruments:\n\n: <math>(1 + i_{lt})^n=(1 + i_{st}^{\\text{year }1})(1 + i_{st}^{\\text{year }2}) \\cdots (1 + i_{st}^{\\text{year }n}),</math>\n\nwhere ''i''<sub>''st''</sub> and ''i''<sub>''lt''</sub> are the expected short-term and actual long-term interest rates (but <math>i_{st}^{\\text{year}1}</math> is the actual observed short-term rate for the first year).\n\nThis theory is consistent with the observation that yields usually move together. However, it fails to explain the persistence in the shape of the yield curve.\n\nShortcomings of expectations theory include that it neglects the [[interest rate risk]] inherent in investing in bonds.\n\n===Liquidity premium theory===\n\nThe liquidity premium theory is an offshoot of the pure expectations theory. The liquidity premium theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors' assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher not just because of the liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term. The market expectations hypothesis is combined with the liquidity premium theory:\n\n: <math>(1 + i_{lt})^n=rp_{n}+((1 + i_{st}^{\\mathrm{year }1})(1 + i_{st}^{\\mathrm{year }2}) \\cdots (1 + i_{st}^{\\mathrm{year }n})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>rp_n</math> is the risk premium associated with an <math>{n}</math> year bond.\n\n===Preferred habitat theory===\n\nThe preferred habitat theory is a variant of the liquidity premium theory, and states that in addition to interest rate expectations, investors have distinct investment horizons and require a meaningful premium to buy bonds with maturities outside their \"preferred\" maturity, or habitat. Proponents of this theory believe that short-term investors are more prevalent in the fixed-income market, and therefore longer-term rates tend to be higher than short-term rates, for the most part, but short-term rates can be higher than long-term rates occasionally. This theory is consistent with both the persistence of the normal yield curve shape and the tendency of the yield curve to shift up and down while retaining its shape.\n\n===Market segmentation theory===\nThis theory is also called the '''segmented market hypothesis'''. In this theory, financial instruments of different terms are not [[substitute good|substitutable]]. As a result, the [[supply and demand]] in the markets for short-term and long-term instruments is determined largely independently. Prospective investors decide in advance whether they need short-term or long-term instruments. If investors prefer their portfolio to be liquid, they will prefer short-term instruments to long-term instruments. Therefore, the market for short-term instruments will receive a higher demand. Higher demand for the instrument implies higher prices and lower yield. This explains the [[stylized fact]] that short-term yields are usually lower than long-term yields. This theory explains the predominance of the normal yield curve shape. However, because the supply and demand of the two markets are independent, this theory fails to explain the observed fact that yields tend to move together (i.e., upward and downward shifts in the curve).\n\n===Historical development of yield curve theory===\n\nOn 15 August 1971, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] announced that the U.S. dollar would no longer be based on the [[gold standard]], thereby ending the [[Bretton Woods system]] and initiating the era of [[floating exchange rate]]s.\n\nFloating exchange rates made life more complicated for bond traders, including those at [[Salomon Brothers]] in [[New York City]]. By the middle of the 1970s, encouraged by the head of bond research at Salomon, Marty Liebowitz, traders began thinking about bond yields in new ways. Rather than think of each maturity (a ten-year bond, a five-year, etc.) as a separate marketplace, they began drawing a curve through all their yields. The bit nearest the present time became known as the ''short end''\u2014yields of bonds further out became, naturally, the ''long end''.\n\nAcademics had to play catch up with practitioners in this matter. One important theoretic development came from a Czech mathematician, [[Oldrich Vasicek]], who argued in a 1977 paper that bond prices all along the curve are driven by the short end (under risk neutral equivalent martingale measure) and accordingly by short-term interest rates. The mathematical model for Vasicek's work was given by an [[Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process]], but has since been discredited because the model predicts a positive probability that the short rate becomes negative and is inflexible in creating yield curves of different shapes. Vasicek's model has been superseded by many different models including the [[Hull\u2013White model]] (which allows for time varying parameters in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process), the [[Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross model]], which is a modified [[Bessel process]], and the [[Heath\u2013Jarrow\u2013Morton framework]]. There are also many modifications to each of these models, but see the article on [[short rate model]].\nAnother modern approach is the [[LIBOR market model]], introduced by Brace, Gatarek and Musiela in 1997 and advanced by others later.\nIn 1996 a group of derivatives traders led by Olivier Doria (then head of swaps at Deutsche Bank) and Michele Faissola, contributed to an extension of the swap yield curves in all the major European currencies. Until then the market would give prices until 15 years maturities. The team extended the maturity of European yield curves up to 50 years (for the lira, French franc, Deutsche mark, Danish krone and many other currencies including the ecu). This innovation was a major contribution towards the issuance of long dated [[zero-coupon bond]]s and the creation of long dated mortgages.\n\n==Construction of the full yield curve from market data==\n:''See also: [[Bootstrapping (finance)]]; [[Fixed-income attribution#Modeling the yield curve]]; [[Multi-curve framework]].''\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0em 1em 0em 1em;\"\n|+ '''Typical inputs to the money market curve'''\n|-\n|'''Type'''\n|'''Settlement date'''\n|'''Rate (%)'''\n|-\n|Cash\n|Overnight rate\n|5.58675\n|-\n|Cash\n|Tomorrow next rate\n|5.59375\n|-\n|Cash\n|1m\n|5.625\n|-\n|Cash\n|3m\n|5.71875\n|-\n|Future\n|Dec-97\n|5.76\n|-\n|Future\n|Mar-98\n|5.77\n|-\n|Future\n|Jun-98\n|5.82\n|-\n|Future\n|Sep-98\n|5.88\n|-\n|Future\n|Dec-98\n|6.00\n|-\n|Swap\n|2y\n|6.01253\n|-\n|Swap\n|3y\n|6.10823\n|-\n|Swap\n|4y\n|6.16\n|-\n|Swap\n|5y\n|6.22\n|-\n|Swap\n|7y\n|6.32\n|-\n|Swap\n|10y\n|6.42\n|-\n|Swap\n|15y\n|6.56\n|-\n|Swap\n|20y\n|6.56\n|-\n|Swap\n|30y\n|6.56\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|\nA list of standard instruments used to build a money market yield curve.\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|\nThe data is for lending in [[US dollar]], taken from October 6, 1997\n|}\n\nThe usual representation of the yield curve is in terms of a function P, defined on all future times ''t'', such that P(''t'') represents the value today of receiving one unit of currency ''t'' years in the future. If P is defined for all future ''t'' then we can easily recover the yield (i.e. the annualized interest rate) for borrowing money for that period of time via the formula\n\n:<math>Y(t) = P(t)^{-1/t} -1. </math>\n\nThe significant difficulty in defining a yield curve therefore is to determine the function P(''t''). P is called the discount factor function or the zero coupon bond.\n\nYield curves are built from either prices available in the ''bond market'' or the ''money market''. Whilst the yield curves built from the bond market use prices only from a specific class of bonds (for instance bonds issued by the UK government) yield curves built from the [[money market]] use prices of \"cash\" from today's LIBOR rates, which determine the \"short end\" of the curve i.e. for ''t''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;3m, [[interest rate future]]s which determine the midsection of the curve (3m&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;15m) and [[interest rate swap]]s which determine the \"long end\" (1y&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;60y).\n\nThe example given in the table at the right is known as a [[LIBOR]] curve because it is constructed using either LIBOR rates or [[swap rates]]. A LIBOR curve is the most widely used interest rate curve as it represents the credit worth of private entities at about A+ rating, roughly the equivalent of commercial banks. If one substitutes the LIBOR and swap rates with government bond yields, one arrives at what is known as a government curve, usually considered the risk free interest rate curve for the underlying currency. The spread between the LIBOR or swap rate and the government bond yield, usually positive, meaning private borrowing is at a premium above government borrowing, of similar maturity is a measure of risk tolerance of the lenders. For the U. S. market, a common benchmark for such a spread is given by the so-called [[TED spread]].\n\nIn either case the available market data provides a matrix ''A'' of cash flows, each row representing a particular financial instrument and each column representing a point in time. The (''i'',''j'')-th element of the matrix represents the amount that instrument ''i'' will pay out on day ''j''. Let the vector ''F'' represent today's prices of the instrument (so that the ''i''-th instrument has value ''F''(''i'')), then by definition of our discount factor function ''P'' we should have that ''F'' = ''AP'' (this is a matrix multiplication). Actually, noise in the financial markets means it is not possible to find a ''P'' that solves this equation exactly, and our goal becomes to find a vector ''P'' such that\n\n: <math> AP = F + \\varepsilon \\, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon</math> is as small a vector as possible (where the size of a vector might be measured by taking its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], for example).\n\nEven if we can solve this equation, we will only have determined ''P''(''t'') for those ''t'' which have a cash flow from one or more of the original instruments we are creating the curve from. Values for other ''t'' are typically determined using some sort of [[interpolation]] scheme.\n\nPractitioners and researchers have suggested many ways of solving the A*P = F equation. It transpires that the most natural method \u2013 that of minimizing <math>\\epsilon</math> by [[least squares regression]] \u2013 leads to unsatisfactory results. The large number of zeroes in the matrix ''A'' mean that function ''P'' turns out to be \"bumpy\".\n\nIn their comprehensive book on interest rate modelling James and Webber note that the following techniques have been suggested to solve the problem of finding P:\n\n#Approximation using [[Lagrange polynomials]]\n#Fitting using parameterised curves (such as [[Spline (mathematics)|splines]], the [[Nelson-Siegel]] family, the [[Fixed income attribution#Modeling the yield curve|Svensson family]], the exponential polynomial<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323689711|title=The exponential polynomial family|last=Moulin|first=Serge|date=2018|website=Research gate.net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> family or the Cairns restricted-exponential family of curves). Van Deventer, Imai and Mesler summarize three different techniques for [[curve fitting]] that satisfy the maximum smoothness of either forward interest rates, zero coupon bond prices, or zero coupon bond yields\n#Local regression using [[Kernel (statistics)|kernels]]\n#[[Linear programming]]\n\nIn the money market practitioners might use different techniques to solve for different areas of the curve. For example, at the short end of the curve, where there are few cashflows, the first few elements of P may be found by [[bootstrapping (finance)|bootstrapping]] from one to the next. At the long end, a regression technique with a cost function that values smoothness might be used.\n\n===Post-financial crisis of 2007-2008===\nAfter the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], swap valuation is typically under a \"multi-curve\" framework; the above, by contrast, describes the \"self discounting\" approach. \nThe reason for the change is that post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]] \u2014 i.e. from the [[overnight index swap]] curve \u2014 is considered a better proxy than [[Libor]] for the \"risk-free rate\", and \"OIS-discounting\" is now standard (sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]]-discounting\").\nThus, when valuing a swap:\n(i) although the forecasted cashflows are derived from the Libor-curve as before, \n(ii) these cashflows are discounted at the (OIS-curve-compounded) overnight rate as opposed to at Libor.\nThe result is that, in practice, curves are built as a \"set\" and not individually, where, correspondingly:\n(i) \"forecast curves\" are constructed for ''each'' floating-leg [[Libor#Maturities|Libor tenor]]; \nand (ii) discounting is on a single, common OIS curve which must simultaneously be constructed. \nSee {{sectionlink|Interest rate swap|Valuation and pricing}} for the math, and for context, {{sectionlink|Financial economics|Derivative pricing}}.\n\n==Effect on bond prices==\n:''See: [[Bond valuation]].''\nThere is a time dimension to the analysis of bond values. A 10-year bond at purchase becomes a 9-year bond a year later, and the year after it becomes an 8-year bond, etc. Each year the bond moves incrementally closer to maturity, resulting in lower volatility and shorter duration and demanding a lower interest rate when the yield curve is rising. Since falling rates create increasing prices, the value of a bond initially will rise as the lower rates of the shorter maturity become its new market rate. Because a bond is always anchored by its final maturity, the price at some point must change direction and fall to par value at redemption.\n\nA bond's market value at different times in its life can be calculated. When the yield curve is steep, the bond is predicted to have a large [[capital gain]] in the first years before falling in price later. When the yield curve is flat, the capital gain is predicted to be much less, and there is little variability in the bond's total returns over time.\n\nRising (or falling) interest rates rarely rise by the same amount all along the yield curve\u2014the curve rarely moves up in parallel. Because longer-term bonds have a larger duration, a rise in rates will cause a larger capital loss for them, than for short-term bonds. But almost always, the long maturity's rate will change much less, flattening the yield curve. The greater change in rates at the short end will offset to some extent the advantage provided by the shorter bond's lower duration.\n\nLong duration bonds tend to be mean reverting, meaning that they readily gravitate to a long-run average. The middle of the curve (5\u201310 years) will see the greatest percentage gain in yields if there is anticipated inflation even if interest rates have not changed. The long-end does not move quite as much percentage-wise because of the mean reverting properties.\n\nThe yearly 'total return' from the bond is a) the sum of the coupon's yield plus b) the capital gain from the changing valuation as it slides down the yield curve and c) any capital gain or loss from changing interest rates at that point in the yield curve.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retailinvestor.org/bondPrice.html|title=Retail Investor .org : Bond Valuation Over Its Life|website=www.retailinvestor.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Short-rate model]]\n*[[Zero interest rate policy]]\n*[[Multi-curve framework]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book | title = Pricing and Trading Interest Rate Derivatives | author = J H M Darbyshire | year = 2017 | edition = 2nd ed. 2017 | url = http://www.tradinginterestrates.com | isbn = 978-0995455528 | publisher = Aitch and Dee Ltd.}}\n*{{cite book | title = Interest Rate Modeling|author1=Leif B.G.

The curve shows the relation between the (level of the) [[interest rate]] (or cost of borrowing) and the time to [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]], known as the \"term\", of the debt for a given borrower in a given [[currency]].<ref>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yield-curve-101-ultimate-guide-110026560.html Yield Curve 101: The Ultimate Guide for ETF Investors \u2013 Yahoo Finance] [[Yahoo Finance]]</ref>\n\nThe [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] interest rates paid on [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]] for various maturities are closely watched by many traders, and are commonly plotted on a graph such as the one on the right, which is informally called \"the yield curve\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Matt |title=What's the Yield Curve?

This curve is unusual (inverted) in that long-term rates are lower than short-term ones.]]\n\nYield curves are usually upward sloping [[asymptotically]]: the longer the maturity, the higher the yield, with diminishing marginal increases (that is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens out). \n\nThere are two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, it may be that the market is anticipating a rise in the [[risk-free rate]]. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the [[arbitrage pricing theory]], investors who are willing to lock their money in now need to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates\u2014thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments. Another explanation is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A [[risk premium]] is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends on the notion that the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect is referred to as the [[liquidity spread]]. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.\n\nThe opposite position (short-term interest rates higher than long-term) can also occur. For instance, in November 2004, the yield curve for [[Gilt-edged securities|UK Government bonds]] was partially ''inverted''. The yield for the 10-year bond stood at 4.68%, but was only 4.45% for the 30-year bond. The market's anticipation of falling interest rates causes such incidents. Negative [[liquidity premium]]s can also exist if long-term investors dominate the market, but the prevailing view is that a positive liquidity premium dominates, so only the anticipation of falling interest rates will cause an inverted yield curve. Strongly inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic recessions.\n\nThe shape of the yield curve is influenced by [[supply and demand]]: for instance, if there is a large demand for long bonds, for instance from [[pension fund]]s to match their fixed liabilities to pensioners, and not enough bonds in existence to meet this demand, then the yields on long bonds can be expected to be low, irrespective of market participants' views about future events.\n\nThe yield curve may also be flat or hump-shaped, due to anticipated interest rates being steady, or short-term volatility outweighing long-term volatility.\n\nYield curves continually move all the time that the markets are open, reflecting the market's reaction to news. A further \"[[stylized fact]]\" is that yield curves tend to move in parallel (i.e., the yield curve shifts up and down as interest rate levels rise and fall: a \"parallel shift\").\n\n===Types of yield curve===\nThere is no single yield curve describing the cost of money for everybody. The most important factor in determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their [[creditworthiness]]. \n\nThe yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government bond yield curve (government curve). Banks with high [[Bond credit rating|credit ratings]] (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the [[LIBOR]] rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the [[LIBOR]] curve or the [[swap (finance)|swap]] curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.\n\nBesides the government curve and the LIBOR curve, there are [[corporation|corporate]] (company) curves. These are constructed from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Since corporations have less [[creditworthiness]] than most governments and most large banks, these yields are typically higher. Corporate yield curves are often quoted in terms of a \"credit spread\" over the relevant swap curve. For instance the five-year yield curve point for [[Vodafone]] might be quoted as LIBOR +0.25%, where 0.25% (often written as 25 [[basis point]]s or 25{{Not a typo|bps}}) is the credit spread.\n\n====Normal yield curve====\n[[File:U.S. Treasury Yield Curves - v1.png|thumb|400px|right|U.S. Treasury yield curves for different dates. The July 2000 yield curve (red line, top) is inverted.]]\nFrom the post-[[Great Depression]] era to the present, the yield curve has usually been \"normal\" meaning that yields rise as maturity lengthens (i.e., the slope of the yield curve is positive). This positive slope reflects investor expectations for the economy to grow in the future and, importantly, for this growth to be associated with a greater expectation that inflation will rise in the future rather than fall. This expectation of higher inflation leads to expectations that the [[central bank]] will tighten monetary policy by raising short-term interest rates in the future to slow economic growth and dampen inflationary pressure. It also creates a need for a risk premium associated with the uncertainty about the future rate of inflation and the risk this poses to the future value of cash flows. Investors price these risks into the yield curve by demanding higher yields for maturities further into the future. In a positively sloped yield curve, lenders profit from the passage of time since yields decrease as bonds get closer to maturity (as yield decreases, price ''increases''); this is known as '''rolldown''' and is a significant component of profit in fixed-income investing (i.e., buying and selling, not necessarily holding to maturity), particularly if the investing is [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/04868cd6-d7b2-11e0-a06b-00144feabdc0.html 'Helicopter Ben' risks destroying credit creation], September 6, 2011, [[Financial Times]], by [[Bill H. Gross|Bill Gross]]</ref>\n\nHowever, a positively sloped yield curve has not always been the norm. Through much of the 19th century and early 20th century the US economy experienced trend growth with persistent [[deflation]], not inflation. During this period the yield curve was typically inverted, reflecting the fact that deflation made current cash flows less valuable than future cash flows. During this period of persistent deflation, a 'normal' yield curve was negatively sloped.\n\n====Steep yield curve====\nHistorically, the 20-year [[Treasury bond]] yield has averaged approximately two percentage points above that of three-month Treasury bills. In situations when this gap increases (e.g. 20-year Treasury yield rises much higher than the three-month Treasury yield), the economy is expected to improve quickly in the future. This type of curve can be seen at the beginning of an economic expansion (or after the end of a recession). Here, economic stagnation will have depressed short-term interest rates; however, rates begin to rise once the demand for capital is re-established by growing economic activity.\n\nIn January 2010, the gap between yields on two-year Treasury notes and 10-year notes widened to 2.92 percentage points, its highest ever.\n\n====Flat or humped yield curve====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:flat-yield-curve.gif|thumb|100px|Flat Yield Curve]] -->\nA flat yield curve is observed when all maturities have similar yields, whereas a humped curve results when short-term and long-term yields are equal and medium-term yields are higher than those of the short-term and long-term. A flat curve sends signals of uncertainty in the economy. This mixed signal can revert to a normal curve or could later result into an inverted curve. It cannot be explained by the Segmented Market theory discussed below.\n\n====Inverted yield curve====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:inverted-yield-curve.gif|thumb|100px|Inverted Yield Curve]] -->\n\n[[File:10-year minus 3-month US Treasury Yields.png|thumb|right|400px|Yield curve becomes inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates]]\nAn inverted yield curve occurs when long-term yields fall below short-term yields.\n\nUnder unusual circumstances, investors will settle for lower yields associated with low-risk long term debt if they think the economy will enter a recession in the near future. For example, the [[S&P 500 Index|S&P 500]] experienced a dramatic fall in mid 2007, from which it recovered completely by early 2013. Investors who had purchased 10-year Treasuries in 2006 would have received a safe and steady yield until 2015, possibly achieving better returns than those investing in equities during that volatile period.\n\nEconomist [[Campbell Harvey]]'s 1986 dissertation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Thesis/Thesis.htm|title=Campbell R. Harvey's Dissertation|website=faculty.fuqua.duke.edu}}</ref> showed that an inverted yield curve accurately forecasts U.S. recessions. An inverted curve has indicated a worsening economic situation in the future 7 times since 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Term_structure/|title=Index of /~charvey/Term_structure|website=faculty.fuqua.duke.edu}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to potentially signaling an economic decline, inverted yield curves also imply that the market believes inflation will remain low. This is because, even if there is a recession, a low bond yield will still be offset by low inflation. However, technical factors, such as a [[flight to quality]] or global economic or currency situations, may cause an increase in demand for bonds on the long end of the yield curve, causing long-term rates to fall. Falling long-term rates in the presence of rising short-term rates is known as \"Greenspan's Conundrum\".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Daniel L.

Their models show that when the difference between short-term interest rates (they use 3-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (10-year Treasury bonds) at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive, a rise in unemployment usually occurs.<ref>Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian, ''[http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr397.pdf FRB of New York Staff Report No. 397]'', 2009</ref> The [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York Fed]] publishes a [http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/capital_markets/ycfaq.html monthly recession probability prediction] derived from the yield curve and based on Estrella's work.\n\nAll the recessions in the US since 1970 (up through 2018) have been preceded by an inverted yield curve (10-year vs 3-month).

Therefore, the table shows the 2019 inversion beginning from May-2019. Likewise, daily inversions in Sep-1998 did not result in negative term spreads on a month average basis and thus do not constitute a false alarm.\n\nEstrella and others have postulated that the yield curve affects the [[business cycle]] via the balance sheet of banks (or [[Shadow banking system|bank-like financial institutions]]).<ref>Arturo Estrella, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1532309 FRB of New York Staff Report No. 421]'', 2010</ref> When the yield curve is inverted, banks are often caught paying more on short-term deposits (or [[Repurchase agreement|other forms]] of short-term wholesale funding) than they are making on new long-term loans leading to a loss of profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a [[credit crunch]]. When the yield curve is upward sloping, banks can profitably take-in short term deposits and make new long-term loans so they are eager to supply credit to borrowers. This eventually leads to a [[Economic bubble|credit bubble]].\n\n{{see also|Net interest margin}}\n\n==Theory==\n\nThere are three main economic theories attempting to explain how yields vary with maturity. Two of the theories are extreme positions, while the third attempts to find a middle ground between the former two.\n\n===Market expectations (pure expectations) hypothesis===\n{{main|Expectations hypothesis}}\n\nThis [[hypothesis]] assumes that the various maturities are [[Substitute good|perfect substitutes]] and suggests that the shape of the yield curve depends on market participants' expectations of future interest rates. It assumes that market forces will cause the interest rates on various terms of bonds to be such that the expected final value of a sequence of short-term investments will equal the known final value of a single long-term investment. If this did not hold, the theory assumes that investors would quickly demand more of the current short-term or long-term bonds (whichever gives the higher expected long-term yield), and this would drive down the return on current bonds of that term and drive up the yield on current bonds of the other term, so as to quickly make the assumed equality of expected returns of the two investment approaches hold.\n\nUsing this, [[futures contract|futures rates]], along with the assumption that [[arbitrage]] opportunities will be minimal in future markets, and that futures rates are unbiased estimates of forthcoming spot rates, provide enough information to construct a complete expected yield curve. For example, if investors have an expectation of what 1-year interest rates will be next year, the current 2-year interest rate can be calculated as the compounding of this year's 1-year interest rate by next year's expected 1-year interest rate. More generally, returns (1+ yield) on a long-term instrument are assumed to equal the [[geometric mean]] of the expected returns on a series of short-term instruments:\n\n: <math>(1 + i_{lt})^n=(1 + i_{st}^{\\text{year }1})(1 + i_{st}^{\\text{year }2}) \\cdots (1 + i_{st}^{\\text{year }n}),</math>\n\nwhere ''i''<sub>''st''</sub> and ''i''<sub>''lt''</sub> are the expected short-term and actual long-term interest rates (but <math>i_{st}^{\\text{year}1}</math> is the actual observed short-term rate for the first year).\n\nThis theory is consistent with the observation that yields usually move together. However, it fails to explain the persistence in the shape of the yield curve.\n\nShortcomings of expectations theory include that it neglects the [[interest rate risk]] inherent in investing in bonds.\n\n===Liquidity premium theory===\n\nThe liquidity premium theory is an offshoot of the pure expectations theory. The liquidity premium theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors' assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher not just because of the liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term. The market expectations hypothesis is combined with the liquidity premium theory:\n\n: <math>(1 + i_{lt})^n=rp_{n}+((1 + i_{st}^{\\mathrm{year }1})(1 + i_{st}^{\\mathrm{year }2}) \\cdots (1 + i_{st}^{\\mathrm{year }n})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>rp_n</math> is the risk premium associated with an <math>{n}</math> year bond.\n\n===Preferred habitat theory===\n\nThe preferred habitat theory is a variant of the liquidity premium theory, and states that in addition to interest rate expectations, investors have distinct investment horizons and require a meaningful premium to buy bonds with maturities outside their \"preferred\" maturity, or habitat. Proponents of this theory believe that short-term investors are more prevalent in the fixed-income market, and therefore longer-term rates tend to be higher than short-term rates, for the most part, but short-term rates can be higher than long-term rates occasionally. This theory is consistent with both the persistence of the normal yield curve shape and the tendency of the yield curve to shift up and down while retaining its shape.\n\n===Market segmentation theory===\nThis theory is also called the '''segmented market hypothesis'''. In this theory, financial instruments of different terms are not [[substitute good|substitutable]]. As a result, the [[supply and demand]] in the markets for short-term and long-term instruments is determined largely independently. Prospective investors decide in advance whether they need short-term or long-term instruments. If investors prefer their portfolio to be liquid, they will prefer short-term instruments to long-term instruments. Therefore, the market for short-term instruments will receive a higher demand. Higher demand for the instrument implies higher prices and lower yield. This explains the [[stylized fact]] that short-term yields are usually lower than long-term yields. This theory explains the predominance of the normal yield curve shape. However, because the supply and demand of the two markets are independent, this theory fails to explain the observed fact that yields tend to move together (i.e., upward and downward shifts in the curve).\n\n===Historical development of yield curve theory===\n\nOn 15 August 1971, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] announced that the U.S. dollar would no longer be based on the [[gold standard]], thereby ending the [[Bretton Woods system]] and initiating the era of [[floating exchange rate]]s.\n\nFloating exchange rates made life more complicated for bond traders, including those at [[Salomon Brothers]] in [[New York City]]. By the middle of the 1970s, encouraged by the head of bond research at Salomon, Marty Liebowitz, traders began thinking about bond yields in new ways. Rather than think of each maturity (a ten-year bond, a five-year, etc.) as a separate marketplace, they began drawing a curve through all their yields. The bit nearest the present time became known as the ''short end''\u2014yields of bonds further out became, naturally, the ''long end''.\n\nAcademics had to play catch up with practitioners in this matter. One important theoretic development came from a Czech mathematician, [[Oldrich Vasicek]], who argued in a 1977 paper that bond prices all along the curve are driven by the short end (under risk neutral equivalent martingale measure) and accordingly by short-term interest rates. The mathematical model for Vasicek's work was given by an [[Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process]], but has since been discredited because the model predicts a positive probability that the short rate becomes negative and is inflexible in creating yield curves of different shapes. Vasicek's model has been superseded by many different models including the [[Hull\u2013White model]] (which allows for time varying parameters in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process), the [[Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross model]], which is a modified [[Bessel process]], and the [[Heath\u2013Jarrow\u2013Morton framework]]. There are also many modifications to each of these models, but see the article on [[short rate model]].\nAnother modern approach is the [[LIBOR market model]], introduced by Brace, Gatarek and Musiela in 1997 and advanced by others later.\nIn 1996 a group of derivatives traders led by Olivier Doria (then head of swaps at Deutsche Bank) and Michele Faissola, contributed to an extension of the swap yield curves in all the major European currencies. Until then the market would give prices until 15 years maturities. The team extended the maturity of European yield curves up to 50 years (for the lira, French franc, Deutsche mark, Danish krone and many other currencies including the ecu). This innovation was a major contribution towards the issuance of long dated [[zero-coupon bond]]s and the creation of long dated mortgages.\n\n==Construction of the full yield curve from market data==\n:''See also: [[Bootstrapping (finance)]]; [[Fixed-income attribution#Modeling the yield curve]]; [[Multi-curve framework]].''\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0em 1em 0em 1em;\"\n|+ '''Typical inputs to the money market curve'''\n|-\n|'''Type'''\n|'''Settlement date'''\n|'''Rate (%)'''\n|-\n|Cash\n|Overnight rate\n|5.58675\n|-\n|Cash\n|Tomorrow next rate\n|5.59375\n|-\n|Cash\n|1m\n|5.625\n|-\n|Cash\n|3m\n|5.71875\n|-\n|Future\n|Dec-97\n|5.76\n|-\n|Future\n|Mar-98\n|5.77\n|-\n|Future\n|Jun-98\n|5.82\n|-\n|Future\n|Sep-98\n|5.88\n|-\n|Future\n|Dec-98\n|6.00\n|-\n|Swap\n|2y\n|6.01253\n|-\n|Swap\n|3y\n|6.10823\n|-\n|Swap\n|4y\n|6.16\n|-\n|Swap\n|5y\n|6.22\n|-\n|Swap\n|7y\n|6.32\n|-\n|Swap\n|10y\n|6.42\n|-\n|Swap\n|15y\n|6.56\n|-\n|Swap\n|20y\n|6.56\n|-\n|Swap\n|30y\n|6.56\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|\nA list of standard instruments used to build a money market yield curve.\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|\nThe data is for lending in [[US dollar]], taken from October 6, 1997\n|}\n\nThe usual representation of the yield curve is in terms of a function P, defined on all future times ''t'', such that P(''t'') represents the value today of receiving one unit of currency ''t'' years in the future. If P is defined for all future ''t'' then we can easily recover the yield (i.e. the annualized interest rate) for borrowing money for that period of time via the formula\n\n:<math>Y(t) = P(t)^{-1/t} -1. </math>\n\nThe significant difficulty in defining a yield curve therefore is to determine the function P(''t''). P is called the discount factor function or the zero coupon bond.\n\nYield curves are built from either prices available in the ''bond market'' or the ''money market''. Whilst the yield curves built from the bond market use prices only from a specific class of bonds (for instance bonds issued by the UK government) yield curves built from the [[money market]] use prices of \"cash\" from today's LIBOR rates, which determine the \"short end\" of the curve i.e. for ''t''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;3m, [[interest rate future]]s which determine the midsection of the curve (3m&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;15m) and [[interest rate swap]]s which determine the \"long end\" (1y&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;60y).\n\nThe example given in the table at the right is known as a [[LIBOR]] curve because it is constructed using either LIBOR rates or [[swap rates]]. A LIBOR curve is the most widely used interest rate curve as it represents the credit worth of private entities at about A+ rating, roughly the equivalent of commercial banks. If one substitutes the LIBOR and swap rates with government bond yields, one arrives at what is known as a government curve, usually considered the risk free interest rate curve for the underlying currency. The spread between the LIBOR or swap rate and the government bond yield, usually positive, meaning private borrowing is at a premium above government borrowing, of similar maturity is a measure of risk tolerance of the lenders. For the U. S. market, a common benchmark for such a spread is given by the so-called [[TED spread]].\n\nIn either case the available market data provides a matrix ''A'' of cash flows, each row representing a particular financial instrument and each column representing a point in time. The (''i'',''j'')-th element of the matrix represents the amount that instrument ''i'' will pay out on day ''j''. Let the vector ''F'' represent today's prices of the instrument (so that the ''i''-th instrument has value ''F''(''i'')), then by definition of our discount factor function ''P'' we should have that ''F'' = ''AP'' (this is a matrix multiplication). Actually, noise in the financial markets means it is not possible to find a ''P'' that solves this equation exactly, and our goal becomes to find a vector ''P'' such that\n\n: <math> AP = F + \\varepsilon \\, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon</math> is as small a vector as possible (where the size of a vector might be measured by taking its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], for example).\n\nEven if we can solve this equation, we will only have determined ''P''(''t'') for those ''t'' which have a cash flow from one or more of the original instruments we are creating the curve from. Values for other ''t'' are typically determined using some sort of [[interpolation]] scheme.\n\nPractitioners and researchers have suggested many ways of solving the A*P = F equation. It transpires that the most natural method \u2013 that of minimizing <math>\\epsilon</math> by [[least squares regression]] \u2013 leads to unsatisfactory results. The large number of zeroes in the matrix ''A'' mean that function ''P'' turns out to be \"bumpy\".\n\nIn their comprehensive book on interest rate modelling James and Webber note that the following techniques have been suggested to solve the problem of finding P:\n\n#Approximation using [[Lagrange polynomials]]\n#Fitting using parameterised curves (such as [[Spline (mathematics)|splines]], the [[Nelson-Siegel]] family, the [[Fixed income attribution#Modeling the yield curve|Svensson family]], the exponential polynomial<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323689711|title=The exponential polynomial family|last=Moulin|first=Serge|date=2018|website=Research gate.net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> family or the Cairns restricted-exponential family of curves). Van Deventer, Imai and Mesler summarize three different techniques for [[curve fitting]] that satisfy the maximum smoothness of either forward interest rates, zero coupon bond prices, or zero coupon bond yields\n#Local regression using [[Kernel (statistics)|kernels]]\n#[[Linear programming]]\n\nIn the money market practitioners might use different techniques to solve for different areas of the curve. For example, at the short end of the curve, where there are few cashflows, the first few elements of P may be found by [[bootstrapping (finance)|bootstrapping]] from one to the next. At the long end, a regression technique with a cost function that values smoothness might be used.\n\n===Post-financial crisis of 2007-2008===\nAfter the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], swap valuation is typically under a \"multi-curve\" framework; the above, by contrast, describes the \"self discounting\" approach. \nThe reason for the change is that post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]] \u2014 i.e. from the [[overnight index swap]] curve \u2014 is considered a better proxy than [[Libor]] for the \"risk-free rate\", and \"OIS-discounting\" is now standard (sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]]-discounting\").\nThus, when valuing a swap:\n(i) although the forecasted cashflows are derived from the Libor-curve as before, \n(ii) these cashflows are discounted at the (OIS-curve-compounded) overnight rate as opposed to at Libor.\nThe result is that, in practice, curves are built as a \"set\" and not individually, where, correspondingly:\n(i) \"forecast curves\" are constructed for ''each'' floating-leg [[Libor#Maturities|Libor tenor]]; \nand (ii) discounting is on a single, common OIS curve which must simultaneously be constructed. \nSee {{sectionlink|Interest rate swap|Valuation and pricing}} for the math, and for context, {{sectionlink|Financial economics|Derivative pricing}}.\n\n==Effect on bond prices==\n:''See: [[Bond valuation]].''\nThere is a time dimension to the analysis of bond values. A 10-year bond at purchase becomes a 9-year bond a year later, and the year after it becomes an 8-year bond, etc. Each year the bond moves incrementally closer to maturity, resulting in lower volatility and shorter duration and demanding a lower interest rate when the yield curve is rising. Since falling rates create increasing prices, the value of a bond initially will rise as the lower rates of the shorter maturity become its new market rate. Because a bond is always anchored by its final maturity, the price at some point must change direction and fall to par value at redemption.\n\nA bond's market value at different times in its life can be calculated. When the yield curve is steep, the bond is predicted to have a large [[capital gain]] in the first years before falling in price later. When the yield curve is flat, the capital gain is predicted to be much less, and there is little variability in the bond's total returns over time.\n\nRising (or falling) interest rates rarely rise by the same amount all along the yield curve\u2014the curve rarely moves up in parallel. Because longer-term bonds have a larger duration, a rise in rates will cause a larger capital loss for them, than for short-term bonds. But almost always, the long maturity's rate will change much less, flattening the yield curve. The greater change in rates at the short end will offset to some extent the advantage provided by the shorter bond's lower duration.\n\nLong duration bonds tend to be mean reverting, meaning that they readily gravitate to a long-run average. The middle of the curve (5\u201310 years) will see the greatest percentage gain in yields if there is anticipated inflation even if interest rates have not changed. The long-end does not move quite as much percentage-wise because of the mean reverting properties.\n\nThe yearly 'total return' from the bond is a) the sum of the coupon's yield plus b) the capital gain from the changing valuation as it slides down the yield curve and c) any capital gain or loss from changing interest rates at that point in the yield curve.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retailinvestor.org/bondPrice.html|title=Retail Investor .org : Bond Valuation Over Its Life|website=www.retailinvestor.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Short-rate model]]\n*[[Zero interest rate policy]]\n*[[Multi-curve framework]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book | title = Pricing and Trading Interest Rate Derivatives | author = J H M Darbyshire | year = 2017 | edition = 2nd ed. 2017 | url = http://www.tradinginterestrates.com | isbn = 978-0995455528 | publisher = Aitch and Dee Ltd.}}\n*{{cite book | title = Interest Rate Modeling|author1=Leif B.G.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year. A special 100-year logo was created and was used throughout the school year. Several celebrations were conducted, including a free lunch provided by the school, intended to pay homage to the older traditions of the College chartering a train from [[Heyington railway station]] to other parts of Melbourne for a school picnic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 1|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> Special events such as \"The Great Debate\", featuring generations of St Kevin's old boys, took place<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> and a limited-edition 100-year history of the College was published for students and staff.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bound by the Green, Gold and Blue|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2020}}\nSt Kevin's College has five campuses:\n*Glendalough \u2013 The St Kevin's College Junior School in Lansell Road, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], is named after the location of the St Kevin's Monastery in Ireland.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year. A special 100-year logo was created and was used throughout the school year. Several celebrations were conducted, including a free lunch provided by the school, intended to pay homage to the older traditions of the College chartering a train from [[Heyington railway station]] to other parts of Melbourne for a school picnic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 1|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> Special events such as \"The Great Debate\", featuring generations of St Kevin's old boys, took place<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> and a limited-edition 100-year history of the College was published for students and staff.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bound by the Green, Gold and Blue|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2020}}\nSt Kevin's College has five campuses:\n*Glendalough \u2013 The St Kevin's College Junior School in Lansell Road, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], is named after the location of the St Kevin's Monastery in Ireland.
