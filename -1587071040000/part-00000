Since 2010, the lineup stabilized around Mastelotto, Levin, and [[Markus Reuter]]. The band was formed as a vehicle for [[progressive rock]] music performed almost exclusively with [[Chapman Stick]]s and drums.\n\n==History==\nIn 2007, Levin released a solo album entitled [[Stick Man (album)|''Stick Man'']], consisting of pieces recorded on the [[Chapman Stick]], featuring his [[King Crimson]] bandmate Pat Mastelotto on drums. This then led to the formation of the band Stick Men by Mastelotto, Levin and Chapman Stick player Michael Bernier. The band released its first album ''Soup'' in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonylevin.com |title=Tonylevin.Com |publisher=Tonylevin.Com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> Bernier left shortly after the release of ''Soup'', to be replaced by [[Markus Reuter]] in early August 2010.\n\nThe new lineup released the CD ''Absalom'', in 2011, and an album of improvisations, ''Open'', in June 2012. A studio album titled ''Deep'' was released in February 2013. There is a special edition including a DVD. The album features heavy rock pieces that are mostly instrumental with exceptions like Horatio featuring [[Pat Mastelotto]] on vocals. The album also includes 11 minute tone poem Whale Watch based on Tony Levin's experiences taking whale watching trips out of Boston.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pat Mastelotto 2013 interview on Outsight Radio Hours|url=https://archive.org/details/MastelottoPatOutsight|work=Archive.org|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, the band released their first live album called ''Power Play''.\n\nIn October 2014, Stick Men released their first retrospective album.  A double album, the first disc featured studio recordings, while the second was a compilation of various recorded live improvisations the band performed on tour.  Also included on the album are remixes and remakes of various other Stick Men songs.\n\nTwo collaborative live albums with King Crimson members were subsequently recorded in Tokyo, Japan. The first one, ''Midori'', featuring [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]] on violin and keyboards, was recorded in 2015. The second one, ''Roppongi'', with [[Mel Collins]] on sax, was recorded in 2017. Eventually, a 2018 tour of Latin American countries featuring David Cross on violin became the multi-disc boxed set ''Panamerica'', released in 2019. In the same spirit of collaborations with prog legends, their sole 2020 concert in Japan with keyboardist [[Gary Husband]] became their album ''[[Nagoya]]'', recorded in its namesake Japanese city on February the 28th. \n\nTheir fourth studio album with Markus Reuter, ''Prog Noir'', was recorded and released in 2016. This album featured several vocal pieces. Tony Levin sang the title track, Markus Reuter sang Plutonium, and they shared vocals on the promotional single, The Tempest.\n\n==Style==\nStylistically, Stick Men's sound is quite unique.  Touting the fact that their lead musicians are \"playing instruments unlike any other,\" their music has evolved to be somewhere between Art Rock, Progressive Rock, and in some cases Progressive Metal.  There is a heavy influence of free music and improvisation during their live shows, as the musicians will often showcase their prowess on their respective instruments in extended free music jams.  Most notably, the band honors their connection and tenure with King Crimson by performing songs by the band as well as songs by Robert Fripp, King Crimson's lead member and guitarist.  Stick Men has also composed an abridged version of Stravinsky's \"Firebird Suite\", a staple of their live shows.\n\nMost of their compositions are instrumental, with very few songs featuring vocals, mostly by Levin, but occasionally by Reuter and Mastelotto as well.

It was released on [[Netflix]] on October 25, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nKatrina's daughter, Clara has been bitten by a [[rattlesnake]] where Katrina meets a mysterious woman in a [[Mobile home|trailer]] who says she'll help. The bite appears to have vanished and when Katrina takes Clara to the hospital, it seems that everything is fine.\n\nThe doctor suggests it was just a hallucination. A mysterious man visits Katrina at the hospital to talk about her \"payment\" for Clara's recovery, declaring her soul was spared and must be repaid; the only conditions being that the soul Katrina takes must be human, and it must be paid on time. He gives her until sunset to repay the debt, otherwise Clara will die from the rattlesnake bite. Katrina doesn't initially believe it, but when she goes back to the desert road, the trailer has disappeared and she sees a trucker with a missing eye, warning that Clara is going to die.\n\nKatrina discovers that the city of Tulia, Texas where she's ended up has been linked to a series of brutal murders and mysterious disappearances. Any time there's a photo or video of the crime scene, there's a mysterious shadowy figure in the background.\n\nThe guy who visited her at the hospital is actually a lawyer who was fatally stabbed by a school teacher with the teacher saying \"a soul for a soul\" as he stabbed the lawyer, while a creepy kid who spooks Katrina actually went missing back in 2010. After an aborted attempt to kill a dying old man in the hospital, Katrina sets her sights on Billy, an abusive boyfriend she sees criticising his girlfriend in a bar.\n\nShe breaks into their home and forces Billy to drive to a remote canyon in the desert. Before Katrina can kill him, though, he fights back and runs away. With time running out before sunset, Katrina prepares to kill herself, but as she films a goodbye message to Clara, Billy hits her with a rock and she blacks out.\n\nShe wakes up just in time and when Billy is bitten by a rattlesnake, Katrina takes the opportunity to kill him to save her daughter. As she's watched over by mysterious figures on top of the canyon, Katrina leaves the canyon and on the way home, the doctor calls to say Clara is fine.\n\nWhen Katrina reunites with her daughter, she sees that Clara has drawn a picture of the mysterious figure and the sun, seemingly aware of what her mother had to do.\nAnd when the pair get back on the road, Clara spots a hitchhiker by the road, who Katrina sees is actually Billy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Katrina Ridgeway\n* [[Theo Rossi]] as Billy\n* [[Emma Greenwell]] as Abbie\n* Richard Lippert as Dying Man\n* [[David Yow]] as Charlie\n* Joy Jacobson as Loraine\n* Arianna Ortiz as Francine\n* Catherine Haun as Loraine's Sister\n* Debrianna Mansini as The Woman\n* Sean Dillingham as Dr. Hayes\n* [[Stephanie Hill]] as Neighbor\n* Jenna Doolittle as Female Nurse\n* Alexandra Nell as Hiker\n* Melissa Chambers as Disheveled Woman\n* [[Tim Stafford]] as Male Nurse\n* Apollonia Pratt as Clara\n*Bruce Davis as The Suit/ Donald Covington\n\n== Critical Response ==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 28% approval rating, based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 4.47/10.<ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Rattlesnake (2019)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rattlesnake|work=Rotten Tomatoes|volume=|pages=|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}} R</ref>\n\nReviewing the film for [[RogerEbert.com]], Brian Tallerico praised the \"game performance from the always-good Carmen Ejogo\", but felt that the film's \"biggest issue is the pacing\" and director Zak Hilditch's failure to \"find the tension to keep his story moving.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rattlesnake-movie-review-2019|title=Rattlesnake movie review & film summary (2019) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Tallerico|first=Brian|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Benjamin Lee described the \"undeniably talented\" Ejogo as \"adrift\", Hilditch's direction as \"bland\", and the film overall as \"strangely boring\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lee|first=Benjamin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/25/rattlesnake-review-netflix-carmen-ejogo|title=Rattlesnake review \u2013 disposable supernatural Netflix thriller lacks bite|date=2019-10-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Netflix title|81018455}}\n* {{IMDb title|9257484}}\n\n[[Category:2019 films]]\n[[Category:2010s drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Netflix original films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Crime, drama, mystery film}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Rattlesnake\n| image          = Rattlesnake (2019) Film Poster.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = [[Film poster]]\n| director       = {{ubl|[[Zak Hilditch]]}}\n| producer       =\n| writer         = {{ubl|[[Zak Hilditch]]}}\n| starring       = {{ubl|[[Carmen Ejogo]]|[[Theo Rossi]]|[[Emma Greenwell]]}}\n| screenplay     = \n| story          = \n| based on       = \n| narrator       = \n| music          = \n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| studio         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Campfire]]\n* [[Netflix]]\n}}\n| distributor    = [[Netflix]]\n| released       = {{Film date|2019|10|25}}\n| runtime        = 85 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n'''''Rattlesnake''''' is a [[crime (genre)|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[mystery (genre)|mystery]] film written and directed by [[Zak Hilditch]] and starring [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Theo Rossi]] and [[Emma Greenwell]].

[[bass guitar|Bassist]] and founder member Kevin Hendrick left the group to join [[Pre (band)|Pre]]/[[Male Bonding (band)|Male Bonding]] following the recording of their fourth album ''[[Paper Crown King]]'' in 2006, and was not permanently replaced. [[Cahir O'Doherty (musician)|Cahir O'Doherty]], from [[Fighting with Wire]] and Jetplane Landing, played bass on numerous tours.\n\n==Band History==\n===Early Years===\n\nSeafood were formed on 31 August 1996 by David and Charles, who advertised for a female bassist and male drummer in classified magazine [[Loot (magazine)|Loot]]. The line-up turned out differently - a female drummer and male bassist - but, happily, this worked out and Seafood played their first gig at Camden\u2019s Dublin Castle in March, 1997. Seafood were signed to [[Fierce Panda Records]] after their fourth gig in London's Highbury Garage. The band claim that they could have been signed at their third gig, had the representative of Fierce Panda not been too drunk from a Kerrang magazine party to turn up in time to see their set.\n\nSeafood came to the attention of the music press with the release of \"Scorch Comfort\" on Fierce Panda, a noisy but melodic track that was oddly compared to both Sonic Youth and [[Bis (band)|Bis]]. This was followed by the release of \"Psychic Rainy Nights\" on Kooky records, and \"Porchlight\" on Fierce Panda. All of these singles were eventually compiled with their [[b-side]]s on the ''[[Messenger in the Camp]]'' mini-album. \n\nAt this time, Seafood embarked on two national tours, one supporting [[Kenickie]], and the other as part of the \"Panda in a Vanda\" record label tour with [[Billy Mahonie]] and Tiny Too. They also played support slots for [[Laptop]], [[Grandaddy]] and [[Dawn of the Replicants]], amongst others. Seafood played as a three-piece at the Reading festival after Charles lacerated his hands in an accident, ending with a 10-minute noise version of [[Walking in the Air]] as made popular by choir-boy [[Aled Jones]]. 1998 ended with the release of ''Messenger in the Camp'', and a gig at London's LSE.  \n\nIn 1999, Seafood headed off on tour again, with [[Idlewild (band)|Idlewild]] and [[Llama Farmers]], and returned to play a full set at the [[Reading festival]]. They also made their American debut at the [[CMJ]] band marathon.\n\n===''Surviving The Quiet'' and ''When Do We Start Fighting''===\n\nThis was also the year they recorded their debut album, ''[[Surviving the Quiet]]''.  Produced by [[Ian McCutcheon]] the album was released by Fierce Panda Records worldwide. The LP included flutes, cello, acoustic and electric guitar and a 10-minute noise breakdown on the last track.  Four singles were released from ''Surviving the Quiet'': \"Easy Path\" and \"This Is Not An Exit\" (both released before the album) and \"Belt\" and \"Led by Bison\" (both released after the album).\n\nAfter the release of the LP, Seafood toured extensively during 2000, firstly with [[Wilt (band)|Wilt]] and [[Turn (band)|Turn]], then with [[Gerling]]. They also did a short tour of the US, playing with [[Jimmy Eat World]] and [[Hot Rod Circuit]]. \n\nIn 2001, Seafood continued touring as well as beginning the recording of their follow-up to ''Surviving the Quiet''. The second LP, ''[[When Do We Start Fighting...]]'' was recorded and produced in New York by [[Girls Against Boys]] member [[Eli Janney (musician)|Eli Janney]]. It featured guest appearances by [[Mary Lorson]] of [[Madder Rose]] and [[Scott McCloud]] of Girls Against Boys. \n\nThe album release in July 2001 (on [[Infectious Records]]) was preceded by the release of ''Cloaking'' as a single. The release of further singles \"Splinter\" and \"Western Battle\" followed in December 2001 and March 2002. 2001 saw Seafood headline a tour with [[Easyworld]], support [[Sportfreunde Stiller]] in Germany and [[My Vitriol]] and [[Ash (band)|Ash]] on their UK tours.\n\nIn 2002 the band toured with [[Dashboard Confessional]] in the US, played a long UK tour with Jetplane Landing, supported Jimmy Eat World on their UK tour and played their own headline UK tour with [[Crackout (Band)|Crackout]] as support. \n\nAfter this tour, Seafood spent time working on building a studio, Neat Science Laboratories, in preparation for recording their next album, eventually released in the summer of 2004. During this time, Seafood played only a handful of gigs due to problems with singer David Line's health following the collapse of one of his lungs.\n\n===''As The Cry Flows'', ''Paper Crown King'' and split===\n\n''[[As the Cry Flows]]'' was recorded with ''Surviving The Quiet'' producer [[Ian McCutcheon]] at the end of 2003 and released by [[Cooking Vinyl]] records in May 2004. An attempt at touring the record around the time of its release was cut short when David Line's lung problem flared up again. However, they were able to finally tour the UK in late 2004, and Europe in early 2005. After the conclusion of their European tour, the band retreated to write songs for their next release.\n\nOn 17 September 2005, the band played their first live show for almost six months, at the 2nd annual [[Smalltown America|Smalltown America Records]] Charity All-Dayer at [[London]]'s 93 Feet East venue, where they played a set that consisted almost entirely of new material.\n\nThe band embarked on their first national tour of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for several years in July 2006 and released the single \"Signal Sparks\" on the 31st of that month. The band's fourth album, ''[[Paper Crown King]]'', followed in September of the same year. In early May 2007 Seafood announced, via their website, that they would be releasing covers of [[The Cure|The Cure's]] \"[[Lovesong (The Cure song)|Lovesong]]\" and [[Townes Van Zandt|Townes Van Zandt's]] \"I'll be Here in the Morning\" as a [[Double A-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] download-only single on 11 June to accompany their May/June UK tour.\n\nIn mid-2009 it was announced via the band's website that the band no longer exists, but each member of the band continues to work in various side projects.\n\nSeafood on [https://www.facebook.com/seafoodrocks Facebook]\n\n==Discography==\n;Albums\n\n*''[[Messenger in the Camp]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Surviving the Quiet]]'' (2000)\n*''[[When Do We Start Fighting...]]'' (2001)\n*''[[As the Cry Flows]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Paper Crown King]]'' (2006)\n\n;Singles\n\n*\"Scorch Comfort\"\n*\"Psychic Rainy Nights\"\n*\"Porchlight\"\n*\"Easy Path\"\n*\"This Is Not An Exit\"\n*\"Belt\"\n*\"Led By Bison\"\n*\"Cloaking\"\n*\"Splinter\" (December 2001)\n*\"Coursework\" EP (2001)\n*\"Western Battle\" (March 2002)\n*\"Pleasurehead\" (June 2002, [[split album|split single]] with Jetplane Landing)\n*\"Summer Falls\" (March 2004)\n*\"Good Reason\" (April 2004)\n*\"Sleepover\" (October 2004)\n*\"Signal Sparks\" (July 2006)\n*\"I Will Talk\" (October 2006)\n*\"[[Lovesong (The Cure song)|Lovesong]]\" / \"I'll be Here in the Morning\" (June 2007)\n\n;DVD\n*\"Seafood: Where have you been?\" (October 2009)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.facebook.com/seafoodrocks Facebook]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/seafoodtheband Official MySpace]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/seafoodus U.S. MySpace]\n* [http://seafood.hp.infoseek.co.jp Japanese Fansite]\n* [http://www.subpop.com/artists/male_bonding]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seafood}}\n[[Category:English alternative rock groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from London]]\n[[Category:Underground punk scene in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Cooking Vinyl artists]]\n[[Category:Infectious Music artists]]\n[[Category:Fierce Panda Records artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2013}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=April 2009}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Seafood\n| image               = \n| caption             = \n| image_size          = \n| background          = group_or_band\n| origin              = [[London]], [[England]], \n| genre               = [[Rock music|Rock]]<br/>[[Alternative Music|Alternative]]<br/>[[Punk music|Punk]]\n| years_active        = 1996\u20132009\n| label               = [[Fierce Panda]], [[Infectious Records|Infectious]], [[Cooking Vinyl]], \n| associated_acts = [[Cazmechanic]],<br>[[Torn Flags]],<br>[[William Fairley Project]],<br>[[Billy Mahonie]],<br>[[Pre (band)|Pre]],<br>[[Fighting with Wire]],<br/>[[Male Bonding (band)|Male Bonding]]\n| current_members     = David Line<br/>Caroline Banks<br/>Kevin Penney \n| past_members        = Charles MacLeod <br>Kevin Hendrick\n}}\n\n'''Seafood''' were a [[UK]] band formed in [[London]] around 1996.\n\nThe line-up included chief songwriter David Line (vocals, [[guitar]]), Caroline Banks ([[drum kit|drums]] and backing vocals) and Kevin Penney (guitars) who joined the band following the departure of founder-member Charles MacLeod.

In early May 2007 Seafood announced, via their website, that they would be releasing covers of [[The Cure|The Cure's]] \"[[Lovesong (The Cure song)|Lovesong]]\" and [[Townes Van Zandt|Townes Van Zandt's]] \"I'll be Here in the Morning\" as a [[Double A-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] download-only single on 11 June to accompany their May/June UK tour.\n\nIn mid-2009 it was announced via the band's website that the band no longer exists, but each member of the band continues to work in various side projects.\n\n==Discography==\n;Albums\n\n*''[[Messenger in the Camp]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Surviving the Quiet]]'' (2000)\n*''[[When Do We Start Fighting...]]'' (2001)\n*''[[As the Cry Flows]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Paper Crown King]]'' (2006)\n\n;Singles\n\n*\"Scorch Comfort\"\n*\"Psychic Rainy Nights\"\n*\"Porchlight\"\n*\"Easy Path\"\n*\"This Is Not An Exit\"\n*\"Belt\"\n*\"Led By Bison\"\n*\"Cloaking\"\n*\"Splinter\" (December 2001)\n*\"Coursework\" EP (2001)\n*\"Western Battle\" (March 2002)\n*\"Pleasurehead\" (June 2002, [[split album|split single]] with Jetplane Landing)\n*\"Summer Falls\" (March 2004)\n*\"Good Reason\" (April 2004)\n*\"Sleepover\" (October 2004)\n*\"Signal Sparks\" (July 2006)\n*\"I Will Talk\" (October 2006)\n*\"[[Lovesong (The Cure song)|Lovesong]]\" / \"I'll be Here in the Morning\" (June 2007)\n\n;DVD\n*\"Seafood: Where have you been?\" (October 2009)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.facebook.com/seafoodrocks Facebook]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/seafoodtheband Official MySpace]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/seafoodus U.S. MySpace]\n* [http://seafood.hp.infoseek.co.jp Japanese Fansite]\n* [http://www.subpop.com/artists/male_bonding]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seafood}}\n[[Category:English alternative rock groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from London]]\n[[Category:Underground punk scene in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Cooking Vinyl artists]]\n[[Category:Infectious Music artists]]\n[[Category:Fierce Panda Records artists]]\n", "name_user": "Peteecole", "label": "safe", "comment": "added Faceook link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood_(band)"}

The major problem with ricin is that its native [[Endocytosis|internalization]] sequences are distributed throughout the protein. If any of these native internalization sequences are present in a therapeutic agent, the drug will be internalized by, and kill, untargeted non-tumorous cells as well as targeted cancerous cells.\n\nModifying ricin may sufficiently lessen the likelihood that the ricin component of these [[immunotoxin]]s will cause the wrong cells to internalize it, while still retaining its cell-killing activity when it is internalized by the targeted cells. However, bacterial toxins, such as [[diphtheria toxin]], which is used in [[denileukin diftitox]], an FDA-approved treatment for leukemia and lymphoma, have proven to be more practical. A promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic B subunit (a lectin) as a vehicle for delivering [[antigen]]s into cells, thus greatly increasing their [[immunogenicity]]. Use of ricin as an [[adjuvant]] has potential implications for developing [[mucosal]] [[vaccine]]s.\n\n== Regulation ==\nIn the US, ricin appears on the [[select agent]]s list of the [[US Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf |title=HHS and USDA Select Agents and Toxins 7 CFR Part 331, 9 CFR Part 121, and 42 CFR Part 73 |website=cdc.gov |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117165906/http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> and scientists must register with HHS to use ricin in their research.

The major problem with ricin is that its native [[Endocytosis|internalization]] sequences are distributed throughout the protein. If any of these native internalization sequences are present in a therapeutic agent, the drug will be internalized by, and kill, untargeted non-tumorous cells as well as targeted cancerous cells.\n\nModifying ricin may sufficiently lessen the likelihood that the ricin component of these [[immunotoxin]]s will cause the wrong cells to internalize it, while still retaining its cell-killing activity when it is internalized by the targeted cells. However, bacterial toxins, such as [[diphtheria toxin]], which is used in [[denileukin diftitox]], an FDA-approved treatment for leukemia and lymphoma, have proven to be more practical. A promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic B subunit (a lectin) as a vehicle for delivering [[antigen]]s into cells, thus greatly increasing their [[immunogenicity]]. Use of ricin as an [[adjuvant]] has potential implications for developing [[mucosal]] [[vaccine]]s.\n\n== Regulation ==\nIn the US, ricin appears on the [[select agent]]s list of the [[US Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf |title=HHS and USDA Select Agents and Toxins 7 CFR Part 331, 9 CFR Part 121, and 42 CFR Part 73 |website=cdc.gov |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117165906/http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> and scientists must register with HHS to use ricin in their research.

Corresponding to this, knowledge-based decision making tries to focus on functioning within an environment containing a variety of components, including respecting one another's decisions and listening to each other. These factors influence a culture since they can contribute to how an individual feels within the environment. This influence can be positive or negative, reducing the amount of fear and pressure put on individuals if they make a mistake. If individuals feel as though they need advice, the culture can assist individuals, since it would be normal to help each other, by reassuring as well as encouraging. In contrast, not having a culture of trust can increase the level of risk when making decisions, as individuals may take advantage of situations and be non-supportive or unwilling to give advice to others.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Advantages===\n\n'''Open communication'''\n* Contributes to increased relevant overall knowledge and understanding about the topic, doing this can limit both confusion and [[misunderstanding]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n'''Dialogue Before deliberation'''\n* Provides the opportunity for decision maker's to prepare by viewing background information founded, this can generate a better understanding of the topic involved.\n* Decision makers prepared for discussion as they have the chance to generate questions and identification of specific aspects of the findings and information they want to discuss or develop on.\n* Decision maker's gaining a clearer and rounded understanding of the topic beforehand from background information provided.\n* Gives clear direction of conversation<ref name=\":5\" />\n'''All decision makers have common access to information'''\n* Having information published in one location can contribute to ease of access, but also ensures availability, allowing decision makers to view information before a meeting, efficiently and effectively.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Publishing information beforehand allows members to have a sufficient time period to become informed about the content provided, generate further questions, and express opinions<ref name=\":3\" /> about the matter to reach the most suitable outcome.\n'''Decision makers exist in a culture of trust'''\n* Helping, advising and supporting one another.\n* Working towards the same goals, group effort.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hafg.org/group_rep/KBDM_ETAAA.pdf|title = Knowledge based decision making, benefits|last = Anon|first = Anon|date = n.d.|journal = KBDM Benefits|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 3 November 2015}}</ref>\n* Authority isn't a large factor, the content of the information to make an informed decision is most important.\n* Group members are more likely to support a decision made because of their contribution.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Disadvantages===\n\n'''Open communication'''\n* There is always a chance that some decision makers will not communicate effectively, leading to confusion.\n* Miscommunication can still occur between individuals from different perceptions.\n'''Dialogue Before deliberation'''\n* Some individuals may not have read the background information and not understand the direction of conversation.\n* Background information provided may be hard to understand and impact preparation time.\n* Unexpected issues will constantly arise.\n'''All decision makers have common access to information'''\n* Technology can be a barrier, information stored on a computer based system maybe lost.\n* Background information can be outdated.<ref name=\":1\" />\n'''We exist in a culture of trust'''\n* New decision makers may not fully understand the culture.\n\n==Process==\nThe process is composed of six main components:\n[[File:KDBM Process.jpg|thumb|Figure 2 - Knowledge-based decision making (KBDM)]]\n# A topic is specified.\n# Relevant background information<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tech-clarity.com/documents/Tech-Clarity-Insight-Knowledge-Enabled-Decisions-Summary.pdf|title = Knowledge- Enabled Decision Making|last = Inc|first = Tech-Clarity|date = 2012|journal = Tech Clarity Insight|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 17 October 2015}}</ref> and key facts are identified and gathered in relation to the specified topic.

The structure supports and is suited to assist long- term planning and strategic decision-making.<ref name=\":5\" /> At the beginning of the process key background information is assembled to increase the amount of knowledge and understanding each individual decision maker has about the topic, vital aspects of information will also be included. The research and information founded are put into a mutual location to provide equal grounds in terms of knowledge before a discussion occurs, this gives time for questions to be established.

Corresponding to this, knowledge-based decision making tries to focus on functioning within an environment containing a variety of components, including respecting one another's decisions and listening to each other. These factors influence a culture since they can contribute to how an individual feels within the environment. This influence can be positive or negative, reducing the amount of fear and pressure put on individuals if they make a mistake. If individuals feel as though they need advice, the culture can assist individuals, since it would be normal to help each other, by reassuring as well as encouraging. In contrast, not having a culture of trust can increase the level of risk when making decisions, as individuals may take advantage of situations and be non-supportive or unwilling to give advice to others.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Advantages===\n\n'''Open communication'''\n* Contributes to increased relevant overall knowledge and understanding about the topic, doing this can limit both confusion and [[misunderstanding]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n'''Dialogue Before deliberation'''\n* Provides opportunity for decision maker's to prepare by viewing background information founded, this can generate a better understanding of the topic involved.\n* Decision makers prepared for discussion as they have the chance to generate questions and identification of specific aspects of the findings and information they want to discuss or develop on.\n* Decision maker's gaining a clearer and rounded understanding of the topic beforehand from background information provided.\n* Gives clear direction of conversation<ref name=\":5\" />\n'''All decision makers have common access to information'''\n* Having information published in one location can contribute to ease of access, but also ensures availability, allowing decision makers to view information before a meeting, efficiently and effectively.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Publishing information beforehand allows members to have a sufficient time period to become informed about content provided, generate further questions, and express opinions<ref name=\":3\" /> about the matter to reach the most suitable outcome.\n'''Decision makers exist in a culture of trust'''\n* Helping, advising and supporting one another.\n* Working towards the same goals, group effort.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hafg.org/group_rep/KBDM_ETAAA.pdf|title = Knowledge based decision making, benefits|last = Anon|first = Anon|date = n.d.|journal = KBDM Benefits|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 3 November 2015}}</ref>\n* Authority isn't a large factor, the content of the information to make an informed decision is most import.\n* Group members are more likely to support a decision made because of their contribution.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Disadvantages===\n\n'''Open communication'''\n* There is always a chance that some decision makers will not communicate effectively, leading to confusion.\n* Miscommunication can still occur between individuals from different perceptions.\n'''Dialogue Before deliberation'''\n* Some individuals may not have read the background information and not understand the direction of conversation.\n* Background information provided may be hard to understand and impact preparation time.\n* Unexpected issues will constantly arise.\n'''All decision makers have common access to information'''\n* Technology can be a barrier, information stored on a computer based system maybe lost.\n* Background information can be outdated.<ref name=\":1\" />\n'''We exist in a culture of trust'''\n* New decision makers may not fully understand the culture.\n\n==Process==\nThe process is composed of six main components:\n[[File:KDBM Process.jpg|thumb|Figure 2 - Knowledge-based decision making (KBDM)]]\n# A topic is specified.\n# Relevant background information<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tech-clarity.com/documents/Tech-Clarity-Insight-Knowledge-Enabled-Decisions-Summary.pdf|title = Knowledge- Enabled Decision Making|last = Inc|first = Tech-Clarity|date = 2012|journal = Tech Clarity Insight|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 17 October 2015}}</ref> and key facts are identified and gathered in relation to the specified topic.

The structure present enables the thought process of a decision to be specified and states the reasons behind a decision,<ref name=\":3\" /> so if an issue does occur with the overall outcome the thought process can be evaluated thoroughly.\n* In association with business, the KBDM process can give companies or organisations a competitive advantage, create common grounds and gain an understanding of others within the same sector due to the structured format. The structure supports and is suited to assist long- term planning and strategic decision-making.<ref name=\":5\" /> At the beginning of the process key background information is assembled to increase the amount of knowledge and understanding each individual decision maker has about the topic, vital aspects of information will also be included. The research and information founded are put into a mutual location to provide equal grounds in terms of knowledge before a discussion occurs, this gives time for questions to be established. From the KBDM process, a decision can be made based on facts, understanding and suitable reasoning from discussions to conclude the most appropriate decision.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Questions==\nDuring the third stage of the process background information is measured against a set of questions. These questions are answered and then used to contribute to the overall decision made.\n\nQuestions that are used to measure information include:\n# What do we currently know about the needs, wants and preferences of our members that relates to this discussion?\n# What do we know about both our resources and strategic position that is relevant to this issue?\n# What do we know about the current environment and culture that relates to this issue?\n# What are the (ethical) implications of our choice (pros and cons)?<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pa-al-anon.org/service/KnowledgeBasedDecisionMakingSummary.pdf|title = Knowledge based decision making - questions|last = Anon|first = Anon|date = n.d.|journal = Pa-al-anon|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n# What do we not know about this issue that we wish we knew?<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.scws-al-anon.org/director_presentations/KBDM_IntroandRefresher_wNotes_021514.pdf|title = KBDM|last = Al- Anon|first = SCWS|date = n.d.|journal = KBDM|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 October 2015}}</ref>\n# How do Al-Anon's legacies apply to this issue?\n# What is your part in the process?<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Knowledge Based Decision Making Overview|last = http://www.al-anon12.org/uploads/3/7/6/8/37680853/knowledgebaseddecisionmaking.pdf|first = Al-Anon|date = January 2012|journal = Al-Anon District 12 Panel 52|doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\n== Decision making in project management ==\nEffective [[project management]] is best achieved using an adaptive approach focused on effective decision-making.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O\u2019Sullivan|first=David|date=2015-06-24|title=Decision making in project management|journal=Production Planning & Control|language=en|volume=26|issue=16|pages=1386\u20131387|doi=10.1080/09537287.2015.1055092|issn=0953-7287}}</ref> Therefore, a variety of tools based on [[Knowledge management software|software]] and [[Organizational structure|structure]] have been developed to support decision making in groups.\nDecision Making processes are strongly correlating to the level of available knowledge regarding the environment, the decision\nis based on.<ref>Holsapple, C.

The skit takes a turn when it is revealed that the smiling and cheerful characters are actually on their way to commit a bank robbery that eventually leads to a violent police chase.

Bennett noted the manner in which their skits gradually establish their premise in judiciously quiet moments, before implementing more manic payoffs that subvert expectations. While Bennett did not believe that the setups were always paced properly, he noted the ones that were, saying, \"To call them sketches would seem to demean their unquestionable artistry \u2013 builds up the tension so beautifully, then punctures it so hilariously with just two short words, it's one of the best single moments of the Fringe.\"<ref name=Chortle/>\n\nJon Stapley, reviewing a 2012 Edinburgh performance of The Chris and Paul Show for ''[[Broadway Baby]]'', lauded the pair, noting that despite the audience tension on account of the performance beginning ten minutes late, \"the result was a very different, very funny hour of comedy that quickly won the audience\u2019s affections and left everyone with big grins on their faces.\" Stapley called The Chris and Paul Show's approach to sketch comedy \"novel\", praising their \"impressive physical comedy chops\", and the way in which they incorporate impromptu participation by audience members into their sketches. Although Stapley also criticized the duo for the length of their \"long, awkward pauses,\" and with their ability to end a scene, \"the physical talent and originality on display...more than made up for it.

At that time, Valenti created a one-man show called ''The Long, Miserable Journey to Happiness'', which he would perform in the 2017 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]].  \n\nIn 2019, the duo gained wide exposure in 2019 as contestants on the [[NBC]] comedy competition television series ''[[Bring the Funny]]'',<ref name=StamfordAdvocate/> in which they placed as finalists.\n\n===Comedy style ===\nThe Chris and Paul Show's sketches involve an emphasis on [[physical comedy]] and minimal or no dialogue,<ref name=StamfordAdvocate/><ref name=Chortle/><ref name=BroadwayBaby/> a style influenced by comedians like [[Laurel and Hardy]], which the ''[[Stamford Advocate]]'' described as \"modern day vaudeville with an edgy, unexpected twist.\" In one of their sketches, for example, O'Neill and Valenti act out getting into a car as cheerful music plays over what appears to be a pleasant ride. The skit takes a turn when it is revealed that the smiling and cheerful characters are actually on their way to commit a bank robbery that eventually leads to a violent police chase. O'Neill said of his comedy, \"We like to set it up where the audience likes to think where the sketch is going and then we turn the switch on them.\" <ref name=StamfordAdvocate/>\n\n== Reception ==\n''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Jessica Goldstein, commenting on the duo's practice of setting up an idea, only for it to be subverted in the payoff, stated, \"'The Chris and Paul Show' is their sensibility distilled to its simplest form: a joke heads in one direction but veers to the left at the last minute, and the sketch snaps shut before the shock fully registers.<ref name=WashingtonPost/>\n\nBarrie Morgan, reviewing The Chris and Paul Show's performance at the 2011 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] for ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'', lauded the act, saying that it offers \"a unique show of interesting and surprising skits that are both intelligent and hilarious. The show starts slowly but the audience instantly warm to the two Americans. Their comedic dynamic is spot on, and it shows.\" Morgan called the duo \"one of the greatest sketch shows I've ever seen.\"<ref name=TheSkinny/>\n\nSteve Bennett, reviewing the same entry at that festival for ''[[Chortle]]'' called O'Neill and Valenti \"slick, talented and with undoubted funny\", comparing them to [[The Pajama Men]]. Bennett noted the manner in which their skits gradually establish their premise in judiciously quiet moments, before implementing more manic payoffs that subvert expectations. While Bennett did not believe that the setups were always paced properly, he noted the ones that were, saying, \"To call them sketches would seem to demean their unquestionable artistry \u2013 builds up the tension so beautifully, then punctures it so hilariously with just two short words, it's one of the best single moments of the Fringe.\"<ref name=Chortle/>\n\nJon Stapley, reviewing a 2012 Edinburgh performance of The Chris and Paul Show for ''[[Broadway Baby]]'', lauded the pair, noting that despite the audience tension on account of the performance beginning ten minutes late, \"the result was a very different, very funny hour of comedy that quickly won the audience\u2019s affections and left everyone with big grins on their faces.\" Stapley called The Chris and Paul Show's approach to sketch comedy \"novel\", praising their \"impressive physical comedy chops\", and the way in which they incorporate impromptu participation by audience members into their sketches. Although Stapley also criticized the duo for the length of their \"long, awkward pauses,\" and with their ability to end a scene, \"the physical talent and originality on display...more than made up for it. Chris and Paul put on a relentlessly unique sketch show and did it very well indeed.
