Its core original members included David Schelzel on lead vocals/guitar, Steve Lau on keyboards/saxophone, Bobby Mittan on bass guitar and Rob Minnig on drums and vocals.\n\n==Early career==\nThe members of The Ocean Blue first met in junior high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediafiveent.com/archive/viewprofile.php?id=285|title=Media Five Archive for The Ocean Blue|publisher=Media Five Ltd|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> They cut a series of demos while in high school, with Scott Stouffer sitting in on drums. They managed to get two of these earliest recordings, \"On Growing Up\" and \"Wounds of a Friend\", included on a local radio station compilation in late 1986. The compilation also included very early work from friends and mentors of The Ocean Blue, noted local artists, [[The Innocence Mission]]. Rob Minnig would join as permanent drummer in 1987, and the classic line-up of Schelzel/Lau/Minnig/Mittan would continue through 1994.\n\n==Sire Records years==\nThe Ocean Blue's members were just teenagers and still in high school when they signed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ocean-blue-mn0000486395/biography|title=The Ocean Blue - Artist Biography |author=Jason Ankeny|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> a three-album deal in [[1988 in music|1988]] with [[Sire Records]], at the behest of Sire founder [[Seymour Stein]]. The Ocean Blue's self-titled album was recorded in London with producers [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]] and Mark Optiz.\n\nThe band's busy calendar included U.S. touring and an appearance on one of the first episodes of ''[[Club MTV]]'', with [[Downtown Julie Brown]]. The first single, \"Between Something and Nothing,\" peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] Alternative Songs chart, while its follow-up, \"Drifting, Falling\" peaked at #10.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-ocean-blue|title=The Ocean Blue Chart History|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> Two promotional videos were made for the songs and both received rotation on ''[[PostModern MTV]]'', with the latter video featuring the band in various locations in and around their hometown of [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]]. The band later joined [[The Mighty Lemon Drops]] and [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|John Wesley Harding]] on an extensive U.S./Canadian tour. All of this promotion helped the band sell well over 150,000 units of the first record.\n\nAfter recording in several New England studios, the band released their second album, ''Cerulean'', in 1991.<ref name=\"UT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/03/04/ocean-blue/1962263/|work=USA Today|title=Fave '90s band The Ocean Blue resurfaces|author=Whitney Matheson|date=2013}}</ref> The singles \"Ballerina Out of Control\" and \"Mercury\" both charted on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, at #3 and #27, respectively.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Drummer [[Rob Minnig]] began to hone his song production and mixing abilities, which would later be reflected on the next album and its single [[B-sides]], which the band chose to produce themselves.\n\nThe final Sire Records release came in 1993 with ''Beneath the Rhythm and Sound''<ref name=\"UT\" />, which sold over 100,000 copies. The single \"Sublime\" peaked at #3 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe band contributed songs to the [[Eric Stoltz]] film ''[[Naked in New York]]'', released on April 13, 1994. For the duration of their 1993-1994 tour in support of ''Beneath the Rhythm and Sound'', the band toured as a five-piece group, with newly-added second guitarist Oed Ronne. [[Westwood One Radio Networks]] recorded the group's June 20, 1994 concert in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], [[California]] and released it as a promotional-only CD, the band's only official live album.\n\nDuring this time, keyboardist/sax player and original member Steve Lau was becoming more interested in the music business and moved to [[New York City]]. His final appearance on a commercial release by the band came with the ''Peace and Light'' EP, featuring the album track \"Peace of Mind\" as well as two live performances and a previously unreleased track. Lau exited the band in late 1994 and Oed Ronne was brought in full-time. Lau later became a record executive with a Sire Records subsidiary known as Kinetic, a label specializing in indie dance music.\n\n==Mercury Records and indie releases==\nIn 1996, [[Mercury Records]] signed the band and released their fourth album, ''See the Ocean Blue'', that fall, which reflected the arrival of new guitarist Oed Ronne and the band's renewed interest in the music of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kordarecords.com/the-ocean-blue/|title=the ocean blue |website=Kordarecords.com|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> While Schelzel remained the predominant songwriter of the band, Ronne composed two tracks and sang lead on his song \"Behind.\"\n\n''See'' was released to lukewarm results, with the record company cancelling plans to film a video for the second single, \"Slide.\" Despite a nationwide tour, the band fell victim to the global record company mergers and purges that engulfed late 1996 and early 1997.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1999, the band recorded and self-released their fifth album, ''Davy Jones Locker''. Two years later, the album was resequenced, remastered and re-released on [[March Records]], with March releasing both \"Denmark\" and \"Ayn\" as EPs, each featuring three new B-sides.

Its core original members included David Schelzel on lead vocals/guitar, Steve Lau on keyboards/saxophone, Bobby Mittan on bass guitar and Rob Minnig on drums and vocals.\n\n==Early career==\nThe members of The Ocean Blue first met in junior high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediafiveent.com/archive/viewprofile.php?id=285|title=Media Five Archive for The Ocean Blue|publisher=Media Five Ltd|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> They cut a series of demos while in high school, with Scott Stouffer sitting in on drums. They managed to get two of these earliest recordings, \"On Growing Up\" and \"Wounds of a Friend\", included on a local radio station compilation in late 1986. The compilation also included very early work from friends and mentors of The Ocean Blue, noted local artists, [[The Innocence Mission]]. Rob Minnig would join as permanent drummer in 1987, and the classic line-up of Schelzel/Lau/Minnig/Mittan would continue through 1994.\n\n==Sire Records years==\nThe Ocean Blue's members were just teenagers and still in high school when they signed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ocean-blue-mn0000486395/biography|title=The Ocean Blue - Artist Biography |author=Jason Ankeny|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> a three-album deal in [[1988 in music|1988]] with [[Sire Records]], at the behest of Sire founder [[Seymour Stein]]. The Ocean Blue's self-titled album was recorded in London with producers [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]] and Mark Optiz.\n\nThe band's busy calendar included U.S. touring and an appearance on one of the first episodes of ''[[Club MTV]]'', with [[Downtown Julie Brown]]. The first single, \"Between Something and Nothing,\" peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] Alternative Songs chart, while its follow-up, \"Drifting, Falling\" peaked at #10.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-ocean-blue|title=The Ocean Blue Chart History|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> Two promotional videos were made for the songs and both received rotation on ''[[PostModern MTV]]'', with the latter video featuring the band in various locations in and around their hometown of [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]]. The band later joined [[The Mighty Lemon Drops]] and [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|John Wesley Harding]] on an extensive U.S./Canadian tour. All of this promotion helped the band sell well over 150,000 units of the first record.\n\nAfter recording in several New England studios, the band released their second album, ''Cerulean'', in 1991.<ref name=\"UT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/03/04/ocean-blue/1962263/|work=USA Today|title=Fave '90s band The Ocean Blue resurfaces|author=Whitney Matheson|date=2013}}</ref> The singles \"Ballerina Out of Control\" and \"Mercury\" both charted on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, at #3 and #27, respectively.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Drummer [[Rob Minnig]] began to hone his song production and mixing abilities, which would later be reflected on the next album and its single [[B-sides]], which the band chose to produce themselves.\n\nThe final Sire Records release came in 1993 with ''Beneath the Rhythm and Sound''<ref name=\"UT\" />, which sold over 100,000 copies. The single \"Sublime\" peaked at #3 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe band contributed songs to the [[Eric Stoltz]] film ''[[Naked in New York]]'', released on April 13, 1994. For the duration of their 1993-1994 tour in support of ''Beneath the Rhythm and Sound'', the band toured as a five-piece group, with newly-added second guitarist Oed Ronne. [[Westwood One Radio Networks]] recorded the group's June 20, 1994 concert in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], [[California]] and released it as a promotional-only CD, the band's only official live album.\n\nDuring this time, keyboardist/sax player and original member Steve Lau was becoming more interested in the music business and moved to [[New York City]]. His final appearance on a commercial release by the band came with the ''Peace and Light'' EP, featuring the album track \"Peace of Mind\" as well as two live performances and a previously unreleased track. Lau exited the band in late 1994 and Oed Ronne was brought in full-time. Lau later became a record executive with a Sire Records subsidiary known as Kinetic, a label specializing in indie dance music.\n\n==Mercury Records and indie releases==\nIn 1996, [[Mercury Records]] signed the band and released their fourth album, ''See the Ocean Blue'', that fall, which reflected the arrival of new guitarist Oed Ronne and the band's renewed interest in the music of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kordarecords.com/the-ocean-blue/|title=the ocean blue |website=Kordarecords.com|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> While Schelzel remained the predominant songwriter of the band, Ronne composed two tracks and sang lead on his song \"Behind.\"\n\n''See'' was released to lukewarm results, with the record company cancelling plans to film a video for the second single, \"Slide.\" Despite a nationwide tour, the band fell victim to the global record company mergers and purges that engulfed late 1996 and early 1997.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1999, the band recorded and self-released their fifth album, ''Davy Jones Locker''. Two years later, the album was resequenced, remastered and re-released on [[March Records]], with March releasing both \"Denmark\" and \"Ayn\" as EPs, each featuring three new B-sides. Shortly thereafter, [[Rob Minnig]] decided to leave the group after fourteen years, and Peter Anderson, a friend of the band from [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], was brought in for live shows and, eventually, permanent recording work.\n\nIn 2004, the band released the diverse six-song EP ''Waterworks'' on What Are Records?.

It was frequently used by local schools as the venue for their annual choral concerts, as well as being regularly used by local music, opera, amateur dramatic and religious organisations. The Concert Hall features a cinema with Croydon's largest cinema screen.\n\n==History==\n\nThe halls are built on the site of Croydon's historic \"Fair Field\", which hosted a well-known [[fair]] up until around 1860, and above disused railway cuttings which used to link the [[Brighton Main Line|main London to Brighton railway]] to [[Croydon Central railway station|Croydon Central Station]] in what is now [[Queen's Gardens (Croydon)|Queen's Gardens]]. Between 1930 and 1962 the land was home to both a car park and air raid shelters during the war.\n\nThe venue was 50 years old in 2012 and an anniversary concert by the London Mozart Players was attended by the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl of Wessex]]. A website was also launched to celebrate both the venue's history and to act as an ongoing archive, containing 2,000 digitised images accessed via text and keyword searches. This makes it one of the largest digitised venue archives in Europe.\n\nIn the summer of 2014 the council paid for the refurbishment of the Arnhem Gallery, the conversion of the former Green Room into the New Studio and the installation of modern digital projection equipment with Dolby Surround 7.1 in the Concert Hall.\n\nFairfield was run from 1993 to 2016 by a self-financing charity with a board of trustees. The charity was in receipt of an operating grant from Croydon Council; it was placed into administration in July 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/8203-fairfield-halls-cannot-afford-to-pay-staff-redundancy-as-the-trust-files-for-administration/story-29525101-detail/story.html |title=Fairfield Halls charity cannot afford to pay staff redundancy as trust files for administration |author=Samantha Booth |date=18 July 2016 |work=Croydon Advertiser }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===2016 redevelopment===\n\nCroydon Council, the freeholder of the land, had various plans to refurbish Fairfield over the years but none of these plans came to fruition.  In the spring of 2015 a new set of consultants led by Croydon firm [[Mott MacDonald]] was appointed by Croydon Council to deliver a \u00a312m programme on the Fairfield Halls and a separate programme for the remainder of the College Green site. Around \u00a330m would be spent on redeveloping and modernising Fairfield Halls in the period between 2016 and 2018. \n\nIn February 2016, it was confirmed that the venue would close for two years for redevelopment starting July 2016 as part of the Croydon council's plan for the cultural and educational quarter in the town centre, with new homes, offices, shops and a building for Croydon College being constructed.<ref name=\"croydon advertiser\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/13809257.Major_plans_to_transform_Fairfield_Halls_will__outdo_the_South_Bank_/ |title= Major plans to transform Fairfield Halls and 'outdo the South Bank' unveiled |date= 7 October 2015 |author= Chris Baynes |work=Croydon Guardian }}</ref> Later on the venue was scheduled to re-open by the end of March 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://developcroydon.com/fairfield-halls-set-to-reopen-fully-by-the-end-of-march-2019/ |title= Fairfield Halls set to fully reopen by the end of March 2019 |date= 15 March 2018 |work=Develop Croydon}}</ref> It is now due to re-open mid September 2019.\n\n==As a venue==\n[[File:DrupalCon London Group Photo (6072349311).jpg|thumb|The concert hall in 2011]]\nThe building's concert hall has 1,801 seats (counting the choir stalls), the [[Ashcroft Theatre]] has 755, and the Arnhem Gallery is used for standing concerts of up to 400.\n\nMany famous acts have performed at the Fairfield Halls, including [[David Bowie]], [[Elton John]], [[the Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[the Who]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Sister Sledge]], [[Morrissey]], [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[The Dubliners]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Canned Heat]], [[Taste]], [[Free (band)|Free]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Petula Clark]], [[The Stranglers]] and [[Shane Filan]] of [[Westlife]].

It was frequently used by local schools as the venue for their annual choral concerts, as well as being regularly used by local music, opera, amateur dramatic and religious organisations. The Concert Hall features a cinema with Croydon's largest cinema screen.\n\n==History==\n\nThe halls are built on the site of Croydon's historic \"Fair Field\", which hosted a well-known [[fair]] up until around 1860, and above disused railway cuttings which used to link the [[Brighton Main Line|main London to Brighton railway]] to [[Croydon Central railway station|Croydon Central Station]] in what is now [[Queen's Gardens (Croydon)|Queen's Gardens]]. Between 1930 and 1962 the land was home to both a car park and air raid shelters during the war.\n\nThe venue was 50 years old in 2012 and an anniversary concert by the London Mozart Players was attended by the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl of Wessex]]. A website was also launched to celebrate both the venue's history and to act as an ongoing archive, containing 2,000 digitised images accessed via text and keyword searches. This makes it one of the largest digitised venue archives in Europe.\n\nIn the summer of 2014 the council paid for the refurbishment of the Arnhem Gallery, the conversion of the former Green Room into the New Studio and the installation of modern digital projection equipment with Dolby Surround 7.1 in the Concert Hall.\n\nFairfield was run from 1993 to 2016 by a self-financing charity with a board of trustees. The charity was in receipt of an operating grant from Croydon Council; it was placed into administration in July 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/8203-fairfield-halls-cannot-afford-to-pay-staff-redundancy-as-the-trust-files-for-administration/story-29525101-detail/story.html |title=Fairfield Halls charity cannot afford to pay staff redundancy as trust files for administration |author=Samantha Booth |date=18 July 2016 |work=Croydon Advertiser }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===2016 redevelopment===\n\nCroydon Council, the freeholder of the land, had various plans to refurbish Fairfield over the years but none of these plans came to fruition.  In the spring of 2015 a new set of consultants led by Croydon firm [[Mott MacDonald]] was appointed by Croydon Council to deliver a \u00a312m programme on the Fairfield Halls and a separate programme for the remainder of the College Green site. Around \u00a330m would be spent on redeveloping and modernising Fairfield Halls in the period between 2016 and 2018. \n\nIn February 2016, it was confirmed that the venue would close for two years for redevelopment starting July 2016 as part of the Croydon council's plan for the cultural and educational quarter in the town centre, with new homes, offices, shops and a building for Croydon College being constructed.<ref name=\"croydon advertiser\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/13809257.Major_plans_to_transform_Fairfield_Halls_will__outdo_the_South_Bank_/ |title= Major plans to transform Fairfield Halls and 'outdo the South Bank' unveiled |date= 7 October 2015 |author= Chris Baynes |work=Croydon Guardian }}</ref> Later on the venue was scheduled to re-open by the end of March 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://developcroydon.com/fairfield-halls-set-to-reopen-fully-by-the-end-of-march-2019/ |title= Fairfield Halls set to fully reopen by the end of March 2019 |date= 15 March 2018 |work=Develop Croydon}}</ref> It is now due to re-open mid September 2019.\n\n==As a venue==\n[[File:DrupalCon London Group Photo (6072349311).jpg|thumb|The concert hall in 2011]]\nThe building's concert hall has 1,801 seats (counting the choir stalls), the [[Ashcroft Theatre]] has 755, and the Arnhem Gallery is used for standing concerts of up to 400.\n\nMany famous acts have performed at the Fairfield Halls, including [[David Bowie]], [[Elton John]], [[the Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[the Who]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Sister Sledge]], [[Morrissey]], [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[The Dubliners]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Canned Heat]], [[Taste]], [[Free (band)|Free]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Petula Clark]], [[The Stranglers]] and [[Shane Filan]] of [[Westlife]].

Recovered individuals have reached up to {{convert|4|-|4.2|m|1}} in height, and an estimated {{convert|11.3|-|15|t}} in weight. The straight-tusked elephant probably lived in small herds, flourishing in [[interglacial]] periods, when its range would extend as far as Great Britain. Isolated tusks are often found while partial or whole skeletons are rare, and there is evidence of predation by early humans. It is the ancestral species of most [[dwarf elephant]]s that inhabited islands in the [[Mediterranean]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Elephas antiquus Rom.JPG|left|thumb|Complete skeleton in Rome.]]\n''Palaeoloxodon antiquus'' was quite large, with individuals reaching {{convert|4|m|ft|1}} in height. Like other members of ''Paleoloxodon, P. antiquus'' possesses a well developed parieto-occipital crest (POC) at the top of the cranium, for anchoring the [[Splenius muscles|splenius]] as well as possibly the [[Rhomboid muscles|rhomboid]] muscles to support the large head, the largest proportionally and in absolute size among proboscideans. Two morphs of ''P. antiquus'' in Europe were previously suggested to exist in Europe based on POC variation, one more similar to ''P. namadicus'', but these were shown to be the result of [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]] variation and [[Taphonomy|taphonomic distortion]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Larramendi|first=Asier|last2=Zhang|first2=Hanwen|last3=Palombo|first3=Maria Rita|last4=Ferretti|first4=Marco P.|date=February 2020|title=The evolution of Palaeoloxodon skull structure: Disentangling phylogenetic, sexually dimorphic, ontogenetic, and allometric morphological signals|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277379119302690|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|language=en|volume=229|pages=106090|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.106090}}</ref> One approximately 40-year-old male measured about {{convert|3.81|m|ft}} tall and weighed about {{convert|11.3|t|LT ST}}, while another from Montreuil weighed about {{convert|15|t|LT ST|1}} and was about {{convert|4.2|m|ft|1}} tall.<ref name=\"proboscideans\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Larramendi | first1 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Shoulder height, body mass and shape of proboscideans | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = | publisher = | jstor = | doi = 10.4202/app.00136.2014 | url = https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app61/app001362014.pdf | format = | accessdate = }}</ref> and had long, slightly upward-curving tusks.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=R.

Its arrival is co-incides with the replacement of [[Mammuthus meridionalis|''Mammuthus meridionalis'']] by [[Mammuthus trogontherii|''Mammuthus trogontherii'']], there appears to be no overlap between ''M. meridionalis'' and ''P. antiquus'', which suggests that the latter might have outcompeted the former.

One of the earliest finds is in an approximately 600,000-year-old site near Heidelberg, the location of the early human jawbone dubbed [[Mauer 1]]. Fossils were also found washed up in a course of the [[Neckar]] river. [[Isernia#La Pineta|Isernia la Pineta]] in Italy is likely to be the same age or slightly younger. Remains of lower jaws are well documented in these three locations, alongside stone artefacts and numerous bones of rhinos, wild cattle, hippos and horses. Since the remains of the trunks do not show human markings, extinction by natural causes can not be ruled out.\n\nThe clearest proof to date that this animal was among the prey of early humans was provided in 1948 in [[Lehringen]], Germany, near the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] river. A skeleton of a straight-tusked elephant was found with a [[yew]] [[spear]] between the ribs, and [[Lithic analysis|lithic]] artifacts around the head.

Palaeoloxodon antiquus'' first appears during the early Middle Pleistocene, around 0.8-0.6 Ma, with an early occurence of around 780 kya in Italy, its earliest appearance in northern Europe is in Suffolk around 600 kya. Its arrival is co-incides with the replacement of [[Mammuthus meridionalis|''Mammuthus meridionalis'']] by [[Mammuthus trogontherii|''Mammuthus trogontherii'']], there appears to be no overlap between ''M. meridionalis'' and ''P. antiquus'', which suggests that the latter might have outcompeted the former. During ''P. antiquus'' hundreds of thousands of years of existence, it appears to not have undergone drastic morphological change unlike European mammoth populations.<ref>{{Citation|last=Lister|first=Adrian M.|title=Ecological Interactions of Elephantids in Pleistocene Eurasia:|date=2004|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264788794_Ecological_Interactions_of_elephantids_in_Pleistocene_Eurasia_Palaeoloxodon_and_Mammuthus|work=Human Paleoecology in the Levantine Corridor|volume=|pages=53\u201360|publisher=Oxbow Books|isbn=978-1-78570-965-4|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== Behaviour ==\nStraight-tusked elephants probably lived in small herds of about five to 15 individuals.<ref name=\"Goren-Inbar, N. 2001\"/> Like its recent relatives, the straight-tusked elephant would have been heavily dependent on fresh water, which greatly influenced its migration.<ref>{{cite book | last=Meller | first=Harald | title=Elefantenreich : eine Fossilwelt in Europa ; Begleitband zur Sonderausstellung im Landesmuseum f\u00fcr Vorgeschichte Halle 26.03.-03.10.2010 | publisher=Landesamt f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege und Arch\u00e4ologie Sachsen-Anhalt, Landesmuseum f\u00fcr Vorgeschichte | publication-place=Halle (Saale | year=2010 | isbn=3-939414-48-4 | oclc=642989683 | language=de | ref=harv | pages = 314\u2013321}}</ref> Its dietary habits changed depending on food supply across the seasons, browsing in spring and summer and grazing in autumn and winter.

Sites where early humans and the straight-tusked elephant appear together have been frequently documented. One of the earliest finds is in an approximately 600,000-year-old site near Heidelberg, the location of the early human jawbone dubbed [[Mauer 1]]. Fossils were also found washed up in a course of the [[Neckar]] river. [[Isernia#La Pineta|Isernia la Pineta]] in Italy is likely to be the same age or slightly younger. Remains of lower jaws are well documented in these three locations, alongside stone artefacts and numerous bones of rhinos, wild cattle, hippos and horses. Since the remains of the trunks do not show human markings, extinction by natural causes can not be ruled out.\n\nThe clearest proof to date that this animal was among the prey of early humans was provided in 1948 in [[Lehringen]], Germany, near the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] river. A skeleton of a straight-tusked elephant was found with a [[yew]] [[spear]] between the ribs, and [[Lithic analysis|lithic]] artifacts around the head.

Though both probes launched on [[Boeing]] [[Delta II]] 7925-9.5 rockets from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17]] (CCAFS SLC-17), MER-B was on the heavy version of that launch vehicle, needing the extra energy for [[Trans-Mars injection]].

The dual pads allowed for working the 15- and 21-day planetary launch periods close together; the last possible launch day for MER-A was June 19, 2003 and the first day for MER-B was June 25, 2003. [[NASA]]'s [[Launch Services Program]] managed the launch of both spacecraft.\n\n[[File:MER Timeline English 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Timeline of the Mars Exploration mission]]\nThe probes landed in January 2004 in widely separated equatorial locations on Mars.\nOn January 21, 2004, the [[Deep Space Network]] lost contact with ''Spirit'', for reasons originally thought to be related to a flare shower over [[Australia]]. The rover transmitted a message with no data, but later that day missed another communications session with the [[Mars Global Surveyor]]. The next day, [[JPL]] received a beep from the rover, indicating that it was in fault mode. On January 23, the flight team succeeded in making the rover send. The fault was believed to have been caused by an error in the rover's [[flash memory]] subsystem. The rover did not perform any scientific activities for ten days, while engineers updated its software and ran tests. The problem was corrected by reformatting ''Spirit''{{'s}} flash memory and using a [[software patch]] to avoid memory overload; ''Opportunity'' was also upgraded with the patch as a precaution. ''Spirit'' returned to full scientific operations by February 5.\n\nOn March 23, 2004, a news conference was held announcing \"major discoveries\" of evidence of past liquid water on the Martian surface. A delegation of scientists showed pictures and data revealing a stratified pattern and [[cross bedding]] in the rocks of the outcrop inside a crater in [[Meridiani Planum]], landing site of [[MER-B|MER-B, ''Opportunity'']]. This suggested that water once flowed in the region. The irregular distribution of [[chlorine]] and [[bromine]] also suggests that the place was once the shoreline of a salty sea, now evaporated.\n\nOn April 8, 2004, NASA announced that it was extending the mission life of the rovers from three to eight months. It immediately provided additional funding of US$15&nbsp;million through September, and $2.8&nbsp;million per month for continuing operations. Later that month, ''Opportunity'' arrived at [[Endurance (crater)|Endurance crater]], taking about five days to drive the 200 meters. NASA announced on September 22 that it was extending the mission life of the rovers for another six months. ''Opportunity'' was to leave Endurance crater, visit its discarded heat shield, and proceed to [[Victoria (crater)|Victoria crater]]. ''Spirit'' was to attempt to climb to the top of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]].\n\nWith the two rovers still functioning well, NASA later announced another 18-month extension of the mission to September 2006. ''Opportunity'' was to visit the \"Etched Terrain\" and ''Spirit'' was to climb a rocky slope toward the top of [[Husband Hill]]. On August 21, 2005, ''Spirit'' reached the summit of Husband Hill after 581 [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sols]] and a journey of {{convert|4.81|km|mi|sp=us}}.\n\n''Spirit'' celebrated its one Martian year anniversary (669 sols or 687 Earth days) on November 20, 2005. ''Opportunity'' celebrated its anniversary on December 12, 2005. At the beginning of the mission, it was expected that the rovers would not survive much longer than 90 Martian days. The Columbia Hills were \"just a dream\", according to rover driver Chris Leger. ''Spirit'' explored the semicircular rock formation known as [[Home Plate (Mars)|Home Plate]]. It is a layered rock outcrop that puzzles and excites scientists.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.space.com/2039-spirit-mars-rover-reaches-home-plate-formation-researchers-puzzled.html |title=Spirit Mars Rover Reaches 'Home Plate': Formation Has Researchers Puzzled |work=Space.com |access-date=May 1, 2018}}</ref> It is thought that its rocks are explosive volcanic deposits, though other possibilities exist, including impact deposits or sediment borne by wind or water.\n\n''Spirit's'' front right wheel ceased working on March 13, 2006, while the rover was moving itself to [[McCool Hill]]. Its drivers attempted to drag the dead wheel behind Spirit, but this only worked until reaching an impassable sandy area on the lower slopes. Drivers directed ''Spirit'' to a smaller sloped feature, dubbed \"Low Ridge Haven\", where it spent the long Martian winter, waiting for spring and increased solar power levels suitable for driving. That September, ''Opportunity'' reached the rim of [[Victoria crater]], and Spaceflight Now reported that NASA had extended mission for the two rovers through September 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20060927.html |title=NASA Mars Rover Arrives at Dramatic Vista on Red Planet |publisher=nasa.gov |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0609/26rovers/ |title=Mars rover, Global Surveyor, Odyssey missions extended |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}</ref> On February 6, 2007, ''Opportunity'' became the first spacecraft to traverse {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} on the surface of Mars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/images/opp-20070207.html |title=Opportunity Passes 10-Kilometer Mark |publisher=nasa.gov |accessdate=February 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\n''Opportunity'' was poised to enter Victoria Crater from its perch on the rim of Duck Bay on June 28, 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070628a.html |title=NASA Mars Rover Ready For Descent Into Crater |publisher=jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> but due to extensive dust storms, it was delayed until the dust had cleared and power returned to safe levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_opportunityAll.html#sol1220 |title=Opportunity Waiting for Dust to Settle |publisher=jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> Two months later, ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' resumed driving after hunkering down during raging dust storms that limited solar power to a level that nearly caused the permanent failure of both rovers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070824.html |title=Mars Exploration Rover Status Report: Rovers Resume Driving |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol1337 |title=Hardy Rover Continues to Celebrate Milestones |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 16, 2007}}</ref> both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' entered their fifth mission extension that extended operations into 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/071015-marsrover-extendedmission.html |title=NASA Extends Mars Rover Mission a Fifth Time |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 16, 2007}}</ref> allowing the rovers to have spent five years exploring the Martian surface, pending their continued survival.\n\nOn August 26, 2008, ''Opportunity'' began its three-day climb out of Victoria crater amidst concerns that power spikes, similar to those seen on ''Spirit'' before the failure of its right-front wheel, might prevent it from ever being able to leave the crater if a wheel failed.

It is very similar to the Mars Pathfinder in design and is approximately 2.65 [[metre|meters]] (8.7&nbsp;ft) in [[diameter]] and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, including the entry vehicle (see below).\n\nThe primary structure is aluminium with an outer ring of ribs covered by the [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, which are about {{convert|2.65|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. Divided into five sections, the solar arrays can provide up to 600 [[watt]]s of power near Earth and 300&nbsp;W at Mars.\n\nHeaters and [[multi-layer insulation]] keep the electronics \"warm\". A [[freon]] system removes heat from the flight computer and communications hardware inside the rover so they do not overheat. Cruise avionics systems allow the flight computer to interface with other electronics, such as the sun sensors, star scanner and heaters.\n\n====Navigation====\nThe star scanner (without a backup system) and [[sun sensor]] allowed the spacecraft to know its orientation in space by analyzing the position of the Sun and other stars in relation to itself. Sometimes the craft could be slightly off course; this was expected, given the 500-million-kilometer (320&nbsp;million mile) journey. Thus navigators planned up to six trajectory correction maneuvers, along with health checks.\n\nTo ensure the spacecraft arrived at Mars in the right place for its landing, two light-weight, aluminium-lined tanks carried about 31&nbsp;kg (about 68&nbsp;lb) of [[hydrazine]] [[propellant]]. Along with cruise guidance and control systems, the propellant allowed navigators to keep the spacecraft on course. Burns and pulse firings of the propellant allowed three types of maneuvers:\n* An axial burn uses pairs of thrusters to change spacecraft velocity;\n* A lateral burn uses two \"thruster clusters\" (four thrusters per cluster) to move the spacecraft \"sideways\" through seconds-long pulses;\n* Pulse mode firing uses coupled thruster pairs for spacecraft [[precession]] maneuvers (turns).\n\n====Communication====\nThe spacecraft used a high-frequency [[X band]] [[radio]] [[wavelength]] to communicate, which allowed for less power and smaller [[antenna (electronics)|antennas]] than many older craft, which used [[S band]].\n\nNavigators sent commands through two antennas on the cruise stage: a cruise [[low-gain antenna]] mounted inside the inner ring, and a cruise medium-gain antenna in the outer ring. The low-gain antenna was used close to Earth. It is omni-directional, so the transmission power that reached Earth fell faster with increasing distance. As the craft moved closer to Mars, the Sun and Earth moved closer in the sky as viewed from the craft, so less energy reached Earth. The spacecraft then switched to the medium-gain antenna, which directed the same amount of transmission power into a tighter beam toward Earth.\n\nDuring flight, the spacecraft was [[gyroscope|spin-stabilized]] with a spin rate of two [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm). Periodic updates kept antennas pointed toward Earth and solar panels toward the Sun.\n\n===Aeroshell===\n[[File:Mars Rover Aeroshell.jpg|thumb|Overview of the Mars Exploration Rover aeroshell|alt=|250x250px]]\nThe aeroshell maintained a protective covering for the lander during the seven-month voyage to Mars. Together with the lander and the rover, it constituted the \"entry vehicle\". Its main purpose was to protect the lander and the rover inside it from the intense heat of entry into the thin Martian atmosphere. It was based on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Viking designs.\n\n====Parts====\nThe aeroshell was made of two main parts: a [[heat shield]] and a backshell. The heat shield was flat and brownish, and protected the lander and rover during entry into the Martian atmosphere and acted as the first [[aerobrake]] for the spacecraft. The backshell was large, cone-shaped and painted white. It carried the [[parachute]] and several components used in later stages of entry, descent, and landing, including:\n\n* A parachute (stowed at the bottom of the backshell);\n* The backshell electronics and batteries that fire off pyrotechnic devices like separation nuts, rockets and the parachute mortar;\n* A Litton LN-200 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which monitors and reports the orientation of the backshell as it swings under the parachute;\n* Three large [[solid rocket]] motors called RAD rockets (Rocket Assisted Descent), each providing about a ton of force (10 [[kilonewton]]s) for about 60 seconds;\n* Three small solid rockets called TIRS (mounted so that they aim horizontally out the sides of the backshell) that provide a small horizontal kick to the backshell to help orient the backshell more vertically during the main RAD rocket burn.\n\n====Composition====\nBuilt by [[Lockheed Martin]] Space in Denver, Colorado, the aeroshell is made of an aluminium honeycomb structure sandwiched between [[graphite-epoxy]] face sheets. The outside of the aeroshell is covered with a layer of [[phenol]]ic honeycomb. This honeycomb is filled with an [[ablation|ablative]] material (also called an \"ablator\"), that dissipates heat generated by atmospheric friction.\n\nThe ablator itself is a unique blend of [[Cork (material)|cork]] wood, [[binder (material)|binder]] and many tiny [[silica]] glass spheres. It was invented for the heat shields flown on the Viking Mars lander missions. A similar technology was used in the first US [[manned space mission]]s [[Mercury program|Mercury]], [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]]. It was specially formulated to react chemically with the Martian atmosphere during [[atmospheric entry|entry]] and carry heat away, leaving a hot wake of gas behind the vehicle. The vehicle slowed from {{convert|19000|to|1600|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in about a minute, producing about 60&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (6 ''[[g-force|g]]'') of [[acceleration]] on the lander and rover.\n\nThe backshell and heat shield are made of the same materials, but the heat shield has a thicker, {{convert|1/2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}, layer of the ablator. Instead of being painted, the backshell was covered with a very thin aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] blanket to protect it from the cold of deep space. The blanket vaporized during entry into the Martian atmosphere.\n\n===Parachute===\n[[File:Parachute1.jpg|thumb|right|Mars Exploration Rover's parachute test]]\nThe parachute helped slow the spacecraft during entry, descent, and landing. It is located in the backshell.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\">{{cite web| url = http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_edl_parachute.html | title = Mars Exploration Rover Mission: The Mission | publisher = nasa.gov | accessdate = September 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Design====\nThe 2003 parachute design was part of a long-term Mars parachute technology development effort and is based on the designs and experience of the Viking and Pathfinder missions. The parachute for this mission is 40% larger than Pathfinder's because the largest load for the Mars Exploration Rover is 80 to 85 [[newton (units)|kilonewton]]s (kN) or {{convert|18000|to|19000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip}} when the parachute fully inflates. By comparison, Pathfinder's inflation loads were approximately 35&nbsp;kN (about 8,000&nbsp;lbf). The parachute was designed and constructed in [[South Windsor, Connecticut]] by [[Pioneer Aerospace]], the company that also designed the parachute for the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' mission.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n====Composition====\nThe parachute is made of two durable, lightweight fabrics: [[polyester]] and [[nylon]]. A triple bridle made of [[Kevlar]] connects the parachute to the backshell.\n\nThe amount of space available on the spacecraft for the parachute is so small that the parachute had to be pressure-packed. Before launch, a team tightly folded the 48 suspension lines, three bridle lines, and the parachute. The parachute team loaded the parachute in a special structure that then applied a heavy weight to the parachute package several times. Before placing the parachute into the backshell, the parachute was heat set to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] it.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n====Connected systems====\n[[File:Rocket assisted descent.jpg|right|thumb|Descent is halted by [[retrorocket]]s and lander is dropped {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the surface in this computer generated impression.]]\n'''Zylon Bridles''': After the parachute was deployed at an altitude of about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface, the heatshield was released using 6 separation nuts and push-off springs. The lander then separated from the backshell and \"rappelled\" down a metal tape on a [[centrifugal brake|centrifugal braking system]] built into one of the lander petals. The slow descent down the metal tape placed the lander in position at the end of another bridle (tether), made of a nearly {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} long braided [[Zylon]].<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\nZylon is an advanced fiber material, similar to Kevlar, that is sewn in a webbing pattern (like shoelace material) to make it stronger. The Zylon bridle provides space for airbag deployment, distance from the solid rocket motor exhaust stream, and increased stability. The bridle incorporates an electrical harness that allows the firing of the solid rockets from the backshell as well as provides data from the backshell inertial measurement unit (which measures rate and tilt of the spacecraft) to the flight computer in the rover.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n'''Rocket assisted descent (RAD)''' motors: Because the atmospheric density of Mars is less than 1% of Earth's, the parachute alone could not slow down the Mars Exploration Rover enough to ensure a safe, low landing speed. The spacecraft descent was assisted by rockets that brought the spacecraft to a dead stop {{convert|10|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Martian surface.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n'''Radar altimeter unit''': A [[radar]] [[altimeter]] unit was used to determine the distance to the Martian surface. The radar's antenna is mounted at one of the lower corners of the lander tetrahedron. When the radar measurement showed the lander was the correct distance above the surface, the Zylon bridle was cut, releasing the lander from the parachute and backshell so that it was free and clear for landing. The radar data also enabled the timing sequence on airbag inflation and backshell RAD rocket firing.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n===Airbags===\n[[File:Airbags.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's concept of inflated airbags]]\n[[Airbag]]s used in the Mars Exploration Rover mission are the same type that Mars Pathfinder used in 1997. They had to be strong enough to cushion the spacecraft if it landed on rocks or rough terrain and allow it to bounce across Mars' surface at highway speeds (about 100&nbsp;km/h) after landing. The airbags had to be inflated seconds before touchdown and deflated once safely on the ground.\n\nThe airbags were made of [[Vectran]], like those on Pathfinder. Vectran has almost twice the strength of other synthetic materials, such as Kevlar, and performs better in cold temperatures. Six 100 [[Denier (measure)|denier]] (10&nbsp;mg/m) layers of Vectran protected one or two inner bladders of Vectran in 200 denier (20&nbsp;mg/m). Using 100 denier (10&nbsp;mg/m) leaves more fabric in the outer layers where it is needed, because there are more threads in the weave.\n\nEach rover used four airbags with six lobes each, all of which were connected. Connection was important, since it helped abate some of the landing forces by keeping the bag system flexible and responsive to ground pressure. The airbags were not attached directly to the rover, but were held to it by ropes crisscrossing the bag structure. The ropes gave the bags shape, making inflation easier. While in flight, the bags were stowed along with three gas generators that are used for inflation.\n\n===Lander===\n[[File:Opportunity Lander Petals PIA04848.jpg|thumb|left|MER lander petals opening (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]\n\nThe spacecraft lander is a protective shell that houses the rover, and together with the airbags, protects it from the forces of impact.\n\nThe lander is a [[tetrahedron]] shape, whose sides open like petals. It is strong and light, and made of beams and sheets. The beams consist of layers of [[graphite]] fiber woven into a fabric that is lighter than aluminium and more rigid than steel. Titanium fittings are glued and fitted onto the beams to allow it to be bolted together. The rover was held inside the lander by [[Screw|bolts]] and special nuts that were released after landing with small explosives.\n\n====Uprighting====\nAfter the lander stopped bouncing and rolling on the ground, it came to rest on the base of the tetrahedron or one of its sides. The sides then opened to make the base horizontal and the rover upright. The sides are connected to the base by hinges, each of which has a motor strong enough to lift the lander. The rover plus lander has a [[mass]] of about 533 kilograms (1,175 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s). The rover alone has a mass of about {{convert|185|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The gravity on Mars is about 38% of Earth's, so the motor does not need to be as powerful as it would on Earth.\n\nThe rover contains [[accelerometer]]s to detect which way is down (toward the surface of Mars) by measuring the pull of gravity. The rover computer then commanded the correct lander petal to open to place the rover upright. Once the base petal was down and the rover was upright, the other two petals were opened.\n\nThe petals initially opened to an equally flat position, so all sides of the lander were straight and level. The petal motors are strong enough so that if two of the petals come to rest on rocks, the base with the rover would be held in place like a bridge above the ground. The base will hold at a level even with the height of the petals resting on rocks, making a straight flat surface throughout the length of the open, flattened lander. The flight team on Earth could then send commands to the rover to adjust the petals and create a safe path for the rover to drive off the lander and onto the Martian surface without dropping off a steep rock.\n\n====Moving the payload onto Mars====\n[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|''Spirit'''s lander on Mars]]\nThe moving of the rover off the lander is called the egress phase of the mission. The rover must avoid having its wheels caught in the airbag material or falling off a sharp incline. To help this, a retraction system on the petals slowly drags the airbags toward the lander before the petals open. Small ramps on the petals fan out to fill spaces between the petals. They cover uneven terrain, rock obstacles, and airbag material, and form a circular area from which the rover can drive off in more directions. They also lower the step that the rover must climb down. They are nicknamed \"batwings\", and are made of Vectran cloth.\n\nAbout three hours were allotted to retract the airbags and deploy the lander petals.\n\n==Rover design==\n[[File:Mars Exploration Rover.stl|thumb|Interactive 3D model of the MER]]\nThe rovers are six-wheeled, solar-powered robots that stand {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. They weigh {{convert|180|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|35|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of which is the wheel and suspension system.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://hobbiton.thisside.net/rovermanual/| title = MER Technical Data | accessdate = July 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Drive system===\n[[File:NASA MER FLEXURE WHEEL.jpg|right|thumb|Drive wheel from the Mars Exploration Rovers, with integral suspension [[flexure]]s.]]\nEach rover has six wheels mounted on a [[rocker-bogie]] suspension system that ensures wheels remain on the ground while driving over rough terrain. The design reduces the range of motion of the rover body by half, and allows the rover to go over obstacles or through holes that are more than a wheel diameter ({{convert|250|mm|in|sp=us}}) in size. The rover wheels are designed with integral compliant [[flexure]]s which provide shock absorption during movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/wheels01.html |title= Wheels in the Sky |website=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |access-date=February 14, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, the wheels have cleats which provide grip for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks.\n\nEach wheel has its own drive motor. The two front and two rear wheels each have individual steering motors. This allows the vehicle to turn in place, a full revolution, and to swerve and curve, making arching turns. The motors for the rovers have been designed by the Swiss company [[Maxon Motor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storkdrives.com/2017/07/nasa-relies-maxon-technology/ |title= Once again, NASA relies on maxon technology |website=Maxon Motor|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref> The rover is designed to withstand a tilt of 45 degrees in any direction without overturning. However, the rover is programmed through its \"fault protection limits\" in its hazard avoidance software to avoid exceeding tilts of 30 degrees.\n\nEach rover can spin one of its front wheels in place to grind deep into the terrain. It is to remain motionless while the digging wheel is spinning. The rovers have a top speed on flat hard ground of 50&nbsp;mm/s (2 in/s). The average speed is 10&nbsp;mm/s, because its hazard avoidance software causes it to stop every 10 seconds for 20 seconds to observe and understand the terrain into which it has driven.\n\n===Power and electronic systems===\n{{See also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}\n[[File:MER vs. Sojourner PIA04827.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mars Exploration Rover (rear) vs. [[Mars Pathfinder|''Sojourner'']] rover (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]\n[[File:PIA23244-MER-Rovers-AssemblyRoom-20030210.jpg|thumb|left|200px|MER rovers - assembly room (February 10, 2003)]]\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|Circular projection showing MER-A ''Spirit''{{'s}} solar panels covered in dust in October 2007 on Mars.

This was due to anticipated dust coverage on the solar arrays, and the change in season. Over three Earth years later, however, the rovers' power supplies hovered between 300 [[watt-hour]]s and 900 watt-hours per day, depending on dust coverage. Cleaning events (dust removal by wind) have occurred more often than NASA expected, keeping the arrays relatively free of dust and extending the life of the mission. During a 2007 global dust storm on Mars, both rovers experienced some of the lowest power of the mission; ''Opportunity'' dipped to 128 watt-hours. In November 2008, ''Spirit'' had overtaken this low-energy record with a production of 89 watt-hours, due to dust storms in the region of Gusev crater.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6909656.stm|accessdate=July 22, 2007|title=Mars dust storms threaten rovers | work=BBC News | date=July 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe rovers run a [[VxWorks]] [[embedded operating system]] on a [[Radiation hardened|radiation-hardened]] 20 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[RAD6000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] with 128 [[megabyte|MB]] of [[DRAM]] with error detection and correction and 3 MB of [[EEPROM]]. Each rover also has 256 MB of [[flash memory]]. To survive during the various mission phases, the rover's vital instruments must stay within a temperature of \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to +40&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F to 104&nbsp;\u00b0F). At night, the rovers are heated by eight [[radioisotope heater units]] (RHU), which each continuously generate 1 [[watt|W]] of thermal energy from the decay of [[radioisotope]]s, along with electrical heaters that operate only when necessary. A sputtered gold film and a layer of [[silica]] [[aerogel]] are used for insulation.\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:MER Pancam.JPG|thumb|right|Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA)]]\n[[File:MER Rock Abrasion Tool.JPG|thumb|right|Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT)]]\n[[File:MER APXS PIA05113.jpg|thumb|[[Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]] (APXS) (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]\n\nThe rover has an [[X band]] [[low-gain antenna|low-gain]] and an X band [[high-gain antenna]] for communications to and from the Earth, as well as an [[ultra high frequency]] monopole antenna for relay communications.

The high-gain antenna is directional and steerable, and can transmit data to Earth at a higher rate. The rovers use the UHF monopole and its CE505 radio to communicate with spacecraft orbiting Mars, the [[Mars Odyssey]] and (before its failure) the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] (already more than 7.6 [[terabit]]s of data were transferred using its Mars Relay antenna and [[Mars Orbiter Camera]]'s memory buffer of 12 MB).<ref name=\"malin\">{{cite journal|first1=Michael C. |last1=Malin |first2=Kenneth S. |last2=Edgett |first3=Bruce A. |last3=Cantor |first4=Michael A. |last4=Caplinger |author5=G.

Most of the lander data is relayed to Earth through Odyssey and MRO. The orbiters can receive rover signals at a much higher data rate than the Deep Space Network can, due to the much shorter distances from rover to orbiter. The orbiters then quickly relay the rover data to the Earth using their large and [[Signal strength|high-powered]] antennas.\n\nEach rover has nine cameras, which produce 1024-pixel by 1024-pixel images at 12 bits per pixel,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050123032851/http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-155/155J.pdf]</ref> but most navigation camera images and image thumbnails are truncated to 8 bits per pixel to conserve memory and transmission time. All images are then compressed using [[ICER]] before being stored and sent to Earth. Navigation, thumbnail, and many other image types are compressed to approximately 0.8 to 1.1 bits/pixel. Lower bit rates (less than 0.5-bit/pixel) are used for certain wavelengths of multi-color panoramic images.\n\nICER is based on [[wavelets]], and was designed specifically for deep-space applications. It produces progressive compression, both lossless and lossy, and incorporates an error-containment scheme to limit the effects of data loss on the deep-space channel. It outperforms the lossy JPEG image compressor and the lossless Rice compressor used by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission.\n\n===Scientific instrumentation===\nThe rover has various instruments. Three are mounted on the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA):\n* Panoramic Cameras ([[Pancam]]), two cameras with color filter wheels for determining the texture, color, [[mineralogy]], and structure of the local terrain.\n* Navigation Cameras ([[Navcam]]), two cameras that have larger fields of view but lower resolution and are monochromatic, for navigation and driving.\n* A periscope assembly for the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer ([[Mini-TES]]), which identifies promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and determines the processes that formed them. The Mini-TES was built by [[Arizona State University]]. The periscope assembly features two beryllium fold mirrors, a shroud that closes to minimize dust contamination in the assembly, and stray-light rejection baffles that are strategically placed within the graphite epoxy tubes.\n\nThe cameras are mounted 1.5 meters high on the Pancam Mast Assembly. The PMA is deployed via the Mast Deployment Drive (MDD). The Azimuth Drive, mounted directly above the MDD, turns the assembly horizontally a whole revolution with signals transmitted through a rolling tape configuration. The camera drive points the cameras in elevation, almost straight up or down. A third motor points the Mini-TES fold mirrors and protective shroud, up to 30\u00b0 above the horizon and 50\u00b0 below. The PMA's conceptual design was done by Jason Suchman at JPL, the Cognizant Engineer who later served as Contract Technical Manager (CTM) once the assembly was built by [[Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.]], [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Raul Romero served as CTM once subsystem-level testing began. Satish Krishnan did the conceptual design of the High-Gain Antenna Gimbal (HGAG), whose detailed design, assembly, and test was also performed by Ball Aerospace at which point Satish acted as the CTM.\n\nFour monochromatic hazard cameras ([[Hazcam]]s) are mounted on the rover's body, two in front and two behind.\n\nThe instrument deployment device (IDD), also called the rover arm, holds the following:\n* [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer]] (MB) [[MIMOS II]], developed by Dr. G\u00f6star Klingelh\u00f6fer at the [[Johannes Gutenberg]] University in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]], is used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils.<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title= The miniaturized M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer MIMOS II for extraterrestrial and outdoor terrestrial applications: A status report\n|author1=Klingelh\u00f6fer G. |author2=Bernhardt But. |author3=Foh J. |author4=Bonnes U. |author5=Rodionov D. |author6=De Souza P.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium.

The dual pads allowed for working the 15- and 21-day planetary launch periods close together; the last possible launch day for MER-A was June 19, 2003 and the first day for MER-B was June 25, 2003. [[NASA]]'s [[Launch Services Program]] managed the launch of both spacecraft.\n\n[[File:MER Timeline English 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Timeline of the Mars Exploration mission]]\nThe probes landed in January 2004 in widely separated equatorial locations on Mars.\nOn January 21, 2004, the [[Deep Space Network]] lost contact with ''Spirit'', for reasons originally thought to be related to a flare shower over [[Australia]]. The rover transmitted a message with no data, but later that day missed another communications session with the [[Mars Global Surveyor]]. The next day, [[JPL]] received a beep from the rover, indicating that it was in fault mode. On January 23, the flight team succeeded in making the rover send. The fault was believed to have been caused by an error in the rover's [[flash memory]] subsystem. The rover did not perform any scientific activities for ten days, while engineers updated its software and ran tests. The problem was corrected by reformatting ''Spirit''{{'s}} flash memory and using a [[software patch]] to avoid memory overload; ''Opportunity'' was also upgraded with the patch as a precaution. ''Spirit'' returned to full scientific operations by February 5.\n\nOn March 23, 2004, a news conference was held announcing \"major discoveries\" of evidence of past liquid water on the Martian surface. A delegation of scientists showed pictures and data revealing a stratified pattern and [[cross bedding]] in the rocks of the outcrop inside a crater in [[Meridiani Planum]], landing site of [[MER-B|MER-B, ''Opportunity'']]. This suggested that water once flowed in the region. The irregular distribution of [[chlorine]] and [[bromine]] also suggests that the place was once the shoreline of a salty sea, now evaporated.\n\nOn April 8, 2004, NASA announced that it was extending the mission life of the rovers from three to eight months. It immediately provided additional funding of US$15&nbsp;million through September, and $2.8&nbsp;million per month for continuing operations. Later that month, ''Opportunity'' arrived at [[Endurance (crater)|Endurance crater]], taking about five days to drive the 200 meters. NASA announced on September 22 that it was extending the mission life of the rovers for another six months. ''Opportunity'' was to leave Endurance crater, visit its discarded heat shield, and proceed to [[Victoria (crater)|Victoria crater]]. ''Spirit'' was to attempt to climb to the top of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]].\n\nWith the two rovers still functioning well, NASA later announced another 18-month extension of the mission to September 2006. ''Opportunity'' was to visit the \"Etched Terrain\" and ''Spirit'' was to climb a rocky slope toward the top of [[Husband Hill]]. On August 21, 2005, ''Spirit'' reached the summit of Husband Hill after 581 [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sols]] and a journey of {{convert|4.81|km|mi|sp=us}}.\n\n''Spirit'' celebrated its one Martian year anniversary (669 sols or 687 Earth days) on November 20, 2005. ''Opportunity'' celebrated its anniversary on December 12, 2005. At the beginning of the mission, it was expected that the rovers would not survive much longer than 90 Martian days. The Columbia Hills were \"just a dream\", according to rover driver Chris Leger. ''Spirit'' explored the semicircular rock formation known as [[Home Plate (Mars)|Home Plate]]. It is a layered rock outcrop that puzzles and excites scientists.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.space.com/2039-spirit-mars-rover-reaches-home-plate-formation-researchers-puzzled.html |title=Spirit Mars Rover Reaches 'Home Plate': Formation Has Researchers Puzzled |work=Space.com |access-date=May 1, 2018}}</ref> It is thought that its rocks are explosive volcanic deposits, though other possibilities exist, including impact deposits or sediment borne by wind or water.\n\n''Spirit's'' front right wheel ceased working on March 13, 2006, while the rover was moving itself to [[McCool Hill]]. Its drivers attempted to drag the dead wheel behind Spirit, but this only worked until reaching an impassable sandy area on the lower slopes. Drivers directed ''Spirit'' to a smaller sloped feature, dubbed \"Low Ridge Haven\", where it spent the long Martian winter, waiting for spring and increased solar power levels suitable for driving.

It is very similar to the Mars Pathfinder in design and is approximately 2.65 [[metre|meters]] (8.7&nbsp;ft) in [[diameter]] and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, including the entry vehicle (see below).\n\nThe primary structure is aluminium with an outer ring of ribs covered by the [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, which are about {{convert|2.65|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. Divided into five sections, the solar arrays can provide up to 600 [[watt]]s of power near Earth and 300&nbsp;W at Mars.\n\nHeaters and [[multi-layer insulation]] keep the electronics \"warm\". A [[freon]] system removes heat from the flight computer and communications hardware inside the rover so they do not overheat. Cruise avionics systems allow the flight computer to interface with other electronics, such as the sun sensors, star scanner and heaters.\n\n====Navigation====\nThe star scanner (without a backup system) and [[sun sensor]] allowed the spacecraft to know its orientation in space by analyzing the position of the Sun and other stars in relation to itself. Sometimes the craft could be slightly off course; this was expected, given the 500-million-kilometer (320&nbsp;million mile) journey. Thus navigators planned up to six trajectory correction maneuvers, along with health checks.\n\nTo ensure the spacecraft arrived at Mars in the right place for its landing, two light-weight, aluminium-lined tanks carried about 31&nbsp;kg (about 68&nbsp;lb) of [[hydrazine]] [[propellant]]. Along with cruise guidance and control systems, the propellant allowed navigators to keep the spacecraft on course. Burns and pulse firings of the propellant allowed three types of maneuvers:\n* An axial burn uses pairs of thrusters to change spacecraft velocity;\n* A lateral burn uses two \"thruster clusters\" (four thrusters per cluster) to move the spacecraft \"sideways\" through seconds-long pulses;\n* Pulse mode firing uses coupled thruster pairs for spacecraft [[precession]] maneuvers (turns).\n\n====Communication====\nThe spacecraft used a high-frequency [[X band]] [[radio]] [[wavelength]] to communicate, which allowed for less power and smaller [[antenna (electronics)|antennas]] than many older craft, which used [[S band]].\n\nNavigators sent commands through two antennas on the cruise stage: a cruise [[low-gain antenna]] mounted inside the inner ring, and a cruise medium-gain antenna in the outer ring. The low-gain antenna was used close to Earth. It is omni-directional, so the transmission power that reached Earth fell faster with increasing distance. As the craft moved closer to Mars, the Sun and Earth moved closer in the sky as viewed from the craft, so less energy reached Earth. The spacecraft then switched to the medium-gain antenna, which directed the same amount of transmission power into a tighter beam toward Earth.\n\nDuring flight, the spacecraft was [[gyroscope|spin-stabilized]] with a spin rate of two [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm). Periodic updates kept antennas pointed toward Earth and solar panels toward the Sun.\n\n===Aeroshell===\n[[File:Mars Rover Aeroshell.jpg|thumb|Overview of the Mars Exploration Rover aeroshell|alt=|250x250px]]\nThe aeroshell maintained a protective covering for the lander during the seven-month voyage to Mars. Together with the lander and the rover, it constituted the \"entry vehicle\". Its main purpose was to protect the lander and the rover inside it from the intense heat of entry into the thin Martian atmosphere. It was based on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Viking designs.\n\n====Parts====\nThe aeroshell was made of two main parts: a [[heat shield]] and a backshell. The heat shield was flat and brownish, and protected the lander and rover during entry into the Martian atmosphere and acted as the first [[aerobrake]] for the spacecraft. The backshell was large, cone-shaped and painted white. It carried the [[parachute]] and several components used in later stages of entry, descent, and landing, including:\n\n* A parachute (stowed at the bottom of the backshell);\n* The backshell electronics and batteries that fire off pyrotechnic devices like separation nuts, rockets and the parachute mortar;\n* A Litton LN-200 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which monitors and reports the orientation of the backshell as it swings under the parachute;\n* Three large [[solid rocket]] motors called RAD rockets (Rocket Assisted Descent), each providing about a ton of force (10 [[kilonewton]]s) for about 60 seconds;\n* Three small solid rockets called TIRS (mounted so that they aim horizontally out the sides of the backshell) that provide a small horizontal kick to the backshell to help orient the backshell more vertically during the main RAD rocket burn.\n\n====Composition====\nBuilt by [[Lockheed Martin]] Space in Denver, Colorado, the aeroshell is made of an aluminium honeycomb structure sandwiched between [[graphite-epoxy]] face sheets. The outside of the aeroshell is covered with a layer of [[phenol]]ic honeycomb. This honeycomb is filled with an [[ablation|ablative]] material (also called an \"ablator\"), that dissipates heat generated by atmospheric friction.\n\nThe ablator itself is a unique blend of [[Cork (material)|cork]] wood, [[binder (material)|binder]] and many tiny [[silica]] glass spheres. It was invented for the heat shields flown on the Viking Mars lander missions. A similar technology was used in the first US [[manned space mission]]s [[Mercury program|Mercury]], [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]]. It was specially formulated to react chemically with the Martian atmosphere during [[atmospheric entry|entry]] and carry heat away, leaving a hot wake of gas behind the vehicle. The vehicle slowed from {{convert|19000|to|1600|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in about a minute, producing about 60&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (6 ''[[g-force|g]]'') of [[acceleration]] on the lander and rover.\n\nThe backshell and heat shield are made of the same materials, but the heat shield has a thicker, {{convert|1/2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}, layer of the ablator. Instead of being painted, the backshell was covered with a very thin aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] blanket to protect it from the cold of deep space. The blanket vaporized during entry into the Martian atmosphere.\n\n===Parachute===\n[[File:Parachute1.jpg|thumb|right|Mars Exploration Rover's parachute test]]\nThe parachute helped slow the spacecraft during entry, descent, and landing. It is located in the backshell.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\">{{cite web| url = http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_edl_parachute.html | title = Mars Exploration Rover Mission: The Mission | publisher = nasa.gov | accessdate = September 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Design====\nThe 2003 parachute design was part of a long-term Mars parachute technology development effort and is based on the designs and experience of the Viking and Pathfinder missions. The parachute for this mission is 40% larger than Pathfinder's because the largest load for the Mars Exploration Rover is 80 to 85 [[newton (units)|kilonewton]]s (kN) or {{convert|18000|to|19000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip}} when the parachute fully inflates. By comparison, Pathfinder's inflation loads were approximately 35&nbsp;kN (about 8,000&nbsp;lbf). The parachute was designed and constructed in [[South Windsor, Connecticut]] by [[Pioneer Aerospace]], the company that also designed the parachute for the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' mission.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n====Composition====\nThe parachute is made of two durable, lightweight fabrics: [[polyester]] and [[nylon]]. A triple bridle made of [[Kevlar]] connects the parachute to the backshell.\n\nThe amount of space available on the spacecraft for the parachute is so small that the parachute had to be pressure-packed. Before launch, a team tightly folded the 48 suspension lines, three bridle lines, and the parachute. The parachute team loaded the parachute in a special structure that then applied a heavy weight to the parachute package several times. Before placing the parachute into the backshell, the parachute was heat set to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] it.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n====Connected systems====\n[[File:Rocket assisted descent.jpg|right|thumb|Descent is halted by [[retrorocket]]s and lander is dropped {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the surface in this computer generated impression.]]\n'''Zylon Bridles''': After the parachute was deployed at an altitude of about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface, the heatshield was released using 6 separation nuts and push-off springs. The lander then separated from the backshell and \"rappelled\" down a metal tape on a [[centrifugal brake|centrifugal braking system]] built into one of the lander petals. The slow descent down the metal tape placed the lander in position at the end of another bridle (tether), made of a nearly {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} long braided [[Zylon]].<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\nZylon is an advanced fiber material, similar to Kevlar, that is sewn in a webbing pattern (like shoelace material) to make it stronger. The Zylon bridle provides space for airbag deployment, distance from the solid rocket motor exhaust stream, and increased stability. The bridle incorporates an electrical harness that allows the firing of the solid rockets from the backshell as well as provides data from the backshell inertial measurement unit (which measures rate and tilt of the spacecraft) to the flight computer in the rover.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n'''Rocket assisted descent (RAD)''' motors: Because the atmospheric density of Mars is less than 1% of Earth's, the parachute alone could not slow down the Mars Exploration Rover enough to ensure a safe, low landing speed. The spacecraft descent was assisted by rockets that brought the spacecraft to a dead stop {{convert|10|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Martian surface.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n'''Radar altimeter unit''': A [[radar]] [[altimeter]] unit was used to determine the distance to the Martian surface. The radar's antenna is mounted at one of the lower corners of the lander tetrahedron. When the radar measurement showed the lander was the correct distance above the surface, the Zylon bridle was cut, releasing the lander from the parachute and backshell so that it was free and clear for landing. The radar data also enabled the timing sequence on airbag inflation and backshell RAD rocket firing.<ref name=\"nasa_expl_rover_mission\"/>\n\n===Airbags===\n[[File:Airbags.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's concept of inflated airbags]]\n[[Airbag]]s used in the Mars Exploration Rover mission are the same type that Mars Pathfinder used in 1997. They had to be strong enough to cushion the spacecraft if it landed on rocks or rough terrain and allow it to bounce across Mars' surface at highway speeds (about 100&nbsp;km/h) after landing. The airbags had to be inflated seconds before touchdown and deflated once safely on the ground.\n\nThe airbags were made of [[Vectran]], like those on Pathfinder. Vectran has almost twice the strength of other synthetic materials, such as Kevlar, and performs better in cold temperatures. Six 100 [[Denier (measure)|denier]] (10&nbsp;mg/m) layers of Vectran protected one or two inner bladders of Vectran in 200 denier (20&nbsp;mg/m). Using 100 denier (10&nbsp;mg/m) leaves more fabric in the outer layers where it is needed, because there are more threads in the weave.\n\nEach rover used four airbags with six lobes each, all of which were connected. Connection was important, since it helped abate some of the landing forces by keeping the bag system flexible and responsive to ground pressure. The airbags were not attached directly to the rover, but were held to it by ropes crisscrossing the bag structure. The ropes gave the bags shape, making inflation easier. While in flight, the bags were stowed along with three gas generators that are used for inflation.\n\n===Lander===\n[[File:Opportunity Lander Petals PIA04848.jpg|thumb|left|MER lander petals opening (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]\n\nThe spacecraft lander is a protective shell that houses the rover, and together with the airbags, protects it from the forces of impact.\n\nThe lander is a [[tetrahedron]] shape, whose sides open like petals. It is strong and light, and made of beams and sheets. The beams consist of layers of [[graphite]] fiber woven into a fabric that is lighter than aluminium and more rigid than steel. Titanium fittings are glued and fitted onto the beams to allow it to be bolted together. The rover was held inside the lander by [[Screw|bolts]] and special nuts that were released after landing with small explosives.\n\n====Uprighting====\nAfter the lander stopped bouncing and rolling on the ground, it came to rest on the base of the tetrahedron or one of its sides. The sides then opened to make the base horizontal and the rover upright. The sides are connected to the base by hinges, each of which has a motor strong enough to lift the lander. The rover plus lander has a [[mass]] of about 533 kilograms (1,175 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s). The rover alone has a mass of about {{convert|185|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The gravity on Mars is about 38% of Earth's, so the motor does not need to be as powerful as it would on Earth.\n\nThe rover contains [[accelerometer]]s to detect which way is down (toward the surface of Mars) by measuring the pull of gravity. The rover computer then commanded the correct lander petal to open to place the rover upright. Once the base petal was down and the rover was upright, the other two petals were opened.\n\nThe petals initially opened to an equally flat position, so all sides of the lander were straight and level. The petal motors are strong enough so that if two of the petals come to rest on rocks, the base with the rover would be held in place like a bridge above the ground. The base will hold at a level even with the height of the petals resting on rocks, making a straight flat surface throughout the length of the open, flattened lander. The flight team on Earth could then send commands to the rover to adjust the petals and create a safe path for the rover to drive off the lander and onto the Martian surface without dropping off a steep rock.\n\n====Moving the payload onto Mars====\n[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|''Spirit'''s lander on Mars]]\nThe moving of the rover off the lander is called the egress phase of the mission. The rover must avoid having its wheels caught in the airbag material or falling off a sharp incline. To help this, a retraction system on the petals slowly drags the airbags toward the lander before the petals open. Small ramps on the petals fan out to fill spaces between the petals. They cover uneven terrain, rock obstacles, and airbag material, and form a circular area from which the rover can drive off in more directions. They also lower the step that the rover must climb down. They are nicknamed \"batwings\", and are made of Vectran cloth.\n\nAbout three hours were allotted to retract the airbags and deploy the lander petals.\n\n==Rover design==\n[[File:Mars Exploration Rover.stl|thumb|Interactive 3D model of the MER]]\nThe rovers are six-wheeled, solar-powered robots that stand {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

The design reduces the range of motion of the rover body by half, and allows the rover to go over obstacles or through holes that are more than a wheel diameter ({{convert|250|mm|in|sp=us}}) in size. The rover wheels are designed with integral compliant [[flexure]]s which provide shock absorption during movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/wheels01.html |title= Wheels in the Sky |website=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |access-date=February 14, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, the wheels have cleats which provide grip for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks.\n\nEach wheel has its own drive motor. The two front and two rear wheels each have individual steering motors. This allows the vehicle to turn in place, a full revolution, and to swerve and curve, making arching turns. The motors for the rovers have been designed by the Swiss company [[Maxon Motor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storkdrives.com/2017/07/nasa-relies-maxon-technology/ |title= Once again, NASA relies on maxon technology |website=Maxon Motor|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref> The rover is designed to withstand a tilt of 45 degrees in any direction without overturning. However, the rover is programmed through its \"fault protection limits\" in its hazard avoidance software to avoid exceeding tilts of 30 degrees.\n\nEach rover can spin one of its front wheels in place to grind deep into the terrain. It is to remain motionless while the digging wheel is spinning. The rovers have a top speed on flat hard ground of 50&nbsp;mm/s (2 in/s). The average speed is 10&nbsp;mm/s, because its hazard avoidance software causes it to stop every 10 seconds for 20 seconds to observe and understand the terrain into which it has driven.\n\n===Power and electronic systems===\n{{See also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}\n[[File:MER vs. Sojourner PIA04827.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mars Exploration Rover (rear) vs. [[Mars Pathfinder|''Sojourner'']] rover (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]\n[[File:PIA23244-MER-Rovers-AssemblyRoom-20030210.jpg|thumb|left|200px|MER rovers - assembly room (February 10, 2003)]]\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|Circular projection showing MER-A ''Spirit''{{'s}} solar panels covered in dust in October 2007 on Mars.

This was due to anticipated dust coverage on the solar arrays, and the change in season. Over three Earth years later, however, the rovers' power supplies hovered between 300 [[watt-hour]]s and 900 watt-hours per day, depending on dust coverage. Cleaning events (dust removal by wind) have occurred more often than NASA expected, keeping the arrays relatively free of dust and extending the life of the mission. During a 2007 global dust storm on Mars, both rovers experienced some of the lowest power of the mission; ''Opportunity'' dipped to 128 watt-hours. In November 2008, ''Spirit'' had overtaken this low-energy record with a production of 89 watt-hours, due to dust storms in the region of Gusev crater.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6909656.stm|accessdate=July 22, 2007|title=Mars dust storms threaten rovers | work=BBC News | date=July 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe rovers run a [[VxWorks]] [[embedded operating system]] on a [[Radiation hardened|radiation-hardened]] 20 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[RAD6000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] with 128 [[megabyte|MB]] of [[DRAM]] with error detection and correction and 3 MB of [[EEPROM]].

At night, the rovers are heated by eight [[radioisotope heater units]] (RHU), which each continuously generate 1 [[watt|W]] of thermal energy from the decay of [[radioisotope]]s, along with electrical heaters that operate only when necessary.

The high-gain antenna is directional and steerable, and can transmit data to Earth at a higher rate. The rovers use the UHF monopole and its CE505 radio to communicate with spacecraft orbiting Mars, the [[Mars Odyssey]] and (before its failure) the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] (already more than 7.6 [[terabit]]s of data were transferred using its Mars Relay antenna and [[Mars Orbiter Camera]]'s memory buffer of 12 MB).<ref name=\"malin\">{{cite journal|first1=Michael C. |last1=Malin |first2=Kenneth S. |last2=Edgett |first3=Bruce A. |last3=Cantor |first4=Michael A. |last4=Caplinger |author5=G.

Most of the lander data is relayed to Earth through Odyssey and MRO. The orbiters can receive rover signals at a much higher data rate than the Deep Space Network can, due to the much shorter distances from rover to orbiter. The orbiters then quickly relay the rover data to the Earth using their large and [[Signal strength|high-powered]] antennas.\n\nEach rover has nine cameras, which produce 1024-pixel by 1024-pixel images at 12 bits per pixel,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050123032851/http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-155/155J.pdf]</ref> but most navigation camera images and image thumbnails are truncated to 8 bits per pixel to conserve memory and transmission time. All images are then compressed using [[ICER]] before being stored and sent to Earth. Navigation, thumbnail, and many other image types are compressed to approximately 0.8 to 1.1 bits/pixel. Lower bit rates (less than 0.5-bit/pixel) are used for certain wavelengths of multi-color panoramic images.\n\nICER is based on [[wavelets]], and was designed specifically for deep-space applications. It produces progressive compression, both lossless and lossy, and incorporates an error-containment scheme to limit the effects of data loss on the deep-space channel. It outperforms the lossy JPEG image compressor and the lossless Rice compressor used by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission.\n\n===Scientific instrumentation===\nThe rover has various instruments. Three are mounted on the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA):\n* Panoramic Cameras ([[Pancam]]), two cameras with color filter wheels for determining the texture, color, [[mineralogy]], and structure of the local terrain.\n* Navigation Cameras ([[Navcam]]), two cameras that have larger fields of view but lower resolution and are monochromatic, for navigation and driving.\n* A periscope assembly for the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer ([[Mini-TES]]), which identifies promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and determines the processes that formed them. The Mini-TES was built by [[Arizona State University]]. The periscope assembly features two beryllium fold mirrors, a shroud that closes to minimize dust contamination in the assembly, and stray-light rejection baffles that are strategically placed within the graphite epoxy tubes.\n\nThe cameras are mounted 1.5 meters high on the Pancam Mast Assembly. The PMA is deployed via the Mast Deployment Drive (MDD). The Azimuth Drive, mounted directly above the MDD, turns the assembly horizontally a whole revolution with signals transmitted through a rolling tape configuration. The camera drive points the cameras in elevation, almost straight up or down. A third motor points the Mini-TES fold mirrors and protective shroud, up to 30\u00b0 above the horizon and 50\u00b0 below. The PMA's conceptual design was done by Jason Suchman at JPL, the Cognizant Engineer who later served as Contract Technical Manager (CTM) once the assembly was built by [[Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.]], [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Raul Romero served as CTM once subsystem-level testing began. Satish Krishnan did the conceptual design of the High-Gain Antenna Gimbal (HGAG), whose detailed design, assembly, and test was also performed by Ball Aerospace at which point Satish acted as the CTM.\n\nFour monochromatic hazard cameras ([[Hazcam]]s) are mounted on the rover's body, two in front and two behind.\n\nThe instrument deployment device (IDD), also called the rover arm, holds the following:\n* [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer]] (MB) [[MIMOS II]], developed by Dr. G\u00f6star Klingelh\u00f6fer at the [[Johannes Gutenberg]] University in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]], is used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils.<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title= The miniaturized M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer MIMOS II for extraterrestrial and outdoor terrestrial applications: A status report\n|author1=Klingelh\u00f6fer G. |author2=Bernhardt But. |author3=Foh J. |author4=Bonnes U. |author5=Rodionov D. |author6=De Souza P.

This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates.\n\nThe Clovis group is especially interesting because the [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer]] (MB) detected [[goethite]] in it.<ref>Klingelhofer, G., et al. (2005) Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXVI abstr. 2349</ref> Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks.

Geophys. Res.: 111</ref>  Olivine is a marker for the lack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form.\nWishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.\nOne type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and iron.<ref>Ming, D., et al. 2006 Geochemical and mineralogical indicators for aqueous processes in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater, Mars. J. Geophys. Res.111</ref>\nAlso, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe<sup>3+</sup> form.\nTowards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil. The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.<ref name=\"nasa4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html |title=NASA - Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past |publisher=nasa.gov|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Spirit'' stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n===''Opportunity'' Landing Site, Meridiani Planum===\n[[File:PIA17759-MarsOpportunityRover-SelfPortrait-20140106.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait of [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] near [[Endeavour (crater)|Endeavour Crater]] on the surface of [[Mars]] (January 6, 2014).]]\n[[File:PIA21497capetrib.jpg|thumb|[[Cape Tribulation (Mars)|Cape Tribulation]] southern end, as seen in 2017 by ''Opportunity'' rover]]\nThe ''Opportunity'' rover landed in a small crater, dubbed \"Eagle\", on the flat plains of Meridiani. The plains of the landing site were characterized by the presence of a large number of small [[Martian spherules|spherules]], spherical [[concretion]]s that were tagged \"blueberries\" by the science team, which were found both loose on the surface, and also embedded in the rock. These proved to have a high concentration of the mineral [[hematite]], and showed the signature of being formed in an aqueous environment. The layered bedrock revealed in the crater walls showed signs of being sedimentary in nature, and compositional and microscopic-imagery analysis showed this to be primarily with composition of [[Jarosite]], a ferrous sulfate mineral that is characteristically an [[evaporite]] that is the residue from the evaporation of a salty pond or sea.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Squyres S. | year = 2004 | title = The Opportunity Rover's Athena Science Investigation At Meridiani Planum, Mars | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702| pages = 1698\u20131703 | doi=10.1126/science.1106171 | pmid=15576602|display-authors=etal| bibcode=2004Sci...306.1698S}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Squyres S. | year = 2006 | title = Overview of the Opportunity Mars Exploration Rover Mission to Meridiani Planum: Eagle Crater to Purgatory Dune | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 111 | issue = E12| pages = E12S12 | doi=10.1029/2006je002771 | bibcode=2006JGRE..11112S12S|display-authors=etal| hdl = 1893/17165 }}</ref>\n\nThe mission has provided substantial evidence of past water activity on Mars. In addition to investigating the \"water hypothesis\", ''Opportunity'' has also obtained astronomical observations and atmospheric data.\nThe extended mission took the rover across the plains to a series of larger craters in the south, with the arrival at the edge of a 25-km diameter crater, Endeavour Crater, eight years after landing. The orbital spectroscopy of this crater rim show the signs of [[phyllosilicate]] rocks, indicative of older sedimentary deposits.\n\n==Landing locations==\n{{Features and artificial objects on Mars}}\n\n==Glossary==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*'''APXS''': Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer\n*'''DSCC''': Deep Space Communications Center\n*'''DSN''': Deep Space Network\n*'''DTS''': Dead Time Start\n*'''ERT''': Earth-received time, UTC of an event\n*'''FSW''': flight software\n*'''HGA''': High Gain Antenna\n*'''LGA''': Low Gain Antenna\n*'''MER''': Mars Exploration Rover\n*'''MSL''': Mars Science Laboratory\n*'''Mini-TES''':Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer\n*'''NASA''': National Aeronautics and Space Administration (USA)\n*'''Navcam''': Navigation camera\n*'''Pancam''': Panoramic camera\n*'''RAT''': Rock Abrasion Tool\n*'''RCS''': Reaction Control System\n{{refend}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons|Mars Exploration Rover}}\n* [[Aeolis quadrangle]]\n* [[Astrogeology Research Program]] of the [[United States Geological Survey]]\n* [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]] \n* [[Composition of Mars]]\n* [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]]\n* [[Lunokhod programme]] (Lunar rovers)\n* [[Maestro (software)]]\n* [[Space exploration]]\n* [[Syd Lieberman]] (Official storyteller of the Mars Exploration Mission)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Portions of this article are adopted from [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/overview/ NASA/JPL MER article].\n* Additional information was adapted from [http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html the MER homepage]\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Expand list|date=November 2009}}\n* ''Roving Mars: Spirit, Opportunity, and the Exploration of the Red Planet'' by [[Steve Squyres]] (published August 2005; {{ISBN|1-4013-0149-5}})\n* ''Postcards from Mars: The First Photographer on the Red Planet'' by Jim Bell (published November 2006; {{ISBN|0-525-94985-2}})\n* [https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/projects/projectPublications.cfm?Project=1 Technical papers by JPL Robotics Engineers]\n* [http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;563338166;pp;1 Interview: The driver behind NASA's Mars Rovers from Australian PC World]\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mars Exploration Rovers}}\n* [http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html NASA JPL's MER website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070801222207/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=MER_A Spirit Mission Profile]\n* [http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=MER_B ''Opportunity'' Mission Profile]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527044955/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/12837/1/01-1164.pdf Mars Exploration Rover project, NASA/JPL document NSS ISDC 2001 27 May 2001]\n* [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol305/issue5685/index.dtl ''Science'', 6 August 2004] - Scientific papers from the first phase of the ''Spirit'' mission\n* [http://hobbiton.thisside.net/rovermanual/ Mars Rover Manual]: Centralized resource for all publicly released rover technical details\n* [http://an.rsl.wustl.edu/ MER Analysts Notebook] (access to the MER scientific data set)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060329010029/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=000CBCF6-9E2B-101A-9E2B83414B7F0000 ''Scientific American'' Magazine (March 2004 Issue) \"The Spirit of Exploration\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100520033859/http://www.li2-innovations.com/li2-rover.html Li2-Rover]\n* [http://marswatch.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/true_color.html Official PanCam True Color Images Gallery]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709161905/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/ Rover image gallery]\n* [http://areo.info/mer/ Nonofficial Daily PanCam Color Image Gallery]\n* [http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/space-missions/mer-updates/ Archive] of MER progress reports by A.J.S.

The original [[German language|German]] title given by Munch to his work was ''{{lang|de|Der Schrei der Natur}}'' ('''''The Scream of Nature'''''), and the Norwegian title is ''{{lang|no|Skrik}}'' ('''''Shriek'''''). The agonised face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolising the [[angst|anxiety]] of the [[human condition]].\n\nMunch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds \"[[Weather lore#Red sky at night|a blood red]]\". He sensed an \"infinite scream passing through nature\". Scholars have located the spot to a [[fjord]] overlooking Oslo ({{coord|59|54|02.4|N|10|46|12.9|E|}}), and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister\u2019s commitment at a nearby [[lunatic asylum]].\n\nMunch created two versions in paint and two in [[pastel]]s, as well as a [[lithography|lithograph]] stone from which several prints survive. Both of the painted versions have been stolen, but since recovered. One of the pastel versions commanded the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at a public auction.\n\n==Sources of inspiration==\n[[File:Edvard Munch 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Edvard Munch]], 1921]]\nIn his diary in an entry headed \"Nice 22 January 1892\", Munch wrote:\n{{quote|One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord\u2014the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red.

This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend [[Paul Gauguin]]: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting ''Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles)'' and for the old woman at the left in his painting ''[[Where Do We Come From?

The original [[German language|German]] title given by Munch to his work was ''{{lang|de|Der Schrei der Natur}}'' ('''''The Scream of Nature'''''), and the Norwegian title is ''{{lang|no|Skrik}}'' ('''''Shriek'''''). The agonised face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolising the [[angst|anxiety]] of the [[human condition]].\n\nMunch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds \"[[Weather lore#Red sky at night|a blood red]]\". He sensed an \"infinite scream passing through nature\". Scholars have located the spot to a [[fjord]] overlooking Oslo ({{coord|59|54|02.4|N|10|46|12.9|E|}}), and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister\u2019s commitment at a nearby [[lunatic asylum]].\n\nMunch created two versions in paint and two in [[pastel]]s, as well as a [[lithography|lithograph]] stone from which several prints survive. Both of the painted versions have been stolen, but since recovered. One of the pastel versions commanded the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at a public auction.\n\n==Sources of inspiration==\n[[File:Edvard Munch 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Edvard Munch]], 1921]]\nIn his diary in an entry headed \"Nice 22 January 1892\", Munch wrote:\n{{quote|One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below.
