The show premiered on February 17, 2014, and is produced by [[Broadway Video]] and [[Universal Television]]. It is the seventh (and current) incarnation of NBC's long-running [[The Tonight Show|''Tonight Show'' franchise]], with Fallon serving as the sixth host. The show also stars sidekick and announcer [[Steve Higgins]] and house band [[The Roots]]. ''The Tonight Show'' is produced by Katie Hockmeyer and executive-produced by [[Lorne Michaels]]. The show records from [[NBC Studios (New York City)|Studio 6B]] in [[Rockefeller Center]], [[New York City]], which is the same studio in which ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]'' and then ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' were produced from 1957 until 1972.\n\nThe program airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT. The show opens with Fallon's topical monologue, then transitions into comedic sketches/games, concluding with guest interviews and musical performance. ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'' attracted high ratings from its 2014 premiere. Many moments from the show have generated [[viral video]]s. The show has been nominated for nine [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, winning two.\n\nOn August 13, 2015, NBC announced that Fallon signed a contract to remain as host until at least 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/08/13/nbc-extends-tonight-show-host-jimmy-fallons-deal-through-2021/447713/|title=NBC Extends 'Tonight Show' Host Jimmy Fallon's Deal through 2021|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref>\nOn March 12, 2020, following an audience-less broadcast of the show, NBC announced suspension of the show's taping until a planned date of March 30, in response to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web |title=An important message for our fans. |url=https://twitter.com/FallonTonight/status/1238276798405894145?s=20 |website=twitter.com |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> \n\n== Background ==\n\n=== History ===\n''[[The Tonight Show]]'' premiered on NBC in 1954 as ''Tonight'', hosted by [[Steve Allen]]. [[Jack Paar]] hosted the show from 1957 to 1962, but the show's longest-running and most famous host was [[Johnny Carson]], who hosted the show for three decades and received six Emmys. Following Carson's 1992 retirement, \"vast quantities of brainpower, money, and column inches were devoted to the issue of who was truly best suited to carry the franchise forward.\"<ref name=\"VF\" /> NBC chose interim guest host [[Jay Leno]], who took over the show that year.\n\nA pair of conflicts ensued over Leno's 22-year tenure, both revolving around the then-current hosts of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'', the program directly following ''Tonight'' since its premiere in 1982. Original ''Late Night'' host [[David Letterman]] was considered Carson's top choice as successor and left the network acrimoniously in 1993 after Leno was given the job. Years later, NBC attempted to transit Letterman's ''Late Night'' successor, [[Conan O'Brien]] to in turn succeed Leno as host of ''Tonight'' in 2009. However, as a result of various contractual obligations and fears of losing performers to other networks, Leno was given a [[The Jay Leno Show|nightly prime-time show]] shortly after Conan's run began. Leno posted less than stellar ratings, leading to a [[domino effect]] on the late local news. O'Brien's ''Tonight'' also suffered falling ratings leading to a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|public controversy]] that resulted in O'Brien leaving the network the following year, and Leno returning to host ''The Tonight Show''.\n[[File:Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Intertitle.png|thumb|left|Show title, used since summer 2015 when the [[NBC peacock]] replaced the [[General Electric|GE]] sign on the Comcast Building]]\n\n[[Jimmy Fallon]], a former cast member from 1998-2004 on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' , was appointed as the third host of ''Late Night'' by executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] in 2009 when O'Brien moved to ''Tonight'' (only for a little over a year).

At Leno's suggestion, the date was moved forward from the end of his contract in September 2014, to February so as to use NBC's coverage of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] as a springboard for Fallon's tenure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=Leno Blesses 'Tonight Show' Succession Plan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/business/media/nbc-confirms-fallon-will-succeed-leno.html|accessdate=August 15, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 3, 2013}}</ref> The date was later moved up a week to February 17, midway through the Olympics.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lisa |last=De Moraes |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/12/sochi-olympics-violence-nbc-coverage/ |title=UPDATE: NBC \"Taking Every Precaution\" In Wake of Russian Violence Walking Up To Sochi Olympics |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=December 30, 2013 |accessdate=February 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs Leno's contract ran until September 2014, much of his staff were paid until that month.<ref name=\"date\">{{cite news|last=De Moraes|first=Lisa|title=Leno's Last 'Tonight Show' To Air Feb. 6; Staff Paid Until September|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/08/lenos-last-tonight-show-to-air-feb-6-staff-paid-until-september/|accessdate=August 15, 2013|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=August 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Emphasis on sketch comedy ===\n{{see also|List of Jimmy Fallon games and sketches}}\nBy bringing over many of his recurring bits and features from ''Late Night'', Fallon has departed in a few ways from the format which Leno used for his show. Fallon's edition places less emphasis on his opening monologue, a feature which was a staple of the Leno edition. In his opening episode, in which he described what the format of the show would be, he only briefly mentioned the monologue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/8130/the-smartest-thing-jimmy-fallon-did-on-his-first-tonight-show/|title=The Smartest Thing Jimmy Fallon Did on His First Tonight Show|first=James|last=Poniewozik}}</ref>\n\nThe show has many recurring segments and games that are played with the various celebrity guests. The most popular of these, \"Lip Sync Battle\", was spun off into [[Lip Sync Battle|its own show]] that premiered on [[Paramount Network|Spike]] (later re-branded as Paramount Network) after being passed on by NBC. Similarly, \"Wheel of Musical Impressions\", another popular segment spawned ''That\u2019s My Jam'', a music and [[Variety show|variety]] [[game show]] set to debut with a 10-episode order during the [[2019-20 United States network television schedule|2019-20 television season]] on NBC.<ref>{{cite web |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |last2=Petski |first2=Denise |title=NBC Orders Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u2018That\u2019s My Jam\u2019 Music & Variety Game Show Inspired By \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 Segments |url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/nbc-orders-jimmy-fallons-thats-my-jam-music-variety-game-show-inspired-by-tonight-show-segments-1202575109/ |website=Deadline |date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther segments include playing charades, [[Catchphrase]], [[Pictionary]], or other family style games. \n\nAdditionally, Fallon and celebrity guests regularly appear in sketches parodying pop culture or political events.

The show premiered on February 17, 2014, and is produced by [[Broadway Video]] and [[Universal Television]]. It is the seventh (and current) incarnation of NBC's long-running [[The Tonight Show|''Tonight Show'' franchise]], with Fallon serving as the sixth host. The show also stars sidekick and announcer [[Steve Higgins]] and house band [[The Roots]]. ''The Tonight Show'' is produced by Katie Hockmeyer and executive-produced by [[Lorne Michaels]]. The show records from [[NBC Studios (New York City)|Studio 6B]] in [[Rockefeller Center]], [[New York City]], which is the same studio in which ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]'' and then ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' were produced from 1957 until 1972.\n\nThe program airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT. The show opens with Fallon's topical monologue, then transitions into comedic sketches/games, concluding with guest interviews and musical performance. ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'' attracted high ratings from its 2014 premiere. Many moments from the show have generated [[viral video]]s. The show has been nominated for nine [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, winning two.\n\nOn August 13, 2015, NBC announced that Fallon signed a contract to remain as host until at least 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/08/13/nbc-extends-tonight-show-host-jimmy-fallons-deal-through-2021/447713/|title=NBC Extends 'Tonight Show' Host Jimmy Fallon's Deal through 2021|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref>\nOn March 12, 2020, following an audience-less broadcast of the show, NBC announced suspension of the show's taping until a planned date of March 30, in response to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web |title=An important message for our fans. |url=https://twitter.com/FallonTonight/status/1238276798405894145?s=20 |website=twitter.com |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> \n\n== Background ==\n\n=== History ===\n''[[The Tonight Show]]'' premiered on NBC in 1954 as ''Tonight'', hosted by [[Steve Allen]]. [[Jack Paar]] hosted the show from 1957 to 1962, but the show's longest-running and most famous host was [[Johnny Carson]], who hosted the show for three decades and received six Emmys. Following Carson's 1992 retirement, \"vast quantities of brainpower, money, and column inches were devoted to the issue of who was truly best suited to carry the franchise forward.\"<ref name=\"VF\" /> NBC chose interim guest host [[Jay Leno]], who took over the show that year.\n\nA pair of conflicts ensued over Leno's 22-year tenure, both revolving around the then-current hosts of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'', the program directly following ''Tonight'' since its premiere in 1982. Original ''Late Night'' host [[David Letterman]] was considered Carson's top choice as successor and left the network acrimoniously in 1993 after Leno was given the job. Years later, NBC attempted to transit Letterman's ''Late Night'' successor, [[Conan O'Brien]] to in turn succeed Leno as host of ''Tonight'' in 2009. However, as a result of various contractual obligations and fears of losing performers to other networks, Leno was given a [[The Jay Leno Show|nightly prime-time show]] shortly after Conan's run began. Leno posted less than stellar ratings, leading to a [[domino effect]] on the late local news.

Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983.   The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 NCAA Tournament]].  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl]], the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in [[NCAA]] men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|winningest program]]s in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Men's Basketball and Louisville #26 (#10 including vacated victories).  Kentucky has eight national championships while Louisville has two (official)(3 including the vacated 2013 championship) national championships.\n\n===Cincinnati Bearcats===\n{{main|Cincinnati\u2013Louisville rivalry#Men's Basketball}}\n\nWhile predominantly a football rivalry, the proximity and long-standing conference affiliation of Cincinnati and Louisville made this into a key rivalry, particularly in the days of the [[Metro Conference|Metro]] and [[Big East Conference|Big East]] conferences.  This rivalry went on hiatus in 2014 when Louisville left the [[American Athletic Conference]] for the ACC.\n\n==Notable Cardinals==\n{{See also|List of University of Louisville people}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"float:right; width:250px;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Louisville Cardinals|color=white}};\"| '''Retired numbers'''\n|-\n!Number\n!Player\n!Years\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 8 || [[Charlie Tyra]] || 1954\u201357\n|-\n| 31 || [[Wes Unseld]] || 1966\u201368\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 35 || [[Darrell Griffith]] || 1977\u201380\n|-\n| 42 || [[Pervis Ellison]] || 1986\u201389\n|}\n\nLouisville basketball has honored four former players by retiring their numbers. These are the last players to wear these numbers for a Louisville men's squad:\n\n* '''Charlie Tyra #8''' \u2013 A consensus All-American during the 1956 and 1957 seasons, Charlie Tyra led the University of Louisville to its first NIT title in 1956 and was named the tournament's MVP for his performance. Tyra was named Helms Athletic Foundation All-American in his junior and senior years. One of only five Cardinals to record over 1,000 rebounds in his career, Tyra ranks as the all-time rebounder in U of L history with 1,617. During the 1955\u201356 season, Tyra pulled down 645 rebounds, a mark that has been bettered by only three other players in NCAA history. He set the Louisville record for most rebounds in a game when he pulled down 38 against Canisius during the 1955\u201356 season. In his four seasons with Louisville, he helped his teams to a combined record of 88\u201323 and three straight NIT appearances. Tyra ranks third in career free throws made (448), second in career rebounding average (17.0), fourth in career scoring average (18.2), eighth in career scorers (1,728 points) and eighth in field goals made (640). Tyra is one of only four players in UofL history to score 40 points or more in a game (achieved against Notre Dame when he hit 12 of 16 field goals and all 16 of his free throw attempts). Tyra died on December 29, 2006, at the age of 71. He was drafted #2 by in the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[1957 NBA draft]].\n* '''Wes Unseld #31''' \u2013 When Wes Unseld ended his career with the University of Louisville following the 1967\u201368 season, he left as the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer for a three-year player. Today, Unseld ranks 10th on the all-time scoring list, but his career point total of 1,686 is still tops for a three-year player. A consensus All-American during his junior and senior years, Unseld is one of only five other Cardinal players to pull down over 1,000 rebounds in his career. His 1,551 career rebounds ranks second behind Tyra's 1,617. Unseld began his senior season with a 45-point effort against Georgetown College, a UofL record that still stands today. Unseld, chosen as second player overall in the NBA draft by Baltimore, was honored on the All-Missouri Valley Conference team all three years at UofL and the Cardinals were 60\u201322 during his three seasons. During his junior year, Unseld led the Cardinals to a final No. 2 ranking in both wire service polls. Unseld's 20.6 scoring average still ranks as the top scoring average in Louisville history. His 18.9 rebounding average also ranks as the top average for a Cardinal. While playing on the Cardinals' freshmen team, Unseld averaged 35.8 points and 23.6 rebounds, and hit 68.6 percent from the field. \n* '''Darrell Griffith #35''' \u2013 The 1980 Player of the Year and consensus first team All-American led Louisville to four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, winning the 1980 Championship as he had promised when he committed to his hometown Cardinals. Griffith's career 2333 points and single-season 825 points rank first in Louisville history. He scored in double figures in 41 straight games and 111 of his 126 games with the Cardinals. His play earned him the nickname \"Dr. Dunkenstein\".<ref>John Papanek. \"[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124021/index.htm A Rookie Gives The Jazz Pizzazz]\". ''Sports Illustrated''. December 8, 1980. Retrieved on February 1, 2010.</ref>  He was drafted #2 by the [[Utah Jazz]] in the [[1980 NBA draft]].\n* '''Pervis Ellison #42''' \u2013 Ellison won the 1986 NCAA Tournament MOP award after leading the Cardinals to their second NCAA Tournament Championship. A consensus first team All-American in 1989, he is the only Louisville player to score 2000 points and grab 1000 rebounds in a career. His 374 career rejections rank first at Louisville and ranked Ellison third all time in the NCAA when he left in 1989. He was drafted #1 by the [[Sacramento Kings]] in the [[1989 NBA draft]].\n\n===Cardinals in the Hall of Fame===\nLouisville has three representatives in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]: Cardinal All-American and former Washington Bullets All-Star [[Wes Unseld]], who was inducted in 1988, former coach [[Denny Crum]], who was inducted in 1994, and coach [[Rick Pitino]], who was inducted in 2013.

Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983.   The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 NCAA Tournament]].  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl]], the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in [[NCAA]] men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|winningest program]]s in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Men's Basketball and Louisville #26 (#10 including vacated victories).  Kentucky has eight national championships while Louisville has two (official)(3 including the vacated 2013 championship) national championships.\n\n===Cincinnati Bearcats===\n{{main|Cincinnati\u2013Louisville rivalry#Men's Basketball}}\n\nWhile predominantly a football rivalry, the proximity and long-standing conference affiliation of Cincinnati and Louisville made this into a key rivalry, particularly in the days of the [[Metro Conference|Metro]] and [[Big East Conference|Big East]] conferences.  This rivalry went on hiatus in 2014 when Louisville left the [[American Athletic Conference]] for the ACC.\n\n==Notable Cardinals==\n{{See also|List of University of Louisville people}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"float:right; width:250px;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Louisville Cardinals|color=white}};\"| '''Retired numbers'''\n|-\n!Number\n!Player\n!Years\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 8 || [[Charlie Tyra]] || 1954\u201357\n|-\n| 31 || [[Wes Unseld]] || 1966\u201368\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 35 || [[Darrell Griffith]] || 1977\u201380\n|-\n| 42 || [[Pervis Ellison]] || 1986\u201389\n|}\n\nLouisville basketball has honored four former players by retiring their numbers. These are the last players to wear these numbers for a Louisville men's squad:\n\n* '''Charlie Tyra #8''' \u2013 A consensus All-American during the 1956 and 1957 seasons, Charlie Tyra led the University of Louisville to its first NIT title in 1956 and was named the tournament's MVP for his performance. Tyra was named Helms Athletic Foundation All-American in his junior and senior years. One of only five Cardinals to record over 1,000 rebounds in his career, Tyra ranks as the all-time rebounder in U of L history with 1,617. During the 1955\u201356 season, Tyra pulled down 645 rebounds, a mark that has been bettered by only three other players in NCAA history. He set the Louisville record for most rebounds in a game when he pulled down 38 against Canisius during the 1955\u201356 season. In his four seasons with Louisville, he helped his teams to a combined record of 88\u201323 and three straight NIT appearances. Tyra ranks third in career free throws made (448), second in career rebounding average (17.0), fourth in career scoring average (18.2), eighth in career scorers (1,728 points) and eighth in field goals made (640). Tyra is one of only four players in UofL history to score 40 points or more in a game (achieved against Notre Dame when he hit 12 of 16 field goals and all 16 of his free throw attempts). Tyra died on December 29, 2006, at the age of 71. He was drafted #2 by in the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[1957 NBA draft]].\n* '''Wes Unseld #31''' \u2013 When Wes Unseld ended his career with the University of Louisville following the 1967\u201368 season, he left as the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer for a three-year player. Today, Unseld ranks 10th on the all-time scoring list, but his career point total of 1,686 is still tops for a three-year player. A consensus All-American during his junior and senior years, Unseld is one of only five other Cardinal players to pull down over 1,000 rebounds in his career. His 1,551 career rebounds ranks second behind Tyra's 1,617. Unseld began his senior season with a 45-point effort against Georgetown College, a UofL record that still stands today. Unseld, chosen as second player overall in the NBA draft by Baltimore, was honored on the All-Missouri Valley Conference team all three years at UofL and the Cardinals were 60\u201322 during his three seasons.

The subject is thus built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and decision theory, and derives several key results for the application of [[decision making]] under uncertainty to the [[financial market]]s. The underlying economic logic distills to a \u201dfundamental valuation result\u201d,<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> as aside, which is developed in the following sections.\n\n===Present value, expectation and utility===\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of [[present value]] and [[Expected value|expectation]].<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>\n\nCalculating their present value allows the decision maker to aggregate the [[cashflow]]s (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future, to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is therefore the starting point for financial decision making. (Its history is correspondingly early: [[Richard Witt]] discusses [[compound interest]] in depth already in 1613, in his book \"Arithmeticall Questions\";<ref>C. Lewin (1970). [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf An early book on compound interest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163926/https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf |date=2016-12-21 }}, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</ref> further developed by [[Johan de Witt]] and [[Edmond Halley]].)\n\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the [[Expected value|expected value criterion]] which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, <math>X_{s}</math> and <math>p_{s}</math> respectively. (These ideas originate with [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1654.)\n\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider [[risk aversion]] (\"as any student of finance knows\"<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>). In other words, since individuals receive greater [[Utility#Economic definitions|utility]] from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is to therefore \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes (\"states\") correspondingly, <math>Y_{s}</math>. See [[Indifference price]]. (Some investors may in fact be [[risk seeking]] as opposed to [[Risk aversion|risk averse]], but the same logic would apply).\n\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]]. More formally, the resulting [[expected utility hypothesis]] states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective]] value associated with a gamble by an individual is ''that individual''{{'}}s [[Expected value|statistical expectation]] of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\n\nThe impetus for these ideas arise from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]; see also [[Ellsberg paradox]]. (The development here is originally due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, and later formalized by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1947.)\n\n===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|JEL classification codes\n|-\n|In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]], Financial Economics is one of the 19 primary classifications, at JEL: G.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\n\n[[Economic equilibrium]] is, in general, a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\n\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and are therefore not in equilibrium.<ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\"/> An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\nThe immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]], shows that where markets are as described \u2014and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) [[complete market|complete]]\u2014one may then make financial decisions by constructing a [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] corresponding to the market.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, <math>s</math>, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming [[Frictionless market|no friction]]): essentially [[System of linear equations|solving simultaneously]] for ''n'' (risk-neutral) probabilities, <math>q_{s}</math>, given ''n'' prices. The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\">Freddy Delbaen and Walter Schachermayer. (2004).

Notices of the AMS 51 (5): 526\u2013528</ref> For a simplified example see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}}, where the economy has only two possible states\u2014up and down\u2014and where <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math> (=<math>1-q_{up}</math>) are the two corresponding (i.e. implied) probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or [[probability measure|\"measure\"]].\n\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the riskless return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\",<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> i.e. a security-specific [[risk premium]], compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions and/or conditions.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> This approach is consistent with [[#Present value, expectation and utility|the above]], but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\n\nThus, continuing the example, in pricing a [[derivative (finance)|derivative instrument]] its forecasted cashflows in the up- and down-states, <math>X_{up}</math> and <math>X_{down}</math>, are multiplied through by <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math>, and are then [[present value|discounted]] at the risk-free interest rate; per equation above.  In pricing a \u201cfundamental\u201d, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with <math>Y</math> and <math>r</math> combined. In general, this may be derived by the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] (or extensions) as will be seen under [[#Uncertainty]]. \n\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the instrument as a combination of the [[underlying]] and a risk free \u201cbond\u201d; see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Delta hedging}} (and [[#Uncertainty]] below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such \u201cmanufacturing\u201d is of course not possible - the instrument being \"fundamental\" - and a premium is then required for risk.\n\n===State prices===\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model]] may be derived. This important result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a ''[[representative agent]]''.<ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/>\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally [[complete market]]s, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods. \n\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a [[state price]] security (also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security), a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a [[numeraire]] (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price <math>\\pi_{s}</math> of this particular state of the world.\n\nIn the above example, the state prices, <math>\\pi_{up}</math>,  <math>\\pi_{down}</math>would equate to the present values of <math>$q_{up}</math> and <math>$q_{down}</math>: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the [[state price vector]] is the vector of state prices for all states.\nApplied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [<math>\\pi_{up}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{up}</math> + <math>\\pi_{down}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{down}</math>]; the second formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a [[continuous random variable]] indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by [[integration (mathematics)|integrating]] over the state price \"density\".

As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\",<ref name=\"stanford1\"/><ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/> as will be seen below.\n* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.\n* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.\n* [[Option (finance)|Options]]: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.\n* [[Perfect information|Information]]: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with [[Future value|future monetary value]] (FMV).\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"[[deterministic]]\" and \"random\",<ref name=\"Luenberger\"/> or \"[[stochastic]]\".)\n\n===Certainty===\nThe starting point here is \u201cInvestment under certainty\". The [[Fisher separation theorem]], asserts that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. Related is the [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]], which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\n\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'', which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the intrinsic, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of [[dividend]]s. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. [[Net present value]] (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of \"Equity valuation\" topics under {{sectionlink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}.\n([[John Burr Williams]] published his \"Theory\" in 1938; NPV was introduced by [[Joel Dean (economist)|Joel Dean]] in 1951)\n\n[[Bond valuation]], in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal) are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion.<ref name=\"Luenberger\">See Luenberger's ''Investment Science'', under Bibliography.</ref> An immediate extension, [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach|Arbitrage-free bond pricing]], discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate \u2014 i.e. at each coupon's corresponding zero-rate \u2014 as opposed to an overall rate. In many treatments bond valuation precedes [[equity valuation]], under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" ''per se''. Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these \u2014 based on historic ratios or published policy \u2014 and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under [[#Corporate finance theory]].\n\nThese \"certainty\" results are all commonly employed under corporate finance; uncertainty is the focus of \"asset pricing models\", as follows.\n\n===Uncertainty===\nFor [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|\"choice under uncertainty\"]] the twin assumptions of rationality and [[Financial market efficiency|market efficiency]], as more closely defined, lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) with its [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM)\u2014an ''equilibrium-based'' result\u2014and to the [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton theory]] (BSM; often, simply Black\u2013Scholes) for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]]\u2014an ''arbitrage-free'' result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see [[asset pricing]].\n\nBriefly, and intuitively\u2014and consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above\u2014the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows.<ref>\nFor a more formal treatment, see, for example: Eugene F. Fama. 1965. [http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/faj/1965/21/5 Random Walks in Stock Market Prices]. ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'', September/October 1965, Vol. 21, No. 5: 55\u201359.</ref> \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. ''efficient'', prices: the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See [[Earnings response coefficient]].)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information, are identical to the ''best guess of the future'': the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, but what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a [[normal distribution]]\u2014so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news:<ref name=\"Shiller\"/> the [[random walk hypothesis]]. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \n(The EMH was presented by [[Eugene Fama]] in a 1970 review paper,<ref>Fama, Eugene (1970). \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\". Journal of Finance.</ref> consolidating previous works re random walks in stock prices: [[Jules Regnault]], 1863; [[Louis Bachelier]], 1900; [[Maurice Kendall]], 1953; [[Paul Cootner]], 1964; and [[Paul Samuelson]], 1965, among others.)\n\nUnder these conditions investors can then be assumed to act rationally: their investment decision must be calculated or a loss is sure to follow; correspondingly, where an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, then arbitrageurs will exploit it, reinforcing this equilibrium.\nHere, as under the certainty-case above, the specific assumption as to pricing is that prices are calculated as the present value of expected future dividends,\n<ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\">Christopher L.

The CAPM was derived by [[Jack L. Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962), [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently. )\n\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of [[option style|European-styled options]].\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a [[partial differential equation]] describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, [[geometric Brownian motion]] (see [[Brownian model of financial markets]]).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (<math>V</math>, the value, or price, of the option, grows at <math>r</math>, the risk-free rate).<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/>\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price\u2014in an arbitrage-free sense\u2014for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is [[Partial differential equation#Analytical solutions|the solution]] to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above.

As regards [[asset pricing]], developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under \"Portfolio theory\" below, while \"Derivative pricing\" relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing.  As regards the use of capital, \"Corporate finance theory\" relates, mainly, to the application of these models.\n\n===Portfolio theory===\n[[Image:Pareto Efficient Frontier for the Markowitz Portfolio selection problem..png|thumb|right|200px|Plot of two criteria when maximizing return and minimizing risk in financial portfolios (Pareto-optimal points in red)]]\n[[File:Four Correlations.png|thumb|right|alt=Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.|Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.]]\n:''See also: [[Post-modern portfolio theory]] and {{sectionlink|Mathematical finance|Risk and portfolio management: the P world}}.''\nThe majority of developments here relate to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]] and the [[Carhart four-factor model]], propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The [[intertemporal CAPM]] and [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|consumption-based CAPM]] similarly extend the model. With [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption (in the economic sense)]] then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\n\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the [[single-index model]] is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT; [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], 1976) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\"<ref>''The Arbitrage Pricing Theory,'' Chapter VI in Goetzmann, under External links.</ref> It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\n\nAs regards [[portfolio optimization]], the [[Black\u2013Litterman model]] departs from the original [[Markowitz model]] - i.e. of constructing portfolios via an [[efficient frontier]]. Black\u2013Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] can be applied; here deriving a [[Pareto efficient]] portfolio. The [[universal portfolio algorithm]] ([[Thomas M. Cover]], 1991) applies [[machine learning]] to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data. [[Behavioral portfolio theory]] recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals.  Copulas have [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|lately been applied here]]; recently this is the case also [[List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications#Finance_and_Economics|for genetic algorithms]] and [[Machine learning #Applications|Machine learning, more generally]].

The theoretical framework too has been extended such that [[martingale pricing]] is now the standard approach.\n\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based off the same logic (using \"[[contingent claim analysis]]\"). [[Real options valuation]] allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock option valuation]] explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; [[Credit derivative]]s allow that payment obligations and / or delivery requirements might not be honored.

(The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2014 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2014 are discussed [[#Departures from normality|in the next section]].\n\nAfter the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], a further development: ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]]) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2014 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as [[counterparty credit risk]], funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing,<ref>[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf \"Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917015231/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf |date=2016-09-17 }}, Christian Kj\u00f8lhede & Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]</ref> and a [[Credit Valuation Adjustment]], or CVA\u2014and potentially other ''valuation adjustments'', collectively [[xVA]]\u2014is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\n\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) curve, as opposed to [[LIBOR]] as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]]  is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting Dilemma |first=John |last=Hull |first2=Alan |last2=White |journal=[[Journal of Investment Management]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=14\u201327}}</ref> (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]] discounting\".) [[Swap (finance)#Valuation|Swap pricing]] - and, therefore, [[yield curve]] construction - is further modified: previously, swaps were valued off a single \"self discounting\" interest rate curve; whereas post crisis, to accommodate OIS discounting, valuation is now under a \"[[multi-curve framework]]\" where \"forecast curves\" are constructed for each floating-leg [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]], with discounting on the ''common'' OIS curve.\n\n===Corporate finance theory===\n[[Image:Manual decision tree.jpg|right|thumb|Project valuation via decision tree.]]\nCorporate finance theory has also been extended: mirroring the [[#Certainty|above]] developments, asset-valuation and decisioning no longer need assume \"certainty\". \n[[Monte Carlo methods in finance]] allow financial analysts to construct \"[[stochastic]]\" or [[probabilistic]] corporate finance models, as opposed to the traditional static and [[deterministic]] models;<ref name=\"Damodaran_Risk\"/> see {{sectionlink|Corporate finance|Quantifying uncertainty}}. \nRelatedly, Real Options theory allows for owner\u2014i.e. managerial\u2014actions that impact underlying value: by incorporating option pricing logic, these actions are then applied to a distribution of future outcomes, changing with time, which then determine the \"project's\" valuation today.<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> \n(Simulation was first applied to (corporate) finance by [[David B.

Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold (see [[Kurtosis risk]], [[Skewness risk]], [[Long tail]]) and that in practice, traders, analysts and [[financial risk management|risk managers]] frequently modify the \"standard models\" (see [[Model risk]]). In fact, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] had discovered already in the 1960s that changes in financial prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\n\n[[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]] have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while [[Jump diffusion#In economics and finance|jump diffusion models]] allow for (option) pricing incorporating [[jump process|\"jumps\"]] in the [[spot price]].<ref name=\"holes\">{{cite journal |title=  How to use the holes in Black-Scholes |first= Fischer |last=Black|author-link1=Fischer Black |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=1|issue=Jan|year=1989|pages=67\u201373|jstor=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6622.1989.tb00175.x}}</ref> \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard [[value at risk]] models with [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulations]], [[Mixture model#A financial model|mixture models]], [[principal component analysis]], [[extreme value theory]], as well as models for [[volatility clustering]].<ref>See for example III.A.3, in Carol Alexander, ed.

In this way calculated prices \u2014 and numeric structures \u2014 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense.  The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first [[Stochastic volatility#Calibration and estimation|calibrated to observed prices]], and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are [[Heston model|Heston]], [[SABR volatility model|SABR]] and [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]]. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |title=  Managing smile risk |first= Patrick |last=Hagan |display-authors=etal|journal=[[Wilmott Magazine]] |volume=|issue=Sep|year=2002 |pages=84\u2013108|jstor=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nRelated to local volatility are the [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice]]-based [[Implied binomial tree|implied-binomial]] and [[Implied trinomial tree|-trinomial trees]] \u2014 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2014 which are similarly (but less commonly) used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. \n[[Edgeworth binomial tree]]s allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required.<ref>See for example Pg 217 of: Jackson, Mary; Mike Staunton (2001).

This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no \"[[double counting (accounting)|double counting]]\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...) \n\nAs mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly [[financial engineering]]) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above \"extreme event\" approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. \nRecognizing this, [[James Rickards]], amongst other critics of financial economics, suggests that, instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely: \n:\"The  current  system,  based  on  the  idea  that  risk  is  distributed  in  the  shape  of  a  bell  curve,  is  flawed...

It is built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and [[decision theory]].\n\n[[Financial econometrics]] is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterise these relationships. [[Mathematical finance]] is related in that it will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models suggested by financial economics. The emphasis there is mathematical consistency, as opposed to compatibility with economic theory. Financial economics has a primarily [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] focus, whereas [[monetary economics]] is primarily [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] in nature.\n\nFinancial economics is usually taught at the postgraduate level; see [[Master of Financial Economics]].

The subject is thus built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and decision theory, and derives several key results for the application of [[decision making]] under uncertainty to the [[financial market]]s. The underlying economic logic distills to a \u201dfundamental valuation result\u201d,<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> as aside, which is developed in the following sections.\n\n===Present value, expectation and utility===\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of [[present value]] and [[Expected value|expectation]].<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>\n\nCalculating their present value allows the decision maker to aggregate the [[cashflow]]s (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future, to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is therefore the starting point for financial decision making. (Its history is correspondingly early: [[Richard Witt]] discusses [[compound interest]] in depth already in 1613, in his book \"Arithmeticall Questions\";<ref>C. Lewin (1970). [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf An early book on compound interest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163926/https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf |date=2016-12-21 }}, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</ref> further developed by [[Johan de Witt]] and [[Edmond Halley]].)\n\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the [[Expected value|expected value criterion]] which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, <math>X_{s}</math> and <math>p_{s}</math> respectively. (These ideas originate with [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1654.)\n\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider [[risk aversion]] (\"as any student of finance knows\"<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>). In other words, since individuals receive greater [[Utility#Economic definitions|utility]] from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is to therefore \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes (\"states\") correspondingly, <math>Y_{s}</math>. See [[Indifference price]]. (Some investors may in fact be [[risk seeking]] as opposed to [[Risk aversion|risk averse]], but the same logic would apply).\n\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]]. More formally, the resulting [[expected utility hypothesis]] states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective]] value associated with a gamble by an individual is ''that individual''{{'}}s [[Expected value|statistical expectation]] of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\n\nThe impetus for these ideas arise from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]; see also [[Ellsberg paradox]]. (The development here is originally due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, and later formalized by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1947.)\n\n===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|JEL classification codes\n|-\n|In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]], Financial Economics is one of the 19 primary classifications, at JEL: G.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\n\n[[Economic equilibrium]] is, in general, a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\n\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and are therefore not in equilibrium.<ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\"/> An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\nThe immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]], shows that where markets are as described \u2014and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) [[complete market|complete]]\u2014one may then make financial decisions by constructing a [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] corresponding to the market.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, <math>s</math>, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming [[Frictionless market|no friction]]): essentially [[System of linear equations|solving simultaneously]] for ''n'' (risk-neutral) probabilities, <math>q_{s}</math>, given ''n'' prices. The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\">Freddy Delbaen and Walter Schachermayer. (2004).

Notices of the AMS 51 (5): 526\u2013528</ref> For a simplified example see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}}, where the economy has only two possible states\u2014up and down\u2014and where <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math> (=<math>1-q_{up}</math>) are the two corresponding (i.e. implied) probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or [[probability measure|\"measure\"]].\n\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the riskless return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\",<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> i.e. a security-specific [[risk premium]], compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions and/or conditions.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> This approach is consistent with [[#Present value, expectation and utility|the above]], but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\n\nThus, continuing the example, in pricing a [[derivative (finance)|derivative instrument]] its forecasted cashflows in the up- and down-states, <math>X_{up}</math> and <math>X_{down}</math>, are multiplied through by <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math>, and are then [[present value|discounted]] at the risk-free interest rate; per equation above.  In pricing a \u201cfundamental\u201d, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with <math>Y</math> and <math>r</math> combined. In general, this may be derived by the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] (or extensions) as will be seen under [[#Uncertainty]]. \n\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the instrument as a combination of the [[underlying]] and a risk free \u201cbond\u201d; see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Delta hedging}} (and [[#Uncertainty]] below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such construction is of course not possible - the instrument being \"fundamental\" - and a premium is then required for risk.\n\n===State prices===\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model]] may be derived. This important result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a ''[[representative agent]]''.<ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/>\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally [[complete market]]s, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods. \n\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a [[state price]] security (also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security), a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a [[numeraire]] (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price <math>\\pi_{s}</math> of this particular state of the world.\n\nIn the above example, the state prices, <math>\\pi_{up}</math>,  <math>\\pi_{down}</math>would equate to the present values of <math>$q_{up}</math> and <math>$q_{down}</math>: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the [[state price vector]] is the vector of state prices for all states.\nApplied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [<math>\\pi_{up}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{up}</math> + <math>\\pi_{down}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{down}</math>]; the second formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a [[continuous random variable]] indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by [[integration (mathematics)|integrating]] over the state price \"density\". These concepts are extended to [[martingale pricing]] and the related [[risk-neutral measure]]. See also [[Stochastic discount factor]].\n\nState prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (\"[[contingent claim analysis]]\");<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> but can also be applied to valuation problems.<ref name=\"corp fin state prices\">See de Matos, as well as Bossaerts and \u00d8degaard, under bibliography.</ref> Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value \u2014 true in fact for \"every security\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/> \u2014  as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices.<ref name=\"Chance2\"/><ref name=\"corp fin state prices\"/> These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself. (Breeden and Litzenberger's work in 1978<ref>{{cite journal |title=Prices of State-Contingent Claims Implicit in Option Prices |first=Douglas T. |last=Breeden |first2=Robert H. |last2=Litzenberger |author2-link=Robert Litzenberger |journal=[[Journal of Business]] |volume=51 |issue=4 |year=1978 |pages=621\u2013651 |jstor=2352653 |doi=10.1086/296025}}</ref> established the use of state prices in financial economics.)\n\n==Resultant models==\n[[Image:MM2.png|thumb|right|Modigliani\u2013Miller Proposition II with risky debt.

As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\",<ref name=\"stanford1\"/><ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/> as will be seen below.\n* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.\n* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.\n* [[Option (finance)|Options]]: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.\n* [[Perfect information|Information]]: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with [[Future value|future monetary value]] (FMV).\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"[[deterministic]]\" and \"random\",<ref name=\"Luenberger\"/> or \"[[stochastic]]\".)\n\n===Certainty===\nThe starting point here is \u201cInvestment under certainty\". The [[Fisher separation theorem]], asserts that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. Related is the [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]], which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\n\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'', which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the intrinsic, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of [[dividend]]s. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. [[Net present value]] (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of \"Equity valuation\" topics under {{sectionlink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}.\n([[John Burr Williams]] published his \"Theory\" in 1938; NPV was introduced by [[Joel Dean (economist)|Joel Dean]] in 1951)\n\n[[Bond valuation]], in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal) are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion.<ref name=\"Luenberger\">See Luenberger's ''Investment Science'', under Bibliography.</ref> An immediate extension, [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach|Arbitrage-free bond pricing]], discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate \u2014 i.e. at each coupon's corresponding zero-rate \u2014 as opposed to an overall rate. In many treatments bond valuation precedes [[equity valuation]], under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" ''per se''. Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these \u2014 based on historic ratios or published policy \u2014 and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under [[#Corporate finance theory]].\n\nThese \"certainty\" results are all commonly employed under corporate finance; uncertainty is the focus of \"asset pricing models\", as follows.\n\n===Uncertainty===\nFor [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|\"choice under uncertainty\"]] the twin assumptions of rationality and [[Financial market efficiency|market efficiency]], as more closely defined, lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) with its [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM)\u2014an ''equilibrium-based'' result\u2014and to the [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton theory]] (BSM; often, simply Black\u2013Scholes) for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]]\u2014an ''arbitrage-free'' result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see [[asset pricing]].\n\nBriefly, and intuitively\u2014and consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above\u2014the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows.<ref>\nFor a more formal treatment, see, for example: Eugene F. Fama. 1965. [http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/faj/1965/21/5 Random Walks in Stock Market Prices]. ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'', September/October 1965, Vol. 21, No. 5: 55\u201359.</ref> \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. ''efficient'', prices: the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See [[Earnings response coefficient]].)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information, are identical to the ''best guess of the future'': the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, but what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a [[normal distribution]]\u2014so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news:<ref name=\"Shiller\"/> the [[random walk hypothesis]]. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \n(The EMH was presented by [[Eugene Fama]] in a 1970 review paper,<ref>Fama, Eugene (1970). \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\". Journal of Finance.</ref> consolidating previous works re random walks in stock prices: [[Jules Regnault]], 1863; [[Louis Bachelier]], 1900; [[Maurice Kendall]], 1953; [[Paul Cootner]], 1964; and [[Paul Samuelson]], 1965, among others.)\n\nUnder these conditions investors can then be assumed to act rationally: their investment decision must be calculated or a loss is sure to follow; correspondingly, where an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, then arbitrageurs will exploit it, reinforcing this equilibrium.\nHere, as under the certainty-case above, the specific assumption as to pricing is that prices are calculated as the present value of expected future dividends,\n<ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\">Christopher L.

Relatedly, rationality \u2014 in the sense of arbitrage-exploitation \u2014 gives rise to Black\u2013Scholes; option values here ultimately consistent with the CAPM.\n\nIn general, then, while portfolio theory studies how investors should balance risk and return when investing in many assets or securities, the CAPM is more focused, describing how, in equilibrium, markets set the prices of assets in relation to how risky they are.\nImportantly, this result will be independent of the investor's level of risk aversion, and / or assumed utility function, thus providing a readily determined discount rate for corporate finance decision makers [[Financial economics#Certainty|as above]],<ref name=\"Jensen&Smith\">[[Michael C. Jensen|Jensen, Michael C.]] and Smith, Clifford W., \"The Theory of Corporate Finance: A Historical Overview\". In: ''The Modern Theory of Corporate Finance'', New York: McGraw-Hill Inc., pp. 2\u201320, 1984.</ref> and for other investors.\nThe argument [[Markowitz model|proceeds as follows]]: \nIf one can construct an [[efficient frontier]]\u2014i.e. each combination of assets offering the best possible expected level of return for its level of risk, see diagram\u2014then mean-variance efficient portfolios can be formed simply as a combination of holdings of the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free asset]] and the \"[[market portfolio]]\" (the [[Mutual fund separation theorem]]), with the combinations here plotting as the [[capital market line]], or CML. \nThen, given this CML, the required return on a risky security will be independent of the investor's [[utility function]], and solely determined by its [[covariance]] (\"beta\") with aggregate, i.e. market, risk. \nThis is because investors here can then maximize utility through leverage as opposed to pricing; see [[Separation property (finance)]], {{sectionlink|Markowitz model|Choosing the best portfolio}} and CML diagram aside. \nAs can be seen in the formula aside, this result is consistent with [[Financial economics#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium|the preceding]], equaling the riskless return plus an adjustment for risk.<ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> \nA more modern, direct, derivation is as described at the bottom of this section; which may be generalized to derive other pricing models.\n(The efficient frontier was introduced by [[Harry Markowitz]] in 1952. The CAPM was derived by [[Jack L. Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962), [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently. )\n\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of [[option style|European-styled options]].\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a [[partial differential equation]] describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, [[geometric Brownian motion]] (see [[Brownian model of financial markets]]).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (<math>V</math>, the value, or price, of the option, grows at <math>r</math>, the risk-free rate).<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/>\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price\u2014in an arbitrage-free sense\u2014for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is [[Partial differential equation#Analytical solutions|the solution]] to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above. Relatedly, therefore, the pricing formula may also be derived directly via risk neutral expectation.\n(BSM -  two seminal 1973 papers by [[Fischer Black]] & [[Myron Scholes]],<ref name=\"BlackScholes_paper\">{{cite journal|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|last=Black|first=Fischer|author2=Myron Scholes|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1973|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637\u2013654|doi=10.1086/260062}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029]</ref>  \nand [[Robert C.

As regards [[asset pricing]], developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under \"Portfolio theory\" below, while \"Derivative pricing\" relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing.  As regards the use of capital, \"Corporate finance theory\" relates, mainly, to the application of these models.\n\n===Portfolio theory===\n[[Image:Pareto Efficient Frontier for the Markowitz Portfolio selection problem..png|thumb|right|200px|Plot of two criteria when maximizing return and minimizing risk in financial portfolios (Pareto-optimal points in red)]]\n[[File:Four Correlations.png|thumb|right|alt=Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.|Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.]]\n:''See also: [[Post-modern portfolio theory]] and {{sectionlink|Mathematical finance|Risk and portfolio management: the P world}}.''\nThe majority of developments here relate to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]] and the [[Carhart four-factor model]], propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The [[intertemporal CAPM]] and [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|consumption-based CAPM]] similarly extend the model. With [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption (in the economic sense)]] then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\n\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the [[single-index model]] is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT; [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], 1976) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\"<ref>''The Arbitrage Pricing Theory,'' Chapter VI in Goetzmann, under External links.</ref> It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\n\nAs regards [[portfolio optimization]], the [[Black\u2013Litterman model]] departs from the original [[Markowitz model]] - i.e. of constructing portfolios via an [[efficient frontier]]. Black\u2013Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] can be applied; here deriving a [[Pareto efficient]] portfolio. The [[universal portfolio algorithm]] ([[Thomas M. Cover]], 1991) applies [[machine learning]] to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data. [[Behavioral portfolio theory]] recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals.  Copulas have [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|lately been applied here]]; recently this is the case also [[List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications#Finance_and_Economics|for genetic algorithms]] and [[Machine learning #Applications|Machine learning, more generally]].

Discretized models of this type are built\u2014at least implicitly\u2014using state-prices ([[#State prices|as above]]); relatedly, a large number of researchers have used options to extract state-prices for a variety of other applications in financial economics.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Chance1\"/><ref name=\"Chance2\">Don M.

Various [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|other numeric techniques]] have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that [[martingale pricing]] is now the standard approach.\n\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based off the same logic (using \"[[contingent claim analysis]]\"). [[Real options valuation]] allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock option valuation]] explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; [[Credit derivative]]s allow that payment obligations and / or delivery requirements might not be honored. [[Exotic derivative]]s are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|copula based analysis]].\n\nSimilarly, the various [[short rate model]]s allow for an extension of these techniques to [[Fixed income#Derivatives|fixed income-]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s. (The [[Vasicek model| Vasicek]] and [[Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross model|CIR]] models are equilibrium-based, while [[Ho\u2013Lee model|Ho\u2013Lee]] and subsequent models are based on arbitrage-free pricing.) \nThe more general [[Heath\u2013Jarrow\u2013Morton framework|HJM Framework]] describes the dynamics of the full [[forward rate]] curve - as opposed to working with short rates - and is then more widely applied.\nThe valuation of the underlying bonds -  additional to their derivatives - is relatedly extended, particularly for [[Hybrid security |hybrid securities]], where credit risk is combined with uncertainty re future rates; \nsee {{sectionlink|Bond valuation|Stochastic calculus approach}} and {{sectionlink|Lattice model (finance)|Hybrid securities}}.\n([[Oldrich Vasicek]] developed his pioneering short rate model in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vasicek |first=O. |date=1977 |title=An equilibrium characterization of the term structure |journal=[[Journal of Financial Economics]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=177\u2013188 |doi=10.1016/0304-405X(77)90016-2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.164.447 }}</ref> \nThe HJM framework originates from the work of [[David Heath (probabilist) |David Heath]], [[Robert A.

(The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2014 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2014 are discussed [[#Departures from normality|in the next section]].\n\nAfter the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], a further development: ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]]) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2014 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as [[counterparty credit risk]], funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing,<ref>[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf \"Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917015231/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf |date=2016-09-17 }}, Christian Kj\u00f8lhede & Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]</ref> and a [[Credit Valuation Adjustment]], or CVA\u2014and potentially other ''valuation adjustments'', collectively [[xVA]]\u2014is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\n\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) curve, as opposed to [[LIBOR]] as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]]  is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting Dilemma |first=John |last=Hull |first2=Alan |last2=White |journal=[[Journal of Investment Management]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=14\u201327}}</ref> (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]] discounting\".) [[Swap (finance)#Valuation|Swap pricing]] - and, therefore, [[yield curve]] construction - is further modified: previously, swaps were valued off a single \"self discounting\" interest rate curve; whereas post crisis, to accommodate OIS discounting, valuation is now under a \"[[multi-curve framework]]\" where \"forecast curves\" are constructed for each floating-leg [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]], with discounting on the ''common'' OIS curve.\n\n===Corporate finance theory===\n[[Image:Manual decision tree.jpg|right|thumb|Project valuation via decision tree.]]\nCorporate finance theory has also been extended: mirroring the [[#Certainty|above]] developments, asset-valuation and decisioning no longer need assume \"certainty\". \n[[Monte Carlo methods in finance]] allow financial analysts to construct \"[[stochastic]]\" or [[probabilistic]] corporate finance models, as opposed to the traditional static and [[deterministic]] models;<ref name=\"Damodaran_Risk\"/> see {{sectionlink|Corporate finance|Quantifying uncertainty}}. \nRelatedly, Real Options theory allows for owner\u2014i.e. managerial\u2014actions that impact underlying value: by incorporating option pricing logic, these actions are then applied to a distribution of future outcomes, changing with time, which then determine the \"project's\" valuation today.<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> \n(Simulation was first applied to (corporate) finance by [[David B.

In fact, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] had discovered already in the 1960s that changes in financial prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\n\n[[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]] have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while [[Jump diffusion#In economics and finance|jump diffusion models]] allow for (option) pricing incorporating [[jump process|\"jumps\"]] in the [[spot price]].<ref name=\"holes\">{{cite journal |title=  How to use the holes in Black-Scholes |first= Fischer |last=Black|author-link1=Fischer Black |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=1|issue=Jan|year=1989|pages=67\u201373|jstor=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6622.1989.tb00175.x}}</ref> \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard [[value at risk]] models with [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulations]], [[Mixture model#A financial model|mixture models]], [[principal component analysis]], [[extreme value theory]], as well as models for [[volatility clustering]].<ref>See for example III.A.3, in Carol Alexander, ed.

PRMIA Publications. {{ISBN|978-0976609704}}</ref> \nFor further discussion see {{sectionlink|Fat-tailed distribution|Applications in economics}}, and {{sectionlink|Value at risk|Criticism}}.\nPortfolio managers, likewise, have modified their optimization criteria and algorithms; see [[#Portfolio theory]] above. \n\nClosely related is the [[volatility smile]], where, as above, [[implied volatility]] \u2014 the volatility corresponding to the BSM price \u2014 is observed to ''differ'' as a function of [[strike price]] (i.e. [[moneyness]]), true only if the price-change distribution is non-normal, unlike that assumed by BSM. \nThe term structure of volatility describes how (implied) volatility differs for related options with different maturities. \nAn implied volatility surface is then a three-dimensional surface plot of volatility smile and term structure. \nThese empirical phenomena negate the assumption of constant volatility\u2014and [[log-normal]]ity\u2014upon which Black\u2013Scholes is built.<ref name=\"Haug Taleb\"/><ref name=\"holes\"/>  \nWithin institutions, the function of Black-Scholes is now, largely, to ''communicate'' prices via implied volatilities, much like bond prices are communicated via [[yield to maturity|YTM]]; see {{sectionlink|Black\u2013Scholes model|The volatility smile}}.\n\nIn consequence traders (and risk managers) now, instead, use \"smile-consistent\" models, firstly, when valuing derivatives not directly mapped to the surface, facilitating the pricing of other, i.e. non-quoted, strike/maturity combinations, or of non-European derivatives, and generally for hedging purposes.  \nThe two main approaches are [[local volatility]] and [[stochastic volatility]]. \nThe first returns the volatility which is \u201clocal\u201d to each spot-time point of the [[Finite difference methods for option pricing|finite difference-]] or [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing|simulation-based valuation]]; i.e. as opposed to implied volatility, which holds overall.  In this way calculated prices \u2014 and numeric structures \u2014 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense.  The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first [[Stochastic volatility#Calibration and estimation|calibrated to observed prices]], and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are [[Heston model|Heston]], [[SABR volatility model|SABR]] and [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]]. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |title=  Managing smile risk |first= Patrick |last=Hagan |display-authors=etal|journal=[[Wilmott Magazine]] |volume=|issue=Sep|year=2002 |pages=84\u2013108|jstor=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nRelated to local volatility are the [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice]]-based [[Implied binomial tree|implied-binomial]] and [[Implied trinomial tree|-trinomial trees]] \u2014 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2014 which are similarly (but less commonly) used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. \n[[Edgeworth binomial tree]]s allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required.<ref>See for example Pg 217 of: Jackson, Mary; Mike Staunton (2001).

Working paper, [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].</ref>\n\nAs discussed, additional to assuming log-normality in returns, \"classical\" BSM-type models also (implicitly) assume the existence of a credit-risk-free environment, where one can perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge, and then discount at \"the\" risk-free-rate.  \nAnd therefore, post crisis, the various x-value adjustments must be employed, effectively correcting the risk-neutral value for [[counterparty credit risk|counterparty-]] and [[XVA#Valuation_adjustments|funding-related]] risk.\nThese xVA are ''additional'' to any smile or surface effect. This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no \"[[double counting (accounting)|double counting]]\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...) \n\nAs mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly [[financial engineering]]) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above \"extreme event\" approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. \nRecognizing this, [[James Rickards]], amongst other critics of financial economics, suggests that, instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely: \n:\"The  current  system,  based  on  the  idea  that  risk  is  distributed  in  the  shape  of  a  bell  curve,  is  flawed...  The  problem  is  [that economists and practitioners]  never  abandon  the  bell  curve.

Recently, however, researchers in [[experimental economics]] and [[experimental finance]] have challenged this assumption [[Empirical evidence|empirically]]. These assumptions are also challenged [[Theory|theoretically]], by [[behavioral finance]], a discipline primarily concerned with the limits to rationality of economic agents.\n\nConsistent with, and complementary to these findings, various persistent [[Market anomaly|market anomalies]] have been documented, these being price and/or return distortions\u2014e.g. [[size premium]]s\u2014which appear to contradict the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]; [[calendar effect]]s are the best known group here. Related to these are various of the [[economic puzzle]]s, concerning phenomena similarly contradicting the theory. The ''[[equity premium puzzle]]'', as one example, arises in that the difference between the observed returns on stocks as compared to government bonds is consistently higher than the [[risk premium]] rational equity investors should demand, an \"[[abnormal return]]\".

On 27 May 1970 [[Don Whillans]] and [[Dougal Haston]] reached the summit of [[Annapurna I]] which at {{convert|26545|ft}} is the highest peak in the [[Annapurna Massif]] in [[Nepal]]. [[Chris Bonington]] led the expedition which approached up a glacier from the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] and then used rock climbing techniques to put [[fixed rope]]s up the steep South Face. Although the plan had been to use supplementary oxygen, in the event it was not possible to carry any cylinders high enough for the lead climbers to use on their summit bid.\n\nLow down on the mountain, on 30 May as the expedition was about to leave, [[Ian Clough]] was killed by a falling [[serac]]. Several members of the expedition rose to fame in Britain, and as a whole the expedition received international recognition in mountaineering circles on account of its innovative and extremely difficult nature.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Annapurna ===\n{{see also|Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal}}\nThe [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna massif]] is in the [[Eastern Himalaya]]a region of Nepal where for over one hundred years the ruling [[Rana dynasty]]  had not allowed explorers or mountaineers to enter the country.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=238\u2013241}}{{sfnp|Ward|Clark|1992}} In 1950 Nepal at last gave permission for the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition]], to attempt [[Dhaulagiri]] or [[Annapurna I Main|Annapurna I]], the two highest peaks in the Annapurna region. The expedition, led by [[Maurice Herzog]], mounted a successful summit attempt via the North Face. For most Himalayan mountains the easiest route to the summit is along a ridge route but for Annapurna the North Face is not too steep (though it is very exposed to avalanches) and the route subsequently turned out to be the easiest.{{sfnp|Herzog|1954|pp=48,54,57,102\u2013103}}{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=242\u2013253,387}} Although it was the first climbed of the eight-thousanders, Annapurna is not often climbed and there is a high death rate among those attempting it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adam |first1=Voiland |title=The Eight-Thousanders |url=https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/8000MeterPeaks |website=www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |date=16 December 2013 |access-date=18 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503184334/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/8000MeterPeaks/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Start of rock climbing in Himalaya ===\nAfter years of stagnation between the wars, British rock climbing underwent a renaissance, particularly with working-class climbing clubs starting up in the north of England and Scotland. The [[Rock and Ice Club]] in [[Manchester]], the Creagh Dhu Mountaineering Club in [[Glasgow]] and several university climbing clubs were amongst those that engendered a highly competitive climbing environment. At [[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]] in Wales numerous routes of a very high standard were achieved using strictly [[free climbing]] techniques. [[Hamish MacInnes]] and [[Dougal Haston]], although not members, climbed with Creagh Dhu and MacInnes had mentored [[Chris Bonington]]'s youthful climbing as early as 1953.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nIn 1960, Bonington, as a member of a joint British\u2013Indian\u2013Nepalese army team led by [[J. O. M. Roberts|Jimmy Roberts]], reached the summit of the {{convert|26039|ft|adj=on}} [[Annapurna II]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of the range's main summit, Annapurna I. The route did not involve rock climbing.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=347,387}}\n\n[[Mount Everest]] was ascended in 1963 by an American team along [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1963|a deliberately difficult route along its West Ridge]].{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=387}}  Two years later, when planning with the American [[John Harlin]] for Harlin's ''direttissima'' attempt on the [[Eigerwand|North Face of the Eiger]], Harlin introduced Bonington to the American [[Big wall climbing|big wall]] technique of directly ascending a [[fixed rope]] using [[Jumar]]s.{{sfnp|Harlin|2008|pp=109\u2013111}} Harlin fell to his death and Haston's success on the route were reported on by Bonington and [[Mick Burke (mountaineer)|Mick Burke]] who were on the North Face as climbing journalist and cameraman.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=246}} The publicity led to the televising of a climb of the [[Old Man of Hoy]] in Scotland, this time featuring Bonington and Haston.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=231}} From this start, commercial sponsorship became a possibility for rock climbing and more elaborate and ambitious expeditions could be planned. With all fourteen [[Eight-thousander|8000-metre peaks]] climbed by 1964, Himalayan expeditions using rock climbing routes became an opportunity Bonington wanted to seize.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nEncouraged by Roberts, Bonington conceived of the idea of climbing [[Annapurna]] by its South Face which he realised was going to require not just rock climbing but also [[Expedition style|siege climbing tactics]] because the ascent would take many weeks. No one had tried rock climbing at high altitude before.

Bonington and Burke relocated the lower part of the route hoping to make it suitable for porters.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=64\u201372}}\n\nThe ridge they were to use at the start of the climb was straightforwardly approached across the glacier but steep cliff barred the way onto the ridge itself so they skirted these on the right to reach a site for Camp II, lower than hoped for but with nowhere suitable immediately higher. For a short distance the route was seriously threatened by an ice overhang which they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" but they decided to reduce the risk by moving under it as quickly as possible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=73\u201377}}\n\nWhen he arrived with the main baggage Clough was supposed to stop at Hinko Cave overnight on 7 April but, due to confusing instructions, with his entourage of 240 porters he continued on in a snowstorm to temporary base camp some miles further on. Some porters had refused to go beyond Hinko Cave and the rest, overloaded and without adequate clothes and shoes in the bad weather, variously got into states of anger and collapse. However, now the main gear had arrived, it was possible to sort out shelter under cover for the night and provide medical help when necessary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=79\u201381}} On this same day Whillans and Haston had reached the Ice Ridge at a col where Camp III was to be established. They had to climb through deep snow in bad weather. In ten days the expedition had got from the Sanctuary to half height on the face, although with the difficult climbing all to be done further ahead. They [[abseil]]ed down to Camp II from where, next day, they started placing fixed ropes towards the col.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=81\u201383}}\n\nOn 11 March Boysen and Estcourt established Camp III on the col, where there were to be two Whillans Box tents at a spacious location, free from risk of avalanches or falling rocks.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=85,98}} The version used on Annapurna, designed by Whillans, was [[cuboid]] in shape, {{convert|6.5|x|4.0|x|4|ft}}, made of socketed aluminium tubes covered in nylon top and bottom and cotton-[[terylene]] at the sides. It was strengthened with nylon webbing straps and at one end was a nylon-zipped entrance. An inner nylon tent was available but not always used. It weighed {{convert|30|lb}}{{refn|group=note|In comparison the nylon tents of a hooped design, Bonington calls them RAFMA tents, weighed only {{convert|10|lb}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=251}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=66\u201367,249\u2013250}}\n\nOn 12 April, after Bonington had organised the logistics of getting Base Camp fully set up and equipped, he and Frost set from there so that on 14 April they could start to prospect a route up the Ice Ridge above Camp III. After investigating a snow shelf leading to a gully on the west of the ridge, Bonington decided avalanches posed too great a threat so he joined Frost who was ascending along the actual crest of the ridge. However, this turned out to be much more difficult than they had expected with snow too soft and loose for firm [[piton]] placements and there would be a need to set [[fixed rope]]s all the way up the ridge. Also, they had not formed a plan for placing fixed ropes \u2013 should the lead climber fix his rope or should he climb normally leaving the second climber to pay out a rope from his rucksack, fixing it as he climbed? To begin with the latter method seemed more successful but progress was dreadfully slow with Bonington never having previously encountered such appalling snow.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=86\u201391}} Later in the expedition the technique changed and they climbed using their {{convert|9|mm|adj=on}} fixed rope which they then secured with pitons and [[karabiner]]s, not using their {{convert|11|mm|adj=on}} climbing rope at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=247}}\n\nThat night at Camp III they discussed their religious beliefs \u2013 Bonington was a sceptic and Frost a [[Morman]]. Bonington wrote to his wife \"He is a convinced and fervent Mormon, never rams it down your throat, yet his faith has given him a code of conduct that puts him way out in front of most of us\". Next day it was straightforward to re-climb their fixed rope but again onward climbing was extremely difficult. On the previous day and this one Whillans and Haston had been ferrying supplies from Camp II up to Camp III and following their second climb they starting exploring the shelf which Bonington had investigated previously beside the ridge. Here they made such good progress that the pair on the ridge needed little persuasion to abandon  entirely their efforts on the lowest part of the ridge.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=91\u201395}}\n\nNext day all four climbers set off along the shelf with Haston breaking trail and never surrendering the lead. The avalanche risk was considerable even though they kept their distance from the ridge and matters got worse as they reached the gully threatened by avalanches from ice cliffs thousands of feet above and by [[Snow cornice|cornices]] on the ridge itself. They decided to avoid the gully by climbing a minor [[ar\u00eate]] which led from the foot of the gully up to a high point on the main ridge but they had to leave a [[deadman anchor]] when deteriorating weather forced them to retreat to camp. Next day Bonington and Frost got within {{convert|50|ft}} of the crest of the Ice Ridge but again bad weather forced a retreat.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=95\u201399}}\n\nBy 18 April only {{convert|1000|ft}} had been gained since the Col had been reached eleven days earlier and from Base Camp and on 19 April Haston again ascended the minor ar\u00eate where the way to the main ridge was blocked by huge cornices but he found he could slip through gaps in the rotten snow between the wall of the ridge and one of the cornices. However, after reaching the crest of main ridge and fixing a rope he was forced back by the weather. At last, two days later, he was able to reach the Ice Ridge and find an ideal place for Camp IV.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=102\u2013109}}\n\nThe expedition was unexpectedly enhanced when four trekkers \u2013 the Sherpas called them the \"London Sherpas\" \u2013 turned up at Base Camp completely unexpectedly.{{refn|group=note|The trekkers had left [[Essex]] in England in 1969 in a [[Land Rover]], planning to climb in the [[Hindu Kush]]. Delayed in Austria they had spent the winter in Afghanistan and then had driven to Kathmandu, flown to Pokhara, trekked over to the foothills of [[Dhaulagiri]] and crossed to Chomro via the Deroli Pass intending to reach the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=109}} The Deroli Pass, now more usually referred to as the [[Deurali Pass]], is on the [[Annapurna Circuit]] trail, near [[Ghorepani]] and [[Poon Hill]].}} In return for \"board and lodging\" the two men helped carry loads even as high as Camp IV and the women helped at Base Camp where Bonington thought their presence engendered a more a civilised and relaxed air. Other trekkers also turned up to get a grandstand view of the climb and to help carrying loads.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n===Camp IV to Camp V on the Rock Band===\nBoysen, Estcourt, Haston and Whillans worked together establishing Camp IV but the situation at Camp III became critical after several attempts to supply it from Camp II had failed because of deep snow and avalanches. Eventually an overnight carry was successful and in general it seemed the snow conditions improved the higher one got up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=110\u2013114}}\n\nBoysen and Estcourt tackled the upper part of the Ice Ridge above Camp IV which was very narrow with cornices to the left but solid rock on the right. At one point Boysen's progress was blocked except for a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} tunnel which he could clamber through, without his rucksack, as if potholing. The tunnel led not further up the ridge but out onto an ice cliff with a {{convert|2000|ft|adj=on}} drop to the glacier. However, he managed to climb onto and up the cliff despite the drag of his climbing rope passing along a highly contorted route behind him. When he reached safety he had let out {{convert|150|ft}} of rope in ascending only {{convert|50|ft}}. It was the most difficult ice climb Boysen had ever done. There was no direct way for Estcourt to ascend to Boysen's stance so he had to repeat the circuitous climb. Boysen's next lead again went on to a traverse, which was later called the \"Terrible Traverse\", which he was not able to complete before descending to Camp IV for the night. They had spent all day climbing {{convert|300|ft}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=115\u2013119,125}} Next day it again proved impossible to keep to the crest of the ridge but a descent on the right to solid rock gave access to an ice-covered rock wall leading upwards. This climb had to be without the rope being secured with pitons because the rope would have jammed along its contorted route. They regained the ridge again only some {{convert|50|ft}} higher than they had reached the previous day. The following day they extended their route slightly further. After that they had to go down to recover from exhaustion but the fixed ropes they had left allowed everyone following to take a direct line though one that was neither safe nor easy.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=119\u2013121,125}}\n\nBonington and Clough took over the work of extending the route, reaching Camp IV on 27 April. Sometimes they advanced only {{convert|10|ft}} in an hour.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=123\u2013128}} At Whillans' suggestion, they arranged for Sherpas to carry all the climbers'supplies up to Camp III so that when climbers went down to rest they only needed to go to Camp III rather than Base Camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=128}} After a few very difficult days, and without being able to regain the crest of the Ice Ridge at a higher point, Clough went down to be replaced by Haston. On 3 May Whillans, Frost and Burke carried a box tent up to Camp IV while Bonington and Haston with very difficult ice climbing reached a col at {{convert|21650|ft}} where the Ice Ridge terminates to be replaced by a snow slope leading up to the Ice Wall.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=124\u2013141}} Next day they carried a load of ropes to the col and Haston ran out {{convert|500|ft}} of rope towards the Ice Wall. At {{convert|22350|ft}} the slope suddenly changes from 45\u00b0 to vertical and this point was planned to become Camp V{{refn|group=note|The site turned out to be very poor so the camp here was only temporary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=149}}}} where a {{convert|18|lb|adj=on}} hooped tent was set up, capable of sleeping three. Supplying as high as here was a logistical problem because it took at least five days for anything to arrive from base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141,251}}\n\nSupported by Frost and Burke, Whillans and Haston established Camp V but that night spindrift  inundated the site and the tent so they decided to find a better camp location. Next day they explored the Ice Wall finding a \"gangway\" leading to the top of the Ice Wall and the foot of the Rock Band. At this point the overhang of the [[bergschrund]], although threatening, provided excellent shelter so they proposed moving Camp V to this point. On 9 May Frost and Burke established the camp at the new, higher location.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141\u2013153}} The climb from Camp IV to V was very long and difficult so two intermediate dumps{{refn|group=note|The lower of the dumps was at the top of the Ice Ridge and the other was at the original site for Camp V at the bottom of the Ice Wall.}} for supplies were used with carrying being done in shorter sections from above and below.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=149\u2013150,154,178}}\n\n===Above Camp V===\n[[File:Tom Frost - South Face of Annapurna - 1970.jpg|thumb|Photograph by Frost: Boysen descending to Camp IV after carrying supplies up to Camp V.]]\nFrost and Burke started on the Rock Band which sloped at about 50\u00b0{{refn|group=note|Bonington likens this to the Second Ice Field on the [[Nordwand|North face of the Eiger]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=160}}}} Instead of taking the most direct line up a groove leading straight upwards, they cut over to the left aiming for the \"Flat Iron\", named after the similar-looking feature on the Eiger, with Burke doing the lead climbing. The good weather helped with the climbing but because of the thaw they were bombarded  from above by falling rocks. The climbers Further down the mountain were having to rest through illness or exhaustion so shortages of rope, oxygen, tents, food and fuel built up towards Camp V. On 12 May Burke and Frost made more progress but only through taking serious risks with inadequate piton placements but when they turned back for the day a storm hit them and their tent was almost buried. Fortunately by that time fresh supplies had arrived from lower camps.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154\u2013172}}\n\nBonington's general plan had been to pair off the leading climbers and to share the work of the pairs equitably by having periods of rest, carrying supplies to higher camps and extending the route. The Sherpas were carrying higher up the mountain than expected and other trekkers with climbing experience had turned up by chance and helped out. However at the higher camps things were not going so well and so on 13 May Bonington decided that when Frost and Burke came down to be rested they would be replaced by Whillans and Haston. In fact it was the turn of Estcourt and Boysen to force the route upwards but they had been working hard doing carrying while Whillans and Haston were rested. Over the radio between various camps some of the adversely affected climbers complained but were accepting it after Bonington agreed for Whillans and Haston to do a single carry before rotating into the lead. Whillans then started criticising Burke and Frost for making very slow progress on the Rock Band and so, to curtail the increasing bitterness, the radio call was ended leaving each pair to plan the detail of their newly assigned roles.{{refn|group=note|Bonington did not think Whillans' criticisms were at all fair. Indeed Burke and Frost has worked hard and made good progress.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=182}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=173\u2013180}}\n\nOn their last day in the lead Burke and Frost, possibly goaded by the criticism, managed to fix ropes up all the way to the Flat Iron. Burke had been on the face for 28 days, and Frost only slightly less \u2013 Bonington thought Burke's climb had been on the most exacting rock of the entire expedition. When Frost met Bonington down at Camp II he firmly told him he thought the stab in the back of Estcourt and Boysen had wrecked the morale of the expedition \u2013 all the same he maintained his close relationship with Bonington.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=180\u2013184}}\n\nOn 17 May Boysen, Whillans and Haston carried equipment to the top of the Flat Iron to a suitable site for Camp VI but on the way Boysen had to return to camp to recover. Whillans and Haston found a site for Camp VI but that night at Camp V the ridge tent was crushed with an avalanche of snow so Estcourt and Haston went down to the upper dump to collect the one intended for Camp VII and to get more food. Climbing back to Camp VI on 19 May, Haston's rucksack, containing his personal gear and food for Camp VI, fell down the mountain. So, that night, Whillans was alone at Camp VII with no food after the others had descended. Estcourt was alone at Camp V and so Bonington went up there to help him support the lead team. The climb from there to Camp VI was even more tiring and Bonington scarcely managed the {{convert|200|ft|adj=on}} [[jumar]] climb near the top. However, he managed and even took the time on his way down to relocate the dangling rope and place further [[piton]]s on this [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitch]] of the climb. As for oxygen, there were only three bottles at Camp V and another three at the upper dump. There was hardly any food or rope at Camp VI.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154,185\u2013195}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=205\u2013209}}\n\nOn 20 May Haston returned to Camp VI where Whillans had been without food for over twenty-four hours. Bonington carried up there more food and a radio but had to dump the rope slightly below the camp. Camp VI was a terrible place \u2013 the tent was too large to fit on the ledge so Whillans and Haston had to sleep lying across the width of the tent. Also, the wind was severe and it was only held by two tent pegs, a rope over the top, and the weight of the climbers.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=209\u2013209}} The same day Estcourt carried the oxygen bottles up to Camp V from the upper dump and the lead climbers climbed {{convert|400|ft}} up from Camp VI but they were then out of food and rope and had no tent to pitch for Camp VII which they intended to place at the top of the Rock Band. They heard news that the army team on the other side of the mountain had reached the summit using a similar route to that of the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition|French expedition in 1950]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=196\u2013200}}\n\nOn 22 May Bonington and Estcourt headed up with supplies and oxygen cylinders towards Camp VI but Estcourt had to retreat back and Bonington, who was using supplementary oxygen, had to abandon the tent and oxygen ''en route''. Haston and Whillans had reached the top of the \"mini rock band\" at the top of the Rock Band but, with no rope left, they had needed to climb without protection, leaving only about {{convert|1500|ft}} to the summit, they estimated.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=200\u2013202}} They had reached the {{convert|25000|ft|adj=on}} snowfield above the Rock Band but without a tent or food. Next day Bonington carried tent, cin\u00e9 camera and food up from V to VI but he had needed to abandon his personal gear so he had to turn down an offer to join then on a summit attempt, Bonington and so had to go down again but the tent could be carried up next day to be left on the snow field above Camp VI. On 23 May with insufficient rope and no tent for Camp VII, the lead climbers took a rest day.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=212\u2013216,224}}\n\nIn terrible conditions on 24 May Bonington and Clough managed a carry to Camp VI but found Haston and Whillans had been forced back there so all four climbers had to spend the night together in the two-man tent. Bonington and Clough got back to Camp IV but once there the weather became impossible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\n===Summit===\nFor the next two days the entire mountain was snowbound and it seemed the monsoon had arrived but on 27 May 1970 at Camp VI there was an improvement in the weather. Leaving Camp VI about 07:00, without supplementary oxygen because they had none, Whillans and Haston reached the snow field at 11:00 from where they could see the summit through breaks in the cloud. They agreed to move the tent up to establish a camp at a higher location but they really had a more ambitious goal for the day. Indeed, any camp would be entirely lacking food or sleeping bags. They were faced with an ice plateau leading to a snow ridge and then an {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} cliff of mixed ice and rock rising up to the top of the mountain. They abandoned the tent at the foot of the ridge and climbed on without [[belay]]s. Neither climber had any difficulty with breathing.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\nThe last fifty feet of the ice cliff was vertical though there were good holds and as they reached the northern side of the mountain the wind dropped. They could see traces of army boot footprints but the flag that had been left a week earlier by the army expedition had blown away. Haston took a cin\u00e9 film of Whillans reaching the summit and then they swapped places. From the top, which they reached at 14:30 and stayed for about 10 minutes, they could see the other two Annapurna summits but nothing more. With no feeling of exhilaration, which they knew would come later. They had {{convert|150|ft}} of rope which, after they had abseiled down, was all there was left on the summit. By 17:00 they had managed the difficult descent to Camp VI.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Day|2010|p=188}}{{sfnp|Frost|1971|p=232}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=427}}\n\nLower down the mountain everyone had been completely stormbound but Bonington, having been confined to Camp IV, put in his routine 17:00 radio call asking Haston if they had been able to get out of their camp. Due to static on the radio he did not hear the reply \"Aye, we've just climbed Annapurna\" but this was heard load and clear at Base Camp and the news spread rapidly up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=204}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|p=219}}\n\n===Leaving the mountain===\nBurke and Frost wanted to make their own attempt on the summit and, contrary to his better judgement, Bonington agreed subject to the clearing of the camps proceeding at the same time. So on 28 May, Burke and Frost while Whillans and Haston descended, reaching Camp III at midday. Everyone was very excited but were held back by their British formality. Only by evening did Frost and Burke reach Camp VI. On 29 May they made their attempt but Burke had to turn back and Frost, having reached the snowfield, stayed there almost three hours but then, because it was the Lord's will, turned back in ferocious wind.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=220\u2013224}}\n\nOn 30 May the mountain was being cleared apace with most of the party reaching Base Camp when Thompson rushed down, calling out in despair. He and Clough had been passing under the place of the \"Sword of Damocles\" when a [[serac]] fell creating an avalanche which had killed Clough.{{refn|group=note|The overhanging wall of ice they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" had collapsed on 23 May so they thought the location had become less dangerous.

On 27 May 1970 [[Don Whillans]] and [[Dougal Haston]] reached the summit of [[Annapurna I]] which at {{convert|26545|ft}} is the highest peak in the [[Annapurna Massif]] in [[Nepal]]. [[Chris Bonington]] led the expedition which approached up a glacier from the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] and then used rock climbing techniques to put [[fixed rope]]s up the steep South Face. Although the plan had been to use supplementary oxygen, in the event it was not possible to carry any cylinders high enough for the lead climbers to use on their summit bid.\n\nLow down on the mountain, on 30 May as the expedition was about to leave, [[Ian Clough]] was killed by a falling [[serac]]. Several members of the expedition rose to fame in Britain, and as a whole the expedition received international recognition in mountaineering circles on account of its innovative and extremely difficult nature.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Annapurna ===\n{{see also|Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal}}\nThe [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna massif]] is in the [[Eastern Himalaya]]a region of Nepal where for over one hundred years the ruling [[Rana dynasty]]  had not allowed explorers or mountaineers to enter the country.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=238\u2013241}}{{sfnp|Ward|Clark|1992}} In 1950 Nepal at last gave permission for the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition]], to attempt [[Dhaulagiri]] or [[Annapurna I Main|Annapurna I]], the two highest peaks in the Annapurna region. The expedition, led by [[Maurice Herzog]], mounted a successful summit attempt via the North Face. For most Himalayan mountains the easiest route to the summit is along a ridge route but for Annapurna the North Face is not too steep (though it is very exposed to avalanches) and the route subsequently turned out to be the easiest.{{sfnp|Herzog|1954|pp=48,54,57,102\u2013103}}{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=242\u2013253,387}} Although it was the first climbed of the eight-thousanders, Annapurna is not often climbed and there is a high death rate among those attempting it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adam |first1=Voiland |title=The Eight-Thousanders |url=https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/8000MeterPeaks |website=www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |date=16 December 2013 |access-date=18 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503184334/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/8000MeterPeaks/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Start of rock climbing in Himalaya ===\nAfter years of stagnation between the wars, British rock climbing underwent a renaissance, particularly with working-class climbing clubs starting up in the north of England and Scotland. The [[Rock and Ice Club]] in [[Manchester]], the Creagh Dhu Mountaineering Club in [[Glasgow]] and several university climbing clubs were amongst those that engendered a highly competitive climbing environment. At [[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]] in Wales numerous routes of a very high standard were achieved using strictly [[free climbing]] techniques. [[Hamish MacInnes]] and [[Dougal Haston]], although not members, climbed with Creagh Dhu and MacInnes had mentored [[Chris Bonington]]'s youthful climbing as early as 1953.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nIn 1960, Bonington, as a member of a joint British\u2013Indian\u2013Nepalese army team led by [[J. O. M. Roberts|Jimmy Roberts]], reached the summit of the {{convert|26039|ft|adj=on}} [[Annapurna II]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of the range's main summit, Annapurna I. The route did not involve rock climbing.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=347,387}}\n\n[[Mount Everest]] was ascended in 1963 by an American team along [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1963|a deliberately difficult route along its West Ridge]].{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=387}}  Two years later, when planning with the American [[John Harlin]] for Harlin's ''direttissima'' attempt on the [[Eigerwand|North Face of the Eiger]], Harlin introduced Bonington to the American [[Big wall climbing|big wall]] technique of directly ascending a [[fixed rope]] using [[Jumar]]s.{{sfnp|Harlin|2008|pp=109\u2013111}} Harlin fell to his death and Haston's success on the route were reported on by Bonington and [[Mick Burke (mountaineer)|Mick Burke]] who were on the North Face as climbing journalist and cameraman.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=246}} The publicity led to the televising of a climb of the [[Old Man of Hoy]] in Scotland, this time featuring Bonington and Haston.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=231}} From this start, commercial sponsorship became a possibility for rock climbing and more elaborate and ambitious expeditions could be planned. With all fourteen [[Eight-thousander|8000-metre peaks]] climbed by 1964, Himalayan expeditions using rock climbing routes became an opportunity Bonington wanted to seize.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nEncouraged by Roberts, Bonington conceived of the idea of climbing [[Annapurna]] by its South Face which he realised was going to require not just rock climbing but also [[Expedition style|siege climbing tactics]] because the ascent would take many weeks. No one had tried rock climbing at high altitude before. The face itself was almost twice as high as the {{convert|6000|ft}} [[Eigerwand]] and even above the rock band there was another {{convert|3000|ft}} to the summit.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971b|p=18\u201333}}{{sfnp|Bonington|2017|p=155}}{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}  The topography near the summit could be assessed from photographs Bonington had taken on the Annapurna II expedition of ten years earlier.{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=411}}\n\n===Planning===\n{{external media|topic=Clip from TV programme|Annapurna|title=Annapurna South Face|headerimage=|caption=\n|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQE_65nk_p4 Annapurna: The Hardest Way Up]{{sfnp|Edwards|1971}}}}\nWith financial support for the expedition from the [[Mount Everest Foundation]], Bonington assembled a team from amongst his friends: [[Nick Estcourt]], [[Martin Boysen]], [[Ian Clough]], Mike Thompson, Burke and Haston. Advised to include an American to boost sales of the book he was planning, Bonington appointed [[Tom Frost]] who had considerable [[big wall]] experience in [[Yosemite]] as well as \u2013 secretly at the time \u2013 [[Nanda Devi]] on a [[Nanda Devi#CIA mission|CIA mission]] to install a nuclear-powered listening device for monitoring [[China and weapons of mass destruction|Chinese missiles]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}} Frost was known to and respected by Haston and [[Don Whillans]]. Whillans was to be deputy leader for, although by then he was an overweight heavy drinker and smoker who disliked Bonington, he had more Himalayan experience than any other British mountaineer still active.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=389\u2013390}} Indeed, only he, Bonington and Clough had been to Himalaya at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1986|p=16}} Also included as climbers were [[Kelvin Kent (mountaineer)|Kelvin Kent]], base camp manager, and David Lambert, the doctor.

Bonington and Burke relocated the lower part of the route hoping to make it suitable for porters.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=64\u201372}}\n\nThe ridge they were to use at the start of the climb was straightforwardly approached across the glacier but steep cliff barred the way onto the ridge itself so they skirted these on the right to reach a site for Camp II, lower than hoped for but with nowhere suitable immediately higher. For a short distance the route was seriously threatened by an ice overhang which they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" but they decided to reduce the risk by moving under it as quickly as possible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=73\u201377}}\n\nWhen he arrived with the main baggage Clough was supposed to stop at Hinko Cave overnight on 7 April but, due to confusing instructions, with his entourage of 240 porters he continued on in a snowstorm to temporary base camp some miles further on. Some porters had refused to go beyond Hinko Cave and the rest, overloaded and without adequate clothes and shoes in the bad weather, variously got into states of anger and collapse. However, now the main gear had arrived, it was possible to sort out shelter under cover for the night and provide medical help when necessary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=79\u201381}} On this same day Whillans and Haston had reached the Ice Ridge at a col where Camp III was to be established. They had to climb through deep snow in bad weather. In ten days the expedition had got from the Sanctuary to half height on the face, although with the difficult climbing all to be done further ahead. They [[abseil]]ed down to Camp II from where, next day, they started placing fixed ropes towards the col.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=81\u201383}}\n\nOn 11 March Boysen and Estcourt established Camp III on the col, where there were to be two Whillans Box tents at a spacious location, free from risk of avalanches or falling rocks.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=85,98}} The version used on Annapurna, designed by Whillans, was [[cuboid]] in shape, {{convert|6.5|x|4.0|x|4|ft}}, made of socketed aluminium tubes covered in nylon top and bottom and cotton-[[terylene]] at the sides. It was strengthened with nylon webbing straps and at one end was a nylon-zipped entrance. An inner nylon tent was available but not always used. It weighed {{convert|30|lb}}{{refn|group=note|In comparison the nylon tents of a hooped design, Bonington calls them RAFMA tents, weighed only {{convert|10|lb}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=251}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=66\u201367,249\u2013250}}\n\nOn 12 April, after Bonington had organised the logistics of getting Base Camp fully set up and equipped, he and Frost set from there so that on 14 April they could start to prospect a route up the Ice Ridge above Camp III. After investigating a snow shelf leading to a gully on the west of the ridge, Bonington decided avalanches posed too great a threat so he joined Frost who was ascending along the actual crest of the ridge. However, this turned out to be much more difficult than they had expected with snow too soft and loose for firm [[piton]] placements and there would be a need to set [[fixed rope]]s all the way up the ridge. Also, they had not formed a plan for placing fixed ropes \u2013 should the lead climber fix his rope or should he climb normally leaving the second climber to pay out a rope from his rucksack, fixing it as he climbed? To begin with the latter method seemed more successful but progress was dreadfully slow with Bonington never having previously encountered such appalling snow.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=86\u201391}} Later in the expedition the technique changed and they climbed using their {{convert|9|mm|adj=on}} fixed rope which they then secured with pitons and [[karabiner]]s, not using their {{convert|11|mm|adj=on}} climbing rope at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=247}}\n\nThat night at Camp III they discussed their religious beliefs \u2013 Bonington was a sceptic and Frost a [[Morman]]. Bonington wrote to his wife \"He is a convinced and fervent Mormon, never rams it down your throat, yet his faith has given him a code of conduct that puts him way out in front of most of us\". Next day it was straightforward to re-climb their fixed rope but again onward climbing was extremely difficult. On the previous day and this one Whillans and Haston had been ferrying supplies from Camp II up to Camp III and following their second climb they starting exploring the shelf which Bonington had investigated previously beside the ridge. Here they made such good progress that the pair on the ridge needed little persuasion to abandon  entirely their efforts on the lowest part of the ridge.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=91\u201395}}\n\nNext day all four climbers set off along the shelf with Haston breaking trail and never surrendering the lead. The avalanche risk was considerable even though they kept their distance from the ridge and matters got worse as they reached the gully threatened by avalanches from ice cliffs thousands of feet above and by [[Snow cornice|cornices]] on the ridge itself. They decided to avoid the gully by climbing a minor [[ar\u00eate]] which led from the foot of the gully up to a high point on the main ridge but they had to leave a [[deadman anchor]] when deteriorating weather forced them to retreat to camp. Next day Bonington and Frost got within {{convert|50|ft}} of the crest of the Ice Ridge but again bad weather forced a retreat.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=95\u201399}}\n\nBy 18 April only {{convert|1000|ft}} had been gained since the Col had been reached eleven days earlier and from Base Camp and on 19 April Haston again ascended the minor ar\u00eate where the way to the main ridge was blocked by huge cornices but he found he could slip through gaps in the rotten snow between the wall of the ridge and one of the cornices. However, after reaching the crest of main ridge and fixing a rope he was forced back by the weather. At last, two days later, he was able to reach the Ice Ridge and find an ideal place for Camp IV.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=102\u2013109}}\n\nThe expedition was unexpectedly enhanced when four trekkers \u2013 the Sherpas called them the \"London Sherpas\" \u2013 turned up at Base Camp completely unexpectedly.{{refn|group=note|The trekkers had left [[Essex]] in England in 1969 in a [[Land Rover]], planning to climb in the [[Hindu Kush]]. Delayed in Austria they had spent the winter in Afghanistan and then had driven to Kathmandu, flown to Pokhara, trekked over to the foothills of [[Dhaulagiri]] and crossed to Chomro via the Deroli Pass intending to reach the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=109}} The Deroli Pass, now more usually referred to as the [[Deurali Pass]], is on the [[Annapurna Circuit]] trail, near [[Ghorepani]] and [[Poon Hill]].}} In return for \"board and lodging\" the two men helped carry loads even as high as Camp IV and the women helped at Base Camp where Bonington thought their presence engendered a more a civilised and relaxed air. Other trekkers also turned up to get a grandstand view of the climb and to help carrying loads.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n===Camp IV to Camp V on the Rock Band===\nBoysen, Estcourt, Haston and Whillans worked together establishing Camp IV but the situation at Camp III became critical after several attempts to supply it from Camp II had failed because of deep snow and avalanches. Eventually an overnight carry was successful and in general it seemed the snow conditions improved the higher one got up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=110\u2013114}}\n\nBoysen and Estcourt tackled the upper part of the Ice Ridge above Camp IV which was very narrow with cornices to the left but solid rock on the right. At one point Boysen's progress was blocked except for a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} tunnel which he could clamber through, without his rucksack, as if potholing. The tunnel led not further up the ridge but out onto an ice cliff with a {{convert|2000|ft|adj=on}} drop to the glacier. However, he managed to climb onto and up the cliff despite the drag of his climbing rope passing along a highly contorted route behind him. When he reached safety he had let out {{convert|150|ft}} of rope in ascending only {{convert|50|ft}}. It was the most difficult ice climb Boysen had ever done. There was no direct way for Estcourt to ascend to Boysen's stance so he had to repeat the circuitous climb. Boysen's next lead again went on to a traverse, which was later called the \"Terrible Traverse\", which he was not able to complete before descending to Camp IV for the night. They had spent all day climbing {{convert|300|ft}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=115\u2013119,125}} Next day it again proved impossible to keep to the crest of the ridge but a descent on the right to solid rock gave access to an ice-covered rock wall leading upwards. This climb had to be without the rope being secured with pitons because the rope would have jammed along its contorted route. They regained the ridge again only some {{convert|50|ft}} higher than they had reached the previous day. The following day they extended their route slightly further. After that they had to go down to recover from exhaustion but the fixed ropes they had left allowed everyone following to take a direct line though one that was neither safe nor easy.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=119\u2013121,125}}\n\nBonington and Clough took over the work of extending the route, reaching Camp IV on 27 April. Sometimes they advanced only {{convert|10|ft}} in an hour.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=123\u2013128}} At Whillans' suggestion, they arranged for Sherpas to carry all the climbers'supplies up to Camp III so that when climbers went down to rest they only needed to go to Camp III rather than Base Camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=128}} After a few very difficult days, and without being able to regain the crest of the Ice Ridge at a higher point, Clough went down to be replaced by Haston. On 3 May Whillans, Frost and Burke carried a box tent up to Camp IV while Bonington and Haston with very difficult ice climbing reached a col at {{convert|21650|ft}} where the Ice Ridge terminates to be replaced by a snow slope leading up to the Ice Wall.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=124\u2013141}} Next day they carried a load of ropes to the col and Haston ran out {{convert|500|ft}} of rope towards the Ice Wall. At {{convert|22350|ft}} the slope suddenly changes from 45\u00b0 to vertical and this point was planned to become Camp V{{refn|group=note|The site turned out to be very poor so the camp here was only temporary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=149}}}} where a {{convert|18|lb|adj=on}} hooped tent was set up, capable of sleeping three. Supplying as high as here was a logistical problem because it took at least five days for anything to arrive from base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141,251}}\n\nSupported by Frost and Burke, Whillans and Haston established Camp V but that night spindrift  inundated the site and the tent so they decided to find a better camp location. Next day they explored the Ice Wall finding a \"gangway\" leading to the top of the Ice Wall and the foot of the Rock Band. At this point the overhang of the [[bergschrund]], although threatening, provided excellent shelter so they proposed moving Camp V to this point. On 9 May Frost and Burke established the camp at the new, higher location.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141\u2013153}} The climb from Camp IV to V was very long and difficult so two intermediate dumps{{refn|group=note|The lower of the dumps was at the top of the Ice Ridge and the other was at the original site for Camp V at the bottom of the Ice Wall.}} for supplies were used with carrying being done in shorter sections from above and below.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=149\u2013150,154,178}}\n\n===Above Camp V===\n[[File:Tom Frost - South Face of Annapurna - 1970.jpg|thumb|Photograph by Frost: Boysen descending to Camp IV after carrying supplies up to Camp V.]]\nFrost and Burke started on the Rock Band which sloped at about 50\u00b0{{refn|group=note|Bonington likens this to the Second Ice Field on the [[Nordwand|North face of the Eiger]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=160}}}} Instead of taking the most direct line up a groove leading straight upwards, they cut over to the left aiming for the \"Flat Iron\", named after the similar-looking feature on the Eiger, with Burke doing the lead climbing. The good weather helped with the climbing but because of the thaw they were bombarded  from above by falling rocks. The climbers Further down the mountain were having to rest through illness or exhaustion so shortages of rope, oxygen, tents, food and fuel built up towards Camp V. On 12 May Burke and Frost made more progress but only through taking serious risks with inadequate piton placements but when they turned back for the day a storm hit them and their tent was almost buried. Fortunately by that time fresh supplies had arrived from lower camps.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154\u2013172}}\n\nBonington's general plan had been to pair off the leading climbers and to share the work of the pairs equitably by having periods of rest, carrying supplies to higher camps and extending the route. The Sherpas were carrying higher up the mountain than expected and other trekkers with climbing experience had turned up by chance and helped out. However at the higher camps things were not going so well and so on 13 May Bonington decided that when Frost and Burke came down to be rested they would be replaced by Whillans and Haston. In fact it was the turn of Estcourt and Boysen to force the route upwards but they had been working hard doing carrying while Whillans and Haston were rested. Over the radio between various camps some of the adversely affected climbers complained but were accepting it after Bonington agreed for Whillans and Haston to do a single carry before rotating into the lead. Whillans then started criticising Burke and Frost for making very slow progress on the Rock Band and so, to curtail the increasing bitterness, the radio call was ended leaving each pair to plan the detail of their newly assigned roles.{{refn|group=note|Bonington did not think Whillans' criticisms were at all fair. Indeed Burke and Frost has worked hard and made good progress.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=182}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=173\u2013180}}\n\nOn their last day in the lead Burke and Frost, possibly goaded by the criticism, managed to fix ropes up all the way to the Flat Iron. Burke had been on the face for 28 days, and Frost only slightly less \u2013 Bonington thought Burke's climb had been on the most exacting rock of the entire expedition. When Frost met Bonington down at Camp II he firmly told him he thought the stab in the back of Estcourt and Boysen had wrecked the morale of the expedition \u2013 all the same he maintained his close relationship with Bonington.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=180\u2013184}}\n\nOn 17 May Boysen, Whillans and Haston carried equipment to the top of the Flat Iron to a suitable site for Camp VI but on the way Boysen had to return to camp to recover. Whillans and Haston found a site for Camp VI but that night at Camp V the ridge tent was crushed with an avalanche of snow so Estcourt and Haston went down to the upper dump to collect the one intended for Camp VII and to get more food. Climbing back to Camp VI on 19 May, Haston's rucksack, containing his personal gear and food for Camp VI, fell down the mountain. So, that night, Whillans was alone at Camp VII with no food after the others had descended. Estcourt was alone at Camp V and so Bonington went up there to help him support the lead team. The climb from there to Camp VI was even more tiring and Bonington scarcely managed the {convert|200|ft|adj=on}} [[jumar]] climb near the top. However, he managed and even took the time on his way down to relocate the dangling rope and place further [[piton]]s on this [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitch]] of the climb. As for oxygen, there were only three bottles at Camp V and another three at the upper dump. There was hardly any food or rope at Camp VI.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154,185\u2013195}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=205\u2013209}}\n\nOn 20 May Haston returned to Camp VI where Whillans had been without food for over twenty-four hours. Bonington carried up there more food and a radio but had to dump the rope slightly below the camp. Camp VI was a terrible place \u2013 the tent was too large to fit on the ledge so Whillans and Haston had to sleep lying across the width of the tent. Also, the wind was severe and it was only held by two tent pegs, a rope over the top, and the weight of the climbers.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=209\u2013209}} The same day Estcourt carried the oxygen bottles up to Camp V from the upper dump and the lead climbers climbed {{convert|400|ft}} up from Camp VI but they were then out of food and rope and had no tent to pitch for Camp VII which they intended to place at the top of the Rock Band. They heard news that the army team on the other side of the mountain had reached the summit using a similar route to that of the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition|French expedition in 1950]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=196\u2013200}}\n\nOn 22 May Bonington and Estcourt headed up with supplies and oxygen cylinders towards Camp VI but Estcourt had to retreat back and Bonington, who was using supplementary oxygen, had to abandon the tent and oxygen ''en route''. Haston and Whillans had reached the top of the \"mini rock band\" at the top of the Rock Band but, with no rope left, they had needed to climb without protection, leaving only about {{convert|1500|ft}} to the summit, they estimated.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=200\u2013202}} They had reached the {{convert|25000|ft|adj=on}} snowfield above the Rock Band but without a tent or food. Next day Bonington carried tent, cin\u00e9 camera and food up from V to VI but he had needed to abandon his personal gear so he had to turn down an offer to join then on a summit attempt, Bonington and so had to go down again but the tent could be carried up next day to be left on the snow field above Camp VI. On 23 May with insufficient rope and no tent for Camp VII, the lead climbers took a rest day.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=212\u2013216,224}}\n\nIn terrible conditions on 24 May Bonington and Clough managed a carry to Camp VI but found Haston and Whillans had been forced back there so all four climbers had to spend the night together in the two-man tent. Bonington and Clough got back to Camp IV but once there the weather became impossible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\n===Summit===\nFor the next two days the entire mountain was snowbound and it seemed the monsoon had arrived but on 27 May 1970 at Camp VI there was an improvement in the weather. Leaving Camp VI about 07:00, without supplementary oxygen because they had none, Whillans and Haston reached the snow field at 11:00 from where they could see the summit through breaks in the cloud. They agreed to move the tent up to establish a camp at a higher location but they really had a more ambitious goal for the day. Indeed, any camp would be entirely lacking food or sleeping bags. They were faced with an ice plateau leading to a snow ridge and then an {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} cliff of mixed ice and rock rising up to the top of the mountain. They abandoned the tent at the foot of the ridge and climbed on without [[belay]]s. Neither climber had any difficulty with breathing.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\nThe last fifty feet of the ice cliff was vertical though there were good holds and as they reached the northern side of the mountain the wind dropped. They could see traces of army boot footprints but the flag that had been left a week earlier by the army expedition had blown away. Haston took a cin\u00e9 film of Whillans reaching the summit and then they swapped places. From the top, which they reached at 14:30 and stayed for about 10 minutes, they could see the other two Annapurna summits but nothing more. With no feeling of exhilaration, which they knew would come later. They had {{convert|150|ft}} of rope which, after they had abseiled down, was all there was left on the summit. By 17:00 they had managed the difficult descent to Camp VI.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Day|2010|p=188}}{{sfnp|Frost|1971|p=232}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=427}}\n\nLower down the mountain everyone had been completely stormbound but Bonington, having been confined to Camp IV, put in his routine 17:00 radio call asking Haston if they had been able to get out of their camp. Due to static on the radio he did not hear the reply \"Aye, we've just climbed Annapurna\" but this was heard load and clear at Base Camp and the news spread rapidly up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=204}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|p=219}}\n\n===Leaving the mountain===\nBurke and Frost wanted to make their own attempt on the summit and, contrary to his better judgement, Bonington agreed subject to the clearing of the camps proceeding at the same time. So on 28 May, Burke and Frost while Whillans and Haston descended, reaching Camp III at midday. Everyone was very excited but were held back by their British formality. Only by evening did Frost and Burke reach Camp VI. On 29 May they made their attempt but Burke had to turn back and Frost, having reached the snowfield, stayed there almost three hours but then, because it was the Lord's will, turned back in ferocious wind.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=220\u2013224}}\n\nOn 30 May the mountain was being cleared apace with most of the party reaching Base Camp when Thompson rushed down, calling out in despair.
