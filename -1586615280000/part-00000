It was commonly known as '''Pleasure Island'''.  The park opened on 27 May 1993. It was originally a subsidiary of [[Flamingo Land]] Ltd. Pleasure Island became independent of Flamingo Land in May 2010 and was owned and operated by DewarSavile Enterprises Ltd until closing at the end of the 2016 season. Only McCormack's Family Bar continued in business, reopening in 2017.\n\n[[File:Boomerang (Pleasure Island).JPG|thumb|''[[Boomerang (roller coaster)|Boomerang]]'' - Manufactured by [[Vekoma]], this was a steel roller coaster built to the standard.

Owned and operated by Associated Pleasure Parks, the zoo had such attractions as [[Pinniped|seal]]s, penguins, [[raccoon]]s, [[pelican]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, a whale, [[African elephant]], tiger and an [[orangutan]].<ref>[http://www.marineanimalwelfare.com/Dolphinaria/Web%20Pages/Cleethorpes.htm Cleethorpes Marineland & Zoo]</ref><ref>[http://www.francisfrith.co.uk/cleethorpes+zoo,lincolnshire/photos/cleethorpes+zoo_C431111/ Photo of Cleethorpes Zoo, Pelicans c1965 \u2013 Francis Frith]</ref> The zoo closed in 1977.  The site was sold to Pleasureworld, a division of RKF Entertainment, who announced that a new theme park would be built, as a sister park to the [[Pleasurewood Hills]] park near [[Lowestoft]] and bearing the same name.  Construction began on the new theme park in the 1980s.\n\nRKF Entertainment went into receivership during the early 1990s and construction of the park was halted.  The site was sold to Robert Gibb, the managing director of [[Flamingo Land]] in [[Malton, North Yorkshire]]. When the opportunity to purchase the Cleethorpes site became available, Gibb decided to continue with the redevelopment of the site as a theme park, which became today's Pleasure Island. Construction of the park was completed by Gibb in 1992 and Pleasure Island Family Theme Park was opened on 27 May 1993. Robert Gibb's son, [[Gordon Gibb]], later became the chief executive of the company and directly runs Flamingo Land, while his sister Vicky Gibb, and subsequently other sister Melanie Wood (formerly Gibb), took the responsibility for the management of Pleasure Island.\n\nIn 2010, Melanie Wood completed her desire to take ownership of the park, separate from the family company.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/8645522.stm BBC News \u2013 Reopening secures Cleethorpes theme park jobs]</ref> Pleasure Island was operated by Dewarsavile Enterprises Ltd, directed by Wood. This marked the end of Pleasure Island and Flamingo Land's association.\n\nIn 2013, a farm and petting zoo including tractor ride was added, replacing the electric monorail.\n\nAs a result of the most recent ownership transfer, on 14 April 2010, the ''[[Grimsby Telegraph]]'' website broke news that the park had closed. Staff had turned up for work and were given letters informing them of termination to their employment.

It was commonly known as '''Pleasure Island'''.  The park opened on 27 May 1993. It was originally a subsidiary of [[Flamingo Land]] Ltd. Pleasure Island became independent of Flamingo Land in May 2010 and was owned and operated by DewarSavile Enterprises Ltd until closing at the end of the 2016 season. Only McCormack's Family Bar continued in business, reopening in 2017.\n\n[[File:Boomerang (Pleasure Island).JPG|thumb|''[[Boomerang (roller coaster)|Boomerang]]'' - Manufactured by [[Vekoma]], this was a steel roller coaster built to the standard.

Owned and operated by Associated Pleasure Parks, the zoo had such attractions as [[Pinniped|seal]]s, penguins, [[raccoon]]s, [[pelican]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, a whale, [[African elephant]], tiger and an [[orangutan]].<ref>[http://www.marineanimalwelfare.com/Dolphinaria/Web%20Pages/Cleethorpes.htm Cleethorpes Marineland & Zoo]</ref><ref>[http://www.francisfrith.co.uk/cleethorpes+zoo,lincolnshire/photos/cleethorpes+zoo_C431111/ Photo of Cleethorpes Zoo, Pelicans c1965 \u2013 Francis Frith]</ref> The zoo closed in 1977.  The site was sold to Pleasureworld, a division of RKF Entertainment, who announced that a new theme park would be built, as a sister park to the [[Pleasurewood Hills]] park near [[Lowestoft]] and bearing the same name.  Construction began on the new theme park in the 1980s.\n\nRKF Entertainment went into receivership during the early 1990s and construction of the park was halted.  The site was sold to Robert Gibb, the managing director of [[Flamingo Land]] in [[Malton, North Yorkshire]]. When the opportunity to purchase the Cleethorpes site became available, Gibb decided to continue with the redevelopment of the site as a theme park, which became today's Pleasure Island. Construction of the park was completed by Gibb in 1992 and Pleasure Island Family Theme Park was opened on 27 May 1993. Robert Gibb's son, [[Gordon Gibb]], later became the chief executive of the company and directly runs Flamingo Land, while his sister Vicky Gibb, and subsequently other sister Melanie Wood (formerly Gibb), took the responsibility for the management of Pleasure Island.\n\nIn 2010, Melanie Wood completed her desire to take ownership of the park, separate from the family company.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/8645522.stm BBC News \u2013 Reopening secures Cleethorpes theme park jobs]</ref> Pleasure Island was operated by Dewarsavile Enterprises Ltd, directed by Wood. This marked the end of Pleasure Island and Flamingo Land's association.\n\nIn 2013, a farm and petting zoo including tractor ride was added, replacing the electric monorail.\n\nAs a result of the most recent ownership transfer, on 14 April 2010, the ''[[Grimsby Telegraph]]'' website broke news that the park had closed. Staff had turned up for work and were given letters informing them of termination to their employment. Visitors were turned away at the gate.<ref>[http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/news/Pleasure-Island-closed/article-2017024-detail/article.html Grimsby news, views & business listings from Grimsby's Community &#124; This is Grimsby]</ref> Later stories suggested that the closure was caused by a breakdown in negotiations about the park's ownership. While negotiations took place to separate Pleasure Island from its sister park Flamingo Land, managing director of Pleasure Island Melanie Wood took control.<ref>[http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/news/Theme-park-closed-takeover-negotiated/article-2019402-detail/article.html Theme park closed as takeover is negotiated &#124; This is Grimsby]</ref> The park reopened under its new ownership on 1 May 2010.\n\nPleasure Island Family Theme Park closed permanently at the end of the 2016 season, with only McCormack's restaurant set to reopen in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pleasure Island Will Sadly Be Closing At The End Of The 2016 RIP 1993-2016 Season.|url=http://www.pleasure-island.co.uk/news/item/77-pleasure-island-will-sadly-be-closing-at-the-end-of-the-2016-season.html|publisher=Pleasure Island|accessdate=22 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922115310/http://www.pleasure-island.co.uk/news/item/77-pleasure-island-will-sadly-be-closing-at-the-end-of-the-2016-season.html|archivedate=22 September 2016|date=22 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Craig|first1=Peter|title=Closure of Pleasure Island is 'desperately sad'|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/closure-of-pleasure-island-is-desperately-sad/story-29739534-detail/story.html|website=Grimsby Telegraph|accessdate=22 September 2016|date=22 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pleasure Island Family Theme Park closure announced|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-37434077|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 September 2016|date=22 September 2016}}</ref> The contents, including a 1904 carousel, were put up for auction.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-humber-42967495/cleethorpes-pleasure-island-theme-park-rides-for-sale |title=Cleethorpes' Pleasure Island theme park rides for sale |publisher=BBC News |date=6 February 2018 |type=video}}</ref> The last of the items were sold off in October 2018.\n\n== Areas ==\nThe theme park was split into 6 areas:\n* Africa \u2013 themed around Africa, the largest area of Pleasure island and containing one white-knuckle ride\n* Kiddies Kingdom \u2013 rides for especially young children\n* Morocco \u2013 themed around Morocco, with three white-knuckle rides: the Alakazam, Hydromax and the Hyper Blaster\n* Old England \u2013 themed around England, it contained the park entrance and was the smallest area of Pleasure Island\n* Spain \u2013 themed around Spain and nearly as small as Old England, containing one ride and other attractions\n* White Knuckle Valley \u2013 three white-knuckle rides: the Boomerang (a [[Vekoma]] [[Boomerang (roller coaster)|Boomerang]] roller coaster), the Pendulus and the Terror Rack\n\n== Height restrictions ==\nThe minimum heights are colour-coded as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Both aspects stem from the research performed by [[Cato Maximilian Guldberg|Cato M. Guldberg]] and [[Peter Waage]] between 1864 and 1879 in which equilibrium constants were derived by using kinetic data and the rate equation which they had proposed. Guldberg and Waage also recognized that chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process in which [[reaction rate|rates of reaction]] for the forward and backward reactions must be equal at [[chemical equilibrium]]. In order to derive the expression of the equilibrium constant appealing to kinetics, the expression of the rate equation must be used. The expression of the rate equations was rediscovered later independently by [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]].\n\nThe law is a statement about equilibrium and gives an expression for the [[equilibrium constant]], a quantity characterizing [[chemical equilibrium]]. In modern chemistry, this is derived using [[equilibrium thermodynamics]]. It can also be derived from the concept of [[chemical potential]]. <ref>https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/kap_2/advanced/t2_4_3.html</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTwo chemists generally expressed the composition of a mixture in terms of numerical values relating the amount of the product to describe the equilibrium state.\n[[Cato Maximilian Guldberg]] and [[Peter Waage]], building on [[Berthollet|Claude Louis Berthollet]]'s ideas<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berthollet|first1=C.L.|title=Essai de statique chimique|trans-title=Essay on chemical statics [i.e., equilibrium]|date=1803|publisher=Firmin Didot|location=Paris, France|url=https://archive.org/details/essaidestatiquec01bert|language=French}} On pp. 404\u2013407, Berthellot mentions that when he accompanied Napoleon on his expedition to Egypt, he (Berthellot) visited Lake Natron and found sodium carbonate along its shores.

Thus the Law of Mass Action was first stated as follows:\n\n: When two reactants, A and B, react together at a given temperature in a \"substitution reaction,\" the affinity, or chemical force between them, is proportional to the active masses, [A] and [B], each raised to a particular power\n::<math chem>\\text{affinity} = \\alpha[\\ce A]^a[\\ce B]^b</math>.\n\nIn this context a substitution reaction was one such as <chem>{alcohol} + acid <=> {ester} + water</chem>. Active mass was defined in the 1879 paper as \"the amount of substance in the sphere of action\".<ref>(Guldberg & Waage, 1879), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000067440054;view=1up;seq=83 p. 71:] ''\"Eigentlich verstehen wir unter der activen Masse nur die Menge des Stoffes innerhalb der Actionsph\u00e4re; unter sonst gleichen Umst\u00e4nden kann aber die Actionsph\u00e4re durch die Volumeneinheit repr\u00e4sentirt werden.\"'' (Actually we understand by \"active mass\" only the quantity of substance inside the sphere of action; under otherwise identical conditions, however, the sphere of action can be represented by the unit volume.)</ref> For species in solution active mass is equal to concentration. For solids, active mass is taken as a constant. <math>\\alpha</math>, a and b were regarded as empirical constants, to be determined by experiment.\n\nAt [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], the chemical force driving the forward reaction must be equal to the chemical force driving the reverse reaction. Writing the initial active masses of A,B, A' and B' as p, q, p' and q' and the dissociated active mass at equilibrium as <math>\\xi</math>, this equality is represented by\n:<math>\\alpha(p-\\xi)^a(q-\\xi)^b=\\alpha'(p'+\\xi)^{a'}(q'+\\xi)^{b'}\\!</math>\n<math>\\xi</math> represents the amount of reagents A and B that has been converted into A' and B'. Calculations based on this equation are reported in the second paper.<ref name=\"GW2\"/>\n\n==== Dynamic approach to the equilibrium state ====\nThe third paper of 1864<ref name=\"GW3\"/> was concerned with the kinetics of the same equilibrium system. Writing the dissociated active mass at some point in time as x, the rate of reaction was given as\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)_{forward}=k(p-x)^a(q-x)^b</math>\nLikewise the reverse reaction of A' with B' proceeded at a rate given by\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)_{reverse}=k'(p'+x)^{a'}(q'+x)^{b'}</math>\nThe overall rate of conversion is the difference between these rates, so at equilibrium (when the composition stops changing) the two rates of reaction must be equal. Hence\n:<math>(p-x)^{a}(q-x)^{b}=\\frac{k'}{k} (p'+x)^{a'}(q'+x)^{b'}</math>...\n\n=== 1867 ===\nThe rate expressions given in Guldberg and Waage's 1864 paper could not be differentiated, so they were simplified as follows.<ref name =\" GW4\"/> The chemical force was assumed to be directly proportional to the product of the active masses of the reactants.\n:<math>\\mbox{affinity} = \\alpha[A][B]\\!</math>\nThis is equivalent to setting the exponents a and b of the earlier theory to one. The proportionality constant was called an affinity constant, k. The equilibrium condition for an \"ideal\" reaction was thus given the simplified form\n\n:<math>k[A]_\\text{eq}[B]_\\text{eq}=k'[A']_\\text{eq}[B']_\\text{eq}</math>\n\n[A]<sub>eq</sub>, [B]<sub>eq</sub> etc. are the active masses at equilibrium. In terms of the initial amounts reagents p,q, etc. this becomes\n:<math>(p-\\xi)(q-\\xi)=\\frac{k'}{k}(p'+\\xi)(q'+\\xi)</math>\nThe ratio of the affinity coefficients, k'/k, can be recognized as an equilibrium constant. Turning to the kinetic aspect, it was suggested that the velocity of reaction, v, is proportional to the sum of chemical affinities (forces). In its simplest form, this results in the expression\n:<math>v = \\psi (k(p-x)(q-x)-k'(p'+x)(q'+x))\\!</math>\nwhere <math>\\psi</math> is the proportionality constant. Actually, Guldberg and Waage used a more complicated expression which allowed for interaction between A and A', etc. By making certain simplifying approximations to those more complicated expressions, the rate equation could be integrated and hence the equilibrium quantity <math>\\xi</math> could be calculated. The extensive calculations in the 1867 paper gave support to the simplified concept, namely,\n: The rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the active masses of the reagents involved.\nThis is an alternative statement of the Law of Mass Action.\n\n=== 1879 ===\nIn the 1879 paper<ref name=\" GW5\"/> the assumption that reaction rate was proportional to the product of concentrations was justified microscopically in terms of the frequency of [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] [[collision theory|collisions]], as had been developed for gas kinetics by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] in 1872 ([[Boltzmann equation]]). It was also proposed that the original theory of the equilibrium condition could be generalized to apply to any arbitrary chemical equilibrium.\n\n: <math chem>\\text{affinity}=k[\\ce A]^{\\alpha}[\\ce B]^{\\beta}\\dots</math>\n\nThe exponents \u03b1, \u03b2, etc. are explicitly identified for the first time as the [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric coefficients]] for the reaction.\n\n== Modern statement of the law==\nThe affinity constants, k<sub>+</sub> and k<sub>\u2212</sub>, of the 1879 paper can now be recognised as [[rate constant]]s. The equilibrium constant, K, was derived by setting the rates of forward and backward reactions to be equal. This also meant that the chemical affinities for the forward and backward reactions are equal. The resultant expression\n\n:<math>K=\\frac{{\\left [ A' \\right ]}^{\\alpha'}{\\left [ B' \\right ]}^{\\beta'} \\dots } {[A]^\\alpha [B]^\\beta \\dots}</math>\n\nis correct<ref name=\"uwaterloo_cact\"/>{{dead link|date=April 2019}} even from the modern perspective, apart from the use of concentrations instead of activities (the concept of chemical activity was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], in the 1870s, but was not [[Josiah Willard Gibbs#Scientific recognition|widely known]] in Europe until the 1890s)? The derivation from the reaction rate expressions is no longer considered to be valid. Nevertheless, Guldberg and Waage were on the right track when they suggested that the driving force for both forward and backward reactions is equal when the mixture is at equilibrium. The term they used for this force was chemical affinity. Today the expression for the equilibrium constant is derived by setting the [[chemical potential]] of forward and backward reactions to be equal. The generalization of the Law of Mass Action, in terms of affinity, to equilibria of arbitrary stoichiometry was a bold and correct conjecture.\n\nThe hypothesis that reaction rate is proportional to reactant concentrations is, strictly speaking, only true for [[elementary reaction]]s (reactions with a single mechanistic step), but the empirical rate expression\n\n:<math>r_f=k_f[A][B]</math>\n\nis also applicable to [[rate equation|second order]] reactions that may not be concerted reactions. Guldberg and Waage were fortunate in that reactions such as ester formation and hydrolysis, on which they originally based their theory, do indeed follow this rate expression.\n\nIn general, many reactions occur with the formation of reactive intermediates, and/or through parallel reaction pathways. However, all reactions can be represented as a series of elementary reactions and, if the mechanism is known in detail, the rate equation for each individual step is given by the <math>r_f</math> expression so that the overall rate equation can be derived from the individual steps. When this is done the equilibrium constant is obtained correctly from the rate equations for forward and backward reaction rates.\n\nIn biochemistry, there has been significant interest in the appropriate mathematical model for chemical reactions occurring in the intracellular medium.  This is in contrast to the initial work done on chemical kinetics, which was in simplified systems where reactants were in a relatively dilute, pH-buffered, aqueous solution.  In more complex environments, where bound particles may be prevented from disassociation by their surroundings, or diffusion is slow or anomalous, the model of mass action does not always describe the behavior of the reaction kinetics accurately.  Several attempts have been made to modify the mass action model, but consensus has yet to be reached.  Popular modifications replace the rate constants with functions of time and concentration.  As an alternative to these mathematical constructs, one school of thought is that the mass action model can be valid in intracellular environments under certain conditions, but with different rates than would be found in a dilute, simple environment {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.\n\nThe fact that Guldberg and Waage developed their concepts in steps from 1864 to 1867 and 1879 has resulted in much confusion in the literature as to which equation the Law of Mass Action refers. It has been a source of some textbook errors.<ref>\"Textbook errors IX: More About the Laws of Reaction Rates and of Equilibrium\", E.A. Guggenheim, ''J. Chem.

Both aspects stem from the research performed by [[Cato Maximilian Guldberg|Cato M. Guldberg]] and [[Peter Waage]] between 1864 and 1879 in which equilibrium constants were derived by using kinetic data and the rate equation which they had proposed. Guldberg and Waage also recognized that chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process in which [[reaction rate|rates of reaction]] for the forward and backward reactions must be equal at [[chemical equilibrium]]. In order to derive the expression of the equilibrium constant appealing to kinetics, the expression of the rate equation must be used. The expression of the rate equations was rediscovered later independently by [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]].\n\nThe law is a statement about equilibrium and gives an expression for the [[equilibrium constant]], a quantity characterizing [[chemical equilibrium]]. In modern chemistry this is derived using [[equilibrium thermodynamics]]. It can also be derived with the concept of [[chemical potential]]. <ref>https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/kap_2/advanced/t2_4_3.html</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTwo chemists generally expressed the composition of a mixture in terms of numerical values relating the amount of the product to describe the equilibrium state.\n[[Cato Maximilian Guldberg]] and [[Peter Waage]], building on [[Berthollet|Claude Louis Berthollet]]'s ideas<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berthollet|first1=C.L.|title=Essai de statique chimique|trans-title=Essay on chemical statics [i.e., equilibrium]|date=1803|publisher=Firmin Didot|location=Paris, France|url=https://archive.org/details/essaidestatiquec01bert|language=French}} On pp. 404\u2013407, Berthellot mentions that when he accompanied Napoleon on his expedition to Egypt, he (Berthellot) visited Lake Natron and found sodium carbonate along its shores.

Thus the Law of Mass Action was first stated as follows:\n\n:When two reactants, A and B, react together at a given temperature in a \"substitution reaction,\" the affinity, or chemical force between them, is proportional to the active masses, [A] and [B], each raised to a particular power\n::<math chem>\\text{affinity} = \\alpha[\\ce A]^a[\\ce B]^b</math>.\n\nIn this context a substitution reaction was one such as <chem>{alcohol} + acid <=> {ester} + water</chem>. Active mass was defined in the 1879 paper as \"the amount of substance in the sphere of action\".<ref>(Guldberg & Waage, 1879), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000067440054;view=1up;seq=83 p. 71:] ''\"Eigentlich verstehen wir unter der activen Masse nur die Menge des Stoffes innerhalb der Actionsph\u00e4re; unter sonst gleichen Umst\u00e4nden kann aber die Actionsph\u00e4re durch die Volumeneinheit repr\u00e4sentirt werden.\"'' (Actually we understand by \"active mass\" only the quantity of substance inside the sphere of action; under otherwise identical conditions, however, the sphere of action can be represented by the unit volume.)</ref> For species in solution active mass is equal to concentration. For solids, active mass is taken as a constant. <math>\\alpha</math>, a and b were regarded as empirical constants, to be determined by experiment.\n\nAt [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], the chemical force driving the forward reaction must be equal to the chemical force driving the reverse reaction. Writing the initial active masses of A,B, A' and B' as p, q, p' and q' and the dissociated active mass at equilibrium as <math>\\xi</math>, this equality is represented by\n:<math>\\alpha(p-\\xi)^a(q-\\xi)^b=\\alpha'(p'+\\xi)^{a'}(q'+\\xi)^{b'}\\!</math>\n<math>\\xi</math> represents the amount of reagents A and B that has been converted into A' and B'. Calculations based on this equation are reported in the second paper.<ref name=\"GW2\"/>\n\n==== Dynamic approach to the equilibrium state ====\nThe third paper of 1864<ref name=\"GW3\"/> was concerned with the kinetics of the same equilibrium system. Writing the dissociated active mass at some point in time as x, the rate of reaction was given as\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)_{forward}=k(p-x)^a(q-x)^b</math>\nLikewise the reverse reaction of A' with B' proceeded at a rate given by\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)_{reverse}=k'(p'+x)^{a'}(q'+x)^{b'}</math>\nThe overall rate of conversion is the difference between these rates, so at equilibrium (when the composition stops changing) the two rates of reaction must be equal. Hence\n:<math>(p-x)^{a}(q-x)^{b}=\\frac{k'}{k} (p'+x)^{a'}(q'+x)^{b'}</math>...\n\n=== 1867 ===\nThe rate expressions given in Guldberg and Waage's 1864 paper could not be differentiated, so they were simplified as follows.<ref name =\"GW4\"/> The chemical force was assumed to be directly proportional to the product of the active masses of the reactants.\n:<math>\\mbox{affinity} = \\alpha[A][B]\\!</math>\nThis is equivalent to setting the exponents a and b of the earlier theory to one. The proportionality constant was called an affinity constant, k. The equilibrium condition for an \"ideal\" reaction was thus given the simplified form\n\n:<math>k[A]_\\text{eq}[B]_\\text{eq}=k'[A']_\\text{eq}[B']_\\text{eq}</math>\n\n[A]<sub>eq</sub>, [B]<sub>eq</sub> etc. are the active masses at equilibrium. In terms of the initial amounts reagents p,q etc. this becomes\n:<math>(p-\\xi)(q-\\xi)=\\frac{k'}{k}(p'+\\xi)(q'+\\xi)</math>\nThe ratio of the affinity coefficients, k'/k, can be recognized as an equilibrium constant. Turning to the kinetic aspect, it was suggested that the velocity of reaction, v, is proportional to the sum of chemical affinities (forces). In its simplest form this results in the expression\n:<math>v = \\psi (k(p-x)(q-x)-k'(p'+x)(q'+x))\\!</math>\nwhere <math>\\psi</math> is the proportionality constant. Actually, Guldberg and Waage used a more complicated expression which allowed for interaction between A and A', etc. By making certain simplifying approximations to those more complicated expressions, the rate equation could be integrated and hence the equilibrium quantity <math>\\xi</math> could be calculated. The extensive calculations in the 1867 paper gave support to the simplified concept, namely,\n:The rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the active masses of the reagents involved.\nThis is an alternative statement of the Law of Mass Action.\n\n=== 1879 ===\nIn the 1879 paper<ref name=\"GW5\"/> the assumption that reaction rate was proportional to the product of concentrations was justified microscopically in terms of the frequency  of [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] [[collision theory|collisions]], as had been developed for gas kinetics by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] in 1872 ([[Boltzmann equation]]). It was also proposed that the original theory of the equilibrium condition could be generalised to apply to any arbitrary chemical equilibrium.\n\n: <math chem>\\text{affinity}=k[\\ce A]^{\\alpha}[\\ce B]^{\\beta}\\dots</math>\n\nThe exponents \u03b1, \u03b2 etc. are explicitly identified for the first time as the [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric coefficients]] for the reaction.\n\n== Modern statement of the law==\nThe affinity constants, k<sub>+</sub> and k<sub>\u2212</sub>, of the 1879 paper can now be recognised as [[rate constant]]s. The equilibrium constant, K, was derived by setting the rates of forward and backward reactions to be equal. This also meant that the chemical affinities for the forward and backward reactions are equal. The resultant expression\n\n:<math>K=\\frac{{\\left [ A' \\right ]}^{\\alpha'}{\\left [ B' \\right ]}^{\\beta'} \\dots } {[A]^\\alpha [B]^\\beta \\dots}</math>\n\nis correct<ref name=\"uwaterloo_cact\"/>{{dead link|date=April 2019}} even from the modern perspective, apart from the use of concentrations instead of activities (the concept of chemical activity was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], in the 1870s, but was not [[Josiah Willard Gibbs#Scientific recognition|widely known]] in Europe until the 1890s). The derivation from the reaction rate expressions is no longer considered to be valid. Nevertheless, Guldberg and Waage were on the right track when they suggested that the driving force for both forward and backward reactions is equal when the mixture is at equilibrium. The term they used for this force was chemical affinity. Today the expression for the equilibrium constant is derived by setting the [[chemical potential]] of forward and backward reactions to be equal. The generalisation of the Law of Mass Action, in terms of affinity, to equilibria of arbitrary stoichiometry was a bold and correct conjecture.\n\nThe hypothesis that reaction rate is proportional to reactant concentrations is, strictly speaking, only true for [[elementary reaction]]s (reactions with a single mechanistic step), but the empirical rate expression\n\n:<math>r_f=k_f[A][B]</math>\n\nis also applicable to [[rate equation|second order]] reactions that may not be concerted reactions. Guldberg and Waage were fortunate in that reactions such as ester formation and hydrolysis, on which they originally based their theory, do indeed follow this rate expression.\n\nIn general many reactions occur with the formation of reactive intermediates, and/or through parallel reaction pathways. However, all reactions can be represented as a series of elementary reactions and, if the mechanism is known in detail, the rate equation for each individual step is given by the <math>r_f</math> expression so that the overall rate equation can be derived from the individual steps. When this is done the equilibrium constant is obtained correctly from the rate equations for forward and backward reaction rates.\n\nIn biochemistry, there has been significant interest in the appropriate mathematical model for chemical reactions occurring in the intracellular medium.  This is in contrast to the initial work done on chemical kinetics, which was in simplified systems where reactants were in a relatively dilute, pH-buffered, aqueous solution.  In more complex environments, where bound particles may be prevented from disassociation by their surroundings, or diffusion is slow or anomalous, the model of mass action does not always describe the behavior of the reaction kinetics accurately.  Several attempts have been made to modify the mass action model, but consensus has yet to be reached.  Popular modifications replace the rate constants with functions of time and concentration.  As an alternative to these mathematical constructs, one school of thought is that the mass action model can be valid in intracellular environments under certain conditions, but with different rates than would be found in a dilute, simple environment {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.\n\nThe fact that Guldberg and Waage developed their concepts in steps from 1864 to 1867 and 1879 has resulted in much confusion in the literature as to which equation the Law of Mass Action refers. It has been a source of some textbook errors.<ref>\"Textbook errors IX: More About the Laws of Reaction Rates and of Equilibrium\", E.A. Guggenheim, ''J. Chem.
