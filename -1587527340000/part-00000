In its early years, entry was optional. Teams were paired against each other by the football associations, without a draw taking place. Later on, for many years, a proper draw took place and also two-legged matches were added. \n\nIn [[1961\u201362 Greek Football Cup|1962]], there was no cup winner because the final between [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] was abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportdog.gr/video/article/462168/san-shmera-o-epeisodiakos-telikos-ths-nyxtas-poy-den-oloklhrwthhke-pote|script-title=el:\u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 1962 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae|language=Greek|work=sportdog.gr}}</ref>\n\nUntil [[1963\u201364 Greek Football Cup|1964]], if the final score was a draw (including [[extra time]]), the two teams played a replay match, while [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] didn't exist.

Both teams were ejected from the competition and therefore, in [[Greek Cup 1963-64|1964]] [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK]] won the title but the final match was not held. [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK]] also won in similar fashion in [[Greek Cup 1965-66|1966]] when [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] did not show up in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfootball.gr/k2/user-page/item/186-o-telikos-aek-olympiakoy-pou-den-egine-pote.html|script-title=el:\u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 1966 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad|language=Greek|work=oldfootball.gr}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1964\u201365 Greek Football Cup|1965]], a new rule was applied, to determine that, if the game was undecided even after extra time, the winner would be determined by the toss of a coin. [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] won this way (captain [[Mimis Domazos]] guessed correctly) in the [[Greek Cup 1968-69|1969]] final<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-retro.gr/panathinaikos-olympiacos-kipello-telikos-1969-derby-aionion-karaiskaki-stripsimo-nomismatos-kerma/|script-title=el:\u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 1969|language=Greek|work=sport-retro.gr}}</ref> against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]. Afterwards the [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] was applied.\n\nUntil [[1970\u201371 Greek Football Cup|1971]], teams from all over the country, professional and amateur, had been taking part. Each team first played against clubs from its own association and the winners continued in a nationwide competition. Due to this, strong professional sides met amateur neighbourhood teams, sometimes beating them with high scores; a 23\u20130 win in an [[Apollon Athens]] vs. PAO Neas Melandias match on 23 September 1959 remains a record win for the Greek Cup until today. Since 1971, only teams from professional divisions are allowed to participate, while amateur clubs take part in the [[Greek Football Amateur Cup|Amateur Cup]].\n\nIn [[1990\u201391 Greek Football Cup|1991]] and [[1991\u201392 Greek Football Cup|1992]] the finals were two-legged matches.\n\nIt is widely considered that the most exciting match in the history of the competition was the [[Greek

Later on, for many years, a proper draw took place and also two-legged matches were added. \n\nIn [[1961\u201362 Greek Football Cup|1962]], there was no cup winner because the final between [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] was abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportdog.gr/video/article/462168/san-shmera-o-epeisodiakos-telikos-ths-nyxtas-poy-den-oloklhrwthhke-pote|script-title=el:\u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 1962 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae|language=Greek|work=sportdog.gr}}</ref>\n\nUntil [[1963\u201364 Greek Football Cup|1964]], if the final score was a draw (including [[extra time]]), the two teams played a replay match, while [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] didn't exist.

Both teams were ejected from the competition and therefore, in [[Greek Cup 1963-64|1964]] [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK]] won the title but the final match was not held. [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK]] also won in similar fashion in [[Greek Cup 1965-66|1966]] when [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] did not show up in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfootball.gr/k2/user-page/item/186-o-telikos-aek-olympiakoy-pou-den-egine-pote.html|script-title=el:\u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 1966 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad|language=Greek|work=oldfootball.gr}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1964\u201365 Greek Football Cup|1965]], a new rule was applied, to determine that, if the game was undecided even after extra time, the winner would be determined by the toss of a coin. [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] won this way (captain [[Mimis Domazos]] guessed correctly) in the [[Greek Cup 1968-69|1969]] final<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-retro.gr/panathinaikos-olympiacos-kipello-telikos-1969-derby-aionion-karaiskaki-stripsimo-nomismatos-kerma/|script-title=el:\u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 1969|language=Greek|work=sport-retro.gr}}</ref> against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]. Afterwards the [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] was applied.\n\nUntil [[1970\u201371 Greek Football Cup|1971]], teams from all over the country, professional and amateur, had been taking part. Each team first played against clubs from its own association and the winners continued in a nationwide competition. Due to this, strong professional sides met amateur neighbourhood teams, sometimes beating them with high scores; a 23\u20130 win in an [[Apollon Athens]] vs. PAO Neas Melandias match on 23 September 1959 remains a record win for the Greek Cup until today. Since 1971, only teams from professional divisions are allowed to participate, while amateur clubs take part in the [[Greek Football Amateur Cup|Amateur Cup]].\n\nIn [[1990\u201391 Greek Football Cup|1991]] and [[1991\u201392 Greek Football Cup|1992]] the finals were two-legged matches.\n\nIt is widely considered that the most exciting match in the history of the competition was the [[Greek

He originated the concept and asked [[David E. Kelley]] to help write the pilot, giving Kelley a \"created by\" credit. Harris was the first actor the show's staff had found that could convincingly play a teenage doctor, but ABC executives opposed his casting. Bochco's contract required that the network pay an [[Television pilot#Put pilot|\"enormous\" penalty]] if it canceled the project, so ABC was forced to let him film the pilot. The network still opposed Harris's casting and disliked the pilot, but after positive reception during [[test screening]]s, ABC [[greenlit]] the show.<ref name=\"adalian20110321\">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/03/david_e_kelley_interview_wonde.html|title=The Vulture Transcript: Prolific TV Creator David E.

She goes to the mirror and realizes that her breasts are comically larger than before. Doogie Howser (Harris) comes in and asks an upset Roseanne if they were supposed to be bigger than they are in the dream. Roseanne screams, but then is woken up by her husband Dan. To make sure she was dreaming, she looks under her bedsheet, sees the surgery went as planned, and sighs, \"Way to go, Doogie!\"\n** [[Barney Stinson]] (also played by Harris) writes in his [[blog|computerized diary]] at the end of the ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' episode \"[[The Bracket]],\" while the ''Doogie Howser'' theme music plays.<ref>{{cite web|title=HIMYM, \"The Bracket\": No bets, just slaps|url=http://blog.nj.com/alltv/2008/03/himym_the_bracket_no_bets_just.html|author=Alan Sepinwall|publisher=blog.nj.com|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=March 31, 2008}}</ref> In the later episode \"[[The Stinsons]],\" he also comments, \"Call me crazy but child actors were way better in the '80s\".\n** In the 2004 comedy ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', Harris \u2013 playing a fictionalized version of himself \u2013 claims to have \"humped every piece of ass ever on that show\" (except the hot nurse, over whom he expresses regret). Harris is referred to as \"Doogie Howser\" while stealing Harold ([[John Cho]])'s car from the convenience store. In ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', Harris remarks, after taking psychotropic mushrooms, \"Dude, I was able to perform an [[appendectomy]] at 14, I think I can handle a few 'shrooms\".\n** In 2008, Harris appeared in commercials for [[Old Spice]] deodorant, claiming to be an expert because he \"used to be a doctor for pretends\".<!--not \"pretend\"-->\n** During the opening of the 2009 ''[[TV Land Awards]]'', Harris, who hosted the show, travels through \"The TV Land Zone\" (a spoof of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''), where he finds himself the star of TV classics. At one point, Harris walks into a doctor's office, dressed as Doogie, while the ''Doogie Howser, M.D.'' theme plays. After realizing where he is, he storms out, saying, \"No no no, not gonna happen! Check my contract!\"\n** On the January 10, 2009 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', an \"[[SNL Digital Short]]\" featured Harris, the episode's guest host, leading a full orchestra version of the ''Doogie Howser'' theme.

Bochco intended to end the show with a \"season-long story arc for Doogie where he becomes disaffected with the practice of medicine and quits medicine to become a writer\".<ref>''Doogie Howser M.D.'', Season 1 DVD</ref> ABC abruptly canceled the show due to low ratings, preventing Bochco and the show's writers from implementing the storyline other than Howser's resignation from Eastman and departure for [[Europe]] in the [[List of Doogie Howser, M.D. episodes#Season 4 (1992\u20131993)|final episode]].\n\n==Production==\nThe weekly, half-hour dramedy was created by [[Steven Bochco]]. He originated the concept and asked [[David E. Kelley]] to help write the pilot, giving Kelley a \"created by\" credit. Harris was the first actor the show's staff had found that could convincingly play a teenage doctor, but ABC executives opposed his casting. Bochco's contract required that the network pay an [[Television pilot#Put pilot|\"enormous\" penalty]] if it canceled the project, so ABC was forced to let him film the pilot. The network still opposed Harris's casting and disliked the pilot, but after positive reception during [[test screening]]s, ABC [[greenlit]] the show.<ref name=\"adalian20110321\">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/03/david_e_kelley_interview_wonde.html|title=The Vulture Transcript: Prolific TV Creator David E.

Harris is referred to as \"Doogie Howser\" while stealing Harold ([[John Cho]])'s car from the convenience store. In ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', Harris remarks, after taking psychotropic mushrooms, \"Dude, I was able to perform an [[appendectomy]] at 14, I think I can handle a few 'shrooms\".\n** In 2008, Harris appeared in commercials for [[Old Spice]] deodorant, claiming to be an expert because he \"used to be a doctor for pretends\".<!--not \"pretend\"-->\n** During the opening of the 2009 ''[[TV Land Awards]]'', Harris, who hosted the show, travels through \"The TV Land Zone\" (a spoof of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''), where he finds himself the star of TV classics.

The lower orbit also means more distance between Starlink and competing internet constellations proposed by OneWeb and Telesat. FCC approval allows satellite companies to provide communications services in the United States.
