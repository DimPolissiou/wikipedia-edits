If the sum of the cards exceeds 10, its second digit is used as the score instead, and if the sum is exactly 10, the score is 1. If the three cards drawn are 8-9-3 (pronounced '''ya-ku-sa''' in Japanese), the sum is 20 and therefore the score is zero, making it the worst possible hand that can be drawn.<ref>[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%82%84%E3%81%8F%E3%81%96 \"Yakuza\" definition]. Kotobank (in Japanese)</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Japan Kyushu Region large.png|thumb|right|Throughout history, especially since the modern era, [[Kyushu]] island has been the largest source of ''yakuza'' members, including many renowned bosses in the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]].  Isokichi Yoshida (1867\u20131936) from the [[Kitakyushu]] area was considered{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} the first renowned modern ''yakuza''. Recently [[Shinobu Tsukasa]] and Kunio Inoue, the bosses of the two most powerful clans in the Yamaguchi-gumi, originate from Kyushu. [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], the northernmost part of the island, has the largest number of [[#Designated boryokudan|designated syndicates]] among all of the prefectures.]]\n\nDespite uncertainty about the single origin of ''yakuza'' organizations, most modern ''yakuza'' derive from two social classifications which emerged in the mid-[[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868): ''[[tekiya]]'', those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen, or shoddy goods; and ''[[bakuto]]'', those who were involved in or participated in gambling.<ref>David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1986), 18-21.</ref>\n\n''Tekiya'' (peddlers) ranked as one of the [[Four occupations|lowest social groups]] during the Edo period. As they began to form organizations of their own, they took over some administrative duties relating to commerce, such as stall allocation and protection of their commercial activities.<ref>Joy, Alicia. \"A Brief History Of The Yakuza Organization\". Culture Trip. Last modified 31 October 2016. https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-yakuza-organization/.</ref> During [[Shinto]] [[Japanese festivals| festivals]], these peddlers opened stalls and some members were hired to act as security. Each peddler paid rent in exchange for a stall assignment and protection during the fair.\n\nThe ''tekiya'' were a highly structured and hierarchical group with the ''oyabun'' (boss) at the top and ''kobun'' (gang members) at the bottom.<ref name=\"kyotojournal.org\">Raz, Jacob. \"Insider Outsider: The Way of the Yakuza.\" Kyoto Journal. Last modified 17 April 2011. https://kyotojournal.org/society/insider-outsider/.</ref> This hierarchy resembles a structure similar to the family - the ''oyabun'' was often regarded{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} as a surrogate father, and the ''kobun'' as surrogate children.<ref name=\"kyotojournal.org\"/> During the Edo period, the government formally recognized  the ''tekiya''. At this time, the ''oyabun'' were appointed{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} as supervisors and granted near-[[samurai]] status, meaning they were allowed the dignity of a surname and two swords.<ref>David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1986), 22.</ref>\n\n''Bakuto'' (gamblers) had a much lower social standing even than traders, as gambling was illegal. Many small gambling houses cropped up in abandoned temples or shrines at the edges of towns and villages all over Japan.  Most of these gambling houses ran loan-sharking businesses for clients, and they usually maintained their own security personnel. Society at large regarded the gambling houses themselves, as well as the ''bakuto'', with disdain. Much of the undesirable image of the Yakuza originates from ''bakuto''; this includes the name ''Yakuza'' itself.\n\nBecause of the economic situation during the mid-period{{when?|date=March 2020}} and the predominance of the merchant class, developing Yakuza groups were composed of misfits and delinquents who had joined or formed Yakuza groups to extort customers in local markets by selling fake or shoddy goods.{{Clarify|What \"mid-period\"? How gone from privileged merchants with swords to misfits? How did tekiya and bakuto come together?|date= March 2016}}\n\nThe roots of the Yakuza survive today in [[initiation ceremony| initiation ceremonies]], which incorporate tekiya or bakuto [[rituals]]. Although the modern Yakuza has diversified, some gangs still identify with one group or the other; for example, a gang whose primary source of income is illegal gambling may refer to themselves as ''bakuto''.\n\n== Organization and activities ==\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:Yakuza hierarchy.png|right|thumb|Yakuza hierarchy]]\nDuring the formation of the Yakuza, they adopted the traditional Japanese hierarchical structure of oyabun-kobun where ''kobun'' (\u5b50\u5206; lit. foster child) owe their allegiance to the {{nihongo|''oyabun''|\u89aa\u5206||lit. foster parent}}.  In a much later period, the code of {{nihongo|''jingi''|\u4ec1\u7fa9||justice and duty}} was developed where loyalty and respect are a way of life.\n\nThe oyabun-kobun relationship is formalized by ceremonial sharing of [[sake]] from a single cup. This ritual is not exclusive to the Yakuza\u2014it is also commonly performed in traditional Japanese [[Shinto]] weddings, and may have been a part of ''sworn brotherhood'' relationships.<ref name=\"trutv.com\">{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Yakuza - Oyabun-Kobun, Father-Child|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html|publisher=[[truTV]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II]] period in Japan, the more traditional tekiya/bakuto form of organization declined as the entire population was mobilised to participate in the war effort and society came under strict military government. However, after the war, the Yakuza adapted again.\n\nProspective Yakuza come from all walks of life. The most romantic tales tell how Yakuza accept sons who have been abandoned or exiled by their parents. Many Yakuza start out in junior high school or high school as common street thugs or members of [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]] gangs.  Perhaps because of its lower socio-economic status, numerous Yakuza members come from [[Burakumin]] and ethnic Korean backgrounds.\n\nYakuza groups are headed by an ''oyabun'' or {{nihongo|''kumich\u014d''|\u7d44\u9577||family head}} who gives orders to his subordinates, the ''kobun''. In this respect, the organization is a variation of the traditional Japanese [[senpai]]-[[kohai|k\u014dhai]] (senior-junior) model. Members of Yakuza gangs cut their family ties and transfer their loyalty to the gang boss. They refer to each other as family members - fathers and elder and younger brothers. The Yakuza is populated almost entirely by men and the very few women who are acknowledged are the wives of bosses, who are referred to by the title {{nihongo|''ane-san''|\u59d0\u3055\u3093||older sister}}. When the 3rd [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] boss ([[Kazuo Taoka]]) died in the early 1980s, his wife (Fumiko) took over as boss of Yamaguchi-gumi, albeit for a short time.\n\nYakuza have a complex organizational structure. There is an [[Capo di tutti capi|overall boss]] of the syndicate, the ''kumicho'', and directly beneath him are the ''saiko komon'' (senior advisor) and ''so-honbucho '' (headquarters chief). The second in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] is the ''wakagashira'', who governs several gangs in a region with the help of a ''fuku-honbucho'' who is himself responsible for several gangs. The regional gangs themselves are governed by their local boss, the ''shateigashira''.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html The Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia - The Crime Library - Crime Library on truTV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nEach member's connection is ranked by the hierarchy of sakazuki (sake sharing). Kumicho are at the top, and control various {{nihongo|''saik\u014d-komon''|\u6700\u9ad8\u9867\u554f||senior advisors}}. The saik\u014d-komon control their own turfs in different areas or cities. They have their own underlings, including other [[underboss]]es, advisors, accountants and enforcers.\n\nThose who have received sake from oyabun are part of the immediate family and ranked in terms of elder or younger brothers. However, each kobun, in turn, can offer sakazuki as oyabun to his underling to form an affiliated organisation, which might in turn form lower ranked organizations. In the Yamaguchi-gumi, which controls some 2,500 businesses and 500 Yakuza groups, there are fifth rank subsidiary organizations.<!--\n[[File:Hitokiri Ginji, Black Lagoon Vol.4.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fictional Yakuza character with typical upper-body [[irezumi|Yakuza tattoos]], from the ''[[Black Lagoon]]'' manga series.

Upon a first offense, the transgressor must cut off the tip of his left little finger and give the severed portion to his boss. Sometimes an underboss may do this in penance to the oyabun if he wants to spare a member of his own gang from further retaliation. This practice has started to wane amongst the younger members, due to it being an easy identifier for police.<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/yakuza-yamaguchi-gumi-explainer/ | work=CNN | title=The yakuza: Inside Japan's murky criminal underworld}}</ref>\n\nIts origin stems from the traditional way of holding a [[Kenjutsu|Japanese sword]]. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the thumb and index fingers slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger moving up the hand to the index finger progressively weakens a person's sword grip.\n\nThe idea is that a person with a weak sword grip then has to rely more on the group for protection\u2014reducing individual action. In recent years, [[prosthetic]] fingertips have been developed to disguise this distinctive appearance.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/>\n\nMany Yakuza have full-body tattoos (including their [[genitalia]]). These tattoos, known as [[irezumi]] in Japan, are still often \"hand-poked\", that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and handheld tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. The procedure is expensive, painful, and can take years to complete.<ref>''[[Japanorama]]'', [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]], Series 2, Episode 3, first aired 21 September 2006</ref>\n\nWhen Yakuza members play [[Oicho-Kabu]] cards with each other, they often remove their shirts or open them up and drape them around their waists. This enables them to display their full-body tattoos to each other. This is one of the few times that Yakuza members display their tattoos to others, as they normally keep them concealed in public with long-sleeved and high-necked shirts. When new members join, they are often required to remove their trousers as well and reveal any lower body tattoos.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Syndicates==\n{{Further|List of Yakuza syndicates}}{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Four largest syndicates===\nAlthough Yakuza membership has declined since the implementation of the Anti-[[Boryokudan]] Act in 1992, according to the [[National Police Agency (Japan)]] there are still approximately 39,100 active Yakuza members in Japan as of 2016.<ref>http://www.npa.go.jp/english/kokusai/pdf/Police_of_Japan_2017_full_text.pdf \"Police of Japan 2017\"</ref> \nThe Yakuza does not consist of just one group, rather there are many different [[syndicate]] groups that together form one of the largest organized crime groups in the world.<ref>Johnston, Eric, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070214i1.html From rackets to real estate, yakuza multifaceted]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 14 February 2007, p. 3.</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!

Despite more than a decade of police repression, the Yamaguchi-gumi has continued to grow. From its headquarters in [[Kobe]], it directs criminal activities throughout Japan. It is also involved in operations in Asia and the United States. [[Kenichi Shinoda|Shinobu Tsukasa]], also known as Kenichi Shinoda, is the Yamaguchi-gumi's current oyabun. He follows an expansionist policy, and has increased operations in [[Tokyo]] (which has not traditionally been the territory of the Yamaguchi-gumi.)\n\nThe Yamaguchi family is successful to the point where its name has become synonymous with Japanese organized crime in many parts of Asia outside Japan.

In essence, this is a specialized form of [[protection racket]]. Instead of harassing small businesses, the Yakuza harass a stockholders' meeting of a larger corporation. They simply scare the ordinary stockholder with the presence of Yakuza operatives, who obtain the right to attend the meeting by making a small purchase of stock.\n\nYakuza also have ties to the Japanese realty market and banking, through ''jiageya''. Jiageya specialize in inducing holders of small real estate to sell their property so that estate companies can carry out much larger development plans. Japan's bubble economy of the 1980s is often blamed on real estate speculation by banking subsidiaries.

This is in line with the idea that their activities are semi-open; theft by definition would be a covert activity. More importantly, such an act would be considered a trespass by the community. Also, Yakuza usually do not conduct the actual business operation by themselves. Core business activities such as merchandising, loan sharking or management of gambling houses are typically managed by non-Yakuza members who pay protection fees for their activities.\n\nThere is much evidence of Yakuza involvement in international crime. There are many tattooed Yakuza members imprisoned in various Asian prisons for such crimes as drug trafficking and arms smuggling. In 1997, one verified Yakuza member was caught smuggling 4 kilograms (8.82 pounds) of [[heroin]] into Canada.\n\nBecause of their history as a legitimate feudal organization and their connection to the Japanese political system through the ''[[uyoku dantai]]'' (extreme right-wing political groups), Yakuza are somewhat a part of the Japanese establishment, with six [[fan magazine]]s reporting on their activities.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-yakuzas-ties-to-the-japanese-right-wing-000 | work=Vice Today | title=The Yakuza's Ties to the Japanese Right Wing}}</ref> Yakuza involvement in politics functions similarly to that of a lobbying group, with them backing those who share in their opinions or beliefs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/13/the-yakuza-lobby/ | work=Foreign Policy | title=The Yakuza Lobby}}</ref> One study found that 1 in 10 adults under the age of 40 believed that the Yakuza should be allowed to exist.{{r|adelstein20110318}} In the 1980s in [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], a Yakuza war spiraled out of control and civilians were hurt. It was a large conflict between the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] and [[Dojin-kai]], called the ''Yama-Michi War''. The police stepped in and forced the Yakuza bosses on both sides to declare a truce in public.\n\nAt various times, people in Japanese cities have launched anti-Yakuza campaigns with mixed and varied success. In March 1995, the Japanese government passed the ''Act for Prevention of Unlawful Activities by Criminal Gang Members'', which made traditional [[racketeering]] much more difficult.

They easily fit into the local population, since many tourists from Japan and other Asian countries visit the islands on a regular basis, and there is a large population of residents who are of full or partial Japanese descent. They also work with local gangs, funneling Japanese tourists to gambling parlors and brothels.<ref name=crimelibrary/>\n\nIn California, the Yakuza have made alliances with local Korean gangs as well as [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese triads]]. They allied with Vietnamese gangs to use them as muscle, as they had potential to become extremely violent as needed. The Yakuza saw their potential following the constant Vietnamese cafe shoot-outs and home invasion burglaries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In New York City, they appear to collect finder's fees from Russian, Irish and Italian gang members and businessmen for guiding Japanese tourists to gambling establishments, both legal and illegal.<ref name=crimelibrary/>\n\n[[Handgun]]s manufactured in the US account for a large share (33%) of handguns seized in Japan, followed by [[China]] (16%) and the [[Philippines]] (10%).  In 1990, a [[Smith & Wesson]] [[.38 caliber]] [[revolver]] that cost $275 in the US could sell for up to $4,000 in Tokyo.

The burakumin are [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of outcast communities of the pre-modern, especially the [[feudal Japan hierarchy|feudal era]], mainly those with occupations considered tainted with death or [[ritual impurity]], such as butchers, [[executioner]]s, [[undertaker]]s, or [[leather worker]]s. They traditionally lived in their own secluded [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]].\n\nAccording to [[David E. Kaplan (author)|David E.

Methods include that which brought down [[Al Capone]]: checking the organization's finances. The [[Financial Services Agency]] ordered [[Mizuho Financial Group]], Inc. to improve compliance and that its top executives report by 28 October 2013 what they knew and when about a consumer-credit affiliate found making loans to crime groups. This adds pressure to the group from the U.S. as well where an executive order in 2011 required financial institutions to freeze Yakuza assets. As of 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] has frozen about US$55,000 of Yakuza holdings, including two Japan-issued American Express cards.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-22/yazkuza-mobsters-whacked-by-regulators-freezing-amexs.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Yakuza Bosses Whacked by Regulators Freezing AmEx Cards}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n=== Yakuza in society ===\nThe Yakuza have had mixed relations with Japanese society. They function as a police force in their areas of operation, to help reduce crime (that would be their competition). They also provide protection to businesses and relief in times of disaster. These actions have painted Yakuza in a fairly positive light within Japan. However, gang-wars, and the use of violence as a tool have caused their approval to fall with the general public.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/09/where-have-japan-s-yakuza-gone | work=Daily Beast | title=Where Have Japan's Yakuza Gone?}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Yakuza have been  in media and culture in many different fashions. Creating its own [[Yakuza film|genre]] of movies within Japan's film industry, the portrayal of the Yakuza mainly manifests in one of two archetypes; they are portrayed as either honorable and respectable men or as criminals who use fear and violence as their means of operation.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/yakuza-kind-hearted-criminals-or-monsters-in-suits | work=Japan Today | title=Yakuza: Kind-hearted criminals or monsters in suits? | date=10 October 2012 | accessdate=18 January 2019 }}</ref> Movies like ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity (film)|Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' portray some of the members as violent criminals, with the focus being on the violence, while other movies focus more on the \"business\" side of the Yakuza.\n\nThe Netflix film ''[[The Outsider (2018 film)|The Outsider]]'' centers around Nick Lowell, an American who falls in with a Yakuza clan in post-war Japan and focuses on his rise within the family.\n\n===Television===\nThe Yakuza make an appearance outside 742 Evergreen Terrace in the episode of the American TV Series [[The Simpsons]] called [[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]. Marge's Pretzel rivals ask the Yakuza to appear outside The Simpson House. They fight the mob gang that is lead by Fat Tony.\n\nThe Yakuza play a very important role in the ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' remake. Lead character [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Kono Kalakaua|Kono Kalakaua's]] husband [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Adam Noshimuri|Adam Noshimuri]] was the former head of the Yakuza who took over after his father Hiro Noshimuri died. Adam's brother [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Michael Nosimuri|Michael Noshimuri]] was also part of the Yakuza.\n\nThe Yakuza are also the basis for the 2019 BBC TV Series [[Giri/Haji]].\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe video game series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'', launched in 2005, portrays the actions of several different ranking members of the Yakuza throughout the series. The series addresses some of the same themes as the Yakuza genre of film does, like violence, honor, politics of the syndicates, etc. The series has been successful; spawning sequels, spin-offs, a live action [[Like a Dragon|movie]] and a web TV series.\n\n''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' features a Yakuza clan that assists the protagonist in the second and third act after they cut their ties with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]. The Yakuza derive most of their income from a casino, Kenji's, and are currently fighting to keep other gangs from peddling drugs in their territory. Towards the end of the third act, the player assassinates the leader of the clan, and the other members are executed by Colombian gangsters.\n\n''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' features a mission set in Japan that sees Agent 47 assassinating the son of a wealthy arms dealer during his dinner meeting with a Yakuza boss. A mission in a later game, ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', set at a secluded mountaintop hospital, features a notorious Yakuza lawyer as one of two targets.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[893239]] or Yakuza-Nijusan-Ku\n* [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku]]\n* [[Chimpira]], low ranking Yakuza\n* [[Crime in Japan]]\n* [[Criminal tattoo]]\n* [[Gopnik]]\n* [[Irezumi]]\n* [[Kkangpae]] (Korean mafia)\n* [[List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates]]\n* [[Organized crime]]\n* [[Punch perm]]\n* [[Russian mafia]]\n* [[Sicilian Mafia]]\n* [[American Mafia]]\n* [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]]\n* [[Yakuza exclusion ordinances]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Portal bar|Japan}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Bruno, A.

If the three cards drawn are 8-9-3 (pronounced '''ya-ku-sa''' in Japanese), the sum is 20 and therefore the score is zero, making it the worst possible hand that can be drawn.<ref>[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%82%84%E3%81%8F%E3%81%96 \"Yakuza\" definition]. Kotobank (in Japanese)</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Japan Kyushu Region large.png|thumb|right|Throughout history, especially since the modern era, [[Kyushu]] island has been the largest source of ''yakuza'' members, including many renowned bosses in the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]].  Isokichi Yoshida (1867\u20131936) from the [[Kitakyushu]] area was considered{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} the first renowned modern ''yakuza''. Recently [[Shinobu Tsukasa]] and Kunio Inoue, the bosses of the two most powerful clans in the Yamaguchi-gumi, originate from Kyushu. [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], the northernmost part of the island, has the largest number of [[#Designated boryokudan|designated syndicates]] among all of the prefectures.]]\n\nDespite uncertainty about the single origin of ''yakuza'' organizations, most modern ''yakuza'' derive from two social classifications which emerged in the mid-[[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868): ''[[tekiya]]'', those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen, or shoddy goods; and ''[[bakuto]]'', those who were involved in or participated in gambling.<ref>David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1986), 18-21.</ref>\n\n''Tekiya'' (peddlers) ranked as one of the [[Four occupations|lowest social groups]] during the Edo period. As they began to form organizations of their own, they took over some administrative duties relating to commerce, such as stall allocation and protection of their commercial activities.<ref>Joy, Alicia. \"A Brief History Of The Yakuza Organization\".

Each peddler paid rent in exchange for a stall assignment and protection during the fair.\n\nThe ''tekiya'' were a highly structured and hierarchical group with the ''oyabun'' (boss) at the top and ''kobun'' (gang members) at the bottom.<ref name=\"kyotojournal.org\">Raz, Jacob. \"Insider Outsider: The Way of the Yakuza.\" Kyoto Journal. Last modified 17 April 2011. https://kyotojournal.org/society/insider-outsider/.</ref> This hierarchy resembles a structure similar to the family - the ''oyabun'' was often regarded{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} as a surrogate father, and the ''kobun'' as surrogate children.<ref name=\"kyotojournal.org\"/> During the Edo period, the government formally recognized  the ''tekiya''. At this time, the ''oyabun'' were appointed{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} as supervisors and granted near-[[samurai]] status, meaning they were allowed the dignity of a surname and two swords.<ref>David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1986), 22.</ref>\n\n''Bakuto'' (gamblers) had a much lower social standing even than traders, as gambling was illegal. Many small gambling houses cropped up in abandoned temples or shrines at the edges of towns and villages all over Japan.  Most of these gambling houses ran loan-sharking businesses for clients, and they usually maintained their own security personnel. Society at large regarded the gambling houses themselves, as well as the ''bakuto'', with disdain. Much of the undesirable image of the Yakuza originates from ''bakuto''; this includes the name ''Yakuza'' itself.\n\nBecause of the economic situation during the mid-period{{when?|date=March 2020}} and the predominance of the merchant class, developing Yakuza groups were composed of misfits and delinquents who had joined or formed Yakuza groups to extort customers in local markets by selling fake or shoddy goods.{{Clarify|What \"mid-period\"? How gone from privileged merchants with swords to misfits? How did tekiya and bakuto come together?|date= March 2016}}\n\nThe roots of the Yakuza survive today in [[initiation ceremony| initiation ceremonies]], which incorporate tekiya or bakuto [[rituals]]. Although the modern Yakuza has diversified, some gangs still identify with one group or the other; for example, a gang whose primary source of income is illegal gambling may refer to themselves as ''bakuto''.\n\n== Organization and activities ==\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:Yakuza hierarchy.png|right|thumb|Yakuza hierarchy]]\nDuring the formation of the Yakuza, they adopted the traditional Japanese hierarchical structure of oyabun-kobun where ''kobun'' (\u5b50\u5206; lit. foster child) owe their allegiance to the {{nihongo|''oyabun''|\u89aa\u5206||lit. foster parent}}.  In a much later period, the code of {{nihongo|''jingi''|\u4ec1\u7fa9||justice and duty}} was developed where loyalty and respect are a way of life.\n\nThe oyabun-kobun relationship is formalized by ceremonial sharing of [[sake]] from a single cup. This ritual is not exclusive to the Yakuza\u2014it is also commonly performed in traditional Japanese [[Shinto]] weddings, and may have been a part of ''sworn brotherhood'' relationships.<ref name=\"trutv.com\">{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Yakuza - Oyabun-Kobun, Father-Child|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html|publisher=[[truTV]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II]] period in Japan, the more traditional tekiya/bakuto form of organization declined as the entire population was mobilised to participate in the war effort and society came under strict military government. However, after the war, the Yakuza adapted again.\n\nProspective Yakuza come from all walks of life. The most romantic tales tell how Yakuza accept sons who have been abandoned or exiled by their parents. Many Yakuza start out in junior high school or high school as common street thugs or members of [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]] gangs.  Perhaps because of its lower socio-economic status, numerous Yakuza members come from [[Burakumin]] and ethnic Korean backgrounds.\n\nYakuza groups are headed by an ''oyabun'' or {{nihongo|''kumich\u014d''|\u7d44\u9577||family head}} who gives orders to his subordinates, the ''kobun''. In this respect, the organization is a variation of the traditional Japanese [[senpai]]-[[kohai|k\u014dhai]] (senior-junior) model. Members of Yakuza gangs cut their family ties and transfer their loyalty to the gang boss. They refer to each other as family members - fathers and elder and younger brothers. The Yakuza is populated almost entirely by men and the very few women who are acknowledged are the wives of bosses, who are referred to by the title {{nihongo|''ane-san''|\u59d0\u3055\u3093||older sister}}. When the 3rd [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] boss ([[Kazuo Taoka]]) died in the early 1980s, his wife (Fumiko) took over as boss of Yamaguchi-gumi, albeit for a short time.\n\nYakuza have a complex organizational structure. There is an [[Capo di tutti capi|overall boss]] of the syndicate, the ''kumicho'', and directly beneath him are the ''saiko komon'' (senior advisor) and ''so-honbucho '' (headquarters chief). The second in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] is the ''wakagashira'', who governs several gangs in a region with the help of a ''fuku-honbucho'' who is himself responsible for several gangs. The regional gangs themselves are governed by their local boss, the ''shateigashira''.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html The Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia - The Crime Library - Crime Library on truTV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nEach member's connection is ranked by the hierarchy of sakazuki (sake sharing). Kumicho are at the top, and control various {{nihongo|''saik\u014d-komon''|\u6700\u9ad8\u9867\u554f||senior advisors}}. The saik\u014d-komon control their own turfs in different areas or cities. They have their own underlings, including other [[underboss]]es, advisors, accountants and enforcers.\n\nThose who have received sake from oyabun are part of the immediate family and ranked in terms of elder or younger brothers. However, each kobun, in turn, can offer sakazuki as oyabun to his underling to form an affiliated organisation, which might in turn form lower ranked organizations. In the Yamaguchi-gumi, which controls some 2,500 businesses and 500 Yakuza groups, there are fifth rank subsidiary organizations.<!--\n[[File:Hitokiri Ginji, Black Lagoon Vol.4.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fictional Yakuza character with typical upper-body [[irezumi|Yakuza tattoos]], from the ''[[Black Lagoon]]'' manga series.

Upon a first offense, the transgressor must cut off the tip of his left little finger and give the severed portion to his boss. Sometimes an underboss may do this in penance to the oyabun if he wants to spare a member of his own gang from further retaliation. This practice has started to wane amongst the younger members, due to it being an easy identifier for police.<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/yakuza-yamaguchi-gumi-explainer/ | work=CNN | title=The yakuza: Inside Japan's murky criminal underworld}}</ref>\n\nIts origin stems from the traditional way of holding a [[Kenjutsu|Japanese sword]]. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the thumb and index fingers slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger moving up the hand to the index finger progressively weakens a person's sword grip.\n\nThe idea is that a person with a weak sword grip then has to rely more on the group for protection\u2014reducing individual action. In recent years, [[prosthetic]] fingertips have been developed to disguise this distinctive appearance.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/>\n\nMany Yakuza have full-body tattoos (including their [[genitalia]]). These tattoos, known as [[irezumi]] in Japan, are still often \"hand-poked\", that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and handheld tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. The procedure is expensive, painful, and can take years to complete.<ref>''[[Japanorama]]'', [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]], Series 2, Episode 3, first aired 21 September 2006</ref>\n\nWhen Yakuza members play [[Oicho-Kabu]] cards with each other, they often remove their shirts or open them up and drape them around their waists. This enables them to display their full-body tattoos to each other. This is one of the few times that Yakuza members display their tattoos to others, as they normally keep them concealed in public with long-sleeved and high-necked shirts. When new members join, they are often required to remove their trousers as well and reveal any lower body tattoos.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Syndicates==\n{{Further|List of Yakuza syndicates}}{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Four largest syndicates===\nAlthough Yakuza membership has declined since the implementation of the Anti-[[Boryokudan]] Act in 1992, according to the [[National Police Agency (Japan)]] there are still approximately 39,100 active Yakuza members in Japan as of 2016.<ref>http://www.npa.go.jp/english/kokusai/pdf/Police_of_Japan_2017_full_text.pdf \"Police of Japan 2017\"</ref> \nThe Yakuza does not consist of just one group, rather there are many different [[syndicate]] groups that together form one of the largest organized crime groups in the world.<ref>Johnston, Eric, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070214i1.html From rackets to real estate, yakuza multifaceted]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 14 February 2007, p. 3.</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!

In essence, this is a specialized form of [[protection racket]]. Instead of harassing small businesses, the Yakuza harass a stockholders' meeting of a larger corporation.

Jiageya specialize in inducing holders of small real estate to sell their property so that estate companies can carry out much larger development plans. Japan's bubble economy of the 1980s is often blamed on real estate speculation by banking subsidiaries.

This is in line with the idea that their activities are semi-open; theft by definition would be a covert activity. More importantly, such an act would be considered a trespass by the community. Also, Yakuza usually do not conduct the actual business operation by themselves. Core business activities such as merchandising, loan sharking or management of gambling houses are typically managed by non-Yakuza members who pay protection fees for their activities.\n\nThere is much evidence of Yakuza involvement in international crime. There are many tattooed Yakuza members imprisoned in various Asian prisons for such crimes as drug trafficking and arms smuggling. In 1997, one verified Yakuza member was caught smuggling 4 kilograms (8.82 pounds) of [[heroin]] into Canada.\n\nBecause of their history as a legitimate feudal organization and their connection to the Japanese political system through the ''[[uyoku dantai]]'' (extreme right-wing political groups), Yakuza are somewhat a part of the Japanese establishment, with six [[fan magazine]]s reporting on their activities.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-yakuzas-ties-to-the-japanese-right-wing-000 | work=Vice Today | title=The Yakuza's Ties to the Japanese Right Wing}}</ref> Yakuza involvement in politics functions similarly to that of a lobbying group, with them backing those who share in their opinions or beliefs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/13/the-yakuza-lobby/ | work=Foreign Policy | title=The Yakuza Lobby}}</ref> One study found that 1 in 10 adults under the age of 40 believed that the Yakuza should be allowed to exist.{{r|adelstein20110318}} In the 1980s in [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], a Yakuza war spiraled out of control and civilians were hurt. It was a large conflict between the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] and [[Dojin-kai]], called the ''Yama-Michi War''. The police stepped in and forced the Yakuza bosses on both sides to declare a truce in public.\n\nAt various times, people in Japanese cities have launched anti-Yakuza campaigns with mixed and varied success. In March 1995, the Japanese government passed the ''Act for Prevention of Unlawful Activities by Criminal Gang Members'', which made traditional [[racketeering]] much more difficult.

They easily fit into the local population, since many tourists from Japan and other Asian countries visit the islands on a regular basis, and there is a large population of residents who are of full or partial Japanese descent. They also work with local gangs, funneling Japanese tourists to gambling parlors and brothels.<ref name=crimelibrary/>\n\nIn California, the Yakuza have made alliances with local Korean gangs as well as [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese triads]]. They allied with Vietnamese gangs to use them as muscle, as they had potential to become extremely violent as needed. The Yakuza saw their potential following the constant Vietnamese cafe shoot-outs and home invasion burglaries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In New York City, they appear to collect finder's fees from Russian, Irish and Italian gang members and businessmen for guiding Japanese tourists to gambling establishments, both legal and illegal.<ref name=crimelibrary/>\n\n[[Handgun]]s manufactured in the US account for a large share (33%) of handguns seized in Japan, followed by [[China]] (16%) and the [[Philippines]] (10%).

The burakumin are [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of outcast communities of the pre-modern, especially the [[feudal Japan hierarchy|feudal era]], mainly those with occupations considered tainted with death or [[ritual impurity]], such as butchers, [[executioner]]s, [[undertaker]]s, or [[leather worker]]s. They traditionally lived in their own secluded [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]].\n\nAccording to [[David E. Kaplan (author)|David E.

Methods include that which brought down [[Al Capone]]: checking the organization's finances. The [[Financial Services Agency]] ordered [[Mizuho Financial Group]], Inc. to improve compliance and that its top executives report by 28 October 2013 what they knew and when about a consumer-credit affiliate found making loans to crime groups. This adds pressure to the group from the U.S. as well where an executive order in 2011 required financial institutions to freeze Yakuza assets. As of 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] has frozen about US$55,000 of Yakuza holdings, including two Japan-issued American Express cards.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-22/yazkuza-mobsters-whacked-by-regulators-freezing-amexs.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Yakuza Bosses Whacked by Regulators Freezing AmEx Cards}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n=== Yakuza in society ===\nThe Yakuza have had mixed relations with Japanese society. They function as a police force in their areas of operation, to help reduce crime (that would be their competition). They also provide protection to businesses and relief in times of disaster. These actions have painted Yakuza in a fairly positive light within Japan. However, gang-wars, and the use of violence as a tool have caused their approval to fall with the general public.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/09/where-have-japan-s-yakuza-gone | work=Daily Beast | title=Where Have Japan's Yakuza Gone?}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Yakuza have been  in media and culture in many different fashions. Creating its own [[Yakuza film|genre]] of movies within Japan's film industry, the portrayal of the Yakuza mainly manifests in one of two archetypes; they are portrayed as either honorable and respectable men or as criminals who use fear and violence as their means of operation.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/yakuza-kind-hearted-criminals-or-monsters-in-suits | work=Japan Today | title=Yakuza: Kind-hearted criminals or monsters in suits? | date=10 October 2012 | accessdate=18 January 2019 }}</ref> Movies like ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity (film)|Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' portray some of the members as violent criminals, with the focus being on the violence, while other movies focus more on the \"business\" side of the Yakuza.\n\nThe Netflix film ''[[The Outsider (2018 film)|The Outsider]]'' centers around Nick Lowell, an American who falls in with a Yakuza clan in post-war Japan and focuses on his rise within the family.\n\n===Television===\nThe Yakuza make an appearance outside 742 Evergreen Terrace in the episode of the American TV Series [[The Simpsons]] called [[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]. Marge's Pretzel rivals ask the Yakuza to appear outside The Simpson House. They fight the mob gang that is lead by Fat Tony.\n\nThe Yakuza play a very important role in the ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' remake. Lead character [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Kono Kalakaua|Kono Kalakaua's]] husband [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Adam Noshimuri|Adam Noshimuri]] was the former head of the Yakuza who took over after his father Hiro Noshimuri died. Adam's brother [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Michael Nosimuri|Michael Noshimuri]] was also part of the Yakuza.\n\nThe Yakuza are also the basis for the 2019 BBC TV Series [[Giri/Haji]].\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe video game series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'', launched in 2005, portrays the actions of several different ranking members of the Yakuza throughout the series. The series addresses some of the same themes as the Yakuza genre of film does, like violence, honor, politics of the syndicates, etc. The series has been successful; spawning sequels, spin-offs, a live action [[Like a Dragon|movie]] and a web TV series.\n\n''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' features a Yakuza clan that assists the protagonist in the second and third act after they cut their ties with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]. The Yakuza derive most of their income from a casino, Kenji's, and are currently fighting to keep other gangs from peddling drugs in their territory. Towards the end of the third act, the player assassinates the leader of the clan, and the other members are executed by Colombian gangsters.\n\n''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' features a mission set in Japan that sees Agent 47 assassinating the son of a wealthy arms dealer during his dinner meeting with a Yakuza boss. A mission in a later game, ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', set at a secluded mountaintop hospital, features a notorious Yakuza lawyer as one of two targets.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[893239]] or Yakuza-Nijusan-Ku\n* [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku]]\n* [[Chimpira]], low ranking Yakuza\n* [[Crime in Japan]]\n* [[Criminal tattoo]]\n* [[Gopnik]]\n* [[Irezumi]]\n* [[Kkangpae]] (Korean mafia)\n* [[List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates]]\n* [[Organized crime]]\n* [[Punch perm]]\n* [[Russian mafia]]\n* [[Sicilian Mafia]]\n* [[American Mafia]]\n* [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]]\n* [[Yakuza exclusion ordinances]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Portal bar|Japan}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Bruno, A.

These works attracted little notice beyond the schools and congregations of conservative fundamental and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christians until the 1970s, when its followers [[Creation\u2013evolution controversy|challenged the teaching of evolution]] in the [[State school#United States|public school]]s and other venues in the United States, bringing it to the attention of the public-at-large and the scientific community.

These describe how God calls the world into existence through the power of speech (\"And God said, Let there be light,\" etc.) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a worldwide flood destroys all life except for [[Noah]] and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 \"nations\" of the world; the nations live together until the incident of the [[Tower of Babel]], when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science attempts to explain history and science within the span of [[Chronology of the Bible|Biblical chronology]], which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago.\n\n===Modern religious affiliations===\nMost creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or Evangelical Christian beliefs in Biblical literalism or Biblical inerrancy, as opposed to the [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] supported by [[liberal Christianity]] in the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]].

The book, originally titled ''Biology and Creation'' but renamed ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', was released in 1989 and became the first published work to promote the [[anti-evolutionist]] design argument under the name intelligent design. The contents of the book later became a focus of evidence in the federal court case, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', when a group of parents filed suit to halt the teaching of intelligent design in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], public schools. School board officials there had attempted to include ''Of Pandas and People'' in their biology classrooms and testimony given during the trial revealed the book was originally written as a creationist text but following the adverse decision in the Supreme Court it underwent simple cosmetic editing to remove the explicit allusions to \"creation\" or \"creator,\" and replace them instead with references to \"design\" or \"designer.\"<ref name=\"numbers\">{{harvnb|Numbers|2006}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1990s, intelligent design had become a separate movement.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> The creation science movement is distinguished from the intelligent design movement, or [[neo-creationism]], because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account, and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account through the use of science. In contrast, as a matter of principle, neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its [[polemic]]s and stated goals (see [[Wedge strategy]]). By so doing, intelligent design proponents have attempted to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula. Carefully avoiding any reference to the identity of the [[intelligent designer]] as God in their public arguments, intelligent design proponents sought to reintroduce the creationist ideas into science classrooms while sidestepping the First Amendment's prohibition against religious infringement.<ref name=\"Johnson-Touchstone\">{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |authorlink=Phillip E.

Christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the Bible, that the Bible is inerrant in this description (and elsewhere), and therefore empirical scientific evidence must correspond with that description. Creationists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles. They claim this to be the motivating factor in science's acceptance of Darwinism, a term used in creation science to refer to evolutionary biology which is also often used as a disparagement. Critics argue that creation science is religious rather than scientific because it stems from [[faith]] in a religious text rather than by the application of the [[scientific method]].<ref name=\"McLean_vs_Arkansas\" /> The United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) has stated unequivocally, \"Evolution pervades all biological phenomena.

Gentry claimed that Baillieul could not publish his criticisms in a reputable scientific journal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.halos.com/faq-replies/creation-halos-stand-unrefuted.htm |title=It Stands Unrefuted |last=Gentry |first=Bob |authorlink=Robert V.

The primary challenge for young-universe cosmologies is that the accepted distances in the Universe require millions or billions of years for [[speed of light|light to travel]] to Earth (the \"[[Creationist cosmologies#The \"starlight problem\"|starlight problem]]\"). An older creationist idea, proposed by creationist astronomer Barry Setterfield, is that the speed of light has decayed in the [[Chronology of the universe|history of the Universe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/c-decay.html |title=The Decay of ''c''-decay |last=Day |first=Robert |year=1997 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-09-18}}</ref> More recently, creationist physicist [[Russell Humphreys]] has proposed a hypothesis called \"white hole cosmology\" which suggests that the Universe expanded out of a [[white hole]] less than 10,000 years ago; the apparent age of the universe results from [[general relativity|relativistic]] effects.{{sfn|Humphreys|1994|ps=}} Humphreys' theory is advocated by creationist organisations such as [[Answers in Genesis]]; however because the predictions of Humphreys' cosmology conflict with current observations, it is not accepted by the scientific community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE412.html |title=CE412: Fast old light |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |date=February 6, 2006 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html#humphreys |title=Evidence for the Big Bang |last1=Feuerbacher |first1=Bj\u00f6rn |last2=Scranton |first2=Ryan |date=January 25, 2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-09-18}}</ref>\n\n====Planetology====\n{{see also|Planetary science}}\nVarious claims are made by creationists concerning alleged evidence that the age of the [[Solar System]] is of the order of thousands of years, in contrast to the scientifically accepted age of 4.6 billion years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interacademies.net/File.aspx?id=6150 |format=PDF |title=IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution |author=IAP Member Academies |date=June 21, 2006 |website=[[InterAcademy Panel|IAP]] |publisher=[[TWAS|The World Academy of Sciences]] |location=Trieste, Italy |accessdate=2014-09-18}}</ref> It is commonly argued that the number of [[comet]]s in the Solar System is much higher than would be expected given its supposed age.

These describe how God calls the world into existence through the power of speech (\"And God said, Let there be light,\" etc.) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a worldwide flood destroys all life except for [[Noah]] and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 \"nations\" of the world; the nations live together until the incident of the [[Tower of Babel]], when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science attempts to explain history and science within the span of [[Chronology of the Bible|Biblical chronology]], which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago.\n\n===Modern religious affiliations===\nMost creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or Evangelical Christian beliefs in Biblical literalism or Biblical inerrancy, as opposed to the [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] supported by [[liberal Christianity]] in the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]]. However, there are also examples of [[Islamic views on evolution|Islamic]] and [[Jewish views on evolution|Jewish]] scientific creationism that conform to the accounts of creation as recorded in their religious doctrines.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sayin |first1=\u00dcmit |last2=Kence |first2=Aykut |date=November\u2013December 1999 |title=Islamic Scientific Creationism: A New Challenge in Turkey |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/19/6/islamic-scientific-creationism |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=18\u201320, 25\u201329 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2014-09-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Scott_1997\">{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=1997 |url=http://bio.classes.ucsc.edu/bio175/Other/Scott_1997.pdf |title=Antievolutionism and Creationism in the United States |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |volume=26 |pages=263\u2013289 |issn=0084-6570 |accessdate=2014-09-18 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.263 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613195924/http://bio.classes.ucsc.edu/bio175/Other/Scott_1997.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] has a history of support for creation science.

The book, originally titled ''Biology and Creation'' but renamed ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', was released in 1989 and became the first published work to promote the [[anti-evolutionist]] design argument under the name intelligent design. The contents of the book later became a focus of evidence in the federal court case, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', when a group of parents filed suit to halt the teaching of intelligent design in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], public schools. School board officials there had attempted to include ''Of Pandas and People'' in their biology classrooms and testimony given during the trial revealed the book was originally written as a creationist text but following the adverse decision in the Supreme Court it underwent simple cosmetic editing to remove the explicit allusions to \"creation\" or \"creator,\" and replace them instead with references to \"design\" or \"designer.\"<ref name=\"numbers\">{{harvnb|Numbers|2006}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1990s, intelligent design had become a separate movement.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> The creation science movement is distinguished from the intelligent design movement, or [[neo-creationism]], because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account, and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account through the use of science. In contrast, as a matter of principle, neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its [[polemic]]s and stated goals (see [[Wedge strategy]]). By so doing, intelligent design proponents have attempted to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula.

Christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the Bible, that the Bible is inerrant in this description (and elsewhere), and therefore empirical scientific evidence must correspond with that description. Creationists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles. They claim this to be the motivating factor in science's acceptance of Darwinism, a term used in creation science to refer to evolutionary biology which is also often used as a disparagement. Critics argue that creation science is religious rather than scientific because it stems from [[faith]] in a religious text rather than by the application of the [[scientific method]].<ref name=\"McLean_vs_Arkansas\" /> The United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) has stated unequivocally, \"Evolution pervades all biological phenomena.

Gentry claimed that Baillieul could not publish his criticisms in a reputable scientific journal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.halos.com/faq-replies/creation-halos-stand-unrefuted.htm |title=It Stands Unrefuted |last=Gentry |first=Bob |authorlink=Robert V.

The primary challenge for young-universe cosmologies is that the accepted distances in the Universe require millions or billions of years for [[speed of light|light to travel]] to Earth (the \"[[Creationist cosmologies#The \"starlight problem\"|starlight problem]]\"). An older creationist idea, proposed by creationist astronomer Barry Setterfield, is that the speed of light has decayed in the [[Chronology of the universe|history of the Universe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/c-decay.html |title=The Decay of ''c''-decay |last=Day |first=Robert |year=1997 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-09-18}}</ref> More recently, creationist physicist [[Russell Humphreys]] has proposed a hypothesis called \"white hole cosmology\" which suggests that the Universe expanded out of a [[white hole]] less than 10,000 years ago; the apparent age of the universe results from [[general relativity|relativistic]] effects.{{sfn|Humphreys|1994|ps=}} Humphreys' theory is advocated by creationist organisations such as [[Answers in Genesis]]; however because the predictions of Humphreys' cosmology conflict with current observations, it is not accepted by the scientific community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE412.html |title=CE412: Fast old light |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |date=February 6, 2006 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html#humphreys |title=Evidence for the Big Bang |last1=Feuerbacher |first1=Bj\u00f6rn |last2=Scranton |first2=Ryan |date=January 25, 2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-09-18}}</ref>\n\n====Planetology====\n{{see also|Planetary science}}\nVarious claims are made by creationists concerning alleged evidence that the age of the [[Solar System]] is of the order of thousands of years, in contrast to the scientifically accepted age of 4.6 billion years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interacademies.net/File.aspx?id=6150 |format=PDF |title=IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution |author=IAP Member Academies |date=June 21, 2006 |website=[[InterAcademy Panel|IAP]] |publisher=[[TWAS|The World Academy of Sciences]] |location=Trieste, Italy |accessdate=2014-09-18}}</ref> It is commonly argued that the number of [[comet]]s in the Solar System is much higher than would be expected given its supposed age.

The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them.]]\n\nA '''Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)''' (also known as '''post-wall waveguide''' or '''laminated waveguide''') is a synthetic [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular electromagnetic waveguide]] formed in a [[dielectric]] substrate by densely arraying metallized posts or [[Via (electronics)|via-hole]]s which connect the upper and lower metal plates of the substrate. The waveguide can be easily fabricated with low-cost mass-production using [[Through-hole technology|through-hole techniques]] where the post walls consists of [[via fence]]s. SIW is known to have similar guided wave and mode characteristics to conventional rectangular waveguide with equivalent [[guide wavelength]].\n\nSince the emergence of new communication technologies in the 1990s, there has been an increasing need for high-performance millimeter-wave systems. These need to be reliable, low-cost, compact, and compatible with high-frequencies. Unfortunately, above 10&nbsp;GHz, the well known [[microstrip]] and [[coplanar waveguide|coplanar lines]] technologies cannot be used because they have high insertion and radiation losses at these frequencies. The [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular waveguide]] topology can overcome these issues as it offers an excellent immunity against radiation losses and presents low insertion losses. But in their classical form, rectangular waveguide is not compatible with the miniaturization required by modern applications.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ke Wu|last2=Desiandes|first2=D.|last3=Cassivi|first3=Y.|date=2003|title=The substrate integrated circuits - a new concept for high-frequency electronics and optoelectronics|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1246173/|journal=6th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Service, 2003.

Using a single substrate guarantees a limited volume and a simplicity of manufacture, while the rectangular cross-section of the line provides the advantages of the waveguide topology in terms of losses.\n\n== Principles of SIW ==\n\n[[File:SIW horizontal.png|alt=Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide.|thumb|Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide. The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them.

The effective width <math display=\"inline\">a_e</math>, computed from <math display=\"inline\">a</math>, <math display=\"inline\">d</math> and <math display=\"inline\">s</math> is also presented.]]\n\n=== Geometry ===\n\nA classical SIW is composed of a thin dielectric substrate covered on both faces by a metallic layer. The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure). Due to the vias geometry, this distance cannot be utilized directly; because of the space between successive vias and their circular shape, the signal inside the guide does not behave exactly as it would in a perfectly rectangular waveguide of the same width.\n\nTo apply waveguide theory to SIWs, an effective width <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>can be used. Its takes into account the shape of the vias and the space in-between. Its value lies between <math>a + d</math> and <math>a - d</math>.\n\nA common simple definition is<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Cassivi|first=Y.|last2=Perregrini|first2=L.|last3=Arcioni|first3=P.|last4=Bressan|first4=M.|last5=Wu|first5=K.|last6=Conciauro|first6=G.|date=September 2002|title=Dispersion characteristics of substrate integrated rectangular waveguide|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1031925/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=12|issue=9|pages=333\u2013335|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2002.803188|issn=1531-1309}}</ref>\n\n<math>a_\\text{eff} = a - \\frac{d^2}{0.95 s}</math>\n\nand a more refined definition used for large values of <math>d/a</math> is,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Feng Xu|last2=Ke Wu|date=January 2005|title=Guided-wave and leakage characteristics of substrate integrated waveguide|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1381676/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques|volume=53|issue=1|pages=66\u201373|doi=10.1109/TMTT.2004.839303|issn=0018-9480}}</ref><br /><math>a_\\text{eff} = a - 1.08 \\frac{d^2}{s} + 0.1 \\frac{d^2}{a}.</math>\n\nUsing this effective width, the propagation constant of a SIW will be similar to that of a classical rectangular waveguide whose width is <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>. The formulas given above are empirical: they were established comparing the dispersion characteristics of different SIWs to those of rectangular waveguide filled with the same dielectric material.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Transitions ==\n\nSIWs are promising structures that can be used in complex microwave systems as interconnects, filters, etc. However, a problem may arise: the connection of the SIWs with other kinds of [[Transmission line|transmission lines (TL)]], mainly [[microstrip]], [[Coplanar waveguide|coplanar]] and [[coaxial cable]]. The goal of such transitions between two different topologies of TL is to excite the correct transmission mode in the SIW cavity with the minimum loss of power and on the broadest possible frequency range.\n\nRapidly after the presentation of the concept of SIW by [[Ke Wu]], two different transitions were mainly used<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. First, the tapered transition allowing to convert a microstrip line into a SIW and secondly a transition between a coplanar line and a SIW (see attached figure). The tapered transition from microstrip to SIW is useful for thin substrates. In this case, the radiation losses associated with microstrip lines are not too significant. This transition is massively used and different optimizing process have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayas-Sanchez|first=Jose E.|last2=Gutierrez-Ayala|first2=Vladimir|date=2008|title=A general EM-based design procedure for single-layer substrate integrated waveguide interconnects with microstrip transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632999/|journal=2008 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=983\u2013986|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2008.4632999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Dominic|date=2010|title=Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5517884/|journal=2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|pages=704\u2013707|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517884}}</ref> But this is not applicable to thick substrates where leakages are important. In that situation, a coplanar excitation of the SIW is recommended. The drawback of the coplanar transition is the narrower bandwidth.\n\nThese two kinds of transitions involve lines that are embedded in the same substrate, which is not the case for coaxial lines. There exists no direct transition between a coaxial line and a SIW: an other planar line have to be used to convert properly the coaxial TEM propagation modes to the TE modes in SIW.\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to optimize the transition between topologies without being able to determine a universal rule making it possible to draw the absolute transition. The architecture, the frequency range, the used materials, etc. are examples of parameters that make specific the design procedure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiao-Ping|last2=Wu|first2=Ke|date=2009|title=Low-loss ultra-wideband transition between conductor-backed coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5165705/|journal=2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=349\u2013352|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165705}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sunho|last2=Jung|first2=Sangwoon|last3=Lee|first3=Hai-Young|date=2008|title=Ultra-Wideband CPW-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide Transition Using an Elevated-CPW Section|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4666756/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=18|issue=11|pages=746\u2013748|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2008.2005230|issn=1531-1309}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taringou|first=Farzaneh|last2=Bornemann|first2=Jens|date=2011|title=New substrate-integrated to coplanar waveguide transition|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6101767/|journal=2011 41st European Microwave Conference|pages=428\u2013431|doi=10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101767}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align    = center   \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = SIW tapered transition.svg\n| caption1 = Transition from microstrip to SIW\n| width1   = 200\n| image2   = SIW transition CPWG.svg\n| caption2 = Transition from a coplanar line to a SIW\n| width2   = 200\n| footer   = Examples of transitions from coplanar and microstrip lines to SIW.

This loss is generated by different phenomena and each of them is represented by a term <math>\\alpha</math>. The most common terms are the following:<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/waveguide-loss|title=Microwaves101 {{!}} Waveguide Loss|website=www.microwaves101.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n*<math>\\alpha_C</math> : the loss due to the external metal conductivity\n*<math>\\alpha_D\n</math> : the loss due to loss tangent of the dielectric medium filling the waveguide\n*<math>\\alpha_G</math> : the loss due to conductivity of the dielectric medium filling the waveguide\n*<math>\\alpha_R</math> : the loss due to radiation.\n\nThis decomposition is valid for all kind of [[Transmission line|transmission lines]]. However, for [[Rectangular waveguide|rectangular waveguides]], the attenuation due to radiations and substrate [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] is negligible. Indeed, usually, the substrate is an insulator such that <math>\\alpha_G \\simeq 0</math>. In the same way, if the wall thickness is much thicker than the skin depth of the signal, no radiation will appear. This is in fact one of the advantages of closed waveguides compared to open lines such as microstrips.\n\nThe SIWs show comparable or lower losses compared the other traditional planar structures like microstrip or coplanar lines especially at high frequencies.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the substrate is thick enough, the losses are dominated by the dielectric behavior of the substrate.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Attenuation due to conduction currents ===\nPart of the signal attenuation is due to the [[Current density|surface current density]] flowing through the metallic walls of the waveguide. These currents are induced by the propagating [[Electromagnetic field|electromagnetic fields]]. These losses may also be named ohmic losses for obvious reasons. They are linked to the finite conductivity of the metals: the better the conduction, the lower the losses. The power lost per unit length <math>P_l</math> can be calculated by integrating the current densities <math>J_s</math> on a path <math>C</math> enclosing the waveguide walls : <ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n<math display=\"block\">P_l = \\frac{1}{2} R_s \\int_C |{J_s}|^2 dl.</math>\n\nIt can be shown that in a classical rectangular waveguide, the attenuation of the dominant mode <math>\\text{TE}_{10}</math> due to conduction currents is given, in [[Neper|Nepers]] per [[Metre|meter]], by<math display=\"block\" id=\"alpha_c_expression\">\\alpha_C = \\frac{R_s}{a^3 b \\beta k \\eta}  \\left( 2 b \\pi^2 + a^3 k^2 \\right) =  \\frac{R_s}{\\beta k \\eta} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi^2}{a^3 } + \\frac{k^2}{b} \\right)</math>where\n\n* <math>a</math> is the width of the waveguide\n* <math>b</math> its height\n* <math>\\eta = \\sqrt{\\mu / \\epsilon}</math> the [[wave impedance]] \n* <math>k = \\omega \\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon}</math> the [[wave vector]]\n* <math>\\delta = 1 / \\sqrt{\\pi f \\mu \\sigma}</math> the [[Skin Depth|skin depth]] in the conductor \n* <math>R_s = \\frac{1}{\\delta \\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu}{2 \\sigma}}</math> is the [[sheet resistance]] (of surface impedance).\n\nIt is noticeable that <math>\\alpha_C</math> is directly linked to the substrate thickness <math>b</math>: the thinner the substrate, the higher the conduction losses.

The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them.]]\n\nA '''Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)''' (also known as '''post-wall waveguide''' or '''laminated waveguide''') is a synthetic [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular electromagnetic waveguide]] formed in a [[dielectric]] substrate by densely arraying metallized posts or [[Via (electronics)|via-hole]]s which connect the upper and lower metal plates of the substrate. The waveguide can be easily fabricated with low-cost mass-production using [[Through-hole technology|through-hole techniques]] where the post walls consists of [[via fence]]s. SIW is known to have similar guided wave and mode characteristics to conventional rectangular waveguide with equivalent [[guide wavelength]].\n\nSince the emergence of new communication technologies in the 1990s, there has been an increasing need for high-performance millimeter-wave systems. These need to be reliable, low-cost, compact, and compatible with high-frequencies. Unfortunately, above 10&nbsp;GHz, the well known [[microstrip]] and [[coplanar waveguide|coplanar lines]] technologies cannot be used because they have high insertion and radiation losses at these frequencies. The [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular waveguide]] topology can overcome these issues as it offers an excellent immunity against radiation losses and presents low insertion losses. But in their classical form, rectangular waveguide is not compatible with the miniaturization required by modern applications.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ke Wu|last2=Desiandes|first2=D.|last3=Cassivi|first3=Y.|date=2003|title=The substrate integrated circuits - a new concept for high-frequency electronics and optoelectronics|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1246173/|journal=6th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Service, 2003.

Using a single substrate guarantees a limited volume and a simplicity of manufacture, while the rectangular cross-section of the line provides the advantages of the waveguide topology in terms of losses.\n\n== Principles of SIW ==\n\n[[File:SIW horizontal.png|alt=Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide.|thumb|Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide. The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them.

The effective width <math>a_e</math>, computed from <math>a</math>, <math>d</math> and <math>s</math>,with is also presented.]]\n\n=== Geometry ===\n\nA classical SIW is composed of a thin dielectric substrate covered on both faces by a metallic layer. The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure). Due to the vias geometry, this distance cannot be utilized directly; because of the space between successive vias and their circular shape, the signal inside the guide does not behave exactly as it would in a perfectly rectangular waveguide of the same width.\n\nTo apply waveguide theory to SIWs, an effective width <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>can be used. Its takes into account the shape of the vias and the space in-between. Its value lies between <math>a + d</math> and <math>a - d</math>.\n\nA common simple definition is<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Cassivi|first=Y.|last2=Perregrini|first2=L.|last3=Arcioni|first3=P.|last4=Bressan|first4=M.|last5=Wu|first5=K.|last6=Conciauro|first6=G.|date=September 2002|title=Dispersion characteristics of substrate integrated rectangular waveguide|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1031925/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=12|issue=9|pages=333\u2013335|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2002.803188|issn=1531-1309}}</ref>\n\n<math>a_\\text{eff} = a - \\frac{d^2}{0.95 s}</math>\n\nand a more refined definition used for large values of <math>d/a</math> is,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Feng Xu|last2=Ke Wu|date=January 2005|title=Guided-wave and leakage characteristics of substrate integrated waveguide|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1381676/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques|volume=53|issue=1|pages=66\u201373|doi=10.1109/TMTT.2004.839303|issn=0018-9480}}</ref><br /><math>a_\\text{eff} = a - 1.08 \\frac{d^2}{s} + 0.1 \\frac{d^2}{a}.</math>\n\nUsing this effective width, the propagation constant of a SIW will be similar to that of a classical rectangular waveguide whose width is <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>.

The goal of such transitions between two different topologies of TL is to excite the correct transmission mode in the SIW cavity with the minimum loss of power and on the broadest possible frequency range.\n\nRapidly after the presentation of the concept of SIW by [[Ke Wu]], two different transitions were mainly used<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. First, the tapered transition allowing to convert a microstrip line into a SIW and secondly a transition between a coplanar line and a SIW (see attached figure). The tapered transition from microstrip to SIW is useful for thin substrates. In this case, the radiation losses associated with microstrip lines are not too significant. This transition is massively used and different optimizing process have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayas-Sanchez|first=Jose E.|last2=Gutierrez-Ayala|first2=Vladimir|date=2008|title=A general EM-based design procedure for single-layer substrate integrated waveguide interconnects with microstrip transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632999/|journal=2008 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=983\u2013986|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2008.4632999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Dominic|date=2010|title=Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5517884/|journal=2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|pages=704\u2013707|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517884}}</ref> But this is not applicable to thick substrates where leakages are important. In that situation, a coplanar excitation of the SIW is recommended. The drawback of the coplanar transition is the narrower bandwidth.\n\nThese two kinds of transitions involve lines that are embedded in the same substrate, which is not the case for coaxial lines. There exists no direct transition between a coaxial line and a SIW: an other planar line have to be used to convert properly the coaxial TEM propagation modes to the TE modes in SIW.\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to optimize the transition between topologies without being able to determine a universal rule making it possible to draw the absolute transition. The architecture, the frequency range, the used materials, etc. are examples of parameters that make specific the design procedure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiao-Ping|last2=Wu|first2=Ke|date=2009|title=Low-loss ultra-wideband transition between conductor-backed coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5165705/|journal=2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=349\u2013352|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165705}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sunho|last2=Jung|first2=Sangwoon|last3=Lee|first3=Hai-Young|date=2008|title=Ultra-Wideband CPW-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide Transition Using an Elevated-CPW Section|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4666756/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=18|issue=11|pages=746\u2013748|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2008.2005230|issn=1531-1309}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taringou|first=Farzaneh|last2=Bornemann|first2=Jens|date=2011|title=New substrate-integrated to coplanar waveguide transition|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6101767/|journal=2011 41st European Microwave Conference|pages=428\u2013431|doi=10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101767}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align    = center   \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = SIW tapered transition.svg\n| caption1 = Transition from microstrip to SIW\n| width1   = 200\n| image2   = SIW transition CPWG.svg\n| caption2 = Transition from a coplanar line to a SIW\n| width2   = 200\n| footer   = Examples of transitions from coplanar and microstrip lines to SIW.

Indeed, usually, the substrate is an insulator such that <math>\\alpha_G \\simeq 0</math>. In the same way, if the wall thickness is much thicker than the skin depth of the signal, no radiation will appear.

These leakages can significantly affect the global transmission quality if the vias geometry is not chosen carefully. Some studies have been conducted to describe, predict and reduce the radiation losses. They have resulted in some simple geometric rules that have to be satisfied in order to reduce the radiation losses. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=Maurizio|last2=Pasian|first2=Marco|last3=Perregrini|first3=Luca|last4=Wu|first4=Ke|date=2009-10|title=On the losses in substrate-integrated waveguides and cavities|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1759078709990493/type/journal_article|journal=International Journal of Microwave and Wireless Technologies|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|pages=395\u2013401|doi=10.1017/S1759078709990493|issn=1759-0787}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Che|first=Wenquan|last2=Wang|first2=Dapeng|last3=Deng|first3=Kuan|last4=Chow|first4=Y.

{"title_page": "Quantum tunnelling", "text_new": "{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}\n\n'''Quantum tunnelling''' or '''tunneling''' (US) is the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon where a [[subatomic particle]]'s probability disappears from one side of a [[potential barrier]] and appears on the other side without any  probability current (flow) appearing inside the well.  Quantum tunnelling is not predicted by the laws of [[classical mechanics]] where surmounting a potential barrier requires enough potential energy.\n\nQuantum tunnelling plays an essential role in several physical phenomena, such as the [[nuclear fusion]] that occurs in [[main sequence]] stars like the [[Sun]].<ref>{{cite book |title=College Physics |volume=2 |last=Serway |last2=Vuille |year=2008 |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont |isbn=978-0-495-55475-2 |edition=Eighth }}</ref> It has important [[Quantum tunnelling#Applications|applications]] in the [[tunnel diode]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=J. |title=Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers |page=234 |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-13-805715-2 }}</ref> [[quantum computing]], and in the [[scanning tunnelling microscope]].

Quantum tunneling is projected to create physical limits to the size of the [[transistor]]s used in [[microprocessors]], due to electrons being able to ''tunnel'' past them if the transistors are too small.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28|title=Quantum Computers Explained \u2013 Limits of Human Technology|date=2017-12-08|website=youtube.com|publisher=Kurzgesagt|access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://semiengineering.com/quantum-effects-at-7-5nm/|title=Quantum Effects At 7/5nm And Beyond|work=Semiconductor Engineering|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nTunnelling is often explained in terms of the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] that the quantum object can be ''known'' as a wave or as a particle in general. In other words, the uncertainty in the exact location of light particles allows these particles to break rules of classical mechanics and move in space without passing over the potential energy barrier.\n\n== History ==\nQuantum tunnelling was developed from the study of [[radioactivity]],<ref name=\"Razavy\" /> which was discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]].<ref name=\"Nimtz\">{{cite book |last=Nimtz |last2=Haibel |title=Zero Time Space |page=1 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2008 }}</ref> Radioactivity was examined further by [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]], for which they earned the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1903.<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Egon Schweidler]] studied its nature, which was later verified empirically by [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch]]. The idea of the [[half-life]] and the possibility of predicting decay was created from their work.<ref name=\"Razavy\" />\n\nIn 1901, Robert Francis Earhart, while investigating the conduction of gases between closely spaced electrodes using the [[Michelson interferometer]] to measure the spacing, discovered an unexpected conduction regime. [[J. J. Thomson]] commented that the finding warranted further investigation. In 1911 and then 1914, then-graduate student Franz Rother, employing Earhart's method for controlling and measuring the electrode separation but with a sensitive platform [[galvanometer]], directly measured steady field emission currents.  In 1926, Rother, using a still newer platform galvanometer of sensitivity 26 pA, measured the [[field emission current]]s in a \"hard\" vacuum between closely spaced electrodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294260678|title=The STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope) [The forgotten contribution of Robert Francis Earhart to the discovery of quantum tunneling.]|author=Thomas Cuff|website=ResearchGate}}</ref>\n\nQuantum tunneling was first noticed in 1927 by [[Friedrich Hund]] when he was calculating the ground state of the [[double-well potential]]<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> and independently in the same year by [[Leonid Mandelstam]] and [[Mikhail Leontovich]] in their analysis of the implications of the then new [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]] for the motion of a particle in a confining potential of a limited spatial extent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Mandelstam |first2=M. |last2=Leontowitsch |title=Zur Theorie der Schr\u00f6dingerschen Gleichung |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik |volume=47 |issue= 1\u20132|pages=131\u2013136 |year=1928 |bibcode = 1928ZPhy...47..131M |doi = 10.1007/BF01391061 }}</ref> Its first application was a mathematical explanation for [[alpha decay]], which was done in 1928 by [[George Gamow]] (who was aware of the findings of Mandelstam and Leontovich<ref>{{cite journal |first=E.

This process cannot be directly perceived, but much of its understanding is shaped by the microscopic world, which [[classical mechanics]] cannot adequately explain. To understand the [[phenomenon]], particles attempting to travel between [[potential barrier]]s can be compared to a ball trying to roll over a hill; [[quantum mechanics]] and [[classical mechanics]] differ in their treatment of this scenario. Classical mechanics predicts that particles that do not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier will not be able to reach the other side. Thus, a ball without sufficient energy to surmount the hill would roll back down. Or, lacking the energy to penetrate a wall, it would bounce back (reflection) or in the extreme case, bury itself inside the wall (absorption). In quantum mechanics, these particles can, with a very small probability, ''tunnel'' to the other side, thus crossing the barrier. Here, the \"ball\" could, in a sense, ''borrow'' energy from its surroundings to tunnel through the wall or \"roll over the hill\", paying it back by making the reflected electrons more energetic than they otherwise would have been.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1119/1.1810153| url=http://www.quantum3000.narod.ru/papers/edu/quantum_tunelling.pdf| title=Quantum tunneling time| journal=American Journal of Physics| volume=73| issue=1| pages=23\u201327| year=2005| last1=Davies| first1=P.

One interpretation of this duality involves the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which defines a limit on how precisely the position and the [[momentum]] of a particle can be known at the same time.<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> This implies that there are no solutions with a probability of exactly zero (or one), though a solution may approach infinity if, for example, the calculation for its position was taken as a probability of 1, the other, i.e. its speed, would have to be infinity. Hence, the probability of a given particle's existence on the opposite side of an intervening barrier is non-zero, and such particles will appear on the 'other' (a semantically difficult word in this instance) side with a relative frequency proportional to this probability.\n\n[[File:EffetTunnel.gif|250px|right|thumb|An electron [[wavepacket]] directed at a potential barrier.

The solid lines represent the [[level set]] of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] <math>H(x,p) = p^2 / 2 + U(x) </math>.]]\n\n=== The tunneling problem ===\nThe [[wave function]] of a particle summarizes everything that can be known about a [[physical system]].<ref>Bjorken and Drell, \"Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\", page 2. Mcgraw-Hill College, 1965.</ref> Therefore, problems in quantum mechanics center on the analysis of the wave function for a system. Using mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, such as the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], the wave function can be solved. The absolute value of this wavefunction to the power of 2 is directly related to the probability density of the particle's position, which describes the probability that the particle is at any given place. In the limit of large barriers, the probability of tunneling decreases for taller and wider barriers.\n\nFor simple tunneling-barrier models, such as the [[rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]], an analytic formulation and thus solution exists. In canonical field theory, the tunneling is described by a wave function which has an amplitude inside the tunnel; but the current is zero there because the relative phase of the amplitude of the conjugate wave function (the time derivative) is orthogonal to it.\n\nAnother way to look at is: The waves were always on BOTH side of the barrier, but on the right the waves were jiggling in opposite directions.  Suppose in the moving illustration on the right, there were another barrier further right and another wave coming FROM the right.  The waves in the middle might be stationary if the waves strike the middle at the same time or sometimes jiggling right and sometimes jiggling left depending on which incoming wave gets there most recently.  It would be like the proverbial steel balls on a string pendulum  for which the middle balls are stationary and the end balls take turns having the \"wave\" bouncing away from the \"barrier\" of the balls in the middle.  In like manner, for a right moving wave, the barrier approximately doubles the amount of the left moving wave in order to keep the wave almost zero on the right side of the barrier.\n\nIn the 2nd moving illustration at right, you can more easily see the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) at work.  A relatively narrow wave impinges on the barrier; the barrier forces it to become even taller and even narrower.  The result is: the wave becomes much more de-localized--in fact it's now on both sides of the barrier, it's wider on each side and lower in maximum amplitude but equal in total amplitude.  In both illustrations, the localization of the wave in space causes the localization of the action of the barrier in time, thus scattering the energy/momentum of the wave.\n\nProblems in real life often do not have one, so \"semiclassical\" or \"quasiclassical\" methods have been developed to give approximate solutions to these problems, like the [[WKB approximation]]. Probabilities may be derived with arbitrary precision, constrained by computational resources, via [[Feynman]]'s [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] method; such precision is seldom required in engineering practice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Related phenomena ==\nThere are several phenomena that have the same behavior as quantum tunnelling, and thus can be accurately described by tunnelling.

Evanescent wave coupling, until recently, was only called \"tunnelling\" in quantum mechanics; now it is used in other contexts.\n\nThese effects are modelled similarly to the [[rectangular potential barrier]]. In these cases, there is one [[transmission medium]] through which the [[wave propagation|wave propagates]] that is the same or nearly the same throughout, and a second medium through which the wave travels differently. This can be described as a thin region of medium B between two regions of medium A. The analysis of a [[Rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]] by means of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be adapted to these other effects provided that the wave equation has [[travelling wave]] solutions in medium A but real [[exponential function|exponential]] solutions in medium B.\n\nIn [[optics]], medium A is a vacuum while medium B is glass. In acoustics, medium A may be a liquid or gas and medium B a solid. For both cases, medium A is a region of space where the particle's [[total energy]] is greater than its [[potential energy]] and medium B is the potential barrier. These have an incoming wave and resultant waves in both directions. There can be more mediums and barriers, and the barriers need not be discrete; approximations are useful in this case.\n\n== Applications ==\nTunnelling occurs with barriers of thickness around 1\u20133&nbsp;nm and smaller,<ref>{{cite book |last=Lerner |last2=Trigg |title=Encyclopedia of Physics |edition=2nd |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 1308] |publisher=VCH |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-89573-752-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 }}</ref> but is the cause of some important macroscopic physical phenomena.

The temperature in stars' cores is generally insufficient to allow atomic nuclei to overcome the [[Coulomb barrier]] and achieve [[Thermonuclear fusion]]. Quantum tunneling increases the probability of penetrating this barrier. Though this probability is still low, the extremely large number of nuclei in the core of a star is sufficient to sustain a steady fusion reaction for millions, billions, or even trillions of years \u2013 a precondition for the evolution of life in insolation habitable zones.

This is done via the tunnelling of a particle out of the nucleus (an electron tunnelling into the nucleus is [[electron capture]]). This was the first application of quantum tunnelling and led to the first approximations. Radioactive decay is also a relevant issue for [[astrobiology]] as this consequence of quantum tunnelling is creating a constant source of energy over a large period of time for environments outside the [[circumstellar habitable zone]] where insolation would not be possible ([[Ocean#Extraterrestrial oceans|subsurface oceans]]) or effective.<ref name=\"Trixler2013\" />\n\n=== Astrochemistry in interstellar clouds ===\nBy including quantum tunnelling, the [[Astrochemistry|astrochemical]] syntheses of various molecules in [[interstellar cloud]]s can be explained such as the synthesis of [[Hydrogen#Elemental molecular forms|molecular hydrogen]], [[water]] ([[ice]]) and the [[Abiogenesis|prebiotic]] important [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=\"Trixler2013\" />\n\n=== Quantum biology ===\nQuantum tunnelling is among the central non trivial quantum effects in [[quantum biology]].

A hydrogen bond joins normal base pairs of DNA.  There exists a double well potential along a hydrogen bond separated by a potential energy barrier. It is believed that the double well potential is asymmetric with one well deeper than the other so the proton normally rests in the deeper well.  For a mutation to occur, the proton must have tunnelled into the shallower of the two potential wells. The movement of the proton from its regular position is called a [[Tautomer|tautomeric transition]].

The device depends on a [[depletion layer]] between [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] and [[P-type semiconductor]]s to serve its purpose; when these are very heavily doped the depletion layer can be thin enough for tunnelling. Then, when a small forward bias is applied, the current due to tunnelling is significant. This has a maximum at the point where the [[voltage bias]] is such that the energy level of the p and n [[conduction band]]s are the same. As the voltage bias is increased, the two conduction bands no longer line up and the diode acts typically.<ref name=\"Krane\">{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Krane |title=Modern Physics |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 423] |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-471-07963-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the tunnelling current drops off rapidly, tunnel diodes can be created that have a range of voltages for which current decreases as voltage is increased. This peculiar property is used in some applications, like high speed devices where the characteristic tunnelling probability changes as rapidly as the bias voltage.<ref name=\"Krane\" />\n\nThe [[resonant tunnelling diode]] makes use of quantum tunnelling in a very different manner to achieve a similar result. This diode has a resonant voltage for which there is a lot of current that favors a particular voltage, achieved by placing two very thin layers with a high energy conductance band very near each other. This creates a quantum [[potential well]] that has a discrete lowest [[energy level]]. When this energy level is higher than that of the electrons, no tunnelling will occur, and the diode is in reverse bias. Once the two voltage energies align, the electrons flow like an open wire. As the voltage is increased further tunnelling becomes improbable and the diode acts like a normal diode again before a second energy level becomes noticeable.<ref name=\"Knight\">{{cite book |first=R.

By using [[Piezoelectric sensor|piezoelectric rods]] that change in size when voltage is applied over them the height of the tip can be adjusted to keep the tunnelling current constant.

This is generally attributed to differences in the zero-point vibrational energies for chemical bonds containing the lighter and heavier isotopes and is generally modeled using [[transition state theory]].  However, in certain cases, very large isotope effects are observed that cannot be accounted for by a semi-classical treatment of kinetic isotope effects, and quantum tunneling through the energy barrier is invoked.

When M(x) is constant and negative, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) = -k^2 \\Psi(x),\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\mathrm{where} \\;\\;\\; k^2=- \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M. </math>\n\nThe solutions of this equation represent travelling waves, with phase-constant +''k'' or -''k''.\nAlternatively, if M(x) is constant and positive, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) = {\\kappa}^2 \\Psi(x), \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\mathrm{where} \\;\\;\\; {\\kappa}^2= \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M. </math>\n\nThe solutions of this equation are rising and falling exponentials in the form of [[evanescent wave]]s.\nWhen M(x) varies with position, the same difference in behaviour occurs, depending on whether M(x) is negative or positive. It follows that the sign of M(x) determines the nature of the medium, with negative M(x) corresponding to medium A as described above and positive M(x) corresponding to medium B. It thus follows that evanescent wave coupling can occur if a region of positive M(x) is sandwiched between two regions of negative M(x), hence creating a potential barrier.\n\nThe mathematics of dealing with the situation where M(x) varies with x is difficult, except in special cases that usually do not correspond to physical reality. A discussion of the semi-classical approximate method, as found in physics textbooks, is given in the next section. A full and complicated mathematical treatment appears in the 1965 monograph by Fr\u00f6man and Fr\u00f6man noted below. Their ideas have not been incorporated into physics textbooks, but their corrections have little quantitative effect.\n\n=== The WKB approximation ===\n{{Main|WKB approximation}}\nThe wave function is expressed as the exponential of a function:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(x) = e^{\\Phi(x)}</math>, where <math>\\Phi''(x) + \\Phi'(x)^2 = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right).</math>\n\n<math>\\Phi'(x)</math> is then separated into real and imaginary parts:\n\n:<math>\\Phi'(x) = A(x) + i B(x)</math>, where A(x) and B(x) are real-valued functions.\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first and using the fact that the imaginary part needs to be 0 results in:\n\n:<math>A'(x) + A(x)^2 - B(x)^2 = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)</math>.\n\nTo solve this equation using the semiclassical approximation, each function must be expanded as a [[power series]] in <math>\\hbar</math>. From the equations, the power series must start with at least an order of <math>\\hbar^{-1}</math> to satisfy the real part of the equation; for a good classical limit starting with the highest power of [[Planck's constant]] possible is preferable, which leads to\n\n:<math>A(x) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\hbar^k A_k(x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>B(x) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\hbar^k B_k(x)</math>,\n\nwith the following constraints on the lowest order terms,\n\n:<math>A_0(x)^2 - B_0(x)^2 = 2m \\left( V(x) - E \\right)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>A_0(x) B_0(x) = 0</math>.\n\nAt this point two extreme cases can be considered.\n\n'''Case 1'''\nIf the amplitude varies slowly as compared to the phase <math>A_0(x) = 0</math> and\n\n::<math>B_0(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{ 2m \\left( E - V(x) \\right) }</math>\n\n:which corresponds to classical motion. Resolving the next order of expansion yields\n\n::<math>\\Psi(x) \\approx C \\frac{ e^{i \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( E - V(x) \\right)} + \\theta} }{\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( E - V(x) \\right)}}</math>\n\n'''Case 2'''\n:If the phase varies slowly as compared to the amplitude, <math>B_0(x) = 0</math> and\n\n::<math>A_0(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{ 2m \\left( V(x) - E \\right) }</math>\n\n:which corresponds to tunnelling. Resolving the next order of the expansion yields\n\n::<math>\\Psi(x) \\approx \\frac{ C_{+} e^{+\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}} + C_{-} e^{-\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}}}{\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}}</math>\n\nIn both cases it is apparent from the denominator that both these approximate solutions are bad near the classical turning points <math>E = V(x)</math>. Away from the potential hill, the particle acts similar to a free and oscillating wave; beneath the potential hill, the particle undergoes exponential changes in amplitude. By considering the behaviour at these limits and classical turning points a global solution can be made.\n\nTo start, choose a classical turning point, <math>x_1</math> and expand <math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right)</math> in a power series about <math>x_1</math>:\n\n:<math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right) = v_1 (x - x_1) + v_2 (x - x_1)^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nKeeping only the first order term ensures linearity:\n\n:<math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right) = v_1 (x - x_1)</math>.\n\nUsing this approximation, the equation near <math>x_1</math> becomes a [[differential equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = v_1 (x - x_1) \\Psi(x)</math>.\n\nThis can be solved using [[Airy function]]s as solutions.\n\n:<math>\\Psi(x) = C_A Ai\\left( \\sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \\right) + C_B Bi\\left( \\sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \\right)</math>\n\nTaking these solutions for all classical turning points, a global solution can be formed that links the limiting solutions. Given the two coefficients on one side of a classical turning point, the two coefficients on the other side of a classical turning point can be determined by using this local solution to connect them.\n\nHence, the Airy function solutions will asymptote into sine, cosine and exponential functions in the proper limits. The relationships between <math>C,\\theta</math> and <math>C_{+},C_{-}</math> are\n\n:<math>C_{+} = \\frac{1}{2} C \\cos{\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}</math>\nand\n:<math>C_{-} = - C \\sin{\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}</math>\n\nWith the coefficients found, the global solution can be found. Therefore, the [[transmission coefficient (physics)|transmission coefficient]] for a particle tunnelling through a single potential barrier is\n\n:<math>T(E) = e^{-2\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\mathrm{d}x \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left[ V(x) - E \\right]}}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>x_1,x_2</math> are the two classical turning points for the potential barrier.\n\nFor a rectangular barrier, this expression is simplified to:\n:<math>T(E) = e^{-2\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(V_0-E)}(x_2-x_1)} = \\tilde V_0^{-(x_2-x_1)}</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dielectric barrier discharge]]\n* [[Field electron emission]]\n* [[Holstein\u2013Herring method]]\n* [[Proton tunneling]]\n* [[Superconducting tunnel junction]]\n* [[Tunnel diode]]\n* [[Tunnel junction]]\n* [[Quantum cloning]]\n* [[White hole]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book| author=N.

[[J. J. Thomson]] commented that the finding warranted further investigation. In 1911 and then 1914, then-graduate student Franz Rother, employing Earhart's method for controlling and measuring the electrode separation but with a sensitive platform [[galvanometer]], directly measured steady field emission currents.  In 1926, Rother, using a still newer platform galvanometer of sensitivity 26 pA, measured the [[field emission current]]s in a \"hard\" vacuum between closely spaced electrodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294260678|title=The STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope) [The forgotten contribution of Robert Francis Earhart to the discovery of quantum tunneling.]|author=Thomas Cuff|website=ResearchGate}}</ref>\n\nQuantum tunneling was first noticed in 1927 by [[Friedrich Hund]] when he was calculating the ground state of the [[double-well potential]]<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> and independently in the same year by [[Leonid Mandelstam]] and [[Mikhail Leontovich]] in their analysis of the implications of the then new [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]] for the motion of a particle in a confining potential of a limited spatial extent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Mandelstam |first2=M. |last2=Leontowitsch |title=Zur Theorie der Schr\u00f6dingerschen Gleichung |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik |volume=47 |issue= 1\u20132|pages=131\u2013136 |year=1928 |bibcode = 1928ZPhy...47..131M |doi = 10.1007/BF01391061 }}</ref> Its first application was a mathematical explanation for [[alpha decay]], which was done in 1928 by [[George Gamow]] (who was aware of the findings of Mandelstam and Leontovich<ref>{{cite journal |first=E.

This process cannot be directly perceived, but much of its understanding is shaped by the microscopic world, which [[classical mechanics]] cannot adequately explain. To understand the [[phenomenon]], particles attempting to travel between [[potential barrier]]s can be compared to a ball trying to roll over a hill; [[quantum mechanics]] and [[classical mechanics]] differ in their treatment of this scenario. Classical mechanics predicts that particles that do not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier will not be able to reach the other side. Thus, a ball without sufficient energy to surmount the hill would roll back down. Or, lacking the energy to penetrate a wall, it would bounce back (reflection) or in the extreme case, bury itself inside the wall (absorption). In quantum mechanics, these particles can, with a very small probability, ''tunnel'' to the other side, thus crossing the barrier. Here, the \"ball\" could, in a sense, ''borrow'' energy from its surroundings to tunnel through the wall or \"roll over the hill\", paying it back by making the reflected electrons more energetic than they otherwise would have been.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1119/1.1810153| url=http://www.quantum3000.narod.ru/papers/edu/quantum_tunelling.pdf| title=Quantum tunneling time| journal=American Journal of Physics| volume=73| issue=1| pages=23\u201327| year=2005| last1=Davies| first1=P.

One interpretation of this duality involves the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which defines a limit on how precisely the position and the [[momentum]] of a particle can be known at the same time.<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> This implies that there are no solutions with a probability of exactly zero (or one), though a solution may approach infinity if, for example, the calculation for its position was taken as a probability of 1, the other, i.e. its speed, would have to be infinity. Hence, the probability of a given particle's existence on the opposite side of an intervening barrier is non-zero, and such particles will appear on the 'other' (a semantically difficult word in this instance) side with a relative frequency proportional to this probability.\n\n[[File:EffetTunnel.gif|250px|right|thumb|An electron [[wavepacket]] directed at a potential barrier.

Mcgraw-Hill College, 1965.</ref> Therefore, problems in quantum mechanics center on the analysis of the wave function for a system. Using mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, such as the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], the wave function can be solved. The absolute value of this wavefunction to the power of 2 is directly related to the probability density of the particle's position, which describes the probability that the particle is at any given place. In the limit of large barriers, the probability of tunneling decreases for taller and wider barriers.\n\nFor simple tunneling-barrier models, such as the [[rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]], an analytic formulation and thus solution exists. In canonical field theory, the tunneling is described by a wave function which has an amplitude inside the tunnel; but the current is zero there because the relative phase of the amplitude of the conjugate wave function (the time derivative) is orthogonal to it.\n\nAnother way to look at is: The waves were always on BOTH side of the barrier, but on the right the waves were jiggling in opposite directions.  Suppose in the moving illustration on the right, there were another barrier further right and another wave coming FROM the right.  The waves in the middle might be stationary if the waves strike the middle at the same time or sometimes jiggling right and sometimes jiggling left depending on which incoming wave gets there most recently.  It would be like the proverbial steel balls on a string pendulum  for which the middle balls are stationary and the end balls take turns having the \"wave\" bouncing away from the \"barrier\" of the balls in the middle.  In like manner, for a right moving wave, the barrier approximately doubles the amount of the left moving wave in order to keep the wave almost zero on the right side of the barrier.\n\nIn the 2nd moving illustration at right, you can more easily see the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) at work.  A relatively narrow wave impinges on the barrier; the barrier forces it to become even taller and even narrower.  The result is: the wave becomes much more de-localized--in fact it's now on both sides of the barrier, it's wider on each side and lower in maximum amplitude but equal in total amplitude.  In both illustrations, the localization of the wave in space causes the localization of the action of the barrier in time, thus scattering the energy/momentum of the wave.\n\nProblems in real life often do not have one, so \"semiclassical\" or \"quasiclassical\" methods have been developed to give approximate solutions to these problems, like the [[WKB approximation]].

Evanescent wave coupling, until recently, was only called \"tunnelling\" in quantum mechanics; now it is used in other contexts.\n\nThese effects are modelled similarly to the [[rectangular potential barrier]]. In these cases, there is one [[transmission medium]] through which the [[wave propagation|wave propagates]] that is the same or nearly the same throughout, and a second medium through which the wave travels differently. This can be described as a thin region of medium B between two regions of medium A. The analysis of a [[Rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]] by means of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be adapted to these other effects provided that the wave equation has [[travelling wave]] solutions in medium A but real [[exponential function|exponential]] solutions in medium B.\n\nIn [[optics]], medium A is a vacuum while medium B is glass. In acoustics, medium A may be a liquid or gas and medium B a solid. For both cases, medium A is a region of space where the particle's [[total energy]] is greater than its [[potential energy]] and medium B is the potential barrier. These have an incoming wave and resultant waves in both directions. There can be more mediums and barriers, and the barriers need not be discrete; approximations are useful in this case.\n\n== Applications ==\nTunnelling occurs with barriers of thickness around 1\u20133&nbsp;nm and smaller,<ref>{{cite book |last=Lerner |last2=Trigg |title=Encyclopedia of Physics |edition=2nd |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 1308] |publisher=VCH |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-89573-752-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 }}</ref> but is the cause of some important macroscopic physical phenomena.

The temperature in stars' cores is generally insufficient to allow atomic nuclei to overcome the [[Coulomb barrier]] and achieve [[Thermonuclear fusion]]. Quantum tunneling increases the probability of penetrating this barrier. Though this probability is still low, the extremely large number of nuclei in the core of a star is sufficient to sustain a steady fusion reaction for millions, billions, or even trillions of years \u2013 a precondition for the evolution of life in insolation habitable zones.<ref name=\"Trixler2013\">{{cite journal|last=Trixler|first=F|title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life|journal=Current Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=17|number=16|pages=1758\u20131770|doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083|pmid=24039543|pmc=3768233}}</ref>\n\n=== Radioactive decay ===\n{{Main|Radioactive decay}}\nRadioactive decay is the process of emission of particles and energy from the unstable nucleus of an atom to form a stable product. This is done via the tunnelling of a particle out of the nucleus (an electron tunnelling into the nucleus is [[electron capture]]). This was the first application of quantum tunnelling and led to the first approximations. Radioactive decay is also a relevant issue for [[astrobiology]] as this consequence of quantum tunnelling is creating a constant source of energy over a large period of time for environments outside the [[circumstellar habitable zone]] where insolation would not be possible ([[Ocean#Extraterrestrial oceans|subsurface oceans]]) or effective.<ref name=\"Trixler2013\" />\n\n=== Astrochemistry in interstellar clouds ===\nBy including quantum tunnelling, the [[Astrochemistry|astrochemical]] syntheses of various molecules in [[interstellar cloud]]s can be explained such as the synthesis of [[Hydrogen#Elemental molecular forms|molecular hydrogen]], [[water]] ([[ice]]) and the [[Abiogenesis|prebiotic]] important [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=\"Trixler2013\" />\n\n=== Quantum biology ===\nQuantum tunnelling is among the central non trivial quantum effects in [[quantum biology]].

A hydrogen bond joins normal base pairs of DNA.  There exists a double well potential along a hydrogen bond separated by a potential energy barrier. It is believed that the double well potential is asymmetric with one well deeper than the other so the proton normally rests in the deeper well.  For a mutation to occur, the proton must have tunnelled into the shallower of the two potential wells. The movement of the proton from its regular position is called a [[Tautomer|tautomeric transition]].

It is similar to [[thermionic emission]], where electrons randomly jump from the surface of a metal to follow a voltage bias because they statistically end up with more energy than the barrier, through random collisions with other particles. When the electric field is very large, the barrier becomes thin enough for electrons to tunnel out of the atomic state, leading to a current that varies approximately exponentially with the electric field.<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=J. |title=Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers |page=479 |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-13-805715-2 }}</ref> These materials are important for [[flash memory]], vacuum tubes, as well as some electron microscopes.\n\n=== Tunnel junction ===\n{{Main|Tunnel junction}}\nA simple barrier can be created by separating two conductors with a very thin [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]].

The device depends on a [[depletion layer]] between [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] and [[P-type semiconductor]]s to serve its purpose; when these are very heavily doped the depletion layer can be thin enough for tunnelling. Then, when a small forward bias is applied, the current due to tunnelling is significant. This has a maximum at the point where the [[voltage bias]] is such that the energy level of the p and n [[conduction band]]s are the same. As the voltage bias is increased, the two conduction bands no longer line up and the diode acts typically.<ref name=\"Krane\">{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Krane |title=Modern Physics |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 423] |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-471-07963-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the tunnelling current drops off rapidly, tunnel diodes can be created that have a range of voltages for which current decreases as voltage is increased. This peculiar property is used in some applications, like high speed devices where the characteristic tunnelling probability changes as rapidly as the bias voltage.<ref name=\"Krane\" />\n\nThe [[resonant tunnelling diode]] makes use of quantum tunnelling in a very different manner to achieve a similar result. This diode has a resonant voltage for which there is a lot of current that favors a particular voltage, achieved by placing two very thin layers with a high energy conductance band very near each other. This creates a quantum [[potential well]] that has a discrete lowest [[energy level]]. When this energy level is higher than that of the electrons, no tunnelling will occur, and the diode is in reverse bias. Once the two voltage energies align, the electrons flow like an open wire. As the voltage is increased further tunnelling becomes improbable and the diode acts like a normal diode again before a second energy level becomes noticeable.<ref name=\"Knight\">{{cite book |first=R.

When the tip of the STM's needle is brought very close to a conduction surface that has a voltage bias, by measuring the current of electrons that are tunnelling between the needle and the surface, the distance between the needle and the surface can be measured. By using [[Piezoelectric sensor|piezoelectric rods]] that change in size when voltage is applied over them the height of the tip can be adjusted to keep the tunnelling current constant. The time-varying voltages that are applied to these rods can be recorded and used to image the surface of the conductor.<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> STMs are accurate to 0.001&nbsp;nm, or about 1% of atomic diameter.<ref name=\"Knight\" />\n\n=== Kinetic isotope effect ===\n{{Main|Kinetic isotope effect}}In chemical kinetics, the substitution of a light isotope of an element with a heavier one typically results in a slower reaction rate.  This is generally attributed to differences in the zero-point vibrational energies for chemical bonds containing the lighter and heavier isotopes and is generally modeled using [[transition state theory]].  However, in certain cases, very large isotope effects are observed that cannot be accounted for by a semi-classical treatment of kinetic isotope effects, and quantum tunneling through the energy barrier is invoked.  [[Ronnie Bell|R. P. Bell]] has developed a modified treatment of Arrhenius kinetics that is commonly used to model this phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The tunnel effect in chemistry|last=Percy)|first=Bell, R. P.

Winful argues that the wavepacket of a tunnelling particle propagates locally, so a particle can't tunnel through the barrier non-locally. Winful also argues that the experiments that are purported to show non-local propagation have been misinterpreted. In particular, the group velocity of a wavepacket does not measure its speed, but is related to the amount of time the wavepacket is stored in the barrier.\n\n== Mathematical discussions of quantum tunnelling ==\nThe following subsections discuss the mathematical formulations of quantum tunnelling.\n\n=== The Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Time independent equation 2|time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for one particle in one [[dimension]] can be written as\n\n:<math>-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) + V(x) \\Psi(x) = E \\Psi(x)</math> or\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right) \\Psi(x) \\equiv \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hbar </math> is the reduced [[Planck's constant]], m is the particle mass, x represents distance measured in the direction of motion of the particle, \u03a8 is the Schr\u00f6dinger wave function, V is the [[potential energy]] of the particle (measured relative to any convenient reference level), ''E'' is the energy of the particle that is associated with motion in the x-axis (measured relative to V), and M(x) is a quantity defined by V(x) \u2013 E which has no accepted name in physics.\n\nThe solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation take different forms for different values of x, depending on whether M(x) is positive or negative. When M(x) is constant and negative, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) = -k^2 \\Psi(x),\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\mathrm{where} \\;\\;\\; k^2=- \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M. </math>\n\nThe solutions of this equation represent travelling waves, with phase-constant +''k'' or -''k''.\nAlternatively, if M(x) is constant and positive, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) = {\\kappa}^2 \\Psi(x), \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\mathrm{where} \\;\\;\\; {\\kappa}^2= \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M. </math>\n\nThe solutions of this equation are rising and falling exponentials in the form of [[evanescent wave]]s.\nWhen M(x) varies with position, the same difference in behaviour occurs, depending on whether M(x) is negative or positive. It follows that the sign of M(x) determines the nature of the medium, with negative M(x) corresponding to medium A as described above and positive M(x) corresponding to medium B. It thus follows that evanescent wave coupling can occur if a region of positive M(x) is sandwiched between two regions of negative M(x), hence creating a potential barrier.\n\nThe mathematics of dealing with the situation where M(x) varies with x is difficult, except in special cases that usually do not correspond to physical reality. A discussion of the semi-classical approximate method, as found in physics textbooks, is given in the next section. A full and complicated mathematical treatment appears in the 1965 monograph by Fr\u00f6man and Fr\u00f6man noted below. Their ideas have not been incorporated into physics textbooks, but their corrections have little quantitative effect.\n\n=== The WKB approximation ===\n{{Main|WKB approximation}}\nThe wave function is expressed as the exponential of a function:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(x) = e^{\\Phi(x)}</math>, where <math>\\Phi''(x) + \\Phi'(x)^2 = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right).</math>\n\n<math>\\Phi'(x)</math> is then separated into real and imaginary parts:\n\n:<math>\\Phi'(x) = A(x) + i B(x)</math>, where A(x) and B(x) are real-valued functions.\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first and using the fact that the imaginary part needs to be 0 results in:\n\n:<math>A'(x) + A(x)^2 - B(x)^2 = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)</math>.\n\nTo solve this equation using the semiclassical approximation, each function must be expanded as a [[power series]] in <math>\\hbar</math>. From the equations, the power series must start with at least an order of <math>\\hbar^{-1}</math> to satisfy the real part of the equation; for a good classical limit starting with the highest power of [[Planck's constant]] possible is preferable, which leads to\n\n:<math>A(x) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\hbar^k A_k(x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>B(x) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\hbar^k B_k(x)</math>,\n\nwith the following constraints on the lowest order terms,\n\n:<math>A_0(x)^2 - B_0(x)^2 = 2m \\left( V(x) - E \\right)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>A_0(x) B_0(x) = 0</math>.\n\nAt this point two extreme cases can be considered.\n\n'''Case 1'''\nIf the amplitude varies slowly as compared to the phase <math>A_0(x) = 0</math> and\n\n::<math>B_0(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{ 2m \\left( E - V(x) \\right) }</math>\n\n:which corresponds to classical motion. Resolving the next order of expansion yields\n\n::<math>\\Psi(x) \\approx C \\frac{ e^{i \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( E - V(x) \\right)} + \\theta} }{\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( E - V(x) \\right)}}</math>\n\n'''Case 2'''\n:If the phase varies slowly as compared to the amplitude, <math>B_0(x) = 0</math> and\n\n::<math>A_0(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{ 2m \\left( V(x) - E \\right) }</math>\n\n:which corresponds to tunnelling. Resolving the next order of the expansion yields\n\n::<math>\\Psi(x) \\approx \\frac{ C_{+} e^{+\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}} + C_{-} e^{-\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}}}{\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}}</math>\n\nIn both cases it is apparent from the denominator that both these approximate solutions are bad near the classical turning points <math>E = V(x)</math>. Away from the potential hill, the particle acts similar to a free and oscillating wave; beneath the potential hill, the particle undergoes exponential changes in amplitude. By considering the behaviour at these limits and classical turning points a global solution can be made.\n\nTo start, choose a classical turning point, <math>x_1</math> and expand <math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right)</math> in a power series about <math>x_1</math>:\n\n:<math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right) = v_1 (x - x_1) + v_2 (x - x_1)^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nKeeping only the first order term ensures linearity:\n\n:<math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right) = v_1 (x - x_1)</math>.\n\nUsing this approximation, the equation near <math>x_1</math> becomes a [[differential equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = v_1 (x - x_1) \\Psi(x)</math>.\n\nThis can be solved using [[Airy function]]s as solutions.\n\n:<math>\\Psi(x) = C_A Ai\\left( \\sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \\right) + C_B Bi\\left( \\sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \\right)</math>\n\nTaking these solutions for all classical turning points, a global solution can be formed that links the limiting solutions. Given the two coefficients on one side of a classical turning point, the two coefficients on the other side of a classical turning point can be determined by using this local solution to connect them.\n\nHence, the Airy function solutions will asymptote into sine, cosine and exponential functions in the proper limits. The relationships between <math>C,\\theta</math> and <math>C_{+},C_{-}</math> are\n\n:<math>C_{+} = \\frac{1}{2} C \\cos{\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}</math>\nand\n:<math>C_{-} = - C \\sin{\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}</math>\n\nWith the coefficients found, the global solution can be found. Therefore, the [[transmission coefficient (physics)|transmission coefficient]] for a particle tunnelling through a single potential barrier is\n\n:<math>T(E) = e^{-2\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\mathrm{d}x \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left[ V(x) - E \\right]}}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>x_1,x_2</math> are the two classical turning points for the potential barrier.\n\nFor a rectangular barrier, this expression is simplified to:\n:<math>T(E) = e^{-2\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(V_0-E)}(x_2-x_1)} = \\tilde V_0^{-(x_2-x_1)}</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dielectric barrier discharge]]\n* [[Field electron emission]]\n* [[Holstein\u2013Herring method]]\n* [[Proton tunneling]]\n* [[Superconducting tunnel junction]]\n* [[Tunnel diode]]\n* [[Tunnel junction]]\n* [[Quantum cloning]]\n* [[White hole]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book| author=N.
