The conspirators intended to declare total independence of Catalonia as a state neutral in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and to marginalize all non-aligned political groupings, especially the [[Anarchism in Spain|Anarchists]]. They counted on party militias and Catalan army and security units, infiltrated by the Estat Catal\u00e0 militants. The coup was planned in November, as the plotters assumed that the central [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government, absorbed by the [[battle of Madrid]], would not be able to take action. The plot failed because of the Anarchist counter-action, who exposed the scheme and some of its leaders. In pre-emptive strike [[Generalitat]] services detained a few of the conspirators; the others fled to [[Third French Republic|France]]. Estat Catal\u00e0 was sidelined, while [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]-[[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|FAI]] ensured its dominant position in Catalonia. The attempted coup remains a poorly researched and rather unknown episode; in [[historiography]] it is discussed against the background of Catalan [[fascism]].\n==Background==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11543, Madrid, Ausrufung der Zweiten Spanischen Republik.jpg|thumb|left|[[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] declared, Barcelona 1931]]\nSince the late 19th century along traditional political groupings \u2013 [[Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservatives]], [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberals]], [[Carlists]], [[Republicanism in Spain|Republicans]] \u2013 there were new currents emerging in Catalonia: [[PSOE|Socialists]], [[Communist Party of Spain|Communists]], Anarchists and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan Nationalists]]. The last two of these were getting increasingly popular. Their social basis partially overlapped, though the Anarchists catered mostly to urban [[proletariat]], while the Catalanists gained dynamics among the mid-lower strata. While competing in terms of popular mobilization, they nevertheless pursued the same anti-system and left-wing course.<ref> detailed analysis of social radicalization in Catalonia in Stanley G. Payne, ''The Spanish Revolution'', Madison 1970, ISBN 97803930988853, see esp. the chapter ''The Social Struggle in Barcelon''a, pp. 37-61</ref> Following the fall of the monarchy in 1931 various currents of Catalanism converged in [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]] (ERC), the centre-left federative party structure which dominated the [[Parliament of Catalonia|autonomous Catalan parliament]]. The Anarchists, who by default boycotted any electoral action, focused rather on expansion of their nationwide trade union, Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Trabajo (CNT). Their structures actively engaged against the state and in late 1933 managed to mount insurgent action which [[:es:Insurrecci\u00f3n anarquista de diciembre de 1933|rocked most of Catalonia]].<ref>discussion of the Anarchists and their position versus other left-wing groupings in Payne 1970, pp. 112-130</ref>\n\nIn October 1934 parts of Northern Spain were engulfed by [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|revolutionary turmoil]]; the Catalanists took advantage of the chaos and [[Events of 6 October|declared the independence of Catalonia]]. The Anarchists did nothing to support their cause; instead, their labored to introduce own [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] communes. The ERC-controlled autonomous government Generalitat cracked down on anarchist structures;<ref>some scholars believe that in October 1934 the Generalitat president, representative of mainstream ERC Lluis Companys was manipulated by radical nationalists of Estat Catal\u00e0, chiefly by Josep Denc\u00e0s and Miquel Badia, see Abel Paz, ''Durruti in the Spanish Revolution'', Edinburgh 2007, ISBN 9781904859505, p. 339</ref> following outbursts of violence mutual aversion between the two was already bordering hostility.<ref> Payne 1970, pp. 150-152</ref> During the [[Spanish general election, 1936|general elections of February 1936]] the Anarchists hesitantly decided to support the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] alliance, which included ERC, but soon truce gave way to tension. In April the Anarchist hit-squad murdered [[Miquel Badia]], who in 1934 engineered and executed the repressive anti-CNT campaign. The Catalanists themselves got increasingly divided over policy towards the central government and the radical Left. Many lambasted Generalitat for appeasement and demanded a more decisive stand. In May 1936 Estat Catal\u00e0 (EC), a group which so far formed part of ERC, left the federation.<ref>Antonio Gasc\u00f3n Ricao, ''El complot de Estat Catal\u00e0 contra Companys'', [in:] Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, Arnau Gonz\u00e1lez i Vilalta (ed.), ''Contra Companys, 1936.

Since the early 1930s EC was getting increasingly radical and adopted a militant stand; its uniformed paramilitary [[militia]], the [[:ca:Escamots d'Estat Catal\u00e0|Escamots]], were outlawed following a series of violent episodes. In the mid-1930s EC entered ERC and formed its radical, left wing. Having left Esquerra in May 1936 the party regained its fully independent status and became the key vehicle of revolutionary Catalan nationalism.<ref> Daniel D\u00edaz Esculies, ''Estat Catal\u00e0 contra Companys'', [in:] Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, Arnau Gonz\u00e1lez i Vilalta (ed.), ''Contra Companys, 1936. La frustraci\u00f3n nacionalista ante la revoluci\u00f3n'', Valencia 2012, ISBN 9788437089157, pp. 77-79</ref> It was soon merged with two other, smaller and equally radical parties of Catalanist left: [[Nosaltres Sols!]]<ref> Gasc\u00f3n Ricao 2012, pp. 92-93</ref> and [[Catalan Nationalist Party|Partit Nacionalista Catal\u00e0]].<ref> Gasc\u00f3n Ricao 2012, p. 94</ref> The command layer of the united organization was formed by the EC leader [[:ca:Josep Denc\u00e0s i Puigdollers|Josep Dencas]], the former NS! chief, an ideologue Manuel Blasi, and the former president of PNC [[:ca:Josep Maria Xammar i Sala|Josep Maria Xammar]]. The integration process was still ongoing when in July 1936 Spain was rocked by the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|military coup d\u2019etat]].<ref>in the early summer of 1936 Estat Catal\u00e0 numbered some 6,000 members, Gasc\u00f3n Ricao 2012, p. 92</ref>\n\nMany EC members actively resisted the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|military rebels]]; during the fightings they seized large quantities of arms. In the already revolutionary ambience the party moved to new headquarters in the Oro de Rhin restaurant by the [[Gran Via (Barcelona)|Gran V\u00eda]], launched a new daily bulletin ''Diari de Barcelona'' and commenced massive recruitment to its militia ranks.<ref> some of the already formed EC militia units were dispatched to fight the Nationalists, either on the Aragon front or taking part in invasion of the Balearic Islands, Gasc\u00f3n Ricao 2012, p. 94</ref> Representatives of EC joined numerous inter-party bodies competing for power, especially [[:es:Comit\u00e8 Central de Mil\u00edcies Antifeixistes de Catalunya|Comit\u00e8 de Mil\u00edcies Antifeixistes]]; however, the party did not enter the coalition Generalitat government.<ref> Gasc\u00f3n Ricao 2012, pp. 94-95</ref> Relations with the Anarchists, who in aftermath of the failed military coup emerged as the dominant political grouping in Catalonia, remained tense. In August the CNT commando tried to plunder the main EC office and their representatives in the government demanded that Dencas, along the murdered Badia blamed for anti-Anarchist violence of 1934, be detained. By September he fled the country, fearing for his life.<ref>when it turned out that when on exile, Dencas settled in Fascist Italy, EC expulsed him from the party ranks</ref> The party jefatura was assumed by its former secretary, [[:ca:Joan Torres i Picart|Joan Torres-Picart]].<ref> Torres-Picart was acceptable to all 3 factions forming the party: the historical Estat Catal\u00e1, Nosaltres Sols! and PNC, Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, ''La ley de silencio: el \u201ecomplot nacionalista\u201d contra Companys, noviembre-diciembre de 1936'', [in:] Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, Arnau Gonz\u00e1lez i Vilalta (ed.), ''Contra Companys, 1936.

Their key asset were armed units controlled by the party, including the militia, the forces of Columna Volant and the MP battalions; some were supposed to enter into action in Barcelona, and some were expected to seize power in other cities and towns of the region.<ref> Gasc\u00f3n Ricao 2012, p. 97</ref> The conspiracy network was being developed within local administrative or revolutionary institutions.<ref> Gasc\u00f3n Ricao 2012, p. 97</ref> Xammar negotiated with acquiescent officials in various committees in Northern Catalonia about a would-be joint action against the Anarchists.<ref> Gasc\u00f3n Ricao 2012, pp. 96-97</ref> The conspirators assumed that the Generalitat security would at least remain passive; since early October the Commissar of Public Order, the de facto police chief in Catalonia,<ref> Francisco J.

During numerous rallies Borrell, Cornudella, Xammar, and Torres-Picart vehemently criticised irresolute Generalitat policy. To much surprise, one of their meetings hosted Casanovas; in belligerent tone he declared that the time for bold action was near and spoke with contempt about the Catalan parliament, the body he still presided.

Also after the war the EC conspiracy was largely ignored by all parties. From the Francoist perspective it was somewhat inconvenient as incompatible with vision of a homogenous, criminal red horde. None one of the post-Republican \u00e9migr\u00e9 groupings saw sufficient propaganda potential of the episode. For historians it remained a rather difficult chapter of Spanish past. The Generalitat archives documented the repressive action rather than the plot itself; most EC papers have gone missing, while memoirs and other accounts provided by the protagonists were trapped in conflicting versions, inconsistencies, and political bias.<ref> Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, Arnau Gonz\u00e1lez i Vilalta (ed.), ''Contra Companys, 1936.

The conspirators intended to declare total independence of Catalonia as a state neutral in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and to marginalize all non-aligned political groupings, especially the [[Anarchism in Spain|Anarchists]]. They counted on party militias and Catalan army and security units, infiltrated by the Estat Catal\u00e0 militants. The coup was planned in November, as the plotters assumed that the central [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government, absorbed by the [[battle of Madrid]], would not be able to take action. The plot failed because of the Anarchist counter-action, who exposed the scheme and some of its leaders. In pre-emptive strike [[Generalitat]] services detained a few of the conspirators; the others fled to [[Third French Republic|France]]. Estat Catal\u00e0 was sidelined, while [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]-[[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|FAI]] ensured its dominant position in Catalonia. The attempted coup remains a poorly researched and rather unknown episode; in [[historiography]] it is discussed against the background of Catalan [[fascism]].\n==Background==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11543, Madrid, Ausrufung der Zweiten Spanischen Republik.jpg|thumb|left|[[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] declared, Barcelona 1931]]\nSince the late 19th century along traditional political groupings \u2013 [[Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservatives]], [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberals]], [[Carlists]], [[Republicanism in Spain|Republicans]] \u2013 there were new currents emerging in Catalonia: [[PSOE|Socialists]], [[Communist Party of Spain|Communists]], Anarchists and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan Nationalists]]. The last two of these were getting increasingly popular. Their social basis partially overlapped, though the Anarchists catered mostly to urban [[proletariat]], while the Catalanists gained dynamics among the mid-lower strata. While competing in terms of popular mobilization, they nevertheless pursued the same anti-system and left-wing course.<ref> detailed analysis of social radicalization in Catalonia in Stanley G. Payne, ''The Spanish Revolution'', Madison 1970, ISBN 97803930988853, see esp. the chapter ''The Social Struggle in Barcelon''a, pp. 37-61</ref> Following the fall of the monarchy in 1931 various currents of Catalanism converged in [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]] (ERC), the centre-left federative party structure which dominated the [[Parliament of Catalonia|autonomous Catalan parliament]]. The Anarchists, who by default boycotted any electoral action, focused rather on expansion of their nationwide trade union, Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Trabajo (CNT). Their structures actively engaged against the state and in late 1933 managed to mount insurgent action which [[:es:Insurrecci\u00f3n anarquista de diciembre de 1933|rocked most of Catalonia]].<ref>discussion of the Anarchists and their position versus other left-wing groupings in Payne 1970, pp. 112-130</ref>\n\nIn October 1934 parts of Northern Spain were engulfed by [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|revolutionary turmoil]]; the Catalanists took advantage of the chaos and [[Events of 6 October|declared the independence of Catalonia]]. The Anarchists did nothing to support their cause; instead, their labored to introduce own [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] communes. The ERC-controlled autonomous government Generalitat cracked down on anarchist structures;<ref>some scholars believe that in October 1934 the Generalitat president, representative of mainstream ERC Lluis Companys was manipulated by radical nationalists of Estat Catal\u00e0, chiefly by Josep Denc\u00e0s and Miquel Badia, see Abel Paz, ''Durruti in the Spanish Revolution'', Edinburgh 2007, ISBN 9781904859505, p. 339</ref> following outbursts of violence mutual aversion between the two was already bordering hostility.<ref> Payne 1970, pp. 150-152</ref> During the [[Spanish general election, 1936|general elections of February 1936]] the Anarchists hesitantly decided to support the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] alliance, which included ERC, but soon truce gave way to tension. In April the Anarchist hit-squad murdered [[Miquel Badia]], who in 1934 engineered and executed the repressive anti-CNT campaign. The Catalanists themselves got increasingly divided over policy towards the central government and the radical Left. Many lambasted Generalitat for appeasement and demanded a more decisive stand. In May 1936 Estat Catal\u00e0 (EC), a group which so far formed part of ERC, left the federation.<ref>Antonio Gasc\u00f3n Ricao, ''El complot de Estat Catal\u00e0 contra Companys'', [in:] Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, Arnau Gonz\u00e1lez i Vilalta (ed.), ''Contra Companys, 1936.

Since the early 1930s EC was getting increasingly radical and adopted a militant stand; its uniformed paramilitary [[militia]], the [[:ca:Escamots d'Estat Catal\u00e0|Escamots]], were outlawed following a series of violent episodes. In the mid-1930s EC entered ERC and formed its radical, left wing. Having left Esquerra in May 1936 the party regained its fully independent status and became the key vehicle of revolutionary Catalan nationalism.<ref> Daniel D\u00edaz Esculies, ''Estat Catal\u00e0 contra Companys'', [in:] Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, Arnau Gonz\u00e1lez i Vilalta (ed.), ''Contra Companys, 1936.

Tarradellas lived in France and America and was a longtime president of the Geerralitat of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Catalan government; having returned to Spain in 1977 he was one of the best-known Catalan politicians until his death in 1988.

Also after the war the EC conspiracy was largely ignored by all parties. From the Francoist perspective it was somewhat inconvenient as incompatible with vision of a homogenous, criminal red horde. None one of the post-Republican \u00e9migr\u00e9 groupings saw sufficient propaganda potential of the episode. For historians it remained a rather difficult chapter of Spanish past. The Generalitat archives documented the repressive action rather than the plot itself; most EC papers have gone missing, while memoirs and other accounts provided by the protagonists were trapped in conflicting versions, inconsistencies, and political bias.<ref> Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, Arnau Gonz\u00e1lez i Vilalta (ed.), ''Contra Companys, 1936.

It covers an area of 608 hectares and is located 750m above sea level. The following villages border Rachaf : Srobbine - Debel - [[Al Tiri]] - [[Haddatha]] - Beit Leif. It can be reached by several routes, such as the following :\nSour - Aain Baal - Qana - Siddiqine - Kafra - [[Hariss]] - Haddatha - Rachaf\n==History==\nIn 1596, it was named as a village,  ''ar-Rasaf'', in the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistrict) of  [[Tibnin]]  under the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa']]'' (district) of [[Safad]], with a population of  51  households, all Muslim.

During the winter, the number of residents is approximately 300, a number which increases to 1,500 during summer. The low number of residents is because Rachaf was under Israeli occupation, which forced most of the residents to immigrate to the southern suburbs of [[Beirut]] and Sour, Aaitit, Al Rmadiyeh, Al Sarafand and Al Bazouriyeh. Despite the Israeli retreat in year 2000, migrants did not return to their village. However, the village has witnessed some renewed construction activities, with 200 additional houses built. There are 250 houses in the village distributed across 12 quarters: El Dayaa - Al Saha, Al Bayyad, Khalet El Maghara, Sahlet El Zaitoun, Al Rou\u00e9s, Al Dabsh Al Sharky, Al Dabsh Al Gharby, Al Assi, Al Maabour, Aain Jdeidah, Al Sowan, and Al Aaqaba.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Voters ==\nThe number of registered voters May 2004 was 1,690 (832 males and 858 females) compared to 1,505 voters in 2000, distributed mainly between 24 families.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Local Authorities ==\nThe village has a municipal council composed of 12 members.

'''Conservatives''', is a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The governing party since 2010, it holds an [[Majority government|overall majority]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with 365 [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Members of Parliament]]. It also has 245 members of the [[House of Lords]], 8 members of the [[London Assembly]], 31 members of the [[Scottish Parliament]], 11 members of the [[Welsh Assembly]] and [[Political make-up of local councils in the United Kingdom|7,430 local councillors]].<ref name=\"localcouncil\"/>\n\nThe Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory Party]]\u2014the Conservatives' colloquial name is [[Tory|Tories]]\u2014and was one of two dominant political parties in the 19th century, along with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Under [[Benjamin Disraeli]], it played a preeminent role in politics at the height of the [[British Empire]]. In 1912, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]] merged with the party to form the Conservative and Unionist Party. In the 1920s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] surpassed the Liberals as the Conservatives' main rivals. Conservative Prime Ministers, most notably [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], led governments for 57 years of the 20th century.\n\nPositioned on the centre-right of British politics, the Conservative Party is ideologically [[Conservatism|conservative]]. Different factions have dominated the party at different times, including [[One-nation conservatism|one nation conservatives]], [[Thatcherism|Thatcherites]] and [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]], while its views and policies have changed throughout its history. The party has generally adopted [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic policies]]\u2014favouring [[free market]] economics, limiting state regulation, and pursuing privatisation\u2014although in the past has also supported [[protectionism]]. The party is [[British unionism|British unionist]], opposing both [[United Ireland|Irish reunification]] and [[Welsh independence|Welsh]] and [[Scottish independence]], and historically supported the continuance and maintenance of the [[British Empire]]. The party includes those with differing views on the [[European Union]], with [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] wings. On social policy, it has historically taken a more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] approach, though this has receded over recent decades. In foreign policy, it favours a strong military capability, being supportive of British participation in [[NATO]].\n\nThe Conservatives are a member of the [[International Democrat Union]] and the [[European Conservatives and Reformists Party]]. The [[Scottish Conservatives|Scottish]], [[Welsh Conservatives|Welsh]], [[Northern Ireland Conservatives|Northern Irish]] and [[Gibraltar Conservatives|Gibraltarian]] branches of the party are semi-autonomous. Its support base has consisted primarily of Middle class voters, especially in rural areas of England, and its domination of British politics throughout the twentieth century has led to it being referred to as one of the most successful political parties in the Western world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/book-review-the-conservative-party-from-thatcher-to-cameron/|title=Book Review: The Conservative Party from Thatcher to Cameron|date=10 April 2011|author=Steve Coulter|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815212248/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/book-review-the-conservative-party-from-thatcher-to-cameron/|archive-date=15 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/the-conservative-party-may-be-destroyed-by-this-european-madness/|author=Philip Johnston|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=The Conservative Party may be destroyed by this European madness|date=19 April 2016|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623063607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/the-conservative-party-may-be-destroyed-by-this-european-madness/|archive-date=23 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2017/05/why-tories-keep-winning|title=Why the Tories keep winning|author=Andrew Gimson|work=New Statesman|date=15 May 2017|access-date=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018071809/https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2017/05/why-tories-keep-winning|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Conservative Party (UK)}}\n[[File:Robert Peel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Peel]], twice [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and founder of the Conservative Party]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Conservative Party was founded in the 1830s.  However, some writers trace its origins to the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 1670s [[Exclusion Crisis]]. Other historians point to a faction, rooted in the 18th century [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]], that coalesced around [[William Pitt the Younger]] in the 1780s. They were known as \"Independent Whigs\", \"Friends of Mr Pitt\", or \"Pittites\" and never used terms such as \"Tory\" or \"Conservative\". Pitt died in 1806. From about 1812 on the name \"Tory\" was commonly used for a new party that, according to historian Robert Blake, \"are the ancestors of Conservatism\".  Blake adds that Pitt's successors after 1812 \"were not in any sense standard-bearers of 'true Toryism'\".<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) p. 4</ref>\n[[File:1st Duke of Wellington 1831 cropped cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], served as the first Conservative Secretary of State]]\nThe term \"Conservative\" was suggested as a title for the party by a magazine article by [[John Wilson Croker|J. Wilson Croker]] in the ''Quarterly Review'' in 1830.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Safire|first1=William|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195343342|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&pg=PA144|accessdate=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330130525/https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&pg=PA144|archive-date=30 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The name immediately caught on and was officially adopted under the aegis of [[Robert Peel]] around 1834. Peel is acknowledged as the founder of the Conservative Party, which he created with the announcement of the [[Tamworth Manifesto]].  The term \"Conservative Party\" rather than Tory was the dominant usage by 1845.<ref>Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, ''The Growth of the British Party System Volume I: 1640\u20131923'' (1965) pp. 66\u201381</ref><ref>David Paterson, ''Liberalism and Conservatism, 1846\u20131905'' (2001) p. 5</ref>\n\n=== Conservatives and Unionists (1867\u20131914) ===\n[[File:Churchill V sign HU 55521.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Winston Churchill]], twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\nThe widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]]. In 1886, the party formed an alliance with [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Spencer Compton Cavendish, Lord Hartington]] (later the 8th [[Dukes of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]) and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s new [[Liberal Unionist Party]] and, under the statesmen [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, Lord Salisbury]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]] when it split over the issue of [[tariff reform|free trade]].\n\nYoung [[Winston Churchill]] denounced Chamberlain's attack on free trade, and helped organize the opposition inside the Unionist/Conservative Party. Nevertheless, Balfour, as party leader, followed Chamberlain's policy introduced protectionist legislation.<ref>Peter Fraser, \"Unionism and Tariff Reform: The Crisis of 1906.\" ''Historical Journal'' 5.2 (1962): 149\u2013166.</ref> The high tariff element called itself \"Tariff Reformers\" and in a major speech in Manchester on 13 May 1904, Churchill warned their takeover of the Unionist/Conservative party would permanently brand it as follows:\n:A party of great vested interests, banded together in a formidable confederation; corruption at home, aggression to cover it up abroad; the trickery of tariff juggles, the tyranny of a party machine; sentiment by the bucketful; patriotism by the imperial pint; the open hand at the public exchequer, the open door at the public-house; dear food for the million, cheap labour for the millionaire.<ref>Andrew Roberts,  ''Churchill: Walking with Destiny'' (2018) p 92.</ref>\n\nTwo weeks later, Churchill crossed the floor and formally joined the Liberal Party (he rejoined the Conservatives in 1925). In December, Balfour lost control of his party, as the defections multiplied. He was replaced by Liberal Prime Minister [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] who called [[1906 United Kingdom general election|an election in January 1906]], which produced a massive Liberal victory with a gain of 214 seats.  Liberal Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] enacted a great deal of reform legislation, but the Unionists worked hard at grassroots organizing. Two general elections were held in 1910, [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|one in January]] and [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|one in December]]. The two main parties were now almost dead equal in seats. The Unionists had more popular votes but the Liberals kept control with a coalition with the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]].<ref>R. C. K.

In Ireland, the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] had been formed in 1891 which merged Unionists who were opposed to Irish Home Rule into one political movement. Its MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster, and in essence, formed the Irish wing of the party until 1922.

[[Winston Churchill]], the party leader, brought in a [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Party Chairman]] to modernise the creaking institution. [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton]], was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946\u201355, he rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Woolton emphasised rhetoric that characterised the opponents as \"Socialist\" rather than \"Labour\". The [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] influence of Professor [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s 1944 best-seller ''Road to Serfdom'' was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter-century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.<ref>Blake, Robert.

Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition, there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies and reluctance to curb the legal powers of labour unions, thus making them complicit in the [[Post-war consensus]]. The critics contend that Britain was overtaken by its economic competitors, and was unable to prevent a troublesome wage-price upward spiral. Historian Graham Goodlad calls for taking a longer perspective. He argues that there were significant advances in transport, healthcare, and higher education.  It would have been unrealistic to expect that Britain could continue as a world power after the huge expense of the Second World War, and the independence of India and other colonies. Goodlad says the Conservative foreign-policy leadership properly adjusted Britain's world role by building an independent nuclear capacity and maintaining a leading role in world affairs, and anyway successive governments seldom did a better job.<ref>Graham Goodlad,  \"Thirteen Wasted Years: \"Do the Conservative governments of  1951\u201364 deserve this label\" ''Modern History Review''  (2001) 13#2 pp 2\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe Conservatives were re-elected in [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955]] and [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] with larger majorities.

The [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 was a humiliating defeat for Prime Minister Eden, but his successor, Macmillan, minimised the damage and focused attention on domestic issues and prosperity. Macmillan boasted during the 1959 general election that Britain had \"never had it so good\".\n\nIn 1958, [[Geoffrey Howe]] co-authored the report ''A Giant's Strength'' published by the [[Inns of Court]] Conservative Association. The report argued that the unions had become too powerful and that their legal privileges ought to be curtailed. [[Iain Macleod]] discouraged the authors from publicising the report. Macmillan believed that trade union votes had contributed towards the 1951 and 1955 victories and thought that it \"would be inexpedient to adopt any policy involving legislation which would alienate this support\".<ref>{{cite book | author=Kynaston, David |year=2013 |title=Modernity Britain: Opening the Box 1957\u20131959 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-7475-8893-1 |page=158}}</ref>\n\nMacmillan's bid to join the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC) in early 1963 was blocked by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]].

To replace the old post-war consensus, she built a right-wing political ideology that became known as [[Thatcherism]], based on social and economic ideas from British and American intellectuals such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. Thatcher believed that too much socially democratic-oriented government policy was leading to a long-term decline in the British economy. As a result, her government pursued a programme of [[economic liberalism]], adopting a free-market approach to public services based on the sale of publicly owned industries and utilities, as well as a reduction in trade union power. She held the belief that the existing trend of unions was bringing economic progress to a standstill by enforcing \"wildcat\" strikes, keeping wages artificially high and forcing unprofitable industries to stay open.\n\nOne of Thatcher's largest and most successful policies assisted council house tenants in public housing to purchase their homes at favourable rates. The \"Right to Buy\" had emerged in the late-1940s but was too great a challenge to the [[Post-War Consensus]] to win Conservative endorsement. Thatcher from her earliest days in politics favoured the idea because it would lead to a \"property-owning democracy\", an important idea that had emerged in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Matthew Francis 2011\"/> Some local Conservative-run councils enacted profitable local sales schemes during the late-1960s.

This belief is reflected, in part, by the advocacy of tax cuts. The party has recently focused on the [[social market economy]] in Britain, promoting a free market for competition with social balance to create fairness. This has included curbs on the banking sector, enterprise zones to revive regions in Britain and grand infrastructure projects such as high-speed rail.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d45ed5c6-842b-11e3-b72e-00144feab7de|title=The death and life of Britain's market economy|author=|date=24 January 2014|newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=18 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218201956/https://www.ft.com/content/d45ed5c6-842b-11e3-b72e-00144feab7de|archive-date=18 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/860969/The-case-for-social-market-capitalism-must-be-made-once-again|title=The case for social market capitalism must be made once again, says Sir Oliver Letwin|first=Oliver|last=Letwin|date=1 October 2017|newspaper=Express|access-date=18 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218202017/https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/860969/The-case-for-social-market-capitalism-must-be-made-once-again|archive-date=18 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne concrete economic policy of recent years has been opposition to the [[Euro]]pean single currency.

It pledged to reform the procurement process, compile a Green Paper on Sovereignty Capability, and publish another Defence Industrial Strategy following on from the Defence Industrial Strategy in 2005. The Conservative Party has said that there will be four aims for British defence procurement: to provide the best possible equipment at the best possible price; to streamline the procurement process to ensure the speedy delivery of equipment to the front line; to support our industry jobs at home by increasing defence exports; to provide defence procurement that underpins strategic relationships abroad and; to provide predictability to the defence industry.\n\nThe Conservative Party also pledged to increase Britain's share of the global defence market as Government policy.\n\n==== Europe and NATO ====\n\nThe Conservative Party aims to build enhanced bilateral defence relations with key European partners and believes that it is in Britain's national interest to cooperate fully with all its European neighbours.

Though the principal architect of the UK's entry into the [[European Communities]] (which became the European Union) was Conservative Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], and both [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]] favoured some form of European union, the bulk of contemporary Conservative opinion is opposed to closer economic and particularly political union with the EU. This is a noticeable shift in British politics, as in the 1960s and 1970s the Conservatives were more pro-Europe than the Labour Party: for example, in the 1971 House of Commons vote on whether the UK should join the European Economic Community, only 39 of the then 330 Conservative MPs were opposed to membership.<ref name=georgiou>{{cite journal |last1=Georgiou |first1=Christakis |date=April 2017 |title=British Capitalism and European Unification, from Ottawa to the Brexit Referendum |journal=[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]] |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=90\u2013129 |doi=10.1163/1569206X-12341511 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Anthony |author-link1=Anthony Lewis |date=29 October 1971 |title=Commons Votes, 356 to 242, for Britain's Membership in the European Market|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/29/archives/commons-votes-356-to-244-for-britains-membership-in-the-european.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=1 |access-date=14 September 2019}}</ref> Divisions on Europe came to the fore under the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979\u20131990) and were cited by several ministers resigning, including [[Geoffrey Howe]], the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], whose resignation triggered [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|the challenge that ended Thatcher's leadership]]. Under Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]] (1990\u20131997), the slow process of integration within the EU forced party tensions to the surface. A core of [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] MPs under Major used the small Conservative majority in Parliament to oppose Government policy on the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. By doing so they undermined Major's ability to govern.\n\nThe Conservative Party has members with varying opinions of the EU, with [[pro-European]] Conservatives joining the affiliate [[Conservative Europe Group|Conservative Group for Europe]], while some Eurosceptics left the party to join the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]]. Whilst the vast majority of Conservatives in recent decades have been Eurosceptics, views among this group regarding the UK's relationship with the EU have been polarised between moderate, soft Eurosceptics who support continued British membership but oppose further harmonisation of regulations affecting business and accept participation in a [[multi-speed Europe]], and a more radical, economically libertarian faction who oppose policy initiatives from Brussels, support the rolling back of integration measures from the Maastricht Treaty onwards, and have become increasingly supportive of a complete withdrawal.<ref name=georgiou /> Under current EU practices, the degree to which a Conservative Government could implement policy change regarding the EU would depend directly on the willingness of other EU member states to agree to such policies.\n\nIn 2009 the Conservative Party actively campaigned against the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], which it believes would give away too much sovereignty to Brussels.

The [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum took place on 23 June 2016]], and resulted in a vote to leave the European Union \u2013 a policy commonly referred to as [[Brexit]]. Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] signed the notice under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which officially began Britain's withdrawal from the EU, on 28 March 2017, and at 12:20 on 29 March 2017, the UK ambassador Tim Barrow delivered the notice to EU president Donald Tusk, officially triggering what was intended to be a two-year process of leaving the European Union.\n\nFollowing the [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|election of Boris Johnson as leader]], the Conservative Party became a strong supporter of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. On 3 September 2019 the Conservative group in the House of Commons withdrew its whip from twenty-one MPs who voted in favour of the so-called [[European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019|Benn-Burton Act]], preventing the UK to [[No-deal Brexit|leave the EU with no deal]].\n\nIn the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] the Conservative Party adopted a clear pro-Brexit platform. Following the election, the [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020|European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act]] was passed; the United Kingdom finally withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020.\n\n=== Union policy ===\nThe Conservatives staunchly support the maintenance of the United Kingdom, and oppose the independence of any of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]]: [[English independence|England]], [[Scottish independence|Scotland]], [[Welsh independence|Wales]] or [[Irish republicanism|Northern Ireland]] from it. They have had a mixed history on support for [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish]], [[Welsh devolution|Welsh]] and [[Devolution for Northern Ireland|Northern Irish devolution]].\n\nIn 1968, [[Edward Heath]] issued his '[[Declaration of Perth|Perth declaration]]', in support of a Scottish assembly, in the wake of growing nationalism. However, the cause went unanswered during his turbulent premiership, and under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]]'s leadership, the Conservatives vehemently opposed devolution, and campaigned against it in the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997 devolution referendum]]. Following the [[Scottish Parliament]]'s establishment in 1999, they have vowed to support its continued existence, and along with Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they supported the [[Scotland Bill (2011)]], granting further devolution of power. They campaigned alongside Labour and the Liberal Democrats against full Scottish Independence in the 2014 [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish Independence referendum]].\n\nIn Wales, the Conservatives campaigned against devolution in the [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|1997 referendum]], however likewise as with Scotland, they have vowed to maintain the [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]]'s continued existence, and in 2011 supported the further devolution of power.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the Conservatives suspended the parliament in 1973 in the wake of the growing [[The Troubles|Troubles]], and made unsuccessful attempts to re-establish it in the same year, and in 1982. They supported the [[Belfast Agreement]] negotiated by the Blair government in 1998, and in 2009, negotiated an electoral pact with the declining [[Ulster Unionist Party]], whom it had previously been allied to before 1973 and informally during the John Major's tenure as Prime Minister. The pact was abandoned for the 2015 general election, where the [[Northern Ireland Conservatives]] ran their own candidates.\n\nOn 4 October 2016, the [[Democratic Unionist Party]]'s leader [[Arlene Foster]] and MPs held a champagne reception at the Conservative Party [[Party conference season|conference]], marking what some have described as an \"informal coalition\" or an \"understanding\" between the two parties to account for the Conservatives' narrow majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Manley|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/10/14/news/ni-conservatives-disquiet-over-dup-love-in-to-be-raised-with-party-hq-736030/|work=[[The Irish News]]|date=14 October 2016|title=NI Conservatives' disquiet over DUP love-in to be raised with party HQ|access-date=28 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707022456/http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/10/14/news/ni-conservatives-disquiet-over-dup-love-in-to-be-raised-with-party-hq-736030/|archive-date=7 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/gary-gibbon-on-politics/tories-increase-majority-dup-deal/33628|title=Tories look to increase majority with DUP deal|work=[[Channel 4]]|date=4 October 2016|first=Gary|last=Gibbon|access-date=28 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018211508/http://blogs.channel4.com/gary-gibbon-on-politics/tories-increase-majority-dup-deal/33628|archive-date=18 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Since then, the DUP has generally supported Conservative legislation.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Public Whip|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/divisions.php|title=Divisions \u2013 2015\u2013present, Westminster|accessdate=28 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329043257/http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/divisions.php|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe party opposed Labour's attempts to [[2004 Northern England devolution referendums|devolve power to the northern regions of England]] in 2004.

The name stems from its support for three British social institutions (though the Church is an English institution): the [[Church of England]], the [[unitary state|unitary British state]] and the family. To this end, it emphasises the country's [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] heritage, oppose any transfer of power away from the United Kingdom\u2014either downwards to the nations and regions or upwards to the European Union\u2014and seek to place greater emphasis on traditional family structures to repair what it sees as a broken society in the UK. It is a strong advocate of marriage and believes the Conservative Party should back the institution with tax breaks and have opposed the alleged assaults on both traditional family structures and fatherhood. \n\nMost oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24\u2011week abortion limit. Some members in the past have expressed support for capital punishment. Prominent MPs from this wing of the party include [[Andrew Rosindell]], [[Nadine Dorries]], [[Edward Leigh]] and [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]]\u2014the latter two being prominent Roman Catholics, notable in a faction marked out by its support for the established Church of England. The conservative English philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] is a representative of the intellectual wing of the [[Traditional conservatism|traditionalist]] group: his writings rarely touch on economics and instead focus on conservative perspectives concerning political, social, cultural and moral issues.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== One-nation Conservatives ===\n{{One-nation conservatism}}\n[[One-nation conservatism]] was the party's dominant ideology in the 20th century until the rise of [[Thatcherism]] in the 1970s. It has included in its ranks Conservative Prime Ministers such as [[Stanley Baldwin]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Edward Heath]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Garner |first2=Richard N. |last2=Kelly |title=British political parties today |year=1998 |page=66}}</ref> One Nation Conservatives in the contemporary party include [[Malcolm Rifkind]] and [[Damian Green]]. The name itself comes from a famous phrase of [[Disraeli]]. Ideologically, One Nation Conservatism identifies itself with a broad [[liberal conservative]] stance. They are often associated with the [[Tory Reform Group]] and the [[Bow Group]]. \n\nAdherents of One-Nation Conservatism believe in social cohesion and support social institutions that maintain harmony between different interest groups, classes, and\u2014more recently\u2014different races or religions. These institutions have typically included the [[welfare state]], the [[BBC]], and local government. One Nation Conservatives often invoke [[Edmund Burke]] and his emphasis on [[civil society]] (\"little platoons\") as the foundations of society, as well as his opposition to radical politics of all types. The Red Tory theory of [[Phillip Blond]] is a strand of the One Nation school of thought. Prominent Red Tories include former Cabinet Ministers [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Eric Pickles]] and [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] [[Jesse Norman]].<ref>Politics Review, April 2013</ref> There is a difference of opinion among supporters regarding the European Union. Some support it perhaps stemming from an extension of the cohesion principle to the international level, though others are strongly against the EU (such as [[Peter Tapsell (UK politician)|Peter Tapsell]]).\n\n=== Free-market Conservatives ===\nThe second main grouping in the Conservative Party is the \"free-market wing\" of [[economic liberalism|economic liberals]] who achieved dominance after the election of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1975. Their goal was to reduce the role of the government in the economy and to this end, they supported cuts in direct taxation, the [[privatisation]] of [[Nationalization|nationalised]] industries and a reduction in the size and scope of the welfare state. Supporters of the \"free-market wing\" have been labelled as \"[[Thatcherites]]\". The group has disparate views of social policy: Thatcher herself was [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] and a practising [[Anglican]] but the free-market wing in the Conservative Party harbour a range of social opinions from the [[civil libertarian]] views of [[Michael Portillo]], [[Daniel Hannan]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Despite Appearances Conservatism Remains the Dominant Ideology |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/category/libertarianism/page/3/ |newspaper=[[The American Conservative]] |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726060253/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/category/libertarianism/page/3/ |archive-date=26 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] to the [[traditional conservatism]] of former party leaders [[William Hague]] and [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. The Thatcherite wing is also associated with the concept of a \"classless society\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Tim |last=Bale |authorlink=Tim Bale |title=The Conservative Party: From Thatcher to Cameron |year=2011 |page=145}}</ref>\n\nWhilst a number of party members are [[pro-European]], some free-marketeers are [[Eurosceptic]], perceiving most EU regulations as interference in the free market and/or a threat to British sovereignty. EU centralisation also conflicts with the localist ideals that have grown in prominence within the party in recent years. Rare Thatcherite Europhiles included [[Leon Brittan, Baron Brittan of Spennithorne|Leon Brittan]]. Many take inspiration from Thatcher's Bruges speech in 1988, in which she declared that \"we have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only to see them reimposed at a European level\". A number of free-market Conservatives have signed the [[Better Off Out]] pledge to leave the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.betteroffout.net/supporters/ |title=Supporters |publisher=Better Off Out |accessdate=18 June 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130620024415/http://www.betteroffout.net/supporters/ |archive-date=20 June 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Thatcherites and [[economic liberals]] in the party tend to support [[Atlanticism]], something exhibited between Margaret Thatcher and [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nThatcher herself claimed philosophical inspiration from the works of Burke and [[Friedrich Hayek]] for her defence of liberal economics. Groups associated with this tradition include the [[No Turning Back (political group)|No Turning Back]] Group and [[Conservative Way Forward]], whilst Enoch Powell and [[Keith Joseph]] are usually cited as early influences in the movement.<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric J. |last=Evans |title=Thatcher and Thatcherism |year=2004 |pages=6, 72}}</ref> Some free-market supporters and [[Christian Democrats|Christian democrats]] within the party tend to advocate the [[Social Market Economy|social market economy]], which supports free markets alongside social and environmental responsibility, as well a welfare state. Keith Joseph was the first to introduce the model idea into British politics, writing the publication: ''Why Britain needs a Social Market Economy''.\n\n=== Relationships between the factions ===\nSometimes two groupings have united to oppose the third. Both Thatcherite and Traditionalist Conservatives rebelled over Europe (and in particular Maastricht) during [[John Major]]'s premiership; and Traditionalist and One Nation MPs united to inflict Margaret Thatcher's only major defeat in Parliament, over Sunday trading.\n\nNot all Conservative MPs can be easily placed within one of the above groupings. For example, John Major was the ostensibly \"Thatcherite\" candidate during the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|1990 leadership election]], but he consistently promoted One-Nation Conservatives to the higher reaches of his cabinet during his time as Prime Minister. These included [[Kenneth Clarke]] as Chancellor of the Exchequer and [[Michael Heseltine]] as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page2384.html |title=Mr Major's Third Cabinet |publisher=John Major |date=25 September 1992 |accessdate=18 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031080312/http://johnmajor.co.uk/page2384.html |archive-date=31 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Electoral performance and campaigns==\nNational campaigning within the Conservative Party is fundamentally managed by  [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters#Campaigning|the CCHQ campaigning team]], which is part of its central office <ref name=\"conservatives.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation|title=Party Structure and Organisation|website=Conservatives.com|accessdate=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230159/https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\nHowever, it also delegates local responsibility to Conservative associations in the area, usually to a team of Conservative activists and volunteers <ref name=\"conservatives.com\"/> in that area, but campaigns are still deployed from and thus managed by [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|CCHQ]]\nNational campaigning sometimes occurs in-house by volunteers and staff at [[CCHQ]] in [[Westminster]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/calling|title=Philip May's Calling Community|website=Conservatives.com|accessdate=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102073000/https://www.conservatives.com/calling|archive-date=2 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[CCHQ]] maintains responsibility overall for campaigning in the Conservative Party, and targeting voters <ref>[https://www.conservativehome.com/majority_conservatism/2017/09/our-cchq-election-audit-the-rusty-machine-part-two-how-and-why-the-ground-campaign-failed.html Our CCHQ election audit: the rusty machine, part two.

'''Conservatives''', is a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The governing party since 2010, it holds an [[Majority government|overall majority]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with 365 [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Members of Parliament]]. It also has 245 members of the [[House of Lords]], 8 members of the [[London Assembly]], 31 members of the [[Scottish Parliament]], 11 members of the [[Welsh Assembly]] and [[Political make-up of local councils in the United Kingdom|7,430 local councillors]].<ref name=\"localcouncil\"/>\n\nThe Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory Party]]\u2014the Conservatives' colloquial name is [[Tory|Tories]]\u2014and was one of two dominant political parties in the 19th century, along with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Under [[Benjamin Disraeli]], it played a preeminent role in politics at the height of the [[British Empire]]. In 1912, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]] merged with the party to form the Conservative and Unionist Party. In the 1920s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] surpassed the Liberals as the Conservatives' main rivals. Conservative Prime Ministers, most notably [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], led governments for 57 years of the 20th century.\n\nPositioned on the centre-right of British politics, the Conservative Party is ideologically [[Conservatism|conservative]]. Different factions have dominated the party at different times, including [[One-nation conservatism|one nation conservatives]], [[Thatcherism|Thatcherites]] and [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]], while its views and policies have changed throughout its history. The party has generally adopted [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic policies]]\u2014favouring [[free market]] economics, limiting state regulation, and pursuing privatisation\u2014although in the past has also supported [[protectionism]]. The party is [[British unionism|British unionist]], opposing both [[United Ireland|Irish reunification]] and [[Welsh independence|Welsh]] and [[Scottish independence]], and historically supported the continuance and maintenance of the [[British Empire]]. The party includes those with differing views on the [[European Union]], with [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] wings. On social policy, it has historically taken a more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] approach, though this has receded over recent decades. In foreign policy, it favours a strong military capability, being supportive of British participation in [[NATO]].\n\nThe Conservatives are a member of the [[International Democrat Union]] and the [[European Conservatives and Reformists Party]]. The [[Scottish Conservatives|Scottish]], [[Welsh Conservatives|Welsh]], [[Northern Ireland Conservatives|Northern Irish]] and [[Gibraltar Conservatives|Gibraltarian]] branches of the party are semi-autonomous. Its support base has consisted primarily of Middle class voters, especially in rural areas of England, and its domination of British politics throughout the twentieth century has led to it being referred to as one of the most successful political parties in the Western world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/book-review-the-conservative-party-from-thatcher-to-cameron/|title=Book Review: The Conservative Party from Thatcher to Cameron|date=10 April 2011|author=Steve Coulter|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815212248/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/book-review-the-conservative-party-from-thatcher-to-cameron/|archive-date=15 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/the-conservative-party-may-be-destroyed-by-this-european-madness/|author=Philip Johnston|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=The Conservative Party may be destroyed by this European madness|date=19 April 2016|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623063607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/the-conservative-party-may-be-destroyed-by-this-european-madness/|archive-date=23 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2017/05/why-tories-keep-winning|title=Why the Tories keep winning|author=Andrew Gimson|work=New Statesman|date=15 May 2017|access-date=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018071809/https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2017/05/why-tories-keep-winning|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Conservative Party (UK)}}\n[[File:Robert Peel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Peel]], twice [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and founder of the Conservative Party]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Conservative Party was founded in the 1830s.  However, some writers trace its origins to the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 1670s [[Exclusion Crisis]]. Other historians point to a faction, rooted in the 18th century [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]], that coalesced around [[William Pitt the Younger]] in the 1780s. They were known as \"Independent Whigs\", \"Friends of Mr Pitt\", or \"Pittites\" and never used terms such as \"Tory\" or \"Conservative\". Pitt died in 1806. From about 1812 on the name \"Tory\" was commonly used for a new party that, according to historian Robert Blake, \"are the ancestors of Conservatism\".  Blake adds that Pitt's successors after 1812 \"were not in any sense standard-bearers of 'true Toryism'\".<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) p. 4</ref>\n[[File:1st Duke of Wellington 1831 cropped cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], served as the first Conservative Secretary of State]]\nThe term \"Conservative\" was suggested as a title for the party by a magazine article by [[John Wilson Croker|J.

Peel is acknowledged as the founder of the Conservative Party, which he created with the announcement of the [[Tamworth Manifesto]].  The term \"Conservative Party\" rather than Tory was the dominant usage by 1845.<ref>Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, ''The Growth of the British Party System Volume I: 1640\u20131923'' (1965) pp. 66\u201381</ref><ref>David Paterson, ''Liberalism and Conservatism, 1846\u20131905'' (2001) p. 5</ref>\n\n=== Conservatives and Unionists (1867\u20131914) ===\n[[File:Churchill V sign HU 55521.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Winston Churchill]], twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\nThe widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]]. In 1886, the party formed an alliance with [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Spencer Compton Cavendish, Lord Hartington]] (later the 8th [[Dukes of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]) and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s new [[Liberal Unionist Party]] and, under the statesmen [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, Lord Salisbury]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]] when it split over the issue of [[tariff reform|free trade]].\n\nYoung [[Winston Churchill]] denounced Chamberlain's attack on free trade, and helped organize the opposition inside the Unionist/Conservative Party. Nevertheless, Balfour, as party leader, followed Chamberlain's policy introduced protectionist legislation.<ref>Peter Fraser, \"Unionism and Tariff Reform: The Crisis of 1906.\" ''Historical Journal'' 5.2 (1962): 149\u2013166.</ref> The high tariff element called itself \"Tariff Reformers\" and in a major speech in Manchester on 13 May 1904, Churchill warned their takeover of the Unionist/Conservative party would permanently brand it as follows:\n:A party of great vested interests, banded together in a formidable confederation; corruption at home, aggression to cover it up abroad; the trickery of tariff juggles, the tyranny of a party machine; sentiment by the bucketful; patriotism by the imperial pint; the open hand at the public exchequer, the open door at the public-house; dear food for the million, cheap labour for the millionaire.<ref>Andrew Roberts,  ''Churchill: Walking with Destiny'' (2018) p 92.</ref>\n\nTwo weeks later, Churchill crossed the floor and formally joined the Liberal Party (he rejoined the Conservatives in 1925). In December, Balfour lost control of his party, as the defections multiplied. He was replaced by Liberal Prime Minister [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] who called [[1906 United Kingdom general election|an election in January 1906]], which produced a massive Liberal victory with a gain of 214 seats.  Liberal Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] enacted a great deal of reform legislation, but the Unionists worked hard at grassroots organizing. Two general elections were held in 1910, [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|one in January]] and [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|one in December]]. The two main parties were now almost dead equal in seats. The Unionists had more popular votes but the Liberals kept control with a coalition with the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]].<ref>R. C. K.

In Ireland, the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] had been formed in 1891 which merged Unionists who were opposed to Irish Home Rule into one political movement. Its MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster, and in essence, formed the Irish wing of the party until 1922.

The Liberal party was in full control of the government until its mismanagement of the war effort under the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|Shell Crisis]] badly hurt its reputation. An all-party coalition government was formed in May 1915.

However the war pulled the party together, allowing it to emphasise patriotism as it found new leadership and worked out its positions on the Irish question, socialism, electoral reform, and the issue of intervention in the economy. The fresh emphasis on anti-Socialism was its response to the growing strength of the Labour Party.

[[Winston Churchill]], the party leader, brought in a [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Party Chairman]] to modernise the creaking institution. [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton]], was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946\u201355, he rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Woolton emphasised rhetoric that characterised the opponents as \"Socialist\" rather than \"Labour\". The [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] influence of Professor [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s 1944 best-seller ''Road to Serfdom'' was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter-century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.<ref>Blake, Robert.

Although he was ageing rapidly, he had national and global prestige. Apart from rationing, which was ended in 1954, most of the [[welfare state]] enacted by Labour were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the \"post-war consensus\" that was satirised as [[Butskellism]], and which lasted until the 1970s.<ref>[[Toye, Richard]]. \"From 'Consensus' to 'Common Ground': The Rhetoric of the Postwar Settlement and its Collapse,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (2013) 48#1 pp. 3\u201323.</ref><ref>''The Economist'', 'Mr Butskell's Dilemma', 13 February 1954.</ref> The Conservatives were conciliatory towards unions, but they did privatise the steel and road haulage industries in 1953.<ref>{{cite book |author=Morgan, Kenneth O. |authorlink=Kenneth O.

Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition, there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies and reluctance to curb the legal powers of labour unions, thus making them complicit in the [[Post-war consensus]]. The critics contend that Britain was overtaken by its economic competitors, and was unable to prevent a troublesome wage-price upward spiral. Historian Graham Goodlad calls for taking a longer perspective. He argues that there were significant advances in transport, healthcare, and higher education.  It would have been unrealistic to expect that Britain could continue as a world power after the huge expense of the Second World War, and the independence of India and other colonies. Goodlad says the Conservative foreign-policy leadership properly adjusted Britain's world role by building an independent nuclear capacity and maintaining a leading role in world affairs, and anyway successive governments seldom did a better job.<ref>Graham Goodlad,  \"Thirteen Wasted Years: \"Do the Conservative governments of  1951\u201364 deserve this label\" ''Modern History Review''  (2001) 13#2 pp 2\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe Conservatives were re-elected in [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955]] and [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] with larger majorities. Conservative Prime Ministers [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], [[Anthony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Alec Douglas-Home]] promoted relatively liberal trade regulations and less state involvement throughout the 1950s and early-1960s. The [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 was a humiliating defeat for Prime Minister Eden, but his successor, Macmillan, minimised the damage and focused attention on domestic issues and prosperity. Macmillan boasted during the 1959 general election that Britain had \"never had it so good\".\n\nIn 1958, [[Geoffrey Howe]] co-authored the report ''A Giant's Strength'' published by the [[Inns of Court]] Conservative Association. The report argued that the unions had become too powerful and that their legal privileges ought to be curtailed. [[Iain Macleod]] discouraged the authors from publicising the report. Macmillan believed that trade union votes had contributed towards the 1951 and 1955 victories and thought that it \"would be inexpedient to adopt any policy involving legislation which would alienate this support\".<ref>{{cite book | author=Kynaston, David |year=2013 |title=Modernity Britain: Opening the Box 1957\u20131959 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-7475-8893-1 |page=158}}</ref>\n\nMacmillan's bid to join the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC) in early 1963 was blocked by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]].

Blackwell, 1997).</ref>  She did not challenge the [[National Health Service]], and supported the Cold War policies of the consensus, but otherwise tried to dismantle and delegitimise it. To replace the old post-war consensus, she built a right-wing political ideology that became known as [[Thatcherism]], based on social and economic ideas from British and American intellectuals such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. Thatcher believed that too much socially democratic-oriented government policy was leading to a long-term decline in the British economy. As a result, her government pursued a programme of [[economic liberalism]], adopting a free-market approach to public services based on the sale of publicly owned industries and utilities, as well as a reduction in trade union power. She held the belief that the existing trend of unions was bringing economic progress to a standstill by enforcing \"wildcat\" strikes, keeping wages artificially high and forcing unprofitable industries to stay open.\n\nOne of Thatcher's largest and most successful policies assisted council house tenants in public housing to purchase their homes at favourable rates. The \"Right to Buy\" had emerged in the late-1940s but was too great a challenge to the [[Post-War Consensus]] to win Conservative endorsement. Thatcher from her earliest days in politics favoured the idea because it would lead to a \"property-owning democracy\", an important idea that had emerged in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Matthew Francis 2011\"/> Some local Conservative-run councils enacted profitable local sales schemes during the late-1960s. By the 1970s, many working-class people had ample incomes to afford to buy homes, and eagerly adopted Thatcher's invitation to purchase their homes at a sizable discount. The new owners were more likely to vote Conservative, as Thatcher had hoped.<ref>Aled Davies, \"'Right to Buy': The Development of a Conservative Housing Policy, 1945\u20131980.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 27.4 (2013): 421\u201344.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283171436 |title=Stephen Farrall, et al. \"Thatcherite Ideology, Housing Tenure, and Crime: The Socio-Spatial Consequences of the Right to Buy for Domestic Property Crime.\" ''British Journal of Criminology'' (2015) |access-date=3 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002256/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Will_Jennings2/publication/283171436_Thatcherite_Ideology_Housing_Tenure_and_Crime_The_Socio-Spatial_Consequences_of_the_Right_to_Buy_for_Domestic_Property_Crime/links/5643f42008aef646e6ca1355.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThatcher led the Conservatives to two further electoral victories with landslide{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2017}} majorities in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]].

This has included curbs on the banking sector, enterprise zones to revive regions in Britain and grand infrastructure projects such as high-speed rail.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d45ed5c6-842b-11e3-b72e-00144feab7de|title=The death and life of Britain's market economy|author=|date=24 January 2014|newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=18 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218201956/https://www.ft.com/content/d45ed5c6-842b-11e3-b72e-00144feab7de|archive-date=18 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/860969/The-case-for-social-market-capitalism-must-be-made-once-again|title=The case for social market capitalism must be made once again, says Sir Oliver Letwin|first=Oliver|last=Letwin|date=1 October 2017|newspaper=Express|access-date=18 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218202017/https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/860969/The-case-for-social-market-capitalism-must-be-made-once-again|archive-date=18 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne concrete economic policy of recent years has been opposition to the [[Euro]]pean single currency. Anticipating the growing [[Euroscepticism]] within his party, [[John Major]] negotiated a British opt-out from the single currency in the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]], although several members of Major's cabinet, such as [[Kenneth Clarke]], were personally supportive of EMU participation. Following Major's resignation after the 1997 defeat, each of the four subsequent Conservative leaders, including [[David Cameron]], have positioned the party firmly against the adoption of the [[euro]]. This policy is broadly popular with the British electorate.\n\nFollowing Labour's victory in the 1997 general election, the Conservative Party opposed Labour's decision to grant the [[Bank of England]] independent control of interest rates\u2014on the grounds that it would be a prelude to the abolition of the [[pound sterling]] and acceptance of the European single currency, and also expressed concern over the removal of monetary policy from democratic control.

Other Conservative politicians, despite being [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]], are in favour of full [[Prohibition of drugs|prohibition of the ownership and trade of many drugs]]. Other Conservatives are in the middle ground, favouring stances such as looser regulation and [[Drug decriminalization|decriminalisation]] of some drugs.

Though the principal architect of the UK's entry into the [[European Communities]] (which became the European Union) was Conservative Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], and both [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]] favoured some form of European union, the bulk of contemporary Conservative opinion is opposed to closer economic and particularly political union with the EU. This is a noticeable shift in British politics, as in the 1960s and 1970s the Conservatives were more pro-Europe than the Labour Party: for example, in the 1971 House of Commons vote on whether the UK should join the European Economic Community, only 39 of the then 330 Conservative MPs were opposed to membership.<ref name=georgiou>{{cite journal |last1=Georgiou |first1=Christakis |date=April 2017 |title=British Capitalism and European Unification, from Ottawa to the Brexit Referendum |journal=[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]] |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=90\u2013129 |doi=10.1163/1569206X-12341511 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Anthony |author-link1=Anthony Lewis |date=29 October 1971 |title=Commons Votes, 356 to 242, for Britain's Membership in the European Market|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/29/archives/commons-votes-356-to-244-for-britains-membership-in-the-european.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=1 |access-date=14 September 2019}}</ref> Divisions on Europe came to the fore under the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979\u20131990) and were cited by several ministers resigning, including [[Geoffrey Howe]], the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], whose resignation triggered [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|the challenge that ended Thatcher's leadership]]. Under Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]] (1990\u20131997), the slow process of integration within the EU forced party tensions to the surface. A core of [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] MPs under Major used the small Conservative majority in Parliament to oppose Government policy on the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. By doing so they undermined Major's ability to govern.\n\nThe Conservative Party has members with varying opinions of the EU, with [[pro-European]] Conservatives joining the affiliate [[Conservative Europe Group|Conservative Group for Europe]], while some Eurosceptics left the party to join the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]]. Whilst the vast majority of Conservatives in recent decades have been Eurosceptics, views among this group regarding the UK's relationship with the EU have been polarised between moderate, soft Eurosceptics who support continued British membership but oppose further harmonisation of regulations affecting business and accept participation in a [[multi-speed Europe]], and a more radical, economically libertarian faction who oppose policy initiatives from Brussels, support the rolling back of integration measures from the Maastricht Treaty onwards, and have become increasingly supportive of a complete withdrawal.<ref name=georgiou /> Under current EU practices, the degree to which a Conservative Government could implement policy change regarding the EU would depend directly on the willingness of other EU member states to agree to such policies.\n\nIn 2009 the Conservative Party actively campaigned against the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], which it believes would give away too much sovereignty to Brussels. [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] stated that, should the treaty be in force by the time of an incoming Conservative government, he would \"not let matters rest there\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7470078.stm |work=BBC News |title=Cameron's Britain: Euro-doubts |date=26 June 2008 |access-date=1 April 2010 |first=Mark |last=Mardell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212231633/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7470078.stm |archive-date=12 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, on 14 June 2009 the shadow Business Secretary, [[Kenneth Clarke]], said in an interview to the [[BBC]] that the Conservative Party would not reopen negotiations on the Lisbon Treaty if the Irish backed it in a new referendum,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8099510.stm |work=BBC News |title= Clarke's treaty pledge sparks row |access-date=14 June 2009 |date=14 June 2009}}</ref> which they did on 2 October 2009.\n\nThe Conservative Party pledged an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union after a renegotiation. The [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum took place on 23 June 2016]], and resulted in a vote to leave the European Union \u2013 a policy commonly referred to as [[Brexit]]. Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] signed the notice under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which officially began Britain's withdrawal from the EU, on 28 March 2017, and at 12:20 on 29 March 2017, the UK ambassador Tim Barrow delivered the notice to EU president Donald Tusk, officially triggering what was intended to be a two-year process of leaving the European Union.\n\nFollowing the [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|election of Boris Johnson as leader]], the Conservative Party became a strong supporter of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. On 3 September 2019 the Conservative group in the House of Commons withdrew its whip from twenty-one MPs who voted in favour of the so-called [[European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019|Benn-Burton Act]], preventing the UK to [[No-deal Brexit|leave the EU with no deal]].\n\nIn the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] the Conservative Party adopted a clear pro-Brexit platform. Following the election, the [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020|European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act]] was passed; the United Kingdom finally withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020.\n\n=== Union policy ===\nThe Conservatives staunchly support the maintenance of the United Kingdom, and oppose the independence of any of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]]: [[English independence|England]], [[Scottish independence|Scotland]], [[Welsh independence|Wales]] or [[Irish republicanism|Northern Ireland]] from it. They have had a mixed history on support for [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish]], [[Welsh devolution|Welsh]] and [[Devolution for Northern Ireland|Northern Irish devolution]].\n\nIn 1968, [[Edward Heath]] issued his '[[Declaration of Perth|Perth declaration]]', in support of a Scottish assembly, in the wake of growing nationalism. However, the cause went unanswered during his turbulent premiership, and under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]]'s leadership, the Conservatives vehemently opposed devolution, and campaigned against it in the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997 devolution referendum]]. Following the [[Scottish Parliament]]'s establishment in 1999, they have vowed to support its continued existence, and along with Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they supported the [[Scotland Bill (2011)]], granting further devolution of power.

The name stems from its support for three British social institutions (though the Church is an English institution): the [[Church of England]], the [[unitary state|unitary British state]] and the family. To this end, it emphasises the country's [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] heritage, oppose any transfer of power away from the United Kingdom\u2014either downwards to the nations and regions or upwards to the European Union\u2014and seek to place greater emphasis on traditional family structures to repair what it sees as a broken society in the UK. It is a strong advocate of marriage and believes the Conservative Party should back the institution with tax breaks and have opposed the alleged assaults on both traditional family structures and fatherhood. \n\nMost oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24\u2011week abortion limit. Some members in the past have expressed support for capital punishment. Prominent MPs from this wing of the party include [[Andrew Rosindell]], [[Nadine Dorries]], [[Edward Leigh]] and [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]]\u2014the latter two being prominent Roman Catholics, notable in a faction marked out by its support for the established Church of England. The conservative English philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] is a representative of the intellectual wing of the [[Traditional conservatism|traditionalist]] group: his writings rarely touch on economics and instead focus on conservative perspectives concerning political, social, cultural and moral issues.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== One-nation Conservatives ===\n{{One-nation conservatism}}\n[[One-nation conservatism]] was the party's dominant ideology in the 20th century until the rise of [[Thatcherism]] in the 1970s. It has included in its ranks Conservative Prime Ministers such as [[Stanley Baldwin]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Edward Heath]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Garner |first2=Richard N. |last2=Kelly |title=British political parties today |year=1998 |page=66}}</ref> One Nation Conservatives in the contemporary party include [[Malcolm Rifkind]] and [[Damian Green]]. The name itself comes from a famous phrase of [[Disraeli]]. Ideologically, One Nation Conservatism identifies itself with a broad [[liberal conservative]] stance. They are often associated with the [[Tory Reform Group]] and the [[Bow Group]]. \n\nAdherents of One-Nation Conservatism believe in social cohesion and support social institutions that maintain harmony between different interest groups, classes, and\u2014more recently\u2014different races or religions. These institutions have typically included the [[welfare state]], the [[BBC]], and local government. One Nation Conservatives often invoke [[Edmund Burke]] and his emphasis on [[civil society]] (\"little platoons\") as the foundations of society, as well as his opposition to radical politics of all types. The Red Tory theory of [[Phillip Blond]] is a strand of the One Nation school of thought. Prominent Red Tories include former Cabinet Ministers [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Eric Pickles]] and [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] [[Jesse Norman]].<ref>Politics Review, April 2013</ref> There is a difference of opinion among supporters regarding the European Union. Some support it perhaps stemming from an extension of the cohesion principle to the international level, though others are strongly against the EU (such as [[Peter Tapsell (UK politician)|Peter Tapsell]]).\n\n=== Free-market Conservatives ===\nThe second main grouping in the Conservative Party is the \"free-market wing\" of [[economic liberalism|economic liberals]] who achieved dominance after the election of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1975. Their goal was to reduce the role of the government in the economy and to this end, they supported cuts in direct taxation, the [[privatisation]] of [[Nationalization|nationalised]] industries and a reduction in the size and scope of the welfare state. Supporters of the \"free-market wing\" have been labelled as \"[[Thatcherites]]\". The group has disparate views of social policy: Thatcher herself was [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] and a practising [[Anglican]] but the free-market wing in the Conservative Party harbour a range of social opinions from the [[civil libertarian]] views of [[Michael Portillo]], [[Daniel Hannan]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Despite Appearances Conservatism Remains the Dominant Ideology |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/category/libertarianism/page/3/ |newspaper=[[The American Conservative]] |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726060253/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/category/libertarianism/page/3/ |archive-date=26 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] to the [[traditional conservatism]] of former party leaders [[William Hague]] and [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. The Thatcherite wing is also associated with the concept of a \"classless society\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Tim |last=Bale |authorlink=Tim Bale |title=The Conservative Party: From Thatcher to Cameron |year=2011 |page=145}}</ref>\n\nWhilst a number of party members are [[pro-European]], some free-marketeers are [[Eurosceptic]], perceiving most EU regulations as interference in the free market and/or a threat to British sovereignty. EU centralisation also conflicts with the localist ideals that have grown in prominence within the party in recent years. Rare Thatcherite Europhiles included [[Leon Brittan, Baron Brittan of Spennithorne|Leon Brittan]]. Many take inspiration from Thatcher's Bruges speech in 1988, in which she declared that \"we have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only to see them reimposed at a European level\". A number of free-market Conservatives have signed the [[Better Off Out]] pledge to leave the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.betteroffout.net/supporters/ |title=Supporters |publisher=Better Off Out |accessdate=18 June 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130620024415/http://www.betteroffout.net/supporters/ |archive-date=20 June 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Thatcherites and [[economic liberals]] in the party tend to support [[Atlanticism]], something exhibited between Margaret Thatcher and [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nThatcher herself claimed philosophical inspiration from the works of Burke and [[Friedrich Hayek]] for her defence of liberal economics. Groups associated with this tradition include the [[No Turning Back (political group)|No Turning Back]] Group and [[Conservative Way Forward]], whilst Enoch Powell and [[Keith Joseph]] are usually cited as early influences in the movement.<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric J. |last=Evans |title=Thatcher and Thatcherism |year=2004 |pages=6, 72}}</ref> Some free-market supporters and [[Christian Democrats|Christian democrats]] within the party tend to advocate the [[Social Market Economy|social market economy]], which supports free markets alongside social and environmental responsibility, as well a welfare state. Keith Joseph was the first to introduce the model idea into British politics, writing the publication: ''Why Britain needs a Social Market Economy''.\n\n=== Relationships between the factions ===\nSometimes two groupings have united to oppose the third. Both Thatcherite and Traditionalist Conservatives rebelled over Europe (and in particular Maastricht) during [[John Major]]'s premiership; and Traditionalist and One Nation MPs united to inflict Margaret Thatcher's only major defeat in Parliament, over Sunday trading.\n\nNot all Conservative MPs can be easily placed within one of the above groupings. For example, John Major was the ostensibly \"Thatcherite\" candidate during the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|1990 leadership election]], but he consistently promoted One-Nation Conservatives to the higher reaches of his cabinet during his time as Prime Minister. These included [[Kenneth Clarke]] as Chancellor of the Exchequer and [[Michael Heseltine]] as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page2384.html |title=Mr Major's Third Cabinet |publisher=John Major |date=25 September 1992 |accessdate=18 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031080312/http://johnmajor.co.uk/page2384.html |archive-date=31 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Electoral performance and campaigns==\nNational campaigning within the Conservative Party is fundamentally managed by  [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters#Campaigning|the CCHQ campaigning team]], which is part of its central office <ref name=\"conservatives.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation|title=Party Structure and Organisation|website=Conservatives.com|accessdate=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230159/https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\nHowever, it also delegates local responsibility to Conservative associations in the area, usually to a team of Conservative activists and volunteers <ref name=\"conservatives.com\"/> in that area, but campaigns are still deployed from and thus managed by [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|CCHQ]]\nNational campaigning sometimes occurs in-house by volunteers and staff at [[CCHQ]] in [[Westminster]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/calling|title=Philip May's Calling Community|website=Conservatives.com|accessdate=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102073000/https://www.conservatives.com/calling|archive-date=2 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[CCHQ]] maintains responsibility overall for campaigning in the Conservative Party, and targeting voters <ref>[https://www.conservativehome.com/majority_conservatism/2017/09/our-cchq-election-audit-the-rusty-machine-part-two-how-and-why-the-ground-campaign-failed.html Our CCHQ election audit: the rusty machine, part two.

In 1958, I-84 was co-signed with Route 15 north and east of East Hartford, Connecticut, into Massachusetts.\n\nIn late 1968, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) approved a new Interstate connection from Hartford to Providence, which was to become part of a rerouted I-84. As a result, the existing section of I-84 from Manchester, Connecticut, to I-90 (overlapping Route 15) was redesignated [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)#I-86 relation|I-86]].\n\nShortly thereafter, MassDPW embarked on a reconstruction of its portion of the highway with new and reconstructed carriageways providing three {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} lanes and standard shoulders. Both carriageways were separated by a wide, forested variable median. New bridges, interchanges and weigh stations were erected along the route. The $20 million reconstruction project was completed in 1973. (Similar improvements in Connecticut were not completed until the 1980s.)\n\nOn October 1, 1980, the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] decided to truncate Route 15 back to I-84 exit 57 (where it ends today), eliminating the overlap with I-86. Simultaneously, Massachusetts eliminated the overlap by decommissioning its Route 15 entirely.\n\n===Redesignation===\nWhen the planned portion of I-84 toward Providence ran into opposition in Rhode Island and was cancelled in 1983, I-86 was officially reverted to I-84.  The I-86 numbering was officially deleted on December 12, 1984.

In 1958, I-84 was co-signed with Route 15 north and east of East Hartford, Connecticut, into Massachusetts.\n\nIn late 1968, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) approved a new Interstate connection from Hartford to Providence, which was to become part of a rerouted I-84. As a result, the existing section of I-84 from Manchester, Connecticut, to I-90 (overlapping Route 15) was redesignated [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)#I-86 relation|I-86]].\n\nShortly thereafter, MassDPW embarked on a reconstruction of its portion of the highway with new and reconstructed carriageways providing three {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} lanes and standard shoulders. Both carriageways were separated by a wide, forested variable median. New bridges, interchanges and weigh stations were erected along the route. The $20 million reconstruction project was completed in 1973. (Similar improvements in Connecticut were not completed until the 1980s.)\n\nOn October 1, 1980, the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] decided to truncate Route 15 back to I-84 exit 57 (where it ends today), eliminating the overlap with I-86. Simultaneously, Massachusetts eliminated the overlap by decommissioning its Route 15 entirely.\n\n===Redesignation===\nWhen the planned portion of I-84 toward Providence ran into opposition in Rhode Island and was cancelled in 1983, I-86 was officially reverted to I-84.  The I-86 numbering was officially deleted on December 12, 1984. Plans to connect I-84 along the present day [[Interstate 384|I-384]]/[[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] corridor from Hartford to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] were scuttled for environmental reasons.

The turnpike begins at the New York state line in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]], linking with the Berkshire Connector portion of the [[New York State Thruway]]. Spanning {{convert|138|mi|km}} along an east\u2013west axis, it is entirely [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with the portion of [[Interstate 90]] (I-90) that lies within the state. The turnpike is the longest [[List of Interstate Highways in Massachusetts|Interstate Highway in Massachusetts]], while I-90 in full (which begins nationally in [[Seattle]], Washington) is the longest [[List of Interstate Highways|Interstate Highway in the United States]].\n\nThe turnpike opened in 1957, and it was designated as part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1959. The original western terminus of the turnpike was located at [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]] in West Stockbridge before I-90 had been completed in New York state. The turnpike intersects with several Interstate Highways as it traverses the state, including [[Interstate 91|I-91]] in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]]; [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]] in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]]; [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|I-84]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]]; the junction of [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] and [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] in [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]]; and [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]]. The turnpike originally ended at [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]; it was extended to [[Allston]] in 1964, and to the [[Central Artery]] (designated as [[Interstate 93|I-93]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US 1]], and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]]) in [[Downtown Boston]] in 1965. The \"[[Big Dig]]\" megaproject provided for the construction of the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], which has carried the turnpike to its eastern terminus at [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] beyond [[Logan International Airport]] since 2003. As an Interstate Highway, the turnpike is supplemented by [[Interstate 190 (Massachusetts)|I-190]] and I-290 as [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstate Highways]].\n\nThe turnpike was maintained by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority until the department was replaced by the Highway Division of MassDOT in 2009. The implementation and removal of tolls in some stretches of the turnpike have been controversial; travel between most, but not all, exits requires payment.

The original section of the expressway would have connected the then-proposed \"[[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]]\" in [[Boston]] westward to [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], with connections to [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|US 20]] and [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]] for outbound traffic. Later extensions of the expressway would continue westward to and through [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. Plans for the original expressway included the \"Springfield Bypass\" of US 20 around the [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] area. Part of this bypass, and the eventual turnpike, used the grading from the never-opened [[Hampden Railroad]]. Similarly, the \"West Stockbridge Bypass\" rerouted [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]] from [[Massachusetts Route 183|Route 183]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]] west to Route 102 east by the New York state line in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]]; the latter was built before the turnpike itself.\n\nThe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority was created in 1952 by a special act (1952 Acts and Resolves chapter 354; 1952 Senate Doc. 1) of the Massachusetts General Court (legislature)) upon the recommendation of Governor Dever and his Commissioner of Public Works, William F. Callahan. The enabling act was modeled upon that of the Mystic River Bridge Authority (1946 Acts and Resolves chapter 562), but several changes were made that would prove of great importance fifty years later. Callahan served as chairman of the Authority until his death in April 1964.\n\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxVNa6PMHX0 Building the Massachusetts Turnpike], documentary by Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, 1957}}\nConstruction began in 1955, and the whole four-lane road from Route 102 at the state line to [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] (also [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]) opened on May 15, 1957.\n\n===Expansion into Boston===\n[[File:NYCRR Headlights Cover 196502XX.png|thumb|right|An aerial photograph of the Boston Extension in the [[New York Central Railroad]] employee magazine ''Headlights'', February 1965]]\n\nEarly considerations for the [[Interstate Highway System]] included routing the transcontinental [[Interstate 90]] along [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] within Massachusetts, although this alignment in the northern part of the state was too costly. Ultimately, the turnpike in the southern part of the state was approved for Interstate designation, and became concurrent with I-90 in 1959. The [[New York State Thruway#Berkshire Connector|Berkshire Connector]] opened on May 26, 1959, connecting the west end to the [[New York State Thruway]] mainline south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Prior to its opening, traffic used [[New York State Route 22|NY Route 22]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. At the Massachusetts/New York state line, one can see where the Turnpike made an abrupt right turn before terminating at Route 102 before the late-May 1959 connection into New York State, as the old pavement still exists for Turnpike Authority and State Police vehicles to access this remote stretch of highway.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=42.347834,-73.41181&sll=42.348427,-73.416138&sspn=0.00915,0.027852&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=42.348284,-73.41176&spn=0.00915,0.019677&z=18 |title = View }}</ref>\n\nAfter political and legal battles related to the Boston Extension inside Route 128, construction began on March 5, 1962, with the chosen alignment running next to the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] and reducing that line from four to two tracks. In September 1964 the part from Route 128 east to exit 18 ([[Allston (MA)|Allston]]) opened, and the rest was finished on February 18, 1965, taking it to the [[Central Artery]].

Part of this was the elimination of the Turnpike Authority. Romney wanted to fold the Turnpike into MassHighway, the state highway department, operated under the Executive Office of Transportation. A first step to this was to replace the Chairman of the Board, [[Matthew J. Amorello]] with someone loyal to the Governor. The Governor has the power to appoint members to the board, but the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] (SJC) advised in an [[advisory opinion]] that \"nothing in G. L. c. 81A explicitly provides for the removal and reassignment of the chairperson to the position of \"member.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=15320&sid=120 |title = Answer of the justices to the governor. |accessdate = July 2, 2007 |date = June 29, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ma-appellatecourts.org/display_docket.php?dno=SJC-09461 |title = REQUEST FOR ADVISORY OPINION, A-108 SJC-09461 |accessdate = July 2, 2007 |date = June 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nRomney put pressure on Amorello to step down.

|accessdate = June 19, 2017 }}</ref>) is a [[toll road|toll highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Massachusetts]] that is maintained by the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] (MassDOT). The turnpike begins at the New York state line in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]], linking with the Berkshire Connector portion of the [[New York State Thruway]]. Spanning {{convert|138|mi|km}} along an east\u2013west axis, it is entirely [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with the portion of [[Interstate 90]] (I-90) that lies within the state. The turnpike is the longest [[List of Interstate Highways in Massachusetts|Interstate Highway in Massachusetts]], while I-90 in full (which begins nationally in [[Seattle]], Washington) is the longest [[List of Interstate Highways|Interstate Highway in the United States]].\n\nThe turnpike opened in 1957, and it was designated as part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1959. The original western terminus of the turnpike was located at [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]] in West Stockbridge before I-90 had been completed in New York state. The turnpike intersects with several Interstate Highways as it traverses the state, including [[Interstate 91|I-91]] in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]]; [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]] in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]]; [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|I-84]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]]; the junction of [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] and [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] in [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]]; and [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]]. The turnpike originally ended at [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]; it was extended to [[Allston]] in 1964, and to the [[Central Artery]] (designated as [[Interstate 93|I-93]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US 1]], and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]]) in [[Downtown Boston]] in 1965. The \"[[Big Dig]]\" megaproject provided for the construction of the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], which has carried the turnpike to its eastern terminus at [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] beyond [[Logan International Airport]] since 2003. As an Interstate Highway, the turnpike is supplemented by [[Interstate 190 (Massachusetts)|I-190]] and I-290 as [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstate Highways]].\n\nThe turnpike was maintained by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority until the department was replaced by the Highway Division of MassDOT in 2009. The implementation and removal of tolls in some stretches of the turnpike have been controversial; travel between most, but not all, exits requires payment. The [[Fast Lane (E-ZPass)|Fast Lane]] electronic toll collection system was introduced alongside cash payment in 1998; it was later folded into the [[E-ZPass]] branding in 2012.

The original section of the expressway would have connected the then-proposed \"[[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]]\" in [[Boston]] westward to [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], with connections to [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|US 20]] and [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]] for outbound traffic. Later extensions of the expressway would continue westward to and through [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. Plans for the original expressway included the \"Springfield Bypass\" of US 20 around the [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] area. Part of this bypass, and the eventual turnpike, used the grading from the never-opened [[Hampden Railroad]]. Similarly, the \"West Stockbridge Bypass\" rerouted [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]] from [[Massachusetts Route 183|Route 183]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]] west to Route 102 east by the New York state line in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]]; the latter was built before the turnpike itself.\n\nThe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority was created in 1952 by a special act (1952 Acts and Resolves chapter 354; 1952 Senate Doc. 1) of the Massachusetts General Court (legislature)) upon the recommendation of Governor Dever and his Commissioner of Public Works, William F. Callahan. The enabling act was modeled upon that of the Mystic River Bridge Authority (1946 Acts and Resolves chapter 562), but several changes were made that would prove of great importance fifty years later. Callahan served as chairman of the Authority until his death in April 1964.\n\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxVNa6PMHX0 Building the Massachusetts Turnpike], documentary by Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, 1957}}\nConstruction began in 1955, and the whole four-lane road from Route 102 at the state line to [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] (also [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]) opened on May 15, 1957.\n\n===Expansion into Boston===\n[[File:NYCRR Headlights Cover 196502XX.png|thumb|right|An aerial photograph of the Boston Extension in the [[New York Central Railroad]] employee magazine ''Headlights'', February 1965]]\n\nEarly considerations for the [[Interstate Highway System]] included routing the transcontinental [[Interstate 90]] along [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] within Massachusetts, although this alignment in the northern part of the state was too costly. Ultimately, the turnpike in the southern part of the state was approved for Interstate designation, and became concurrent with I-90 in 1959. The [[New York State Thruway#Berkshire Connector|Berkshire Connector]] opened on May 26, 1959, connecting the west end to the [[New York State Thruway]] mainline south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Prior to its opening, traffic used [[New York State Route 22|NY Route 22]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. At the Massachusetts/New York state line, one can see where the Turnpike made an abrupt right turn before terminating at Route 102 before the late-May 1959 connection into New York State, as the old pavement still exists for Turnpike Authority and State Police vehicles to access this remote stretch of highway.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=42.347834,-73.41181&sll=42.348427,-73.416138&sspn=0.00915,0.027852&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=42.348284,-73.41176&spn=0.00915,0.019677&z=18 |title = View }}</ref>\n\nAfter political and legal battles related to the Boston Extension inside Route 128, construction began on March 5, 1962, with the chosen alignment running next to the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] and reducing that line from four to two tracks.

Part of this was the elimination of the Turnpike Authority. Romney wanted to fold the Turnpike into MassHighway, the state highway department, operated under the Executive Office of Transportation. A first step to this was to replace the Chairman of the Board, [[Matthew J. Amorello]] with someone loyal to the Governor. The Governor has the power to appoint members to the board, but the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] (SJC) advised in an [[advisory opinion]] that \"nothing in G. L. c. 81A explicitly provides for the removal and reassignment of the chairperson to the position of \"member.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=15320&sid=120 |title = Answer of the justices to the governor. |accessdate = July 2, 2007 |date = June 29, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ma-appellatecourts.org/display_docket.php?dno=SJC-09461 |title = REQUEST FOR ADVISORY OPINION, A-108 SJC-09461 |accessdate = July 2, 2007 |date = June 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nRomney put pressure on Amorello to step down.

The highway runs {{convert|60.66|mi|km}} from the [[Connecticut]] state line in [[Monson, Massachusetts|Monson]], where the highway continues as [[Connecticut Route 32]], north to the [[New Hampshire]] state line in [[Royalston, Massachusetts|Royalston]], where the highway continues as [[New Hampshire Route 32]] (NH 32). Route 32 connects several towns on the eastern edge of [[Western Massachusetts]]. The highway serves [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]] in eastern [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]], [[Ware, Massachusetts|Ware]] in eastern [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]], and [[Barre, Massachusetts|Barre]] and [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]] in northwestern [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]]. Route 32 intersects major east&ndash;west routes including [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]] (US 20) and the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] in Palmer, [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]] in Ware, and [[U.S. Route 202 in Massachusetts|US 202]] and [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in Athol. The highway has an [[alternate route]], [[#Auxiliary route|Route 32A]], through [[Hardwick, Massachusetts|Hardwick]] and [[Petersham, Massachusetts|Petersham]].\n\n==Route description==\nRoute 32 begins at the Connecticut state line in the town of Monson in southeastern Hampden County, from which the highway continues south as Connecticut Route 32 toward [[Stafford Springs, Connecticut|Stafford Springs]]. The highway heads north as two-lane Stafford Road and immediately has an oblique grade crossing of the [[New England Central Railroad]]. Route 32 crosses the watershed divide between the Middle River and Chicopee Brook. The highway follows the rail line and intersects it south of South Monson, where the highway becomes named Main Street, and crosses over the railroad in Monson. Route 32 becomes Palmer Lower Road between the latter village and North Monson, where the highway crosses over the rail line and Chicopee Brook. The highway crosses the [[Quaboag River]], a tributary of the [[Chicopee River]], just east of the mouth of Chicopee Brook and enters the town of Palmer as Main Street. Route 32 turns north onto Stone Street, crosses over [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Boston Subdivision]] rail line, and intersects US 20 (Park Street).\n\nRoute 32 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] west with US 20 along Park Street to downtown Palmer, where US 20 turns south onto Thorndike Street and Route 32 turns north. The highway intersects the connector from [[Interstate 90 in Massachusetts|Interstate 90]] (Massachusetts Turnpike) and heads northeast along Ware Street through Palmer Center to the town of Ware in Hampshire County. Shortly after entering the town, Route 32 passes under the [[Massachusetts Central Railroad]] and crosses the [[Ware River]]. The highway follows West Street to the center of town, where the highway intersects and joins Route 9 on Main Street. The highways cross the river, pass under the railroad, and leave town on East Street. The routes diverge just west of the Hampshire&ndash;Worcester county line, with Route 9 continuing east into [[West Brookfield, Massachusetts|West Brookfield]] and Route 32 turning north onto Gilbertville Road. The highway crosses back and forth between Ware and the Worcester County towns of West Brookfield and [[New Braintree, Massachusetts|New Braintree]] as it parallels the river and rail line north.\n\n[[File:New England Route 32 northbound entering Athol MA.jpg|thumb|left|Northbound Route 32 entering Athol]]\nRoute 32 enters Worcester County for good and enters the town of Hardwick just south of [[Gilbertville, Massachusetts|Gilbertville]], where the highway intersects the Massachusetts Central Railroad, crosses the Ware River, and meets the southern end of Route 32A (Hardwick Road). Route 32 exits the village on Church Street and continues northeast parallel to the rail line and river on Lower Road. The highway enters the town of Barre on Wheelwright Road. The route crosses the river and meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 67|Route 67]] at its turn onto Main Street in the village of South Barre. Route 32 turns north again onto Barre Road and crosses the Ware River for the last time. The highway follows the Prince River to the town center of Barre, where the highway begins to run concurrently with [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]] (Worcester Road) and meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]] (Mechanic Street) at the Barre Common. Route 32 and Route 122 head west out of town on West Street, then veer north into Petersham, where they follow Barre Road. In the town center, Route 32 turns north onto Main Street while Route 122 continues on New Salem Road. The intersection serves as the northern terminus of Route 32A, which heads west concurrently with Route 122 then turns south on Hardwick Road west of the town center.\n\nRoute 32 meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 101|Route 101]] (Popple Camp Road) then has a [[partial cloverleaf]] interchange with [[U.S. Route 202 in Massachusetts|US 202]] and [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] shortly after entering the town of Athol on Petersham Road. The highway meets [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]] (Templeton Road) north of the interchange; the highways head toward downtown along Main Street. Once there, Route 32 turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue, crosses over the [[Pan Am Southern]] rail line and the [[Millers River]], then veers onto Silver Lake Street.

The highway heads north as two-lane Stafford Road and immediately has an oblique grade crossing of the [[New England Central Railroad]]. Route 32 crosses the watershed divide between the Middle River and Chicopee Brook. The highway follows the rail line and intersects it south of South Monson, where the highway becomes named Main Street, and crosses over the railroad in Monson. Route 32 becomes Palmer Lower Road between the latter village and North Monson, where the highway crosses over the rail line and Chicopee Brook. The highway crosses the [[Quaboag River]], a tributary of the [[Chicopee River]], just east of the mouth of Chicopee Brook and enters the town of Palmer as Main Street.

Shortly after entering the town, Route 32 passes under the [[Massachusetts Central Railroad]] and crosses the [[Ware River]]. The highway follows West Street to the center of town, where the highway intersects and joins Route 9 on Main Street. The highways cross the river, pass under the railroad, and leave town on East Street. The routes diverge just west of the Hampshire&ndash;Worcester county line, with Route 9 continuing east into [[West Brookfield, Massachusetts|West Brookfield]] and Route 32 turning north onto Gilbertville Road.

The route crosses the river and meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 67|Route 67]] at its turn onto Main Street in the village of South Barre. Route 32 turns north again onto Barre Road and crosses the Ware River for the last time. The highway follows the Prince River to the town center of Barre, where the highway begins to run concurrently with [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]] (Worcester Road) and meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]] (Mechanic Street) at the Barre Common. Route 32 and Route 122 head west out of town on West Street, then veer north into Petersham, where they follow Barre Road. In the town center, Route 32 turns north onto Main Street while Route 122 continues on New Salem Road. The intersection serves as the northern terminus of Route 32A, which heads west concurrently with Route 122 then turns south on Hardwick Road west of the town center.\n\nRoute 32 meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 101|Route 101]] (Popple Camp Road) then has a [[partial cloverleaf]] interchange with [[U.S. Route 202 in Massachusetts|US 202]] and [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] shortly after entering the town of Athol on Petersham Road. The highway meets [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]] (Templeton Road) north of the interchange; the highways head toward downtown along Main Street. Once there, Route 32 turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue, crosses over the [[Pan Am Southern]] rail line and the [[Millers River]], then veers onto Silver Lake Street. The highway follows the East Branch of the Tully River into the town of Royalston as Athol-Richmond Road.

Once in Ludlow, the road continues in a northeasterly direction.  It passes under the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], with access to that road via Exit 7.  It continues through town, passing south of the Springfield Reservoir before heading northward into Belchertown.  In Belchertown it shares a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 202]], which ends at [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]].  From there Route 21 makes its final short trek to its current terminus at [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]].\n\n==History== \nPrior to the completion of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]], Route 21 extended further northward.  It passed through the former town of [[Enfield, Massachusetts|Enfield]], then northward along the Swift River into [[Greenwich, Massachusetts|Greenwich]] and the northern end of [[Dana, Massachusetts|Dana]] before heading through the current town of [[Petersham, Massachusetts|Petersham]] and into [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]], where it terminated at what is now [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]].  The southern portion of the road (Old Enfield Road) is still accessible in Belchertown. The northern trunk follows Pleasant Street and New Sherborn Road in Athol, then the Monson Turnpike (Turnpike Road) in Petersham, where the road had an intersection with [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]].

MA-21 Started in Forest Park with an Intersection with [[U.S. Route 5]] near the South End Bridge, today [[Interstate 91]] now overtakes that intersection along with [[Massachusetts Route 83|MA-83]]. From there, the route went down Longhill Street until Sumner Avenue. Through the 6 way Intersection with Belmont Avenue and Dickinson Street, known to locals as the X. From there, the route went down Sumner until the intersection with Allen Street which then made a turn onto Cooley Street at the Sixteen Acres section of town. From there, Cooley Street continued north into Parker Street which took drivers to today's terminus, outside of Indian Orchard. There were plans to bypass this with the Springfield Bypass but it was never completed.

Along the way it intersects several major highways including [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Interstate 90]] (I-90) in [[Ludlow, Massachusetts|Ludlow]] and [[U.S. Route 202 in Massachusetts|US 202]] and [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]] in [[Belchertown, Massachusetts|Belchertown]].\n\n==Route description==\n[[Image:MA Route 21 northbound entering Ludlow, MA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Route 21 northbound entering Ludlow]]\nThe route begins at [[U.S. Route 20]] in the Indian Orchard section of Springfield.  It heads north, intersecting with [[Massachusetts Route 141|Route 141]] before crossing the [[Chicopee River]] into [[Ludlow, Massachusetts|Ludlow]].  Once in Ludlow, the road continues in a northeasterly direction.  It passes under the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], with access to that road via Exit 7.  It continues through town, passing south of the Springfield Reservoir before heading northward into Belchertown.  In Belchertown it shares a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 202]], which ends at [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]].  From there Route 21 makes its final short trek to its current terminus at [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]].\n\n==History== \nPrior to the completion of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]], Route 21 extended further northward.  It passed through the former town of [[Enfield, Massachusetts|Enfield]], then northward along the Swift River into [[Greenwich, Massachusetts|Greenwich]] and the northern end of [[Dana, Massachusetts|Dana]] before heading through the current town of [[Petersham, Massachusetts|Petersham]] and into [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]], where it terminated at what is now [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]].  The southern portion of the road (Old Enfield Road) is still accessible in Belchertown. The northern trunk follows Pleasant Street and New Sherborn Road in Athol, then the Monson Turnpike (Turnpike Road) in Petersham, where the road had an intersection with [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]].  Much of the route south of this intersection lies within the Quabbin Reservoir State Reservation.<ref>Tougias, Michael. ''Quabbin: A History and Explorers Guide''.

MA-21 Started in Forest Park with an Intersection with [[U.S. Route 5]] near the South End Bridge, today [[Interstate 91]] now overtakes that intersection along with [[Massachusetts Route 83|MA-83]]. From there, the route went down Longhill Street until Sumner Avenue. Through the 6 way Intersection with Belmont Avenue and Dickinson Street, known to locals as the X. From there, the route went down Sumner until the intersection with Allen Street which then made a turn onto Cooley Street at the Sixteen Acres section of town. From there, Cooley Street continued north into Parker Street which took drivers to today's terminus, outside of Indian Orchard. There were plans to bypass this with the Springfield Bypass but it was never completed. Only a small part where Summner and Allen Streets were made for the highway and a short highway bypass of Allen and Cooley Streets known as Bicentennial Highway was constructed to relieve passengers. It is unknown why it was shortened, speculation includes to ease the traffic through that section and to keep motorists away since that area of town was some of the most dangerous in the 1970s.
