Count Lucanor engages in conversation with his advisor Patronio, putting to him a problem (\"Some man has made me a proposition...\" or \"I fear that such and such person intends to...\") and asking for advice. Patronio responds always with the greatest humility, claiming not to wish to offer advice to so illustrious a person as the Count, but offering to tell him a story of which the Count's problem reminds him. (Thus, the stories are \"examples\" [''ejemplos''] of wise action.) At the end he advises the Count to do as the protagonist of his story did.\n\nEach chapter ends in more or less the same way, with slight variations on: \"And this pleased the Count greatly and he did just so, and found it well. And Don Joh\u00e1n (Juan) saw that this example was very good, and had it written in this book, and composed the following verses.\" A rhymed couplet closes, giving the moral of the story.\n\n==Treatments derived from ''Tales of Count Lucanor''==\nShakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' has the basic elements of Tale 44, \"Of what happened to a young Man on his Wedding Day\".<ref name=\"Mujer brava\">''[[wikisource:es:Conde Lucanor:Ejemplo 35|Exemplo XXXV\u00ba]] - De lo que contes\u00e7i\u00f3 a un man\u00e7ebo que cas\u00f3 con una muger muy fuerte et muy brava''</ref> <ref>  {{cite web | url = http://www.elfinspell.com/CountLucanor10.html#ch44 | title = Of what happened to a young Man on his Wedding Day | work = Count Lucanor; of the Fifty Pleasant Stories of Patronio | author = Don Juan Manuel | translator = James York, M.

Count Lucanor engages in conversation with his advisor Patronio, putting to him a problem (\"Some man has made me a proposition...\" or \"I fear that such and such person intends to...\") and asking for advice. Patronio responds always with the greatest humility, claiming not to wish to offer advice to so illustrious a person as the Count, but offering to tell him a story of which the Count's problem reminds him. (Thus, the stories are \"examples\" [''ejemplos''] of wise action.) At the end he advises the Count to do as the protagonist of his story did.\n\nEach chapter ends in more or less the same way, with slight variations on: \"And this pleased the Count greatly and he did just so, and found it well. And Don Joh\u00e1n (Juan) saw that this example was very good, and had it written in this book, and composed the following verses.\" A rhymed couplet closes, giving the moral of the story.\n\n==Treatments derived from ''Tales of Count Lucanor''==\nShakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' has the basic elements of Tale 44, \"Of what happened to a young Man on his Wedding Day\".<ref name=\"Mujer brava\">''[[wikisource:es:Conde Lucanor:Ejemplo 35|Exemplo XXXV\u00ba]] - De lo que contes\u00e7i\u00f3 a un man\u00e7ebo que cas\u00f3 con una muger muy fuerte et muy brava''</ref> <ref>  {{cite web | url = http://www.elfinspell.com/CountLucanor10.html#ch44 | title = Of what happened to a young Man on his Wedding Day | work = Count Lucanor; of the Fifty Pleasant Stories of Patronio | author = Don Juan Manuel | translator = James York, M.
