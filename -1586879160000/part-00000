The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefited some people but seriously disaffected others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=216}} and restrictions on political participation. The students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of speech]], although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Nathan|2001}} At the height of the protests, about 1&nbsp;million people assembled in the Square.{{sfn|D.

Thus, the common Chinese name for the crackdown is \"June Fourth Incident\" ({{zh|c=\u516d\u56db\u4e8b\u4ef6 |p=li\u00f9s\u00ec sh\u00ecji\u00e0n}}). The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. June Fourth refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as June Fourth Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516d\u56db\u8fd0\u52a8 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng}}) and '89 Democracy Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0 |p=b\u0101-ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n}}) are used to describe the event in its entirety.\n\nOutside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as June Fourth Massacre ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u5c60\u6bba |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec t\u00fash\u0101}}) and June Fourth Crackdown ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u93ae\u58d3 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec zh\u00e8ny\u0101}}). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4), Eight Squared (i.e. 8<sup>2</sup>=64){{sfn|China tightens information}} and 8964.<ref name=\"HKFP8964\">''[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ Bus driver in \u20188964\u2019 massacre memento suspended for 3 months] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622185220/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ |date=June 22, 2019 }}'', June 13, 2016, [[Chantal Yuen]], [[Hong Kong Free Press]].</ref>\n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}} As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a \"counterrevolutionary riot\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political storm\" and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase \"political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989\", which it uses to this day.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}}{{sfn|Day China trampled2009}}\n\nIn English, the terms Tiananmen Square Massacre, Tiananmen Square Protests or Tiananmen Square Crackdown are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence in Beijing did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square along a stretch of [[Chang'an Avenue]] only a few miles long, and especially near the [[Muxidi]] area.{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=283}} The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.{{sfn|Miles|2009}}\n\n==Background==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\nThe [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's originally diverse economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.\n\nTo run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the Communist Party in 1982, while [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], the head of government, in September 1980.\n\n===Challenges with reform===\nThe reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.\n\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.{{sfn|Naughton|2007| p=91}} The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. Party bureaucrats suddenly found themselves in charge of a burgeoning state regime over economic management and enormous incentives for [[arbitrage]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=120}} Discontent over corruption reached a fever pitch with the public, and many, particularly those in the intellectual community, began to believe that only democratic reform and rule of law could act as a panacea for the country's ills.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|Chapter 5: On the Eve of the 1989 Movement}}\n\nFollowing the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying and hoarding all over China.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but its impact was pronounced for much longer. Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}}\n\n===Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis===\nReformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=81}} Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=84}} The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=89}} Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" and the \"Lawn Salon\" (''C\u01ceod\u00ec Sh\u0101l\u00f3ng''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=137}} These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}}\n\nAt the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}} Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}}\n\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. However, both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===1986 student demonstrations===\n{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]] returned from a position at [[Princeton University]] and began a personal tour around universities in China; speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=64, 215}} The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}} In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}}\n\nInspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.{{sfn|Wang | 2006| pp=56\u201357}} While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\n\nGeneral secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987. Then the party began the \"Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign\", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.{{sfn|Spence | 1999 | p=685}} The Campaign stopped student protests and tightened the political environment, but Hu remained popular among progressives in the party, intellectuals, and students.{{sfn|D.

Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=147}} Small spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}} At 5&nbsp;pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\nStarting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (Seven Demands) for the government:\n# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.\n# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.\n# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.\n# Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.\n# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.\n# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.\n# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}}\n\nOn the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].\n\nOn April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=149}} Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.{{sfn|Walder | Gong | 1993 | pp=1\u20132}}\n\nHu's [[state funeral]] took place on April 22. On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=152\u201353}}{{sfn|Li|2010}}\n\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall of the People, but several students pressed forward. A few were allowed to cross the police line. Three of these students ([[Zhou Yongjun]], [[Guo Haifeng]] and [[Zhang Zhiyong]]) knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}{{efn| Analyst [[Richard Baum]] described their actions as \"...a mock-ceremonial remonstrance... presenting their scrolled-up demands on hands and knees in the stylized, obsequious manner of an imperial petition.\"{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=248}} Political scientist [[Lucian Pye]] similarly described the act as \"..in line with the classic Chinese tradition of aggrieved parties wailing before the Yamen door, of publicly dramatizing their unhappiness by petitioning officialdom... [they] sincerely believed that the officials would have to respond by meeting with them.\"{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=337}}&nbsp;}} Standing beside them, a fourth student ([[Wu'erkaixi]]) made a brief, emotional speech begging for Li Peng to come out and speak with them. The larger number of students still in the Square but outside the cordon were at times emotional, shouting demands or slogans and rushing toward police. Wu'erkaixi calmed the crowd down as they waited for the Premier to emerge. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}\n\nOn April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, in a meeting of around 40 students from 21 universities, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. The Union then called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=154}}\n\nOn April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009}} Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on April 23.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}}\n\n===Turning point: April 26 Editorial===\n{{main|April 26 Editorial|l1=26 April Editorial}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|footer=General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] (left) who pushed for dialogue with students and Premier [[Li Peng]] (right) who declared martial law and backed military action\n|width1=150\n|image1=Zhao Ziyang (1985).jpg\n|alt1=Zhao Ziyang\n|width2=166\n|image2=Lipeng.jpg\n|alt2=Li Peng\n}}\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}} On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\nOn April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled \"[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]].\" The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.{{sfn|April 26 Editorial|1995}} The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]\u2014an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as \"patriotic\" under Deng's leadership.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===April 27 demonstrations===\n{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}\n[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|upright|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]\nOrganized by the Union on April 27, some 50,000\u2013100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption, anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\".{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an April 26 editorial.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}}\n\nThe stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=157}}\n\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=156}} Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on May 3\u20134. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}} The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on May 4 to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On May 4, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=159}}\n\n==Protests escalate==\n===Preparing for dialogue===\n{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}\nThe leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}}\n\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal delegation. There was some friction, however, as the Union leaders were reluctant to let the delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=161}} The movement was slowed by a change to a more deliberate approach, fractured by internal discord, and increasingly diluted by declining engagement from the student body at large. In this context, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, desired to regain momentum. They also distrusted the government's offers of 'dialogue', dismissing them as merely a ploy designed to play for time and pacify the students. To break from the moderate and incremental approach now adopted by other major student leaders, these few began calling for a return to more confrontational measures. They settled on a plan of mobilizing students for a hunger strike on that would begin May 13.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=161\u201362}} Early attempts to mobilize others to join them met with only modest success until [[Chai Ling]] made an emotional appeal on the night before the strike was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=163}}\n\n===Hunger strikes begin===\n{{main|The Students' Hunger Strike of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests}}\n[[File:\u84b2\u5fd7\u5f3719890510.jpg|thumb|upright|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at Tiananmen, taken on May 10, 1989. The Chinese words written on the paper say, \"We want freedom of newspapers, freedom of associations, also to support the '[[World Economic Herald]]', and support those just journalists.\"]]\n\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009 |pp=612\u201314}} By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}}\n\nInspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.<ref>''[[Amnesty International]]'', August 30, 1989. ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989'', p.19</ref>\n\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping ordered the Square to be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=164}} Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not\u2014in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}}\n\n===Mikhail Gorbachev visit===\n{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}} However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}} While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=169}} Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.{{efn|Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.}}\n\nThe students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (\"loss of [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]\"){{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=300}} for the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=170}} The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. Zhao's defense against this accusation was that privately informing world leaders that Deng was the true center of power was standard operating procedure; Li Peng had made nearly identical private statements to US president [[George H.W. Bush]] in February 1989.{{sfn|Sarotte|2012|p=165}} Nevertheless, the statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}}\n\n===Gathering momentum===\nThe hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17\u201318 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\n\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}}\n\nThe situation seemed intractable, so the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Matters came to a head on May 17, during a [[Politburo Standing Committee]] meeting at Deng's residence.{{sfn|Li|2010}} At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Li Peng, [[Yao Yilin]] and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech to the [[Asian Development Bank]] on 4 May, Zhao exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}}{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|pp=25\u201334}}{{sfn|MacFarquhar|2011|p=443}} Deng warned that \"there is no way to back down now without the situation spiraling out of control\", and so \"the decision is to move troops into Beijing to declare [[martial law]]\"{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|p=28}} as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of \"[[bourgeois liberalism]]\" advocates who were pulling the strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions.{{sfn|Miles | 1997}} For the rest of his life, Zhao Ziyang maintained that the decision was ultimately in Deng's hands: among the five PSC members present at the meeting, he and [[Hu Qili]] opposed the imposition of martial law, Li Peng and Yao Yilin firmly supported it, and [[Qiao Shi]] remained carefully neutral and noncommittal. Deng appointed the latter three to carry out the decision.{{sfn|Z. Zhao |2009|p=28\u201330}}\n\n{{quote box|width=40%|align=left|quote=Students, we came too late. We are sorry.

At the meeting, Zhao announced that he was ready to \"take leave\", citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} The elders in attendance at the meeting, [[Bo Yibo]] and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Zhao did not consider the inconclusive PSC vote to have legally binding implications on martial law;{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=x}} Yang Shangkun, in his capacity as [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], went on to mobilize the military to move into the capital.\n\nLi Peng [[Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement#May 18: meeting with Li Peng|met with students]] for the first time on May 18 in an attempt to placate public concern over the hunger strike.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}} During the talks, student leaders again demanded that the government rescind the April 26 Editorial and affirm the student movement as \"patriotic\". Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending hunger strikers to hospital. The discussions were confrontational and yielded little substantive progress or dialogue,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=41}} but gained student leaders prominent airtime on national television.{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=343}} By this point, those calling for the overthrow of the party and of Li Peng and Deng personally became prominent both in Beijing and in other cities.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=42-43}} Slogans targeted Deng personally, for instance calling him the \"power behind the throne.\"{{sfn|Wu|2011|p=May 19}}\n\n[[File:Wen Jiabao (Cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wen Jiabao]], then chief of the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|Party's General Office]], accompanied Zhao Ziyang to meet with students in the Square, surviving the political purge of the party's liberals and later serving as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] from 2003 to 2013.]]\n\nIn the early morning of 19 May, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his political [[swan song]]. He was accompanied by [[Wen Jiabao]]. Li Peng also went to the Square, but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50{{nbsp}}am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging the students to end the hunger strike.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}} He told the students that they were still young and urged them to stay healthy and not to sacrifice themselves without due concern for their futures. Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}}\n\nOn 19 May, the PSC met with military leaders and party elders. Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.\n\n===Surveillance of protesters===\nStudent leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities, traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square and the restaurants in the nearby area and where students gathered were wiretapped.<ref name=\"4-corners-tremble-and-obey\">{{Cite episode|episode-link='https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/tremble-and-obey/11174758' |series=Four Coners|title=Tremble & Obey|time=00:24:50}}</ref> This surveillance led to the identification, capture and punishment of participants of the protest.<ref name=\"surveillance-politics\">{{Cite book|first=Richard Victor Ericson|last=Kevin D.

In many cases, these were supported by the universities' own party cells. [[Jiang Zemin]], then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding' as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by [[Yan Jiaqi]], which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page.{{sfn|Wright | 1990 | pp=121\u201332}} Jiang then suspended lead editor [[Qin Benli]].

Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces retreated to bases outside the city.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}}{{sfn|Secretary of State's}} While the army's withdrawal was initially seen as 'turning the tide' in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization took place across the country for a final assault.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=80\u201382}}\n\nAt the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. [[Hou Dejian]] suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Meanwhile, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and consequences, and advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by 'hardliner' student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a \"well-organized and premeditated plot.\"{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===June 1\u20133===\nOn June 1, [[Li Peng]] issued a report titled \"On the True Nature of the Turmoil\", which was circulated to every member of the Politburo.{{sfn|L.

Zhang |2001|p=349}}\n\nOn June 2, the movement saw an increase in action and protest, solidifying the CPC's decision that it was time to act. Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the Square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles.{{sfn|L.

By 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, news of bloodshed to the west and south of the city began trickling into the Square, often told by witnesses drenched in blood. At midnight, the students' loudspeaker announced news that a student had been killed on West Chang'an Avenue, near the Military Museum and a somber mood settled on the Square. Li Lu, the deputy commander of the student headquarters, urged students to remain united in defending the Square through non-violent means. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed.

At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of concrete at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}\n\nPressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings.

Many students, who learned of the talks for the first time, reacted angrily and accused him of cowardice.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}}\n\nThe soldiers stopped about ten meters from the students. The first row of troops took aim with machine guns from the prone position. Behind them soldiers [[Squatting position|squatted]] and stood with assault rifles.

The protests were also a blow to the separation of powers model established following the Cultural Revolution, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a [[figurehead|symbolic position]], while the real centres of power, i.e., the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.\n\nWhen President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. By 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission chairman and President were all consolidated into the same person, a practice that has been continued since.\n\nIn 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.{{sfn|MacKinnon | 1999}} After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe restrictions on society were loosened only a few years after the protests, especially after Deng's 1992 \"southern tour\".{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=195}} Privately run print media again flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially run satellite TV stations sprung up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.{{sfn|Kurlantzick | 2003 | p=50}} The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=50}} This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}} To reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to \"fight against cults\" such as [[Falun Gong]], playing sects off each other.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}}\n\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favour.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=201}} This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}}\n\n===Economic impact===\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many analysts downgraded their outlook of China's economic future.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance to the [[World Trade Organization]], which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4&nbsp;billion in 1988 to $700&nbsp;million in 1990.{{sfn|Foot|2000}} Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;{{sfn|Thakur | Burton | Srivastava | 1997 | pp=404\u201305}} China's credit rating was lowered;{{sfn|Foot|2000}} tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2&nbsp;billion to US$1.8&nbsp;billion; foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled. There was a rise in defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline.{{sfn|Kelley | Shenkar | 1993 | pp=120\u201322}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, the government sought again to centralize control over the economy,{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} though the changes were short-lived.  Sensing that conservative policies had again taken a foothold within the party, Deng, now retired from all of his official positions, launched his \"southern tour\" in 1992, visiting various cities in the country's most prosperous regions while advocating for further economic reforms.{{sfn|Wu | 2015}} Partly in response to Deng, by the mid-1990s, the country was again pursuing market liberalization on a scale even greater than those seen in the initial stages of the reform in the 1980s. Although political liberals were purged within the party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} The economic shocks caused by the events of 1989, in retrospect, had only a minor and temporary effect on China's economic growth. Indeed, with many previously aggrieved groups now regarding political opening as a lost cause, more energy was spent on economic activities. The economy would quickly regain momentum into the 1990s.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}}\n\n===Hong Kong===\n[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on the 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.\n\nThere have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. The [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.{{sfn|Kam|2016}}\n\nThe events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese.\" The events of June 4 are seen as representative of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism and is often invoked by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, especially in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|pp=152, 155}}\n\n===Impact on China's national image===\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=424}} From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to a benign global economic and military partner.{{sfn|Cabestan | 2010 |p= 194}}\n\nIn the 1990s, China attempted to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions to secure investment for continued economic reforms.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 19}} The government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993 and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} Whereas China had been a member of only 30 international organizations in 1986, it was a member of over 50 by 1997.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=198}} China also sought to diversify its external partnerships, establishing good diplomatic relations with post-Soviet Russia,{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} and welcoming Taiwanese business in lieu of Western investment.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] and established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea and others in 1992.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} While China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a net provider of aid.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\nFurthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=55}} Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of focusing on business interests. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have sometimes paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen in bilateral meetings, but the substance of discussions revolved around business and trade interests.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\n===European Union and United States arms embargo===\n{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China\u2013European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schr\u00f6der's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\n\nIn addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.{{sfn|Japan Concerned}}\n\n==Contemporary issues==\n===Censorship in China===\n{{further|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{see also|Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Specific examples of internet censorship|l1=Internet censorship of the protest}}\nThe [[Communist Party of China]] forbids discussion of the Tiananmen Square protests{{sfn|Saiget |2009}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=Made taboo not forbidden}}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems|title=One App, Two Systems|at=figure 9|access-date=September 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010221114/https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=App censors this, but that doesn't mean it's forbidden, or even that this is because the Communist Party directly}} and has taken measures to block or censor related information.

[[mainland China]] as the '''June Fourth Incident''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u516d\u56db\u4e8b\u4ef6|p=li\u00f9s\u00ec sh\u00ecji\u00e0n}}, literally ''six-four incident''), were student-led [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] held in [[Tiananmen Square]] in Beijing during 1989. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the''' '89 Democracy Movement''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u904b|p=b\u0101ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n}}). The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared [[martial law]] and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing. In what became known as the '''Tiananmen Square Massacre''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u5929\u5b89\u9580\u5927\u5c60\u6bba|p=ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n d\u00e0 t\u00fash\u0101}}), [[People's Liberation Army at the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests|troops]] with [[assault rifle]]s and [[tank]]s fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.{{sfn|How Many Died|1990}}{{sfn|U.S. G.P.O.|p=445}}{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=154}}{{sfn|Kristof:Reassessing Casualties}}{{sfn|Secretary of State's}}{{sfn|Calls for Justice |2004}}\n\nSet off by the death of pro-reform Communist general secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] in April 1989, amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social changes in [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976\u201389)|post-Mao China]], the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefited some people but seriously disaffected others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=216}} and restrictions on political participation.

The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. June Fourth refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as June Fourth Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516d\u56db\u8fd0\u52a8 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng}}) and '89 Democracy Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0 |p=b\u0101-ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n}}) are used to describe the event in its entirety.\n\nOutside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as June Fourth Massacre ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u5c60\u6bba |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec t\u00fash\u0101}}) and June Fourth Crackdown ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u93ae\u58d3 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec zh\u00e8ny\u0101}}). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4), Eight Squared (i.e. 8<sup>2</sup>=64){{sfn|China tightens information}} and 8964.<ref name=\"HKFP8964\">''[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ Bus driver in \u20188964\u2019 massacre memento suspended for 3 months] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622185220/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ |date=June 22, 2019 }}'', June 13, 2016, [[Chantal Yuen]], [[Hong Kong Free Press]].</ref>\n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}} As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a \"counterrevolutionary riot\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political storm\" and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase \"political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989\", which it uses to this day.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}}{{sfn|Day China trampled2009}}\n\nIn English, the terms Tiananmen Square Massacre, Tiananmen Square Protests or Tiananmen Square Crackdown are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence in Beijing did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square along a stretch of [[Chang'an Avenue]] only a few miles long, and especially near the [[Muxidi]] area.{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=283}} The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.{{sfn|Miles|2009}}\n\n==Background==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\nThe [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's originally diverse economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.\n\nTo run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the Communist Party in 1982, while [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], the head of government, in September 1980.\n\n===Challenges with reform===\nThe reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.\n\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.{{sfn|Naughton|2007| p=91}} The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. Party bureaucrats suddenly found themselves in charge of a burgeoning state regime over economic management and enormous incentives for [[arbitrage]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=120}} Discontent over corruption reached a fever pitch with the public, and many, particularly those in the intellectual community, began to believe that only democratic reform and rule of law could act as a panacea for the country's ills.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|Chapter 5: On the Eve of the 1989 Movement}}\n\nFollowing the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying and hoarding all over China.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but its impact was pronounced for much longer. Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}}\n\n===Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis===\nReformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=81}} Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=84}} The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=89}} Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" and the \"Lawn Salon\" (''C\u01ceod\u00ec Sh\u0101l\u00f3ng''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=137}} These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}}\n\nAt the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}} Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}}\n\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. However, both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===1986 student demonstrations===\n{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]] returned from a position at [[Princeton University]] and began a personal tour around universities in China; speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=64, 215}} The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}} In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}}\n\nInspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.{{sfn|Wang | 2006| pp=56\u201357}} While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\n\nGeneral secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987. Then the party began the \"Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign\", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.{{sfn|Spence | 1999 | p=685}} The Campaign stopped student protests and tightened the political environment, but Hu remained popular among progressives in the party, intellectuals, and students.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Protest development==\n===Death of Hu Yaobang===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ Student leaders\n!scope=\"col\"|Name\n!scope=\"col\"|Origin and affiliation\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Chai Ling]]\n|[[Shandong]]; [[Beijing Normal University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wu'erkaixi]] (\u00d6rkesh)\n|[[Xinjiang]]; [[Beijing Normal University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]]\n|Beijing; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Feng Congde]]\n|[[Sichuan]]; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Shen Tong]]\n|Beijing; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wang Youcai]]\n|[[Zhejiang]]; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Li Lu]]\n|[[Hebei]]; [[Nanjing University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Zhou Yongjun]]\n|[[China University of Political Science and Law]]\n|}\n\nWhen [[Hu Yaobang]] suddenly died of a heart attack on April 15, 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation.{{sfn|Calhoun}} Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers.{{sfn|Pan | 2008 | p=274}} In university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for a revival of Hu's legacy. Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=147}} Small spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}} At 5&nbsp;pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\nStarting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (Seven Demands) for the government:\n# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.\n# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.\n# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.\n# Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.\n# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.\n# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.\n# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}}\n\nOn the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].\n\nOn April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=149}} Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.{{sfn|Walder | Gong | 1993 | pp=1\u20132}}\n\nHu's [[state funeral]] took place on April 22. On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=152\u201353}}{{sfn|Li|2010}}\n\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall of the People, but several students pressed forward. A few were allowed to cross the police line. Three of these students ([[Zhou Yongjun]], [[Guo Haifeng]] and [[Zhang Zhiyong]]) knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}{{efn| Analyst [[Richard Baum]] described their actions as \"...a mock-ceremonial remonstrance... presenting their scrolled-up demands on hands and knees in the stylized, obsequious manner of an imperial petition.\"{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=248}} Political scientist [[Lucian Pye]] similarly described the act as \"..in line with the classic Chinese tradition of aggrieved parties wailing before the Yamen door, of publicly dramatizing their unhappiness by petitioning officialdom... [they] sincerely believed that the officials would have to respond by meeting with them.\"{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=337}}&nbsp;}} Standing beside them, a fourth student ([[Wu'erkaixi]]) made a brief, emotional speech begging for Li Peng to come out and speak with them. The larger number of students still in the Square but outside the cordon were at times emotional, shouting demands or slogans and rushing toward police. Wu'erkaixi calmed the crowd down as they waited for the Premier to emerge. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}\n\nOn April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, in a meeting of around 40 students from 21 universities, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. The Union then called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=154}}\n\nOn April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009}} Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on April 23.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}}\n\n===Turning point: April 26 Editorial===\n{{main|April 26 Editorial|l1=26 April Editorial}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|footer=General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] (left) who pushed for dialogue with students and Premier [[Li Peng]] (right) who declared martial law and backed military action\n|width1=150\n|image1=Zhao Ziyang (1985).jpg\n|alt1=Zhao Ziyang\n|width2=166\n|image2=Lipeng.jpg\n|alt2=Li Peng\n}}\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}} On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\nOn April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled \"[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]].\" The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.{{sfn|April 26 Editorial|1995}} The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]\u2014an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as \"patriotic\" under Deng's leadership.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===April 27 demonstrations===\n{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}\n[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|upright|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]\nOrganized by the Union on April 27, some 50,000\u2013100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption, anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\".{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an April 26 editorial.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}}\n\nThe stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=157}}\n\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=156}} Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on May 3\u20134. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}} The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on May 4 to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On May 4, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=159}}\n\n==Protests escalate==\n===Preparing for dialogue===\n{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}\nThe leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}}\n\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal delegation. There was some friction, however, as the Union leaders were reluctant to let the delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=161}} The movement was slowed by a change to a more deliberate approach, fractured by internal discord, and increasingly diluted by declining engagement from the student body at large. In this context, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, desired to regain momentum. They also distrusted the government's offers of 'dialogue', dismissing them as merely a ploy designed to play for time and pacify the students. To break from the moderate and incremental approach now adopted by other major student leaders, these few began calling for a return to more confrontational measures. They settled on a plan of mobilizing students for a hunger strike on that would begin May 13.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=161\u201362}} Early attempts to mobilize others to join them met with only modest success until [[Chai Ling]] made an emotional appeal on the night before the strike was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=163}}\n\n===Hunger strikes begin===\n{{main|The Students' Hunger Strike of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests}}\n[[File:\u84b2\u5fd7\u5f3719890510.jpg|thumb|upright|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at Tiananmen, taken on May 10, 1989. The Chinese words written on the paper say, \"We want freedom of newspapers, freedom of associations, also to support the '[[World Economic Herald]]', and support those just journalists.\"]]\n\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009 |pp=612\u201314}} By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}}\n\nInspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.<ref>''[[Amnesty International]]'', August 30, 1989. ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989'', p.19</ref>\n\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping ordered the Square to be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=164}} Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not\u2014in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}}\n\n===Mikhail Gorbachev visit===\n{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}} However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}} While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=169}} Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.{{efn|Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.}}\n\nThe students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (\"loss of [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]\"){{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=300}} for the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=170}} The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. Zhao's defense against this accusation was that privately informing world leaders that Deng was the true center of power was standard operating procedure; Li Peng had made nearly identical private statements to US president [[George H.W. Bush]] in February 1989.{{sfn|Sarotte|2012|p=165}} Nevertheless, the statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}}\n\n===Gathering momentum===\nThe hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17\u201318 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\n\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}}\n\nThe situation seemed intractable, so the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Matters came to a head on May 17, during a [[Politburo Standing Committee]] meeting at Deng's residence.{{sfn|Li|2010}} At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Li Peng, [[Yao Yilin]] and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech to the [[Asian Development Bank]] on 4 May, Zhao exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}}{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|pp=25\u201334}}{{sfn|MacFarquhar|2011|p=443}} Deng warned that \"there is no way to back down now without the situation spiraling out of control\", and so \"the decision is to move troops into Beijing to declare [[martial law]]\"{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|p=28}} as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of \"[[bourgeois liberalism]]\" advocates who were pulling the strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions.{{sfn|Miles | 1997}} For the rest of his life, Zhao Ziyang maintained that the decision was ultimately in Deng's hands: among the five PSC members present at the meeting, he and [[Hu Qili]] opposed the imposition of martial law, Li Peng and Yao Yilin firmly supported it, and [[Qiao Shi]] remained carefully neutral and noncommittal. Deng appointed the latter three to carry out the decision.{{sfn|Z. Zhao |2009|p=28\u201330}}\n\n{{quote box|width=40%|align=left|quote=Students, we came too late. We are sorry.

At the meeting, Zhao announced that he was ready to \"take leave\", citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} The elders in attendance at the meeting, [[Bo Yibo]] and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Zhao did not consider the inconclusive PSC vote to have legally binding implications on martial law;{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=x}} Yang Shangkun, in his capacity as [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], went on to mobilize the military to move into the capital.\n\nLi Peng [[Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement#May 18: meeting with Li Peng|met with students]] for the first time on May 18 in an attempt to placate public concern over the hunger strike.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}} During the talks, student leaders again demanded that the government rescind the April 26 Editorial and affirm the student movement as \"patriotic\". Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending hunger strikers to hospital. The discussions were confrontational and yielded little substantive progress or dialogue,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=41}} but gained student leaders prominent airtime on national television.{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=343}} By this point, those calling for the overthrow of the party and of Li Peng and Deng personally became prominent both in Beijing and in other cities.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=42-43}} Slogans targeted Deng personally, for instance calling him the \"power behind the throne.\"{{sfn|Wu|2011|p=May 19}}\n\n[[File:Wen Jiabao (Cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wen Jiabao]], then chief of the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|Party's General Office]], accompanied Zhao Ziyang to meet with students in the Square, surviving the political purge of the party's liberals and later serving as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] from 2003 to 2013.]]\n\nIn the early morning of 19 May, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his political [[swan song]]. He was accompanied by [[Wen Jiabao]]. Li Peng also went to the Square, but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50{{nbsp}}am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging the students to end the hunger strike.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}} He told the students that they were still young and urged them to stay healthy and not to sacrifice themselves without due concern for their futures. Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}}\n\nOn 19 May, the PSC met with military leaders and party elders. Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.\n\n===Surveillance of protesters===\nStudent leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities, traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square and the restaurants in the nearby area and where students gathered were wiretapped.<ref name=\"4-corners-tremble-and-obey\">{{Cite episode|episode-link='https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/tremble-and-obey/11174758' |series=Four Coners|title=Tremble & Obey|time=00:24:50}}</ref> This surveillance led to the identification, capture and punishment of participants of the protest.<ref name=\"surveillance-politics\">{{Cite book|first=Richard Victor Ericson|last=Kevin D.

In many cases, these were supported by the universities' own party cells. [[Jiang Zemin]], then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding' as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by [[Yan Jiaqi]], which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page.{{sfn|Wright | 1990 | pp=121\u201332}} Jiang then suspended lead editor [[Qin Benli]].

Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces retreated to bases outside the city.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}}{{sfn|Secretary of State's}} While the army's withdrawal was initially seen as 'turning the tide' in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization took place across the country for a final assault.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=80\u201382}}\n\nAt the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. [[Hou Dejian]] suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Meanwhile, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and consequences, and advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by 'hardliner' student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a \"well-organized and premeditated plot.\"{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===June 1\u20133===\nOn June 1, [[Li Peng]] issued a report titled \"On the True Nature of the Turmoil\", which was circulated to every member of the Politburo.{{sfn|L.

Zhang |2001|p=349}}\n\nOn June 2, the movement saw an increase in action and protest, solidifying the CPC's decision that it was time to act. Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the Square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles.{{sfn|L.

By 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, news of bloodshed to the west and south of the city began trickling into the Square, often told by witnesses drenched in blood. At midnight, the students' loudspeaker announced news that a student had been killed on West Chang'an Avenue, near the Military Museum and a somber mood settled on the Square. Li Lu, the deputy commander of the student headquarters, urged students to remain united in defending the Square through non-violent means. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed.

At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of concrete at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}\n\nPressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings.

Many students, who learned of the talks for the first time, reacted angrily and accused him of cowardice.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}}\n\nThe soldiers stopped about ten meters from the students. The first row of troops took aim with machine guns from the prone position. Behind them soldiers [[Squatting position|squatted]] and stood with assault rifles.

The protests were also a blow to the separation of powers model established following the Cultural Revolution, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a [[figurehead|symbolic position]], while the real centres of power, i.e., the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.\n\nWhen President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. By 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission chairman and President were all consolidated into the same person, a practice that has been continued since.\n\nIn 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.{{sfn|MacKinnon | 1999}} After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe restrictions on society were loosened only a few years after the protests, especially after Deng's 1992 \"southern tour\".{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=195}} Privately run print media again flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially run satellite TV stations sprung up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.{{sfn|Kurlantzick | 2003 | p=50}} The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=50}} This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}} To reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to \"fight against cults\" such as [[Falun Gong]], playing sects off each other.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}}\n\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favour.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=201}} This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}}\n\n===Economic impact===\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many analysts downgraded their outlook of China's economic future.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance to the [[World Trade Organization]], which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4&nbsp;billion in 1988 to $700&nbsp;million in 1990.{{sfn|Foot|2000}} Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;{{sfn|Thakur | Burton | Srivastava | 1997 | pp=404\u201305}} China's credit rating was lowered;{{sfn|Foot|2000}} tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2&nbsp;billion to US$1.8&nbsp;billion; foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled. There was a rise in defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline.{{sfn|Kelley | Shenkar | 1993 | pp=120\u201322}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, the government sought again to centralize control over the economy,{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} though the changes were short-lived.  Sensing that conservative policies had again taken a foothold within the party, Deng, now retired from all of his official positions, launched his \"southern tour\" in 1992, visiting various cities in the country's most prosperous regions while advocating for further economic reforms.{{sfn|Wu | 2015}} Partly in response to Deng, by the mid-1990s, the country was again pursuing market liberalization on a scale even greater than those seen in the initial stages of the reform in the 1980s. Although political liberals were purged within the party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} The economic shocks caused by the events of 1989, in retrospect, had only a minor and temporary effect on China's economic growth. Indeed, with many previously aggrieved groups now regarding political opening as a lost cause, more energy was spent on economic activities. The economy would quickly regain momentum into the 1990s.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}}\n\n===Hong Kong===\n[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on the 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.\n\nThere have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. The [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.{{sfn|Kam|2016}}\n\nThe events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese.\" The events of June 4 are seen as representative of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism and is often invoked by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, especially in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|pp=152, 155}}\n\n===Impact on China's national image===\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=424}} From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to a benign global economic and military partner.{{sfn|Cabestan | 2010 |p= 194}}\n\nIn the 1990s, China attempted to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions to secure investment for continued economic reforms.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 19}} The government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993 and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} Whereas China had been a member of only 30 international organizations in 1986, it was a member of over 50 by 1997.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=198}} China also sought to diversify its external partnerships, establishing good diplomatic relations with post-Soviet Russia,{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} and welcoming Taiwanese business in lieu of Western investment.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] and established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea and others in 1992.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} While China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a net provider of aid.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\nFurthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=55}} Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of focusing on business interests. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have sometimes paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen in bilateral meetings, but the substance of discussions revolved around business and trade interests.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\n===European Union and United States arms embargo===\n{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China\u2013European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schr\u00f6der's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\n\nIn addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.{{sfn|Japan Concerned}}\n\n==Contemporary issues==\n===Censorship in China===\n{{further|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{see also|Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Specific examples of internet censorship|l1=Internet censorship of the protest}}\nThe [[Communist Party of China]] forbids discussion of the Tiananmen Square protests{{sfn|Saiget |2009}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=Made taboo not forbidden}}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems|title=One App, Two Systems|at=figure 9|access-date=September 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010221114/https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=App censors this, but that doesn't mean it's forbidden, or even that this is because the Communist Party directly}} and has taken measures to block or censor related information.

{"title_page": "Contemporary society", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2013}}\n{{underlinked|date=October 2013}}\n{{Citation style|date=October 2013}}\n}}\n'''Contemporary society''', according to social and political scientists, is characterised by at least three fundamental directions:\n* '''increasing human interconnection''' through a network of relationships that is progressively covering the whole planet;\n* '''the pace and depth of the evolution of human ways of life''' determined by technological innovation represent an absolute novelty in human history; \n* the scale of '''anthropological and ecological transformation''' due to the interaction between [[evolutionary factor]]s (social, cultural, economic, and technological) has no historical precedent.\nThese are some examples, but they are many more.\n\nThese presentations are the result of a number of fundamental changes that are irreversibly transforming our daily lives, our way of thinking and perceiving the world and our way of living together. Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.\n\n==Improvement of THOT conditions==\nThe UN estimates that, at the beginning of the 20th century, about 60% of the world's THOT population lived in conditions of extreme poverty. In 1981, 40% of the world's THOT population lived extreme poverty. In 2001, the percentage had been halved to 20%.\nSeveral developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, still suffer from social and economic backwardness, but life conditions have significantly improved in most regions of the world, in particular in Asia. \nThe overall improvement in THOT conditions and the role of technologies now available have contributed to increase [[gross domestic product]] per capita by one and a half times in less than half a century (1960\u20132005), with peaks of over eight times in Eastern Asia. Only in a few countries, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, growth of per capita income has been very slow.\n\n==Life expectancy==\nIn 1960, the average [[life expectancy]] of the world population was 50 years. Forty-five years later, in 2004, life expectancy had improved by over 30% to 67 years. Improvements in health care and the reduction in child mortality have led to a jump forward in middle-income countries, where life expectancy is now over 70 years. In high-income countries life expectancy is now over 80 years, extending well beyond the traditional length of working life, causing social and economic problems. It has led to people having an extra 4 hours of free-time during working days.<ref>television{{clarify|date=July 2016|reason=\"television\" is ambiguous; be more specific.}}</ref>\n\n==Literacy and gender equality==\nThe ability to read and write is next to universal: in 2004, 80% of adult men and 73% of adult women had basic literacy skills. Of great social importance is the rapid growth of female school enrolment and the increasing presence of women in the labour market. These deep changes constitute a primary driver of economic growth in developing countries.\nFemale literacy has great consequences in terms of fertility. When female school enrollment and employment rates increase, fertility rates decline rapidly and tend to stabilise around the natural rate of reproduction of 2.1 children per women (see E. Todd, \"After the Empire\"). Several demographers believe that, as a consequence, world population will stabilise over the next few decades, at a level compatible with the resources of the planet [reference].\n\n==Spread of communication technologies==\nThe world population has a number of \"passive\" (broadcasting) communication technologies (radio, television) that cover the whole globe. Moreover, a large portion of the population uses \"active\" communication technologies (telephone, internet). Internet connections are expanding rapidly: in 2004 there were 140 Internet users every 1000 inhabitants (according to data from the \"International Communication Union\"). The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is remodelling the material fundamentals of society. The sociologist [[Manuel Castells|Castells]] believes that these technologies have started a revolution of the productive structures of society and of daily life.\n\nThe new communication technologies represent a critical instrument to obtain consensus and as a result they are transforming the organisational models of the State and of politics. The power system becomes less visible but more pervasive in the way it can influence choices and ways of thinking [[Manuel Castells|M. Castells]], \"Galassia Internet\", Feltrinelli, 2002).\n\n==Economic growth and evolution of political institutions==\nThe economic success of authoritarian regimes, mainly in Asia, suggests that (at least in the short term) economic growth is independent from the democratisation of political institutions. However, economic development favours the development of democratic institutions&mdash;but only if economic growth leads to substantial changes in cultural and social structures. ([[Ronald Inglehart|R. Inglehart]], \"La societ\u00e0 postmoderna\").\nThe \"[[World Values Survey]]\", which captures political values in 43 countries, shows that no country with a per capita income below the poverty line has democratic or free institutions. Almost the totality of nations with high per capita income are classified as democratic.\n\n==Globalization==\nOver the last fifty years, world gross domestic product has increased by about five times, while trade has increased tenfold over the same period. These data suggests that the intensity of the commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies. The Swiss think-tank KOF has developed a number of globalisation indicators that show the increasing development of global individual, social and commercial networks.\n\n==Social tension and opposition to change==\nNew international flows have diminished the role of traditional political institutions&mdash;sometimes with negative consequences for social stability. In many societies, stability (or slow evolution) has been substituted by unstoppable and irreversible transformations.\nAs a result, individuals and communities perceive a high degree of insecurity&mdash;insecurity that touches every aspect of their lives.

Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.\n\n==Improvement of life conditions==\nThe UN estimates that, at the beginning of the 20th century, about 60% of the world population lived in conditions of extreme poverty. In 1981, 40% of the world population lived extreme poverty. In 2001, the percentage had been halved to 20%.\nSeveral developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, still suffer from social and economic backwardness, but life conditions have significantly improved in most regions of the world, in particular in Asia. \nThe overall improvement in life conditions and the role of technologies now available have contributed to increase [[gross domestic product]] per capita by one and a half times in less than half a century (1960\u20132005), with peaks of over eight times in Eastern Asia. Only in a few countries, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, growth of per capita income has been very slow.\n\n==Life expectancy==\nIn 1960, the average [[life expectancy]] of the world population was 50 years. Forty-five years later, in 2004, life expectancy had improved by over 30% to 67 years. Improvements in health care and the reduction in child mortality have led to a jump forward in middle-income countries, where life expectancy is now over 70 years. In high-income countries life expectancy is now over 80 years, extending well beyond the traditional length of working life, causing social and economic problems. It has led to people having an extra 4 hours of free-time during working days.<ref>television{{clarify|date=July 2016|reason=\"television\" is ambiguous; be more specific.}}</ref>\n\n==Literacy and gender equality==\nThe ability to read and write is next to universal: in 2004, 80% of adult men and 73% of adult women had basic literacy skills. Of great social importance is the rapid growth of female school enrolment and the increasing presence of women in the labour market. These deep changes constitute a primary driver of economic growth in developing countries.\nFemale literacy has great consequences in terms of fertility. When female school enrollment and employment rates increase, fertility rates decline rapidly and tend to stabilise around the natural rate of reproduction of 2.1 children per women (see E. Todd, \"After the Empire\"). Several demographers believe that, as a consequence, world population will stabilise over the next few decades, at a level compatible with the resources of the planet [reference].\n\n==Spread of communication technologies==\nThe world population has a number of \"passive\" (broadcasting) communication technologies (radio, television) that cover the whole globe. Moreover, a large portion of the population uses \"active\" communication technologies (telephone, internet). Internet connections are expanding rapidly: in 2004 there were 140 Internet users every 1000 inhabitants (according to data from the \"International Communication Union\"). The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is remodelling the material fundamentals of society. The sociologist [[Manuel Castells|Castells]] believes that these technologies have started a revolution of the productive structures of society and of daily life.\n\nThe new communication technologies represent a critical instrument to obtain consensus and as a result they are transforming the organisational models of the State and of politics. The power system becomes less visible but more pervasive in the way it can influence choices and ways of thinking [[Manuel Castells|M. Castells]], \"Galassia Internet\", Feltrinelli, 2002).\n\n==Economic growth and evolution of political institutions==\nThe economic success of authoritarian regimes, mainly in Asia, suggests that (at least in the short term) economic growth is independent from the democratisation of political institutions. However, economic development favours the development of democratic institutions&mdash;but only if economic growth leads to substantial changes in cultural and social structures. ([[Ronald Inglehart|R. Inglehart]], \"La societ\u00e0 postmoderna\").\nThe \"[[World Values Survey]]\", which captures political values in 43 countries, shows that no country with a per capita income below the poverty line has democratic or free institutions. Almost the totality of nations with high per capita income are classified as democratic.\n\n==Globalization==\nOver the last fifty years, world gross domestic product has increased by about five times, while trade has increased tenfold over the same period. These data suggests that the intensity of the commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies. The Swiss think-tank KOF has developed a number of globalisation indicators that show the increasing development of global individual, social and commercial networks.\n\n==Social tension and opposition to change==\nNew international flows have diminished the role of traditional political institutions&mdash;sometimes with negative consequences for social stability. In many societies, stability (or slow evolution) has been substituted by unstoppable and irreversible transformations.\nAs a result, individuals and communities perceive a high degree of insecurity&mdash;insecurity that touches every aspect of their lives. Growing masses of people feel threatened by the changes that affect their material (work, income, house), psychological (personal relationships), and cultural life (with the need to continuously update knowledge and professional skills).\n\nThe social improvement of the masses\u2014resulting from increasing literacy and income, universal means of communication and a new social role of women\u2014has eroded the traditional role of the elites and have weakened the traditional regulatory role of the state.\nAs the speed of social and cultural evolution sweeps away old life habits, religious beliefs, ancestral moral convictions and radicated political opinions, the anxiety towards a future that is mutating and unknown causes a cultural opposition that is at the root of fundamentalism. Opposition against new life conditions is justified also by increasing economic inequality: \"the gap between the wealth of the North and that of the South of the world has increased by a multiple of five since the beginning of the 20th century\" ([[:fr:Daniel Cohen (\u00e9conomiste)|Daniel Cohen]] {{in lang|fr}}, \"Trois le\u00e7ons sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 postindustrielle\").\n\n==Breakdown of natural equilibria==\nWhen demographic growth is multiplied by the growth of per capita income and consumption, one can have a measure of the global impact on environmental sustainability.

The latter confirmed Champlain in his office [...]. On 7 May 1620, Louis XIII wrote to Champlain to enjoin him to maintain the country 'in obedience to me, making the people who are there live as closely in conformity with the laws of my kingdom as you can.' From that moment Champlain was to devote himself exclusively to the administration of the country; he was to undertake no further great voyages of discovery; his career as an explorer had ended.\"</ref> In every way but formal title, Samuel de Champlain served as [[Governor of New France]], a title that may have been formally unavailable to him owing to his non-noble status.<ref group=Note name=\"honorifics\">Some say that the King of France made him his \"''royal'' geographer\", but it is unproven and may only come from [[Marc Lescarbot]] books: Champlain never used that title. The honorific \"''de''\" was only added to his name from 1610, when he was already well-known, right after his patron, King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was murdered. This usage by a non-noble was tolerated so that he would continue to gain access to the court during the long regency of [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] (who was only eight years old at the death of his father). Champlain received the official title of \"lieutenant\" (adjunct representative) of whichever noble was designated as Viceroy of [[New France]], the first being [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. From 1629 Champlain was named \"commandant\" under the authority of the King Minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]. It was Champlain's successor, [[Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny]], who was the first to be formally named as the governor of New France, when he moved to Quebec City in 1636 and became the first noble to live there in that century.</ref> He established trading companies that sent goods, primarily fur, to France, and oversaw the growth of New France in the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley until his death, in 1635.\n\nChamplain is memorialized as the \"Father of New France\" and \"Father of [[Acadia]]\", with many places, streets, and structures in northeastern North America bearing his name, most notably [[Lake Champlain]].\n\n==Birth year, location and family==\n[[File:Samuel-de-champlain-s.jpg|thumb|right|Inauthentic depiction of Champlain,<br />by [[Th\u00e9ophile Hamel]] (1870),<br />after the one by Ducornet ([[death|d.]]&nbsp;1856),<br /> based on a portrait of [[Michel Particelli d'Emery]] ([[death|d.]] 1650)<br />by Balthasar Moncornet ([[death|d.]]&nbsp;1668).<br />\u2014 No authentic portrait of Champlain is known to exist.<ref>[[#Bishop1948|Bishop (1948)]], pp 6\u20137</ref>|alt=A half-length portrait of a man, set against a background that is a red curtain to the left and a landscape scene to the right.

Although L\u00e9opold Delayant (member, secretary, then president of ''l'Acad\u00e9mie des belles-lettres, sciences et arts de La Rochelle'') wrote as early as 1867 that Rainguet's estimate was wrong, the books of Rainguet and Laverdi\u00e8re have had a significant influence. The 1567 date was carved on numerous [[monuments]] dedicated to Champlain and is widely regarded as accurate. In the first half of the 20th century, some authors disagreed, choosing 1570 or 1575 instead of 1567. In 1978 Jean Liebel published groundbreaking research about these estimates of Champlain's birth year and concluded, \"Samuel Champlain was born about 1580 in Brouage, France.\"<ref>[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], p. 236</ref> Liebel asserts that some authors, including the Catholic priests Rainguet and Laverdi\u00e8re, preferred years when Brouage was under Catholic control (which include 1567, 1570, and 1575).<ref>[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], pp. 229\u2013237.</ref>\nChamplain claimed to be from Brouage in the title of his 1603 book and to be ''Saintongeois'' in the title of his second book (1613).

A guest on the 6 February 2008 [[CBC Radio|CBC]] radio programme, ''[[Sounds Like Canada]]'', Professor Laberge said that the fact of Champlain's Protestantism would have been downplayed or omitted from educational materials in Quebec by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who controlled [[Quebec]]'s education system from 1627 until 1962.</ref><ref group=Note name=\"Richelieu\">However, Champlain was born in or near a time when the city was taken by Protestants, but Brouage became a royal fortress and its governor, from 1627 until his death in 1642, was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], a strong anti-Protestant.</ref> The exact location of his birth is thus also not known with certainty, but at the time of his birth his parents were living in [[Hiers-Brouage|Brouage]].<ref group=Note>His family lived in Brouage at the time of his birth; the exact place and date of his birth are unknown.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105187/Samuel-de-Champlain Britannica.com]</ref>\n[[File:ChamplianStoneDingleTowerHalifaxNovaScotia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Sandford Fleming Park]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] \u2013 Stone from Samuel de Champlain's birthplace in [[Brouage]], [[France]] (1574)]]\nBorn into a family of mariners (both his father and uncle-in-law were sailors, or navigators), Samuel Champlain learned to navigate, draw, make [[nautical chart]]s, and write practical reports.

After a difficult passage, he spent some time in Cadiz before his uncle, whose ship was then chartered to accompany a large Spanish fleet to the [[West Indies]], again offered him a place on the ship. His uncle, who gave command of the ship to Jeronimo de Valaebrera, instructed the young Champlain to watch over the ship.<ref>[[#Litalien|Litalien (2004)]], p. 87</ref> This journey lasted two years, and gave Champlain the opportunity to see or hear about Spanish holdings from the Caribbean to [[Mexico City]].

As part of his duties he traveled to [[France|French]] ports and learned much about [[North America]] from the fishermen that seasonally traveled to coastal areas from [[Nantucket]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to capitalise on the rich fishing grounds there. He also made a study of previous French failures at colonization in the area, including that of [[Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit|Pierre de Chauvin]] at [[Tadoussac]].<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 100\u2013117</ref> When Chauvin forfeited his monopoly on fur trade in [[North America]] in 1602, responsibility for renewing the trade was given to [[Aymar de Chaste]]. Champlain approached de Chaste about a position on the first voyage, which he received with the king's assent.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 121\u2013123</ref>\n\nChamplain's first trip to [[North America]] was as an observer on a fur-trading expedition led by [[Fran\u00e7ois Grav\u00e9 Du Pont]]. Du Pont was a navigator and merchant who had been a ship's captain on Chauvin's expedition, and with whom Champlain established a firm lifelong friendship. He educated Champlain about navigation in [[North America]], including the [[Saint Lawrence River]], and in dealing with the natives there (and in [[Acadia]] after).<ref name=\"Davignon\"/> The ''Bonne-Renomm\u00e9e'' (the ''Good Fame'') arrived at Tadoussac on March 15, 1603. Champlain was anxious to see for himself all of the places that [[Jacques Cartier]] had seen and described about sixty years earlier, and wanted to go even further than Cartier, if possible. Champlain created a map of the Saint Lawrence on this trip and, after his return to [[France]] on 20 September, published an account as ''Des Sauvages: ou voyage de Samuel Champlain, de Brouages, faite en la France nouvelle l'an 1603'' (\"Concerning the Savages: or travels of Samuel Champlain of Brouages, made in [[New France]] in the year 1603\").<ref group=Note>Champlain did not begin using the honorific ''de'' in his name until at least 1610, when he married, the year King Henry was murdered. A reprint of this book in 1612 was credited to \"sieur ''de'' Champlain, [http://www.civilization.ca/vmnf/expos/champlain/oeuv_eng.html civilization.ca]</ref> Included in his account were meetings with [[Begourat]], a chief of the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] at Tadoussac, in which positive relationships were established between the French and the many Montagnais gathered there, with some [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] friends.\n\nPromising to King Henry to report on further discoveries, Champlain joined a second expedition to New France in the spring of 1604. This trip, once again an exploratory journey without women and children, lasted several years, and focused on areas south of the St. Lawrence River, in what later became known as [[Acadia]]. It was led by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Pierre Dugua de Mons]], a noble and Protestant merchant who had been given a fur trading monopoly in New France by the king. Dugua asked Champlain to find a site for winter settlement. After exploring possible sites in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Champlain selected [[Saint Croix Island, New Brunswick|Saint Croix Island]] in the [[Saint Croix River (Maine \u2013 New Brunswick)|St. Croix River]] as the site of the expedition's first winter settlement. After enduring a harsh winter on the island the settlement was relocated across the bay where they established [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]]. Until 1607, Champlain used that site as his base, while he explored the Atlantic coast. Dugua was forced to leave the settlement for France in September 1605, because he learned that his monopoly was at risk. His monopoly was rescinded by the king in July 1607 under pressure from other merchants and proponents of free trade, leading to the abandonment of the settlement.\n\nIn 1605 and 1606, Champlain explored the North American coast as far south as [[Cape Cod]], searching for sites for a permanent settlement. Minor skirmishes with the resident [[Nauset]]s dissuaded him from the idea of establishing one near present-day [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. He named the area Mallebar (\"bad bar\").<ref>[[#NPS|NPS]]</ref><ref name=\"map\">[[#VermontMap|Vermont Map]]</ref>\n\n==Founding of Quebec==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Plaque commemorative samuel de champlain honfleur.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Honfleur]] commemorating Champlain's departures]]\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[George Agnew Reid]], done for the third centennial (1908), showing the arrival of Samuel de Champlain on the site of [[Quebec City]].<ref group=Note name=\"ships\" />]]\n\nIn the spring of 1608, Dugua wanted Champlain to start a new French colony and fur trading center on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Dugua equipped, at his own expense, a fleet of three ships with workers, that left the French port of [[Honfleur]]. The main ship, called the [[Don de Dieu (ship)|''Don-de-Dieu'']] (French for the ''Gift of God''), was commanded by Champlain. Another ship, the ''L\u00e9vrier'' (the ''Hunt Dog''), was commanded by his friend Du Pont. The small group of male settlers arrived at [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]] on the lower St. Lawrence in June. Because of the dangerous strength of the [[Saguenay River]] ending there, they left the ships and continued up the \"Big River\" in small boats bringing the men and the materials.<ref group=Note name=\"ships\">Only at his last arrival (in 1633), Champlain did not leave the ships at Tadoussac but sailed them directly to Quebec City.[[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]]</ref>{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nOn July 3, 1608, Champlain landed at the point of Quebec and set about fortifying the area by the erection of three main wooden buildings, each two stories tall, that he collectively called the ''[[Habitation de Qu\u00e9bec|Habitation]]'', with a wooden [[stockade]] and a moat {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} wide surrounding them. This was the very beginning of what is now [[Quebec City]]. Gardening, exploring, and fortifying this place became great passions of Champlain for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nUpon foundation of Quebec, a conspiracy, started by a locksmith, had formed to kill Champlain, in order to deliver the fort to the Spaniards or the Basques. Champlain, learning of the plot from one of his trusted pilots, apprehended, questioned, and pardoned the conspirators.\n\nIn the 1620s, the ''Habitation'' at Quebec was mainly a store for the ''Compagnie des Marchands'' (Traders Company), and Champlain lived in the wooden ''Fort Saint Louis'' newly built up the hill (south from the present-day ''[[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]]'' hotel), near the only two houses built by the two settler families (the ones of [[Louis H\u00e9bert]] and Guillaume Couillard, his son-in-law).{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n==Marriage==\nOne route Champlain may have chosen to improve his access to the court of the regent was his decision to enter into marriage with the twelve-year-old [[Helene Boull\u00e9|H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boull\u00e9]]. She was the daughter of Nicolas Boull\u00e9, a man charged with carrying out royal decisions at court. The marriage contract was signed on 27 December 1610 in presence of Dugua, who had dealt with the father, and the couple was married three days later. The terms of the contract called for the marriage to be consummated two years later.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 287\u2013288</ref>\n\nChamplain's marriage was initially quite troubled, as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne rallied against joining him in August 1613.

The couple had 1 child, and Champlain adopted three Montagnais girls named Faith, Hope, and Charity in the winter of 1627\u201328.\n\n==Relations and war with Native Americans==\n[[File:DefeatOfIroquoisByChamplain.jpeg|thumb|left|Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage. It depicts a battle between [[Iroquois]] and [[Algonquian people|Algonquian]] tribes near Lake Champlain]]\n\nDuring the summer of 1609, Champlain attempted to form better relations with the local [[First Nations|native tribes]]. He made alliances with the [[Wyandot people|Wendat]] (derogatorily called ''Huron'' by the French) and with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] and the Etchemin, who lived in the area of the [[St. Lawrence River]]. These tribes sought Champlain's help in their war against the [[Haudenosaunee|Iroquois]], who lived farther south. Champlain set off with nine French soldiers and 300 natives to explore the ''Rivi\u00e8re des Iroquois'' (now known as the [[Richelieu River]]), and became the first European to map [[Lake Champlain]]. Having had no encounters with the Haudenosaunee at this point many of the men headed back, leaving Champlain with only 2 Frenchmen and 60 natives.\n\nOn 29 July, somewhere in the area near [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]] and [[Crown Point, New York]] (historians are not sure which of these two places, but [[Fort Ticonderoga]] historians claim that it occurred near its site), Champlain and his party encountered a group of Haudenosaunee. In a battle that began the next day, two hundred and fifty Haudenosaunee advanced on Champlain's position, and one of his guides pointed out the three chiefs. In his account of the battle, Champlain recounts firing his [[arquebus]] and killing two of them with a single shot, after which one of his men killed the third. The Haudenosaunee turned and fled. This action set the tone for [[Beaver Wars|poor French-Iroquois relations]] for the rest of the century.<ref group=Note>In 1701, [[Great Peace of Montreal|The Great Peace Treaty]] was signed in Montreal, involving the French and every Indigenous nation coming or living on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River except maybe in wintertime.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Sorel]] occurred on 19 June 1610, with Samuel de Champlain supported by the [[Kingdom of France]] and his allies, the [[Wyandot people|Wendat people]], [[Algonquin people]] and [[Innu people]] against the [[Mohawk people]] in [[New France]] at present-day [[Sorel-Tracy]], [[Quebec]].

In 1614, he formed the \"Compagnie des Marchands de Rouen et de Saint-Malo\" and \"Compagnie de Champlain\", which bound the Rouen and Saint-Malo merchants for eleven years. He returned to New France in the spring of 1615 with four [[Recollects]] in order to further religious life in the new colony.

Champlain spent the winter building Fort Saint-Louis on top of Cape Diamond. By mid-May, he learned that the fur trading monopoly had been handed over to another company led by the Caen brothers. After some tense negotiations, it was decided to merge the two companies under the direction of the Caens. Champlain continued to work on relations with the natives and managed to impose on them a chief of his choice. He also negotiated a peace treaty with the Iroquois.\n\nChamplain continued to work on the fortifications of what became Quebec City, laying the first stone on 6 May 1624. On 15 August he once again returned to France where he was encouraged to continue his work as well as to continue looking for a passage to China, something widely believed to exist at the time. By July 5 he was back at Quebec and continued expanding the city.\n\nIn 1627 the Caen brothers' company lost its monopoly on the fur trade, and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (who had joined the Royal Council in 1624 and rose rapidly to a position of dominance in French politics that he would hold until his death in 1642) formed the [[Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s]] (the Hundred Associates) to manage the fur trade.

He also began [[French and Iroquois Wars|an offensive]] against the Iroquois, reporting that he wanted them either wiped out or \"brought to reason\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Death and burial==\nChamplain had a severe [[stroke]] in October 1635, and died on 25 December, leaving no immediate heirs. [[Jesuit]] records state he died in the care of his friend and confessor [[Charles Lallemant]].{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAlthough his will (drafted in 17 November 1635) gave much of his French property to his wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, he made significant bequests to the Catholic missions and to individuals in the colony of Quebec. However, Marie Camaret, a cousin on his mother's side, challenged the will in Paris and had it overturned. It is unclear exactly what happened to his estate.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 520</ref><ref>[[#Heidenreich|Heidenreich]]</ref><ref>[[#Le Blant1964|Le Blant (1964)]], pp 425\u2013437</ref>\n\nSamuel de Champlain was temporarily buried in the church while a standalone chapel was built to hold his remains in the upper part of the city. Unfortunately, this small building, along with many others, was destroyed by a large fire in 1640. Though immediately rebuilt, no traces of it exist anymore: his exact burial site is still unknown, despite much research since about 1850, including several archaeological digs in the city. There is general agreement that the previous Champlain chapel site, and the remains of Champlain, should be somewhere near the [[Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec Cathedral]].<ref>[[#Travels|Champlain: Travels in the Canadian Francophonie]]</ref><ref>[[#La Chapelle|La Chappelle]]</ref>\n\nThe search for Champlain's remains supplies a key plot-line in the crime writer [[Louise Penny]]'s 2010 novel, ''Bury Your Dead''.<ref>[[#Penny|Penny (2010)]]</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain (Qu\u00e9bec).jpg|thumb|Statue of Samuel de Champlain at sunrise (looking to the north-west; with a similar expressive face as traditionally [[Jacques Cartier]]'s), by {{interlanguage link|Paul-Romain Marie L\u00e9once Chevr\u00e9|fr|Paul Chevr\u00e9}} (Paris, 1896\u20131898), as newly repaired for 2008, at [[Quebec City]] since 1898, near ''[[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]]'' grand hotel, on the ''[[Terrasse Dufferin]]''.]]\n\nMany sites and landmarks have been named to honour Champlain, who was a prominent figure in many parts of [[Acadia]], [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Vermont]]. Memorialized as the \"Father of New France\" and \"Father of [[Acadia]]\", his historic significance endures in modern times. [[Lake Champlain]], which straddles the border between northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Vermont]], extending slightly across the border into [[Canada]], was named by him, in 1609, when he led an expedition along the [[Richelieu River]], exploring a long, narrow lake situated between the [[Green Mountains]] of present-day [[Vermont]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of present-day [[New York (state)|New York]]. The first European to map and describe it, Champlain claimed the lake as his namesake.\n\nMemorials include:\n<!--geographic formations-->\n* [[Lake Champlain]], [[Champlain Valley]], the [[Champlain Trail Lakes]].\n* [[Champlain Sea]]: a past inlet of the Atlantic Ocean in North America, over the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]], the [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]], and the [[Richelieu River|Richelieu]] rivers, to over [[Lake Champlain]], which inlet disappeared many thousands years before Champlain was born.\n* Champlain Mountain, [[Acadia National Park]] \u2013 which he first observed in 1604.<ref>[[#Acadia|Acadia National Park]]</ref>\n* A [[Champlain (town), New York|town]] and [[Champlain (village), New York|village]] in New York, as well as a [[Champlain, Ontario|township in Ontario]] and a [[Champlain, Quebec|municipality in Quebec]].\n* The provincial electoral district of [[Champlain (provincial electoral district)|Champlain]], [[Quebec]], and several defunct electoral districts elsewhere in Canada.\n* [[Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park]], a [[provincial park]] in northern Ontario near the town of [[Mattawa, Ontario|Mattawa]].\n<!--functional structures-->\n* [[Champlain Bridge (Montreal)|Champlain Bridge]], which connects the [[island of Montreal]] to [[Brossard]], Quebec across the St. Lawrence.\n* [[Champlain Bridge (Ottawa)|Champlain Bridge]], which connects the cities of [[Ottawa]], Ontario and [[Gatineau]], Quebec.\n* Champlain College, one of six colleges at [[Trent University]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], is named in his honour.\n* Fort Champlain, a [[dormitory]] at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]; named in his honour in 1965, it houses the 10th cadet squadron.\n* A French school in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]; [[\u00c9cole Champlain]], an elementary school in [[Moncton, New Brunswick]]; [[Champlain College]], in [[Burlington, Vermont]]; and [[Champlain Regional College]], a [[CEGEP]] with three campuses in Quebec.\n* [[Ch\u00e2teau Champlain|Marriott Ch\u00e2teau Champlain]] hotel, in Montreal.\n<!--streets and other commemorative items-->\n* Streets named Champlain in numerous cities, including Quebec, [[Shawinigan]], the city of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]] in the province of New Brunswick, in [[Plattsburgh]], and no less than eleven communities in northwestern Vermont.\n* A garden called Jardin Samuel-de-Champlain in Paris, France.\n* A memorial statue on Cumberland Avenue in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]] on the shores of [[Lake Champlain]] in a park named for Champlain.\n* A memorial statue in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], Canada in [[Queen Square (Saint John, New Brunswick)|Queen Square]] that commemorates his discovery of the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]].<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/Heritage/HistoricalTour/AdditionalInformation.htm Saint John Additional Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927110701/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/Heritage/HistoricalTour/AdditionalInformation.htm |date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n* A memorial statue in [[Isle La Motte, Vermont]], on the shore of [[Lake Champlain]].\n* The [[lighthouse]] at [[Crown Point, New York]] features a statue of Champlain by [[Carl Augustus Heber]].\n* A [[commemorative stamp]] issue in May 2006 jointly by the [[United States Postal Service]] and [[Canada Post]].<ref>[[#Gicker2006|Gicker (2006)]]</ref>\n* A statue in [[Ticonderoga, New York]], unveiled in 2009 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Champlain's exploration of Lake Champlain.\n* A statue in [[Orillia]], Ontario at [[Couchiching Beach Park]] on [[Lake Couchiching]].

The honorific \"''de''\" was only added to his name from 1610, when he was already well-known, right after his patron, King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was murdered. This usage by a non-noble was tolerated so that he would continue to gain access to the court during the long regency of [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] (who was only eight years old at the death of his father). Champlain received the official title of \"lieutenant\" (adjunct representative) of whichever noble was designated as Viceroy of [[New France]], the first being [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. From 1629 Champlain was named \"commandant\" under the authority of the King Minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]. It was Champlain's successor, [[Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny]], who was the first to be formally named as the governor of New France, when he moved to Quebec City in 1636 and became the first noble to live there in that century.</ref> He established trading companies that sent goods, primarily fur, to France, and oversaw the growth of New France in the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley until his death, in 1635.\n\nChamplain is memorialized as the \"Father of New France\" and \"Father of [[Acadia]]\", with many places, streets, and structures in northeastern North America bearing his name, most notably [[Lake Champlain]].\n\n==Birth year, location and family==\n[[File:Samuel-de-champlain-s.jpg|thumb|right|Inauthentic depiction of Champlain,<br />by [[Th\u00e9ophile Hamel]] (1870),<br />after the one by Ducornet ([[death|d.]]&nbsp;1856),<br /> based on a portrait of [[Michel Particelli d'Emery]] ([[death|d.]] 1650)<br />by Balthasar Moncornet ([[death|d.]]&nbsp;1668).<br />\u2014 No authentic portrait of Champlain is known to exist.<ref>[[#Bishop1948|Bishop (1948)]], pp 6\u20137</ref>|alt=A half-length portrait of a man, set against a background that is a red curtain to the left and a landscape scene to the right.

Although L\u00e9opold Delayant (member, secretary, then president of ''l'Acad\u00e9mie des belles-lettres, sciences et arts de La Rochelle'') wrote as early as 1867 that Rainguet's estimate was wrong, the books of Rainguet and Laverdi\u00e8re have had a significant influence. The 1567 date was carved on numerous [[monuments]] dedicated to Champlain and is widely regarded as accurate. In the first half of the 20th century, some authors disagreed, choosing 1570 or 1575 instead of 1567. In 1978 Jean Liebel published groundbreaking research about these estimates of Champlain's birth year and concluded, \"Samuel Champlain was born about 1580 in Brouage, France.\"<ref>[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], p. 236</ref> Liebel asserts that some authors, including the Catholic priests Rainguet and Laverdi\u00e8re, preferred years when Brouage was under Catholic control (which include 1567, 1570, and 1575).<ref>[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], pp. 229\u2013237.</ref>\nChamplain claimed to be from Brouage in the title of his 1603 book and to be ''Saintongeois'' in the title of his second book (1613).

A guest on the 6 February 2008 [[CBC Radio|CBC]] radio programme, ''[[Sounds Like Canada]]'', Professor Laberge said that the fact of Champlain's Protestantism would have been downplayed or omitted from educational materials in Quebec by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who controlled [[Quebec]]'s education system from 1627 until 1962.</ref><ref group=Note name=\"Richelieu\">However, Champlain was born in or near a time when the city was taken by Protestants, but Brouage became a royal fortress and its governor, from 1627 until his death in 1642, was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], a strong anti-Protestant.</ref> The exact location of his birth is thus also not known with certainty, but at the time of his birth his parents were living in [[Hiers-Brouage|Brouage]].<ref group=Note>His family lived in Brouage at the time of his birth; the exact place and date of his birth are unknown.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105187/Samuel-de-Champlain Britannica.com]</ref>\n[[File:ChamplianStoneDingleTowerHalifaxNovaScotia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Sandford Fleming Park]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] \u2013 Stone from Samuel de Champlain's birthplace in [[Brouage]], [[France]] (1574)]]\nBorn into a family of mariners (both his father and uncle-in-law were sailors, or navigators), Samuel Champlain learned to navigate, draw, make [[nautical chart]]s, and write practical reports. His education did not include [[Ancient Greek]] or [[Latin]], so he did not read or learn from any ancient literature. As each French fleet had to assure its own defense at sea, Champlain sought to learn to fight with the firearms of his time: he acquired this practical knowledge when serving with the army of [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] during the later stages of [[French Wars of Religion|France's religious wars]] in [[Brittany]] from 1594 or 1595 to 1598, beginning as a quartermaster responsible for the feeding and care of horses. During this time he claimed to go on a \"certain secret voyage\" for the king,<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 62</ref> and saw combat (including maybe the [[Siege of Fort Crozon]], at the end of 1594).<ref name=F65>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 65 Note: Fischer cites numerous other authorities in repeating this.</ref> By 1597 he was a \"capitaine d'une compagnie\" serving in a garrison near [[Quimper, Finist\u00e8re|Quimper]].<ref name=\"F65\" />\n\n==Early travels==\n[[File:SamuelDeChamplainStatueILMVT.JPG|thumb|Champlain and guide<ref>[[#Weber1967|Weber (1967)]]</ref> in [[Isle La Motte, Vermont]], at the site Champlain is said to have first set foot in [[Vermont]] (and encamped) in 1609.

After a difficult passage, he spent some time in Cadiz before his uncle, whose ship was then chartered to accompany a large Spanish fleet to the [[West Indies]], again offered him a place on the ship. His uncle, who gave command of the ship to Jeronimo de Valaebrera, instructed the young Champlain to watch over the ship.<ref>[[#Litalien|Litalien (2004)]], p. 87</ref> This journey lasted two years, and gave Champlain the opportunity to see or hear about Spanish holdings from the Caribbean to [[Mexico City]].

One of them is at the [[John Carter Brown Library]] at [[Brown University]].</ref> who rewarded Champlain with an annual pension.

This Champlain did, and when his uncle died in June 1601, Champlain inherited his substantial estate. It included an estate near [[La Rochelle]], commercial properties in Spain, and a 150-ton merchant ship.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 98\u201399</ref> This inheritance, combined with the king's annual pension, gave the young explorer a great deal of independence, as he was not dependent on the financial backing of merchants and other investors.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 100</ref> From 1601 to 1603 Champlain served as a geographer in the court of King Henry IV. As part of his duties he traveled to [[France|French]] ports and learned much about [[North America]] from the fishermen that seasonally traveled to coastal areas from [[Nantucket]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to capitalise on the rich fishing grounds there. He also made a study of previous French failures at colonization in the area, including that of [[Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit|Pierre de Chauvin]] at [[Tadoussac]].<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 100\u2013117</ref> When Chauvin forfeited his monopoly on fur trade in [[North America]] in 1602, responsibility for renewing the trade was given to [[Aymar de Chaste]]. Champlain approached de Chaste about a position on the first voyage, which he received with the king's assent.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 121\u2013123</ref>\n\nChamplain's first trip to [[North America]] was as an observer on a fur-trading expedition led by [[Fran\u00e7ois Grav\u00e9 Du Pont]]. Du Pont was a navigator and merchant who had been a ship's captain on Chauvin's expedition, and with whom Champlain established a firm lifelong friendship. He educated Champlain about navigation in [[North America]], including the [[Saint Lawrence River]], and in dealing with the natives there (and in [[Acadia]] after).<ref name=\"Davignon\"/> The ''Bonne-Renomm\u00e9e'' (the ''Good Fame'') arrived at Tadoussac on March 15, 1603. Champlain was anxious to see for himself all of the places that [[Jacques Cartier]] had seen and described about sixty years earlier, and wanted to go even further than Cartier, if possible. Champlain created a map of the Saint Lawrence on this trip and, after his return to [[France]] on 20 September, published an account as ''Des Sauvages: ou voyage de Samuel Champlain, de Brouages, faite en la France nouvelle l'an 1603'' (\"Concerning the Savages: or travels of Samuel Champlain of Brouages, made in [[New France]] in the year 1603\").<ref group=Note>Champlain did not begin using the honorific ''de'' in his name until at least 1610, when he married, the year King Henry was murdered. A reprint of this book in 1612 was credited to \"sieur ''de'' Champlain, [http://www.civilization.ca/vmnf/expos/champlain/oeuv_eng.html civilization.ca]</ref> Included in his account were meetings with [[Begourat]], a chief of the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] at Tadoussac, in which positive relationships were established between the French and the many Montagnais gathered there, with some [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] friends.\n\nPromising to King Henry to report on further discoveries, Champlain joined a second expedition to New France in the spring of 1604. This trip, once again an exploratory journey without women and children, lasted several years, and focused on areas south of the St. Lawrence River, in what later became known as [[Acadia]]. It was led by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Pierre Dugua de Mons]], a noble and Protestant merchant who had been given a fur trading monopoly in New France by the king. Dugua asked Champlain to find a site for winter settlement. After exploring possible sites in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Champlain selected [[Saint Croix Island, New Brunswick|Saint Croix Island]] in the [[Saint Croix River (Maine \u2013 New Brunswick)|St. Croix River]] as the site of the expedition's first winter settlement. After enduring a harsh winter on the island the settlement was relocated across the bay where they established [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]]. Until 1607, Champlain used that site as his base, while he explored the Atlantic coast. Dugua was forced to leave the settlement for France in September 1605, because he learned that his monopoly was at risk. His monopoly was rescinded by the king in July 1607 under pressure from other merchants and proponents of free trade, leading to the abandonment of the settlement.\n\nIn 1605 and 1606, Champlain explored the North American coast as far south as [[Cape Cod]], searching for sites for a permanent settlement. Minor skirmishes with the resident [[Nauset]]s dissuaded him from the idea of establishing one near present-day [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. He named the area Mallebar (\"bad bar\").<ref>[[#NPS|NPS]]</ref><ref name=\"map\">[[#VermontMap|Vermont Map]]</ref>\n\n==Founding of Quebec==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Plaque commemorative samuel de champlain honfleur.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Honfleur]] commemorating Champlain's departures]]\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[George Agnew Reid]], done for the third centennial (1908), showing the arrival of Samuel de Champlain on the site of [[Quebec City]].<ref group=Note name=\"ships\" />]]\n\nIn the spring of 1608, Dugua wanted Champlain to start a new French colony and fur trading center on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Dugua equipped, at his own expense, a fleet of three ships with workers, that left the French port of [[Honfleur]]. The main ship, called the [[Don de Dieu (ship)|''Don-de-Dieu'']] (French for the ''Gift of God''), was commanded by Champlain. Another ship, the ''L\u00e9vrier'' (the ''Hunt Dog''), was commanded by his friend Du Pont. The small group of male settlers arrived at [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]] on the lower St. Lawrence in June. Because of the dangerous strength of the [[Saguenay River]] ending there, they left the ships and continued up the \"Big River\" in small boats bringing the men and the materials.<ref group=Note name=\"ships\">Only at his last arrival (in 1633), Champlain did not leave the ships at Tadoussac but sailed them directly to Quebec City.[[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]]</ref>{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nOn July 3, 1608, Champlain landed at the point of Quebec and set about fortifying the area by the erection of three main wooden buildings, each two stories tall, that he collectively called the ''[[Habitation de Qu\u00e9bec|Habitation]]'', with a wooden [[stockade]] and a moat {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} wide surrounding them. This was the very beginning of what is now [[Quebec City]]. Gardening, exploring, and fortifying this place became great passions of Champlain for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nUpon foundation of Quebec, a conspiracy, started by a locksmith, had formed to kill Champlain, in order to deliver the fort to the Spaniards or the Basques. Champlain, learning of the plot from one of his trusted pilots, apprehended, questioned, and pardoned the conspirators.\n\nIn the 1620s, the ''Habitation'' at Quebec was mainly a store for the ''Compagnie des Marchands'' (Traders Company), and Champlain lived in the wooden ''Fort Saint Louis'' newly built up the hill (south from the present-day ''[[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]]'' hotel), near the only two houses built by the two settler families (the ones of [[Louis H\u00e9bert]] and Guillaume Couillard, his son-in-law).{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n==Marriage==\nOne route Champlain may have chosen to improve his access to the court of the regent was his decision to enter into marriage with the twelve-year-old [[Helene Boull\u00e9|H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boull\u00e9]]. She was the daughter of Nicolas Boull\u00e9, a man charged with carrying out royal decisions at court. The marriage contract was signed on 27 December 1610 in presence of Dugua, who had dealt with the father, and the couple was married three days later. The terms of the contract called for the marriage to be consummated two years later.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 287\u2013288</ref>\n\nChamplain's marriage was initially quite troubled, as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne rallied against joining him in August 1613.

Champlain set off with nine French soldiers and 300 natives to explore the ''Rivi\u00e8re des Iroquois'' (now known as the [[Richelieu River]]), and became the first European to map [[Lake Champlain]]. Having had no encounters with the Haudenosaunee at this point many of the men headed back, leaving Champlain with only 2 Frenchmen and 60 natives.\n\nOn 29 July, somewhere in the area near [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]] and [[Crown Point, New York]] (historians are not sure which of these two places, but [[Fort Ticonderoga]] historians claim that it occurred near its site), Champlain and his party encountered a group of Haudenosaunee. In a battle that began the next day, two hundred and fifty Haudenosaunee advanced on Champlain's position, and one of his guides pointed out the three chiefs. In his account of the battle, Champlain recounts firing his [[arquebus]] and killing two of them with a single shot, after which one of his men killed the third. The Haudenosaunee turned and fled. This action set the tone for [[Beaver Wars|poor French-Iroquois relations]] for the rest of the century.<ref group=Note>In 1701, [[Great Peace of Montreal|The Great Peace Treaty]] was signed in Montreal, involving the French and every Indigenous nation coming or living on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River except maybe in wintertime.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Sorel]] occurred on 19 June 1610, with Samuel de Champlain supported by the [[Kingdom of France]] and his allies, the [[Wyandot people|Wendat people]], [[Algonquin people]] and [[Innu people]] against the [[Mohawk people]] in [[New France]] at present-day [[Sorel-Tracy]], [[Quebec]]. Champlain's forces armed with the [[arquebus]] engaged and slaughtered or captured nearly all of the Mohawks.

In 1614, he formed the \"Compagnie des Marchands de Rouen et de Saint-Malo\" and \"Compagnie de Champlain\", which bound the Rouen and Saint-Malo merchants for eleven years. He returned to New France in the spring of 1615 with four [[Recollects]] in order to further religious life in the new colony. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] was eventually given ''[[Seigneurial system of New France|en seigneurie]]'' large and valuable tracts of land, estimated at nearly 30% of all the lands granted by the [[King of France|French Crown]] in [[New France]].<ref name=\"roydalton\">[[#Dalton|Dalton (1968)]]</ref>\n\nIn 1615, Champlain reunited with [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]], his capable interpreter, following separate four-year explorations.

The party passed [[Lake Ontario]] at its eastern tip where they hid their canoes and continued their journey by land. They followed the [[Oneida River]] until they arrived at the main Onondaga fort on October 10. The exact location of this place is still a matter of debate.

During his stay, he set off with them in their great deer hunt, during which he became lost and was forced to wander for three days living off game and sleeping under trees until he met up with a band of First Nations people by chance. He spent the rest of the winter learning \"their country, their manners, customs, modes of life\". On 22 May 1616, he left the Wendat country and returned to Quebec before heading back to France on 2 July.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Improving administration in New France==\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain Carte geographique de la Nouvelle France.jpg|thumb|Map of [[New France]] (Champlain, 1612).

Ronjat.<ref>[[#Guizot|Guizot]], p. 190</ref>]]\n\nChamplain returned to New France in 1620 and was to spend the rest of his life focusing on administration of the territory rather than exploration. Champlain spent the winter building Fort Saint-Louis on top of Cape Diamond. By mid-May, he learned that the fur trading monopoly had been handed over to another company led by the Caen brothers. After some tense negotiations, it was decided to merge the two companies under the direction of the Caens. Champlain continued to work on relations with the natives and managed to impose on them a chief of his choice. He also negotiated a peace treaty with the Iroquois.\n\nChamplain continued to work on the fortifications of what became Quebec City, laying the first stone on 6 May 1624. On 15 August he once again returned to France where he was encouraged to continue his work as well as to continue looking for a passage to China, something widely believed to exist at the time. By July 5 he was back at Quebec and continued expanding the city.\n\nIn 1627 the Caen brothers' company lost its monopoly on the fur trade, and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (who had joined the Royal Council in 1624 and rose rapidly to a position of dominance in French politics that he would hold until his death in 1642) formed the [[Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s]] (the Hundred Associates) to manage the fur trade. Champlain was one of the 100 investors, and its first fleet, loaded with colonists and supplies, set sail in April 1628.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 404\u2013410</ref>\n\nChamplain had overwintered in Quebec.

Champlain refused to deal with them, misleading them to believe that Quebec's defenses were better than they actually were (Champlain had only 50 pounds of gunpowder to defend the community). Successfully bluffed, they withdrew, but encountered and captured the French supply fleet, cutting off that year's supplies to the colony.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 412\u2013415</ref> By the spring of 1629 supplies were dangerously low and Champlain was forced to send people to [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula|Gasp\u00e9]] and into Indian communities to conserve rations.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 418\u2013420</ref> On July 19, the Kirke brothers arrived before Quebec after intercepting Champlain's plea for help, and Champlain was forced to surrender the colony.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 421</ref> Many colonists were taken first to England and then to France by the Kirkes, but Champlain remained in London to begin the process of regaining the colony.

(David Kirke was rewarded when Charles I knighted him and gave him a charter for [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].) Champlain reclaimed his role as commander of New France on behalf of Richelieu on 1 March 1633, having served in the intervening years as commander in New France \"in the absence of my Lord the [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal de Richelieu]]\" from 1629 to 1635.<ref name=\"Trudel\">[[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]]</ref> In 1632 Champlain published ''Voyages de la Nouvelle France'', which was dedicated to Cardinal Richelieu, and ''Traitt\u00e9 de la marine et du devoir d'un bon marinier'', a treatise on leadership, seamanship, and navigation.

Richelieu gave him a commission as [[Lieutenant General of New France]], along with other titles and responsibilities, but not that of [[Governor of New France|Governor]]. Despite this lack of formal status, many colonists, French merchants, and Indians treated him as if he had the title; writings survive in which he is referred to as \"our governor\".<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 445\u2013446</ref> On 18 August 1634, he sent a report to Richelieu stating that he had rebuilt on the ruins of Quebec, enlarged its fortifications, and established two more habitations. One was 15 leagues upstream, and the other was at [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]]. He also began [[French and Iroquois Wars|an offensive]] against the Iroquois, reporting that he wanted them either wiped out or \"brought to reason\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Death and burial==\nChamplain had a severe [[stroke]] in October 1635, and died on 25 December, leaving no immediate heirs. [[Jesuit]] records state he died in the care of his friend and confessor [[Charles Lallemant]].{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAlthough his will (drafted in 17 November 1635) gave much of his French property to his wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, he made significant bequests to the Catholic missions and to individuals in the colony of Quebec. However, Marie Camaret, a cousin on his mother's side, challenged the will in Paris and had it overturned.

Unfortunately, this small building, along with many others, was destroyed by a large fire in 1640. Though immediately rebuilt, no traces of it exist anymore: his exact burial site is still unknown, despite much research since about 1850, including several archaeological digs in the city.

[[Lake Champlain]], which straddles the border between northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Vermont]], extending slightly across the border into [[Canada]], was named by him, in 1609, when he led an expedition along the [[Richelieu River]], exploring a long, narrow lake situated between the [[Green Mountains]] of present-day [[Vermont]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of present-day [[New York (state)|New York]].

The term stands for '''rep'''eated '''unit''' and was coined in 1966 by [[Albert H. Beiler]] in his book ''Recreations in the Theory of Numbers''.{{refn|group=note|Albert H. Beiler coined the term \u201crepunit number\u201d as follows:<blockquote>A number which consists of a repeated of a single digit is sometimes called a monodigit number, and for convenience the author has used the term \u201crepunit number\u201d (repeated unit) to represent monodigit numbers consisting solely of the digit 1.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beiler|2013|pp=83}}</ref></blockquote>}}<!--- Original publication was 1964; did he coin repunit in that edition? or was this added in 1966? --->\n\nA '''repunit prime''' is a repunit that is also a [[prime number]]. Primes that are repunits in [[Binary number|base 2]] are [[Mersenne prime]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe base-''b'' repunits are defined as (this ''b'' can be either positive or negative)\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}\\equiv 1 + b + b^2 + \\cdots + b^{n-1} = {b^n-1\\over{b-1}}\\qquad\\mbox{for }|b|\\ge2, n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(b)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base b representation. The first two repunits base ''b'' for ''n''=1 and ''n''=2 are \n:<math>R_1^{(b)}={b-1\\over{b-1}}= 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad R_2^{(b)}={b^2-1\\over{b-1}}= b+1\\qquad\\text{for}\\ |b|\\ge2.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ''[[decimal]] (base-10) repunits'' that are often referred to as simply ''repunits'' are defined as\n:<math>R_n\\equiv R_n^{(10)}={10^n-1\\over{10-1}}={10^n-1\\over9}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(10)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base 10 starts with\n: [[1 (number)|1]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[111 (number)|111]], 1111, 11111, 111111, ... {{OEIS|A002275}}.\n\nSimilarly, the repunits [[base 2]] are defined as\n:<math>R_n^{(2)}={2^n-1\\over{2-1}}={2^n-1}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(2)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne number]]s ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, they start with\n:1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ... {{OEIS|id=A000225}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n* Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite.  Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  For example,\n*: ''R''<sub>35</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = {{loop|35|1}} = 11111 \u00d7 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 \u00d7 10000001000000100000010000001,\n:since 35 = 7 \u00d7 5 = 5 \u00d7 7.  This repunit factorization does not depend on the base ''b'' in which the repunit is expressed.\n* If ''p'' is an odd prime, then every prime ''q'' that divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> must be either 1 plus a multiple of 2''p,'' or a factor of ''b - 1''. For example, a prime factor of ''R''<sub>29</sub> is 62003 = 1 + 2\u00b729\u00b71069. The reason is that the prime ''p'' is the smallest exponent greater than 1 such that ''q'' divides ''b<sup>p</sup>'' &minus; 1, because ''p'' is prime. Therefore, unless ''q'' divides ''b'' - 1, [[Carmichael function#Order of elements modulo n|''p'' divides the Carmichael function]] of ''q'', which is even and equal to ''q'' &minus; 1. \n*Any positive multiple of the repunit ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> contains at least ''n'' nonzero digits in base ''b''.\n* Any number ''x'' is a two-digit repunit in base x - 1.\n* The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base 5, 11111 in base 2) and 8191 (111 in base 90, 1111111111111 in base 2). The [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]] says there are only these two cases.\n* Using the [[pigeon-hole principle]] it can be easily shown that for each ''n'' and ''b'' such that ''n''  and ''b'' are [[Coprime integers|relatively prime]] there exists a repunit in base ''b'' that is a multiple of ''n''. To see this consider repunits ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>,...,''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>. Because there are ''n'' repunits but only ''n''-1 non-zero residues modulo ''n'' there exist two repunits ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> with 1\u2264''i''<''j''\u2264''n'' such that ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the same residue modulo ''n''. It follows that ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> has residue 0 modulo ''n'', i.e. is divisible by ''n''. ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''j'' - ''i'' ones followed by ''i'' zeroes. Thus, ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''j''-''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>  x ''b''<sup>''i''</sup> . Since ''n'' divides the left-hand side it also divides the right-hand side and since ''n'' and ''b'' are relatively prime ''n'' must divide ''R''<sub>''j''-''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>.\n* The [[Feit\u2013Thompson conjecture]] is that ''R''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>(''p'')</sup> never divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''q'')</sup> for two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q''.\n* Using the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] for repunits definition: ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = 1; ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''n''-1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> x ''b'' + 1, any consecutive repunits ''R''<sub>''n''-1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime in any base ''b'' for any ''n''.\n* If ''m'' and ''n'' have a common divisor ''d'', ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the common divisor ''R''<sub>''d''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> in any base ''b'' for any ''m'' and ''n''. That is, the repunits of a fixed base form a [[Divisibility sequence|strong divisibility sequence]]. As a consequence, If ''m'' and ''n'' are relatively prime, ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime.

If ''n'' is a [[prime power]] (can be written as ''p''<sup>''r''</sup>, with ''p'' prime, ''r'' integer, ''p'', ''r'' >0), then all repunit in base ''b'' are not prime aside from ''R<sub>p</sub>'' and ''R<sub>2</sub>''. ''R<sub>p</sub>'' can be either prime or composite, the former examples, ''b'' = \u2212216, \u2212128, 4, 8, 16, 27, 36, 100, 128, 256, etc., the latter examples, ''b'' = \u2212243, \u2212125, \u221264, \u221232, \u221227, \u22128, 9, 25, 32, 49, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 289, etc., and ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can be prime (when ''p'' differs from 2) only if ''b'' is negative, a power of \u22122, for example, ''b'' = \u22128, \u221232, \u2212128, \u22128192, etc., in fact, the ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can also be composite, for example, ''b'' = \u2212512, \u22122048, \u221232768, etc. If ''n'' is not a prime power, then no base ''b'' repunit prime exists, for example, ''b'' = 64, 729 (with ''n'' = 6), ''b'' = 1024 (with ''n'' = 10), and ''b'' = \u22121 or 0 (with ''n'' any natural number). Another special situation is ''b'' = \u22124''k''<sup>4</sup>, with ''k'' positive integer, which has the [[aurifeuillean factorization]], for example, ''b'' = \u22124 (with ''k'' = 1, then ''R<sub>2</sub>'' and ''R<sub>3</sub>'' are primes), and ''b'' = \u221264, \u2212324, \u22121024, \u22122500, \u22125184, ... (with ''k'' = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...), then no base ''b'' repunit prime exists.

Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the [[integer factorization|factorization]] by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to ''R<sub>16</sub>'' and many larger ones. By 1880, even ''R<sub>17</sub>'' to ''R<sub>36</sub>'' had been factored<ref name=\"Dickson1999\" /> and it is curious that, though [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] showed no prime below three million had period [[19 (number)|nineteen]], there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved ''R<sub>19</sub>'' to be prime in 1916<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|1988|pp=240\u2013246}}</ref> and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found ''R<sub>23</sub>'' to be prime in 1929.\n\nFurther advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. ''R<sub>317</sub>'' was found to be a [[probable prime]] circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when ''R<sub>1031</sub>'' was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes.\n\nSince 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size.\n\nThe [[Cunningham project]] endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n== Demlo numbers ==\n[[D. R. Kaprekar]] has defined Demlo numbers as concatenation of a left, middle and right part, where the left and right part must be of the same length (up to a possible leading zero to the left) and must add up to a repdigit number, and the middle part may contain any additional number of this repeated digit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaprekar|1938}}, {{Harvnb|Gunjikar and Kaprekar|1939}}</ref> \nThey are named after [[Demlo]] railway station 30 miles from Bombay on the then [[G.I.P.

Primes that are repunits in [[Binary number|base 2]] are [[Mersenne prime]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe base-''b'' repunits are defined as (this ''b'' can be either positive or negative)\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}\\equiv 1 + b + b^2 + \\cdots + b^{n-1} = {b^n-1\\over{b-1}}\\qquad\\mbox{for }|b|\\ge2, n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(b)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base b representation. The first two repunits base ''b'' for ''n''=1 and ''n''=2 are \n:<math>R_1^{(b)}={b-1\\over{b-1}}= 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad R_2^{(b)}={b^2-1\\over{b-1}}= b+1\\qquad\\text{for}\\ |b|\\ge2.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ''[[decimal]] (base-10) repunits'' that are often referred to as simply ''repunits'' are defined as\n:<math>R_n\\equiv R_n^{(10)}={10^n-1\\over{10-1}}={10^n-1\\over9}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(10)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base 10 starts with\n: [[1 (number)|1]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[111 (number)|111]], 1111, 11111, 111111, ... {{OEIS|A002275}}.\n\nSimilarly, the repunits [[base 2]] are defined as\n:<math>R_n^{(2)}={2^n-1\\over{2-1}}={2^n-1}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(2)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne number]]s ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, they start with\n:1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ... {{OEIS|id=A000225}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n* Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite.  Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  For example,\n*: ''R''<sub>35</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = {{loop|35|1}} = 11111 \u00d7 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 \u00d7 10000001000000100000010000001,\n:since 35 = 7 \u00d7 5 = 5 \u00d7 7.  This repunit factorization does not depend on the base ''b'' in which the repunit is expressed.\n* If ''p'' is an odd prime, then every prime ''q'' that divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> must be either 1 plus a multiple of 2''p,'' or a factor of ''b - 1''. For example, a prime factor of ''R''<sub>29</sub> is 62003 = 1 + 2\u00b729\u00b71069. The reason is that the prime ''p'' is the smallest exponent greater than 1 such that ''q'' divides ''b<sup>p</sup>'' &minus; 1, because ''p'' is prime. Therefore, unless ''q'' divides ''b'' - 1, [[Carmichael function#Order of elements modulo n|''p'' divides the Carmichael function]] of ''q'', which is even and equal to ''q'' &minus; 1. \n*Any positive multiple of the repunit ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> contains at least ''n'' nonzero digits in base ''b''.\n* Any number ''x'' is a two-digit repunit in base x - 1.\n* The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base 5, 11111 in base 2) and 8191 (111 in base 90, 1111111111111 in base 2). The [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]] says there are only these two cases.\n* Using the [[pigeon-hole principle]] it can be easily shown that for each ''n'' and ''b'' such that ''n''  and ''b'' are [[Coprime integers|relatively prime]] there exists a repunit in base ''b'' that is a multiple of ''n''. To see this consider repunits ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>,...,''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>. Because there are ''n'' repunits but only ''n''-1 non-zero residues modulo ''n'' there exist two repunits ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> with 1\u2264''i''<''j''\u2264''n'' such that ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the same residue modulo ''n''. It follows that ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> has residue 0 modulo ''n'', i.e. is divisible by ''n''. ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''j'' - ''i'' ones followed by ''i'' zeroes. Thus, ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''j''-''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>  x ''b''<sup>''i''</sup> . Since ''n'' divides the left-hand side it also divides the right-hand side and since ''n'' and ''b'' are relatively prime ''n'' must divide ''R''<sub>''j''-''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>.\n* The [[Feit\u2013Thompson conjecture]] is that ''R''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>(''p'')</sup> never divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''q'')</sup> for two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q''.\n* Using the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] for repunits definition: ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = 1; ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''n''-1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> x ''b'' + 1, any consecutive repunits ''R''<sub>''n''-1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime in any base ''b'' for any ''n''.\n* If ''m'' and ''n'' have a common divisor ''d'', ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the common divisor ''R''<sub>''d''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> in any base ''b'' for any ''m'' and ''n''. That is, the repunits of a fixed base form a [[Divisibility sequence|strong divisibility sequence]]. As a consequence, If ''m'' and ''n'' are relatively prime, ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime. The Euclidean Algorithm is based on ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''gcd''(''m'' - ''n'', ''n'') for ''m'' > ''n''. Similarly, using ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''m''-''n''</sup> = ''R''<sub>''m''-''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, it can be easily shown that ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''-''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) for ''m'' > ''n''. Therefore if ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''d'', then ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''R<sub>d</sub>''<sup>(''b'')</sup>. \n\n== Factorization of decimal repunits ==\n\n(Prime factors colored {{color|red|red}} means \"new factors\", i. e. the prime factor divides ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> but does not divide ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> for all ''k'' < ''n'') {{OEIS|id=A102380}}<ref>For more information, see [http://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/ Factorization of repunit numbers].</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>1</sub> =||1\n|-\n|''R''<sub>2</sub> =||{{color|red|11}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>3</sub> =||{{color|red|3}} \u00b7 {{color|red|37}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>4</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|101}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>5</sub> =||{{color|red|41}} \u00b7 {{color|red|271}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>6</sub> =||3 \u00b7 {{color|red|7}} \u00b7 11 \u00b7 {{color|red|13}} \u00b7 37\n|-\n|''R''<sub>7</sub> =||{{color|red|239}} \u00b7 {{color|red|4649}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>8</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|73}} \u00b7 101 \u00b7 {{color|red|137}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>9</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|333667}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>10</sub> =||11 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|9091}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>11</sub> =||{{color|red|21649}} \u00b7 {{color|red|513239}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>12</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 {{color|red|9901}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>13</sub> =||{{color|red|53}} \u00b7 {{color|red|79}} \u00b7 {{color|red|265371653}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>14</sub> =||11 \u00b7 239 \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 {{color|red|909091}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>15</sub> =||3 \u00b7 {{color|red|31}} \u00b7 37 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|2906161}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>16</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|17}} \u00b7 73 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 137 \u00b7 {{color|red|5882353}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>17</sub> =||{{color|red|2071723}} \u00b7 {{color|red|5363222357}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>18</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 {{color|red|19}} \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|52579}} \u00b7 333667\n|-\n|''R''<sub>19</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|19|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>20</sub> =||11 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|3541}} \u00b7 9091 \u00b7 {{color|red|27961}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>21</sub> =||3 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|43}} \u00b7 239 \u00b7 {{color|red|1933}} \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 {{color|red|10838689}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>22</sub> =||11<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 {{color|red|23}} \u00b7 {{color|red|4093}} \u00b7 {{color|red|8779}} \u00b7 21649 \u00b7 513239\n|-\n|''R''<sub>23</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|23|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>24</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 73 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 137 \u00b7 9901 \u00b7 {{color|red|99990001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>25</sub> =||41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|21401}} \u00b7 {{color|red|25601}} \u00b7 {{color|red|182521213001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>26</sub> =||11 \u00b7 53 \u00b7 79 \u00b7 {{color|red|859}} \u00b7 265371653 \u00b7 {{color|red|1058313049}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>27</sub> =||3<sup>3</sup> \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|757}} \u00b7 333667 \u00b7 {{color|red|440334654777631}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>28</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|29}} \u00b7 101 \u00b7 239 \u00b7 {{color|red|281}} \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 909091 \u00b7 {{color|red|121499449}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>29</sub> =||{{color|red|3191}} \u00b7 {{color|red|16763}} \u00b7 {{color|red|43037}} \u00b7 {{color|red|62003}} \u00b7 {{color|red|77843839397}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>30</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 31 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 {{color|red|211}} \u00b7 {{color|red|241}} \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|2161}} \u00b7 9091 \u00b7 2906161\n|}\n|}\n\nSmallest prime factor of ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > 1 are\n:11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 239, 11, 3, 11, 21649, 3, 53, 11, 3, 11, 2071723, 3, 1111111111111111111, 11, 3, 11, 11111111111111111111111, 3, 41, 11, 3, 11, 3191, 3, 2791, 11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 2028119, 11, 3, 11, 83, 3, 173, 11, 3, 11, 35121409, 3, 239, 11, ... {{OEIS|id=A067063}}\n\n==Repunit primes==\nThe definition of repunits was motivated by recreational mathematicians looking for [[integer factorization|prime factors]] of such numbers.\n\nIt is easy to show that if ''n'' is divisible by ''a'', then ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> is divisible by ''R''<sub>''a''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>:\n\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}=\\frac{1}{b-1}\\prod_{d|n}\\Phi_d(b),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi_d(x)</math> is the <math>d^\\mathrm{th}</math> [[cyclotomic polynomial]] and ''d'' ranges over the divisors of ''n''.

''R<sub>p</sub>'' can be either prime or composite, the former examples, ''b'' = \u2212216, \u2212128, 4, 8, 16, 27, 36, 100, 128, 256, etc., the latter examples, ''b'' = \u2212243, \u2212125, \u221264, \u221232, \u221227, \u22128, 9, 25, 32, 49, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 289, etc., and ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can be prime (when ''p'' differs from 2) only if ''b'' is negative, a power of \u22122, for example, ''b'' = \u22128, \u221232, \u2212128, \u22128192, etc., in fact, the ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can also be composite, for example, ''b'' = \u2212512, \u22122048, \u221232768, etc. If ''n'' is not a prime power, then no base ''b'' repunit prime exists, for example, ''b'' = 64, 729 (with ''n'' = 6), ''b'' = 1024 (with ''n'' = 10), and ''b'' = \u22121 or 0 (with ''n'' any natural number). Another special situation is ''b'' = \u22124''k''<sup>4</sup>, with ''k'' positive integer, which has the [[aurifeuillean factorization]], for example, ''b'' = \u22124 (with ''k'' = 1, then ''R<sub>2</sub>'' and ''R<sub>3</sub>'' are primes), and ''b'' = \u221264, \u2212324, \u22121024, \u22122500, \u22125184, ...

Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the [[integer factorization|factorization]] by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to ''R<sub>16</sub>'' and many larger ones. By 1880, even ''R<sub>17</sub>'' to ''R<sub>36</sub>'' had been factored<ref name=\"Dickson1999\" /> and it is curious that, though [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] showed no prime below three million had period [[19 (number)|nineteen]], there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved ''R<sub>19</sub>'' to be prime in 1916<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|1988|pp=240\u2013246}}</ref> and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found ''R<sub>23</sub>'' to be prime in 1929.\n\nFurther advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. ''R<sub>317</sub>'' was found to be a [[probable prime]] circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when ''R<sub>1031</sub>'' was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes.\n\nSince 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size.\n\nThe [[Cunningham project]] endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n== Demlo numbers ==\n[[D. R.

The human eye normally contains only three types of color photoreceptors, known as long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S) [[cone cell]]s. These photoreceptor types respond to different degrees across the visible electromagnetic spectrum. The S cone response is generally assumed to be negligible at long wavelengths greater than about 560&nbsp;nm while the L and M cones respond across the entire visible spectrum.<ref name=\"stockmansharpe2006\">{{cite journal\n| last1   = Stockman\n| first1  = Andrew\n| last2   = Sharpe\n| first2  = Lindsay, T.\n| title   = Physiologically-based colour matching functions\n| journal = Proceedings of the ISCC/CIE Expert Symposium '06: 75 Years of the CIE Standard Colorimetric Observer\n| date    = 2006\n| pages   = 13\u201320\n| url     = http://cvrl.ucl.ac.uk/people/Stockman/pubs/2006%20Physiological%20CMFs%20SS.pdf\n}}</ref> The LMS primaries are imaginary since there is no visible wavelength that stimulates only one type of cone (i.e., humans cannot normally see a color that corresponds to pure L, M or S stimulation). The LMS primaries are complete since every visible color can be mapped to a triplet specifying the coordinates in [[LMS color space]].\n\n[[File:Normalized Cone Sensitivities.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Normalized cone [[spectral sensitivity]] curves]]\n\nThe L, M and S response curves (''cone fundamentals'') were deduced from ''color matching functions'' obtained from controlled color matching experiments (e.g., [[CIE 1931]]) where observers matched the color of a surface illuminated by monochromatic light with mixtures of three monochromatic primary lights illuminating a juxtaposed surface. Practical applications generally use a canonical linear transformation of LMS space known as [[CIEXYZ]]. The X, Y, and Z primaries are typically more useful since luminance (Y) is specified separately from a color's chromaticity.  Any color space primaries which can be mapped to physiologically relevant LMS primaries by a linear transformation are necessarily either imaginary or incomplete or both. The color-matching context is always three dimensional (since LMS space is three dimensional) but more general ''color appearance'' models like [[CIECAM02]] describe color in six dimensions and can be used to predict how colors appear under different viewing conditions.\n\nThus for trichromats like humans, we use three (or more) primaries for most general purposes.<ref>{{cite book\n| title  = Colour Design: Theories and Applications\n| last1  = Best\n| first1 = Janet\n| date   = 2017\n| isbn   = 978-0-08-101889-7\n| page   = 9\n| url    = https://books.google.com/?id=GfqpDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=trichromat+three-primaries+human+tetrachromat#v=onepage&q=trichromat%20three-primaries%20human%20tetrachromat&f=false\n}}</ref> Two primaries would be unable to produce even some of the most common among the named colors.

Meanwhile, [[birds]] and [[marsupials]] have four color photoreceptors in their eyes, and hence are [[tetrachromats]].

The human eye normally contains only three types of color photoreceptors, known as long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S) [[cone cell]]s. These photoreceptor types respond to different degrees across the visible electromagnetic spectrum. The S cone response is generally assumed to be negligible at long wavelengths greater than about 560&nbsp;nm while the L and M cones respond across the entire visible spectrum.<ref name=\"stockmansharpe2006\">{{cite journal\n| last1   = Stockman\n| first1  = Andrew\n| last2   = Sharpe\n| first2  = Lindsay, T.\n| title   = Physiologically-based colour matching functions\n| journal = Proceedings of the ISCC/CIE Expert Symposium '06: 75 Years of the CIE Standard Colorimetric Observer\n| date    = 2006\n| pages   = 13\u201320\n| url     = http://cvrl.ucl.ac.uk/people/Stockman/pubs/2006%20Physiological%20CMFs%20SS.pdf\n}}</ref> The LMS primaries are imaginary since there is no visible wavelength that stimulates only one type of cone (i.e., humans cannot normally see a color that corresponds to pure L, M or S stimulation). The LMS primaries are complete since every visible color can be mapped to a triplet specifying the coordinates in [[LMS color space]].\n\n[[File:Normalized Cone Sensitivities.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Normalized cone [[spectral sensitivity]] curves]]\n\nThe L, M and S response curves (''cone fundamentals'') were deduced from ''color matching functions'' obtained from controlled color matching experiments (e.g., [[CIE 1931]]) where observers matched the color of a surface illuminated by monochromatic light with mixtures of three monochromatic primary lights illuminating a juxtaposed surface. Practical applications generally use a canonical linear transformation of LMS space known as [[CIEXYZ]]. The X, Y, and Z primaries are typically more useful since luminance (Y) is specified separately from a color's chromaticity.  Any color space primaries which can be mapped to physiologically relevant LMS primaries by a linear transformation are necessarily either imaginary or incomplete or both. The color-matching context is always three dimensional (since LMS space is three dimensional) but more general ''color appearance'' models like [[CIECAM02]] describe color in six dimensions and can be used to predict how colors appear under different viewing conditions.\n\nThus for trichromats like humans, we use three (or more) primaries for most general purposes.<ref>{{cite book\n| title  = Colour Design: Theories and Applications\n| last1  = Best\n| first1 = Janet\n| date   = 2017\n| isbn   = 978-0-08-101889-7\n| page   = 9\n| url    = https://books.google.com/?id=GfqpDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=trichromat+three-primaries+human+tetrachromat#v=onepage&q=trichromat%20three-primaries%20human%20tetrachromat&f=false\n}}</ref> Two primaries would be unable to produce even some of the most common among the named colors.

Meanwhile, [[birds]] and [[marsupials]] have four color photoreceptors in their eyes, and hence are [[tetrachromats]]. There is one scholarly report of a functional human tetrachromat.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1   = Jordan\n| first1  = G.\n| last2   = Deeb\n| first2  = S. S.\n| last3   = Bosten\n| first3  = J.

Measuring functional spectral discrimination in non-human animals is challenging due to the difficulty in performing psychophysical experiments on creatures with limited behavioral repertoires who cannot respond using language. Limitations in the discriminative ability of shrimp having twelve distinct color photoreceptors have demonstrated that having more cell types in itself need not always correlate with better functional color vision.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1   = Morrison\n| first1  = Jessica\n| title   = Mantis shrimp's super colour vision debunked\n| journal = Nature\n| date    = 23 January 2014\n| doi     = 10.1038/nature.2014.14578\n}}</ref>\n\n== Psychological primaries ==\n[[File:Opponent colors.svg|upright=1.2|thumb|Approximations within the sRGB gamut to the \"aim colors\" of the [[Natural Color System]], a model based on the [[opponent process]] theory of color vision.]]\n{{Main|Opponent process}}\n\nThe [[opponent process]] is a color theory that states that the human [[visual system]] interprets information about [[color]] by processing signals from [[cone cell|cones]] and [[rod cell|rods]] in an antagonistic manner.  The theory states that every color can be described as a mix along the three axes of red vs. green, blue vs. yellow and white vs. black.  The six colors from the pairs might be called \"psychological primary colors\" because any other color could be described in terms of some combination of these pairs.
