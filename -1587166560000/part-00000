The present snap pea originated from Dr. Calvin Lamborn's cross between a shelling pea mutant found in 1952 by Dr. M.C. Parker and a snow pea cultivar. Researchers at [[Twin Falls, Idaho]] hoped that the cross might counteract twisting and buckling seen in varieties at the time. With this cross, snap pea was recreated and the first new snap pea was released in 1979 under the name \u2018Sugar Snap\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=HONORING PLANT BREEDER Calvin Lamborn|url=http://www.fedcoseeds.com/seeds/articles/breeder_Lamborn.htm|website=Fedco Seeds|accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = A Midwest Gardener's Cookbook | first = Marian K. | last = Towne | year = 1996 | page = 32 | publisher = Indiana University Press | isbn = 0-253-21056-9 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=hUzB70owB1wC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=sugarsnap+peas}}</ref>\n\nSnap peas, like all other peas, are pod fruits. An edible-podded pea is similar to a garden, or English, pea, but the pod is less fibrous, and is edible when young. Pods of the edible-podded pea, including snap peas, do not have a membrane and do not open when ripe. At maturity, the pods grow to around 4\u20138&nbsp;cm in length. Pods contain three to eight peas. The plants are climbing, and pea sticks or a trellis or other support system is required for optimal growth. Some cultivars are capable of climbing to 2 m high but plants are more commonly around 1\u20131.3 m high, for ease of harvest and cultivation.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe snap pea is a cool season legume or fruit. It may be planted in spring as early as the soil can be worked. Seeds should be planted one to one-and-a-half inches (2,5\u20134&nbsp;cm) deep.  It tolerates light frost when young; it also has a wider adaptation and tolerance of higher temperatures than some other pea cultivars. Snap peas may grow to two metres (6.56 feet) or more, but more typically are about 1.3 metres (about four feet). They have a vining habit and require a trellis or similar support structure. They should get 4\u20136 hours of sunlight each day.\n\n=== Cultivars ===\nBelow is a list of several snap pea [[cultivar]]s currently available, ordered by days to maturity.  Days to maturity is from germination to edible pod stage; add about 7 days to estimate shell pea stage.  ''Amish Snap'' is the only true heirloom snap pea.  ''PMR'' indicates some degree of [[powdery mildew]] resistance; ''afila'' types, also called semi-leafless, maintain an erect, interlocked, plant habit that allows good air movement through the canopy and reduces risk from lodging and mold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/oregon-vegetables/peas-edible-pod|title= Oregon Vegetables / Peas, Edible-Pod|publisher=Oregon State University}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Sugar Ann, 52 days, 1984 [[All-America Selections|AAS]] winner<ref name=aas>{{cite web|title= AAS winners 1933 to present|url= http://www.all-americaselections.org/AAS_Winners.asp?Sort1=Year_Won&Sort2=DESC|access-date= 2011-10-24|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100204220637/http://www.all-americaselections.org/AAS_Winners.asp?Sort1=Year_Won&Sort2=DESC|archive-date= 2010-02-04|df= }}</ref>\n* Sugar Bon, 56 days\n* Amish Snap, 60 days, tall climber, [[Heirloom plant|heirloom]]<ref>{{cite web|title= Amish Snap Pea|url = http://www.seedsavers.org/onlinestore/pea/Pea-Amish-Snap.html | accessdate=2013-02-25}}</ref>\n* Cascadia, 60 days, PMR\n* Sugar Daddy, 60 days\n* Super Sugar Snap, 60 days, PMR, tall climber\n* Sugar Snap, 62 days, tall climber, 1979 AAS winner<ref name=aas/>\n* Sugar Lace II, 68 days, PMR, afila\n}}\n\n===Production===\nCommercial snap peas for export are produced in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Colombia]], [[Kenya]] and [[China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofresh-distribution.com/news/guatemala%E2%80%99s-snow-pea-peace-crop|title=Guatemala's snow pea: the peace crop|publisher=Eurofresh}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/149422/How-El-Ni%C3%B1o-affects-sugar-snap-production-in-Peru-and-Guatemala|title=How El Ni\u00f1o affects sugar snap production in Peru and Guatemala|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/156537/China-Start-of-sugar-snap,-snow-pea-export-season-to-Europe|title=China: Start of sugar snap, snow pea export season to Europe|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nSnap peas are often served in salads or eaten whole.

The present snap pea originated from Dr. Calvin Lamborn's cross between a shelling pea mutant found in 1952 by Dr. M.C. Parker and a snow pea cultivar. Researchers at [[Twin Falls, Idaho]] hoped that the cross might counteract twisting and buckling seen in varieties at the time. With this cross, snap pea was recreated and the first new snap pea was released in 1979 under the name \u2018Sugar Snap\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=HONORING PLANT BREEDER Calvin Lamborn|url=http://www.fedcoseeds.com/seeds/articles/breeder_Lamborn.htm|website=Fedco Seeds|accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = A Midwest Gardener's Cookbook | first = Marian K. | last = Towne | year = 1996 | page = 32 | publisher = Indiana University Press | isbn = 0-253-21056-9 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=hUzB70owB1wC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=sugarsnap+peas}}</ref>\n\nSnap peas, like all other peas, are pod fruits. An edible-podded pea is similar to a garden, or English, pea, but the pod is less fibrous, and is edible when young. Pods of the edible-podded pea, including snap peas, do not have a membrane and do not open when ripe. At maturity, the pods grow to around 4\u20138&nbsp;cm in length. Pods contain three to eight peas. The plants are climbing, and pea sticks or a trellis or other support system is required for optimal growth. Some cultivars are capable of climbing to 2 m high but plants are more commonly around 1\u20131.3 m high, for ease of harvest and cultivation.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe snap pea is a cool season legume or fruit. It may be planted in spring as early as the soil can be worked. Seeds should be planted one to one-and-a-half inches (2,5\u20134&nbsp;cm) deep.  It tolerates light frost when young; it also has a wider adaptation and tolerance of higher temperatures than some other pea cultivars. Snap peas may grow to two metres (6.56 feet) or more, but more typically are about 1.3 metres (about four feet). They have a vining habit and require a trellis or similar support structure. They should get 4\u20136 hours of sunlight each day.\n\n=== Cultivars ===\nBelow is a list of several snap pea [[cultivar]]s currently available, ordered by days to maturity.  Days to maturity is from germination to edible pod stage; add about 7 days to estimate shell pea stage.  ''Amish Snap'' is the only true heirloom snap pea.  ''PMR'' indicates some degree of [[powdery mildew]] resistance; ''afila'' types, also called semi-leafless, maintain an erect, interlocked, plant habit that allows good air movement through the canopy and reduces risk from lodging and mold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/content/peas-edible-pod|title= Oregon Vegetables / Peas, Edible-Pod|publisher=Oregon State University}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Sugar Ann, 52 days, 1984 [[All-America Selections|AAS]] winner<ref name=aas>{{cite web|title= AAS winners 1933 to present|url= http://www.all-americaselections.org/AAS_Winners.asp?Sort1=Year_Won&Sort2=DESC|access-date= 2011-10-24|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100204220637/http://www.all-americaselections.org/AAS_Winners.asp?Sort1=Year_Won&Sort2=DESC|archive-date= 2010-02-04|df= }}</ref>\n* Sugar Bon, 56 days\n* Amish Snap, 60 days, tall climber, [[Heirloom plant|heirloom]]<ref>{{cite web|title= Amish Snap Pea|url = http://www.seedsavers.org/onlinestore/pea/Pea-Amish-Snap.html | accessdate=2013-02-25}}</ref>\n* Cascadia, 60 days, PMR\n* Sugar Daddy, 60 days\n* Super Sugar Snap, 60 days, PMR, tall climber\n* Sugar Snap, 62 days, tall climber, 1979 AAS winner<ref name=aas/>\n* Sugar Lace II, 68 days, PMR, afila\n}}\n\n===Production===\nCommercial snap peas for export are produced in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Colombia]], [[Kenya]] and [[China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofresh-distribution.com/news/guatemala%E2%80%99s-snow-pea-peace-crop|title=Guatemala's snow pea: the peace crop|publisher=Eurofresh}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/149422/How-El-Ni%C3%B1o-affects-sugar-snap-production-in-Peru-and-Guatemala|title=How El Ni\u00f1o affects sugar snap production in Peru and Guatemala|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/156537/China-Start-of-sugar-snap,-snow-pea-export-season-to-Europe|title=China: Start of sugar snap, snow pea export season to Europe|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nSnap peas are often served in salads or eaten whole.

The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]] and [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket, alongside [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Noah Taylor]], [[Missi Pyle]], [[James Fox]], [[Deep Roy]], and [[Christopher Lee]]. The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.\n\nDevelopment for a second adaptation of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (filmed previously as ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' in 1971) began in 1991, which resulted in [[Warner Bros.]] providing the Dahl Estate with total [[artistic control]]. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as [[Gary Ross]], [[Rob Minkoff]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Tom Shadyac]] had been involved, while actors [[Bill Murray]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Will Smith]], [[Adam Sandler]], and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka.\n\nBurton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and [[Danny Elfman]] aboard. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' represents the first time since ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (which was produced by Burton) that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was released to positive critical reviews and was a box office success, grossing $475 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=charliechocolate.htm|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Charlie Bucket]] is a poor boy who lives near the Wonka Candy Company. The company's owner, [[Willy Wonka]], has long closed his factory due to problems concerning [[industrial espionage]] that led him to fire all his employees, including Charlie's [[Grandpa Joe]]. Charlie's father, meanwhile, has recently been made redundant at work.\n\nOne day, Wonka announces a contest in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random [[Wonka Bar]]s worldwide, and the winners will receive a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one will receive a special prize at the end of the tour. Wonka's sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found fairly quickly. The recipients are [[Augustus Gloop]], a gluttonous German boy; [[Veruca Salt (character)|Veruca Salt]], a [[Spoiled child|spoiled]] English girl; [[Violet Beauregarde]], an arrogant gum chewer; and [[Mike Teavee]], an ill-tempered television and video game addict. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in [[Russia]], Charlie finds a ten-dollar note, and purchases a Wonka Bar at a news shop. At the exact moment it is revealed that the Russian ticket was forged, and Charlie discovers the real ticket inside the wrapper. Charlie receives monetary offers for the ticket, but after a pep talk from  Grandpa George (who tells Charlie that \"only a dummy\" would give up an extremely rare golden ticket \"for something as common as money\"), decides to keep it and bring Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the factory tour.\n\nCharlie and the other ticket holders are greeted outside the factory by Wonka, who then leads them into the facility. Individual character flaws cause four children to give into temptation, resulting in their elimination from the tour, while the [[Oompa-Loompa]]s sing a song of morality after each elimination. During the tour, flashbacks reveal Wonka's troubled past; his father, a prominent dentist named Wilbur, strictly forbade Wonka from consuming candy due to the potential risk to his teeth, and also made Wonka wear uncomfortable braces. After sneaking over a piece of candy, Wonka was instantly hooked, and ran away from home to follow his dreams. When he returned, both his father and their house were gone. After the tour, the four children leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their elimination, while Charlie learns Wonka intended to find a worthy heir to his factory. Since Charlie was the \"least rotten\" of the five, Wonka invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, on the condition that Charlie leave his family behind, just as Wonka did. Charlie declines, as his family is the most important thing in his life.\n\nCharlie and his family live contently a while later; however, Wonka is too depressed to make candy the way he used to, causing his candy to sell poorly and his company to decline. He turns to Charlie for advice. Charlie decides to help Wonka confront and reconcile with his estranged father; Wonka finally realizes the value of family, while his father learns to accept his son for who he is, and not what he does. Afterward, Wonka allows Charlie and his family to move into the factory together.\n\n==Cast==<!--First-billed only.-->\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]]\n** [[Blair Dunlop]] as Young Willy Wonka\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Charlie Bucket|Charlie Bucket]]\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Grandpa Joe|Grandpa Joe]]\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mrs. Bucket]]\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mr. Bucket]]\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mrs. Beauregarde]]\n* [[James Fox (actor)|James Fox]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mr. Salt]]\n* [[Adam Godley]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mr. Teavee]]\n* [[Franziska Troegner]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mrs. Gloop]]\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Dr. Wilbur Wonka]]\n* [[Deep Roy]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Oompa-Loompas|Oompa-Loompa]]s (with vocal work by [[Danny Elfman]])\n* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Violet Beauregarde|Violet Beauregarde]]\n* [[Philip Wiegratz]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Augustus Gloop|Augustus Gloop]]\n*[[:sv:Julia Winter|Julia Winter]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Veruca Salt|Veruca Salt]]\n* [[Jordan Fry]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Mike Teavee|Mike Teavee]]\n* [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Grandma Georgina]]\n* [[Eileen Essell]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Grandma Josephine]]\n* [[David Morris (actor)|David Morris]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Grandpa George]]\n* [[Geoffrey Holder]] as the Narrator \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Catcf-logo.svg|200px|thumb|right|The film's logo]]\n\nAuthor [[Roald Dahl]] disapproved of the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|1971 film adaptation]] and declined the [[film rights]] to produce the sequel, ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]''.<ref name=\"difficult\">{{cite news | author = Rob Waugh | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131143566.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142557/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131143566.html | url-status=dead | archive-date = June 12, 2018 | title = Sweet Smell of Success | work = [[The Mail on Sunday]] | via = [[HighBeam Research]] | date = April 3, 2005 | accessdate = July 12, 2009}}</ref> Warner Bros. and [[Brillstein Entertainment Partners|Brillstein-Grey Entertainment]] entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''.

As a consequence of [[Equity (trade union)|British Equity]] rules, which state that children can only work four and a half hours a day, filming for ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' took six months, ending in December 2004.<ref name=\"faber\" />\n\n===Design===\nThe architecture of the Bucket family home was influenced by Burton's visit to Roald Dahl's writing hut. Like the book, the film has a \"timeless\" setting and is not set in a specific country. \"We've tried not to pinpoint it to any place,\" production designer [[Alex McDowell]] explained. \"The cars, in fact, drive down the middle of the road.\"<ref name=\"nut\" /> The town, whose design was shaped by the black and white urban photography of [[Bill Brandt]], as well as [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Northern England]], is arranged like a medieval village, with Wonka's estate on top and the Bucket shack below.<ref name=\"nut\" /> The filmmakers also used [[fascist architecture]] for Wonka's factory exterior, and designed most of the sets on 360\u00b0 [[sound stage]]s, similar to [[cyclorama]]s. Burton biographer Mark Salisbury wrote that ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' \"melds 1950s and '70s visuals with a futuristic sensibility that seems straight out of a 1960s sense of the future.\"<ref name=\"faber\" /> The \"TV Room\" was patterned after photographs from the films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'', and ''[[THX 1138]]''. ''Danger Diabolik'' also served as inspiration for the Nut Room and Inventing Room.<ref name=\"faber\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nTim Burton avoided using too many digital effects because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment.<ref>{{cite news | author = Jamie Graham | title = 2005 Summer Preview: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | date = May 2005 | work = [[Total Film]] }}</ref> As a result, [[forced perspective]] techniques, oversized props and [[scale model]]s were used to avoid [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref name=\"faber\" /> [[Deep Roy]] was cast to play the [[List of characters in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory#Oompa-Loompas|Oompa-Loompas]] based on his previous collaborations with Burton on ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and ''[[Big Fish]]''. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen photography]], digital and [[front projection effect]]s.<ref name=\"truth\" /> \"Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots&nbsp;\u2014 all they do is work, work, work,\" Roy commented. \"So when it comes time to dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps.\"<ref name=\"Roy\">{{cite news | author = Michelle Kung | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1078767,00.html | title = I, Oompa-Loompa | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = July 8, 2005 | accessdate = June 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\nA practical method was considered for the scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for the beginnings of the swelling scene, before the decision was made to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.\n\nRather than rely on CGI, Burton wanted the 40 [[squirrel]]s in the Nut Room to be real. The animals were trained every day for 10 weeks before filming commenced. They began their coaching while newborns, fed by bottles to form relationships with human trainers. The squirrels were each taught how to sit upon a little blue bar stool, tap and then open a walnut, and deposit its meat onto a conveyor belt.<ref name=\"nut\" /> \"Ultimately, the scene was supplemented by CGI and [[animatronics]],\" Burton said, \"but for the close-ups and the main action, they're the real thing.\"<ref name=\"faber\" /> Wonka's Viking boat for the Chocolate River sequence floats down a realistic river filled with 192,000 gallons of faux melted chocolate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.technologytell.com/hometech/82983/hometechtell-review-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-blu-ray/|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Blu-Ray review |date=January 30, 2012 |publisher=TechnologyTell |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref> \"Having seen the first film, we wanted to make the chocolate river look edible,\" McDowell said. \"In the first film, it's so distasteful.\" The production first considered a CGI river, but Burton was impressed with the artificial substance when he saw how it clung to the boat's oars. Nine shades of chocolate were tested before Burton settled on the proper [[hue]].<ref name=\"nut\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Further|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (soundtrack)}}\nThe original music score was written by [[Danny Elfman]], a frequent collaborator with director [[Tim Burton]]. Elfman's score is based around three primary themes: a gentle family theme for the Buckets, generally set in upper [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]]; a mystical, string-driven [[waltz]] for Willy Wonka; and a hyper-upbeat factory theme for full orchestra, Elfman's homemade [[synthesizer]] samples and the diminutive chanting voices of the Oompa-Loompas.<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite web|url=http://chocolatefactorymovie.warnerbros.com/about/production.html |title=Production Notes |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] |accessdate=August 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801051357/http://chocolatefactorymovie.warnerbros.com/about/production.html |archivedate=August 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nElfman also wrote and performed the vocals for four songs, with pitch changes and modulations to represent different singers.<ref name=\"elfman\" /> The lyrics to the Oompa-Loompa songs are adapted from the original book, and are thus credited to [[Roald Dahl]].<ref name=\"notes\" /> Following Burton's suggestion, each song in the score is designed to reflect a different [[archetype]].<ref name=\"elfman\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DANNY+ELFMAN+GOES+(CHOCOLATE-COVERED)+NUTS.(U)-a0134078803|title=DANNY ELFMAN GOES (CHOCOLATE-COVERED) NUTS|author=Rob Lowman|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=July 15, 2005|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}</ref> \"Wonka's Welcome Song\" is a maddeningly cheerful theme park ditty, \"Augustus Gloop\" a [[Bollywood]] spectacle (per [[Deep Roy]]'s suggestion),<ref name=\"Roy\" /> \"Violet Beauregarde\" is 1970s [[funk]], \"Veruca Salt\" is 1960s [[bubblegum pop]] / [[psychedelic pop]], and \"Mike Teavee\" is a tribute to late 1970s [[hard rock]] (such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) and early 1980s [[Glam metal|hair bands]].<ref name=\"notes\" /><ref name=\"elfman\" />\n\nThe original motion picture [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was released on July 12, 2005 by [[Warner Bros.

The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]] and [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket, alongside [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Noah Taylor]], [[Missi Pyle]], [[James Fox]], [[Deep Roy]], and [[Christopher Lee]]. The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.\n\nDevelopment for a second adaptation of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (filmed previously as ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' in 1971) began in 1991, which resulted in [[Warner Bros.]] providing the Dahl Estate with total [[artistic control]]. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as [[Gary Ross]], [[Rob Minkoff]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Tom Shadyac]] had been involved, while actors [[Bill Murray]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Will Smith]], [[Adam Sandler]], and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka.\n\nBurton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and [[Danny Elfman]] aboard. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' represents the first time since ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (which was produced by Burton) that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was released to positive critical reviews and was a box office success, grossing $475 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=charliechocolate.htm|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Charlie Bucket]] is a poor boy who lives near the Wonka Candy Company. The company's owner, [[Willy Wonka]], has long closed his factory due to problems concerning [[industrial espionage]] that led him to fire all his employees, including Charlie's [[Grandpa Joe]]. Charlie's father, meanwhile, has recently been made redundant at work.\n\nOne day, Wonka announces a contest in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random [[Wonka Bar]]s worldwide, and the winners will receive a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one will receive a special prize at the end of the tour. Wonka's sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found fairly quickly. The recipients are [[Augustus Gloop]], a gluttonous German boy; [[Veruca Salt (character)|Veruca Salt]], a [[Spoiled child|spoiled]] English girl; [[Violet Beauregarde]], an arrogant gum chewer; and [[Mike Teavee]], an ill-tempered television and video game addict. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in [[Russia]], Charlie finds a ten-dollar note, and purchases a Wonka Bar at a news shop. At the exact moment it is revealed that the Russian ticket was forged, and Charlie discovers the real ticket inside the wrapper. Charlie receives monetary offers for the ticket, but after a pep talk from  Grandpa George (who tells Charlie that \"only a dummy\" would give up an extremely rare golden ticket \"for something as common as money\"), decides to keep it and bring Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the factory tour.\n\nCharlie and the other ticket holders are greeted outside the factory by Wonka, who then leads them into the facility. Individual character flaws cause four children to give into temptation, resulting in their elimination from the tour, while the [[Oompa-Loompa]]s sing a song of morality after each elimination. During the tour, flashbacks reveal Wonka's troubled past; his father, a prominent dentist named Wilbur, strictly forbade Wonka from consuming candy due to the potential risk to his teeth, and also made Wonka wear uncomfortable braces. After sneaking over a piece of candy, Wonka was instantly hooked, and ran away from home to follow his dreams. When he returned, both his father and their house were gone. After the tour, the four children leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their elimination, while Charlie learns Wonka intended to find a worthy heir to his factory. Since Charlie was the \"least rotten\" of the five, Wonka invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, on the condition that Charlie leave his family behind, just as Wonka did. Charlie declines, as his family is the most important thing in his life.\n\nCharlie and his family live contently a while later; however, Wonka is too depressed to make candy the way he used to, causing his candy to sell poorly and his company to decline. He turns to Charlie for advice. Charlie decides to help Wonka confront and reconcile with his estranged father; Wonka finally realizes the value of family, while his father learns to accept his son for who he is, and not what he does. Afterward, Wonka allows Charlie and his family to move into the factory together.\n\n==Cast==<!--First-billed only.-->\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]]\n** [[Blair Dunlop]] as Young Willy Wonka\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Charlie Bucket|Charlie Bucket]]\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Grandpa Joe|Grandpa Joe]]\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mrs. Bucket]]\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mr. Bucket]]\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mrs. Beauregarde]]\n* [[James Fox (actor)|James Fox]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mr. Salt]]\n* [[Adam Godley]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mr. Teavee]]\n* [[Franziska Troegner]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Mrs. Gloop]]\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Dr. Wilbur Wonka]]\n* [[Deep Roy]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Oompa-Loompas|Oompa-Loompa]]s (with vocal work by [[Danny Elfman]])\n* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Violet Beauregarde|Violet Beauregarde]]\n* [[Philip Wiegratz]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Augustus Gloop|Augustus Gloop]]\n* Julia Winter as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Veruca Salt|Veruca Salt]]\n* [[Jordan Fry]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Mike Teavee|Mike Teavee]]\n* [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Grandma Georgina]]\n* [[Eileen Essell]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Grandma Josephine]]\n* [[David Morris (actor)|David Morris]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Others|Grandpa George]]\n* [[Geoffrey Holder]] as the Narrator \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Catcf-logo.svg|200px|thumb|right|The film's logo]]\n\nAuthor [[Roald Dahl]] disapproved of the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|1971 film adaptation]] and declined the [[film rights]] to produce the sequel, ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]''.<ref name=\"difficult\">{{cite news | author = Rob Waugh | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131143566.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142557/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131143566.html | url-status=dead | archive-date = June 12, 2018 | title = Sweet Smell of Success | work = [[The Mail on Sunday]] | via = [[HighBeam Research]] | date = April 3, 2005 | accessdate = July 12, 2009}}</ref> Warner Bros. and [[Brillstein Entertainment Partners|Brillstein-Grey Entertainment]] entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''.

As a consequence of [[Equity (trade union)|British Equity]] rules, which state that children can only work four and a half hours a day, filming for ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' took six months, ending in December 2004.<ref name=\"faber\" />\n\n===Design===\nThe architecture of the Bucket family home was influenced by Burton's visit to Roald Dahl's writing hut. Like the book, the film has a \"timeless\" setting and is not set in a specific country. \"We've tried not to pinpoint it to any place,\" production designer [[Alex McDowell]] explained. \"The cars, in fact, drive down the middle of the road.\"<ref name=\"nut\" /> The town, whose design was shaped by the black and white urban photography of [[Bill Brandt]], as well as [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Northern England]], is arranged like a medieval village, with Wonka's estate on top and the Bucket shack below.<ref name=\"nut\" /> The filmmakers also used [[fascist architecture]] for Wonka's factory exterior, and designed most of the sets on 360\u00b0 [[sound stage]]s, similar to [[cyclorama]]s. Burton biographer Mark Salisbury wrote that ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' \"melds 1950s and '70s visuals with a futuristic sensibility that seems straight out of a 1960s sense of the future.\"<ref name=\"faber\" /> The \"TV Room\" was patterned after photographs from the films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'', and ''[[THX 1138]]''. ''Danger Diabolik'' also served as inspiration for the Nut Room and Inventing Room.<ref name=\"faber\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nTim Burton avoided using too many digital effects because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment.<ref>{{cite news | author = Jamie Graham | title = 2005 Summer Preview: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | date = May 2005 | work = [[Total Film]] }}</ref> As a result, [[forced perspective]] techniques, oversized props and [[scale model]]s were used to avoid [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref name=\"faber\" /> [[Deep Roy]] was cast to play the [[List of characters in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory#Oompa-Loompas|Oompa-Loompas]] based on his previous collaborations with Burton on ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and ''[[Big Fish]]''. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen photography]], digital and [[front projection effect]]s.<ref name=\"truth\" /> \"Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots&nbsp;\u2014 all they do is work, work, work,\" Roy commented. \"So when it comes time to dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps.\"<ref name=\"Roy\">{{cite news | author = Michelle Kung | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1078767,00.html | title = I, Oompa-Loompa | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = July 8, 2005 | accessdate = June 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\nA practical method was considered for the scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for the beginnings of the swelling scene, before the decision was made to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.\n\nRather than rely on CGI, Burton wanted the 40 [[squirrel]]s in the Nut Room to be real. The animals were trained every day for 10 weeks before filming commenced. They began their coaching while newborns, fed by bottles to form relationships with human trainers. The squirrels were each taught how to sit upon a little blue bar stool, tap and then open a walnut, and deposit its meat onto a conveyor belt.<ref name=\"nut\" /> \"Ultimately, the scene was supplemented by CGI and [[animatronics]],\" Burton said, \"but for the close-ups and the main action, they're the real thing.\"<ref name=\"faber\" /> Wonka's Viking boat for the Chocolate River sequence floats down a realistic river filled with 192,000 gallons of faux melted chocolate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.technologytell.com/hometech/82983/hometechtell-review-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-blu-ray/|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Blu-Ray review |date=January 30, 2012 |publisher=TechnologyTell |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref> \"Having seen the first film, we wanted to make the chocolate river look edible,\" McDowell said. \"In the first film, it's so distasteful.\" The production first considered a CGI river, but Burton was impressed with the artificial substance when he saw how it clung to the boat's oars. Nine shades of chocolate were tested before Burton settled on the proper [[hue]].<ref name=\"nut\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Further|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (soundtrack)}}\nThe original music score was written by [[Danny Elfman]], a frequent collaborator with director [[Tim Burton]]. Elfman's score is based around three primary themes: a gentle family theme for the Buckets, generally set in upper [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]]; a mystical, string-driven [[waltz]] for Willy Wonka; and a hyper-upbeat factory theme for full orchestra, Elfman's homemade [[synthesizer]] samples and the diminutive chanting voices of the Oompa-Loompas.<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite web|url=http://chocolatefactorymovie.warnerbros.com/about/production.html |title=Production Notes |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] |accessdate=August 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801051357/http://chocolatefactorymovie.warnerbros.com/about/production.html |archivedate=August 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nElfman also wrote and performed the vocals for four songs, with pitch changes and modulations to represent different singers.<ref name=\"elfman\" /> The lyrics to the Oompa-Loompa songs are adapted from the original book, and are thus credited to [[Roald Dahl]].<ref name=\"notes\" /> Following Burton's suggestion, each song in the score is designed to reflect a different [[archetype]].<ref name=\"elfman\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DANNY+ELFMAN+GOES+(CHOCOLATE-COVERED)+NUTS.(U)-a0134078803|title=DANNY ELFMAN GOES (CHOCOLATE-COVERED) NUTS|author=Rob Lowman|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=July 15, 2005|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}</ref> \"Wonka's Welcome Song\" is a maddeningly cheerful theme park ditty, \"Augustus Gloop\" a [[Bollywood]] spectacle (per [[Deep Roy]]'s suggestion),<ref name=\"Roy\" /> \"Violet Beauregarde\" is 1970s [[funk]], \"Veruca Salt\" is 1960s [[bubblegum pop]] / [[psychedelic pop]], and \"Mike Teavee\" is a tribute to late 1970s [[hard rock]] (such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) and early 1980s [[Glam metal|hair bands]].<ref name=\"notes\" /><ref name=\"elfman\" />\n\nThe original motion picture [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was released on July 12, 2005 by [[Warner Bros.
