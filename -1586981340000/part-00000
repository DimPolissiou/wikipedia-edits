It allows you to jump from a tank to a fighter jet in one gameplay session.}}</ref> Vehicles range from the [[interwar period]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]] to the [[Iraq War|Iraq war]] and beyond, with an emphasis on [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Game|url=http://warthunder.com/en/game/about|website=Warthunder.com|publisher=Gaijin Entertainment|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/war-thunder-review/1900-6415815/|title=War Thunder Review|first=Brett|last=Todd|date=10 July 2014|website=Gamespot.com|accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/war-thunder-review/|title=War Thunder review|first=Rob|last=Zacny|date=7 August 2014|website=Pcgamer.com|accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> Players can control aircraft, ground vehicles and warships from various nations, the major ones including the [[United States|USA]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]] and the [[USSR]]. The game itself is divided into three main categories: Aviation, Ground and Fleet with game modes divided between Arcade, Realistic and Simulator that offer different styles of battle.<ref name=\"pscrossplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.psu.com/news/war-thunder-ps4-xbox-one-cross-play-is-still-being-looked-at/ |title=War Thunder PS4 & Xbox One Cross-Play Is Still Being Looked At |last=Harradence |first=Michael |date=2 October 2019 |website=psu.com |publisher=Playstation Universe |access-date=16 March 2020 |quote=Players can take part in different styles of battles depending on their preferences, including Arcade, Realistic, and Simulation matches.}}</ref> In Aviation, gameplay is restricted to aircraft without helicopters whereas Ground Forces and Fleet will include their respective vehicle types of ground vehicles and warships alongside aircraft. A single player mode is available focusing on historical settings as well as a cooperative mode against AI ground vehicles and aircraft.<ref name=\"pscrossplay\"/>\n\n===Arcade Battles===\nIn this mode, the game draws two teams of players (of up to 16 players on each side) with vehicles from different nations of varying combat performance. It is possible to see vehicles of the same type on different teams, and different countries on the player's own team. Damage and physics are greatly simplified (e.g. in very high-speed dives planes do not have their [[Aeroelasticity|wings ripped off]] and are still controllable, and ground vehicles receive a boost in engine power), but retain some realism (e.g. bombers are not as maneuverable as fighters). In Arcade, there are mechanics that \u2014 while unrealistic \u2014 are meant to make the player's experience easier (e.g. aircraft are able to reload midair after running out of ammunition). There is also an indicator indicating where bombs and shells would land and showing whether shells would penetrate the opponent's vehicles or not. Everyone can see everyone in this game mode.\n\nFor aircraft, games are played in either Ground Strike, where in order to win players must destroy all enemy ground units, shoot down all enemy aircraft, and destroy the enemy airfield and bombing points; Domination, which consists of seizing neutral or enemy airfields by touching down on them for about five seconds, causing the enemy team to lose points; or Air Domination, which requires players to have total control over an area of airspace for long enough to capture it. To help simplify aiming, a 'leading marker' appears when an enemy plane is in range. This shows a prediction of where the enemy plane will be by the time the bullets of the smaller caliber weapon arrive if the plane continues its current trajectory.\n\nFor ground forces, Domination revolves around the capture of three strategic zones on the map, with Conquest featuring only one. In Break, the two teams must capture a series of points in order, while in Battle, each team has its own base zone and must prevent it from being captured.\n\n===Realistic Battles===\nPreviously called Historical Battles, this mode is designed for more advanced players, and offers more realistic physics and damage modeling, while retaining some of the simplistic elements of the interface and controls of Arcade Battles. For the majority of matches in this mode, players are selected to have only collaborating nations on each team, making it possible to recreate real scenarios, such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] between the Soviet Union and Germany.\n\nIn Air Realistic Battles, players do not have the option to respawn. Once ammunition or armaments are depleted, aircraft are required to land at their airfield to rearm, refuel and repair. Enemy aircraft receive range markers and nametags within a certain range, which varies depending on the angle and distance to the aircraft. The amount of bombers available to each team is also limited.\n\nIn Ground Realistic Battles, players get to use more than one vehicle per game through the use of Spawn Points, which are obtained by destroying enemy vehicles and capturing points. These capture points are essential for ground units to repair without a battle repair kit or to restock on ammunition. Aircraft and helicopters may also be used. Like the Air Realistic Battles mode, players do not have access to enemy player markers, penetration indicators, or range indicators (except for the separate rangefinder).\n\n====Simulator Battles====\nPreviously called Full Real Battles, Simulator Battles are based on Realistic Battles with further restrictions on the user's interface and controls; only the first-person view in the cockpit and external turret gunner views for aircraft are allowed in flight. Tank players are restricted to the gunner's scope, the driver's port / cabin, and a commander's perspective located above the vehicle. Additionally, aircraft can only be played in Full Real controls (there is no \"instructor\" to prevent the aircraft [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stalling]] and the mouse can only be used to simulate a joystick). Players retain the ability to utilize their aircraft's flaps, trim, and engine(s) in Simulator mode. The [[Heads-up display (video games)|Heads up display]] is available to display speed, altitude, heading, engine/throttle settings, oil and water temperatures, and basic vehicle damage status.\n\nPlayer tags are not given for enemy units and players, while tags for friendly units and players are only provided if they are within a certain distance of the player. Combined battles do not show markers above enemy or friendly units and players. Thus, players must pay particular attention when dealing with aircraft and tanks that are available to multiple nations, and vehicles that use [[roundels]] as decoration for countries other than their own through personal customization of the vehicles.\n\n=== Custom Battles ===\nCustom battles, available for air, ground, and naval vehicles alike, is a mode allowing for the creation of battles by individual players. The creator of the custom battle can select the map, game mode, and other settings; they can also set a password to restrict who can play.\n\n=== PvE ===\n\n[[Player_versus_environment|PvE]] \"Assault\" was introduced in patch 1.67. This is an \"Arcade\" tank or a plane game mode where players try to defend a base against waves of [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] attackers.\n\n===Events===\nEvents in ''War Thunder'' provide custom missions, usually based on one of the three main game modes, but with alternative settings regarding allowed vehicles, mission specifics, etc. Examples are the recreation of historical battles by restricting available vehicles (e.g. [[Battle of Britain]])\n\nTraditionally, the developers prepare unconventional events for [[April Fools' Day]]. The 2019 event named \"Earth Thunder\" is an event for April Fools 2019 in ''War Thunder'' where it takes place in an fictional American city named \"Green Hills\" where the players get to play with UFOs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warthunder.com/en/news/6128-special-earth-thunder-we-are-not-their-playthings-en|title=[Special] Earth Thunder: We are not their playthings!|website=Warthunder.com|accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> The 2018 event named \"Silent Thunder\" was based underwater, with submarines. For 2017, ''War Thunder'' made playable rank IX main battle tanks and attack helicopters. For 2016, ahead of the announcement of the naval forces update, ''War Thunder'' offered playable sailing ships of the 18th century fighting in the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Naval combat setting sail in War Thunder|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/404453/Naval+combat+setting+sail+in+War+Thunder/|website=Gamereactor.eu|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> The year before, a new game mode called \"Unrealistic Battles\" featured inflated rubber tanks firing potatoes and carrots.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unrealistic Battles|url=https://warthunder.com/en/news/2974/current/|website=Warthunder.com|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> Other notable examples include \"March to Victory\", introducing playable [[Mecha]] composed of tank parts;<ref>{{cite web|title=War Thunder - March to Victory Trailer|url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/war-thunder-march-to-victory-trailer/2300-6424215/|website=Gamespot.com|accessdate=12 January 2017|date=2015-08-20}}</ref> \"The Pony Nation\" introducing [[Equestria|the world]] of ''[[My Little Pony]]'' as a sixth playable faction (2013);<ref>{{cite news|author1=Sethisto|title=War Thunder Adds the Pony Nation |url=http://www.equestriadaily.com/2013/04/war-thunder-adds-pony-nation.html|accessdate=2 April 2015|work=Equestria Daily|date=1 April 2013}}</ref> , and \"Gaijilla\" was a battle against a giant [[Godzilla]]-like snail (2014).<ref>{{cite web|title=New Japanese war machine in War Thunder!|url=http://warthunder.com/en/news/514/current/|website=Warthunder.com|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign===\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\n\n===World War Mode===\nIn this game mode squadrons battle in historical settings from [[World War II|The Second World War]] to dominate the world.

The game itself is divided into three main categories: Aviation, Ground and Fleet with game modes divided between Arcade, Realistic and Simulator that offer different styles of battle.<ref name=\"pscrossplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.psu.com/news/war-thunder-ps4-xbox-one-cross-play-is-still-being-looked-at/ |title=War Thunder PS4 & Xbox One Cross-Play Is Still Being Looked At |last=Harradence |first=Michael |date=2 October 2019 |website=psu.com |publisher=Playstation Universe |access-date=16 March 2020 |quote=Players can take part in different styles of battles depending on their preferences, including Arcade, Realistic, and Simulation matches.}}</ref> In Aviation, gameplay is restricted to aircraft without helicopters whereas Ground Forces and Fleet will include their respective vehicle types of ground vehicles and warships alongside aircraft. A single player mode is available focusing on historical settings as well as a cooperative mode against AI ground vehicles and aircraft.<ref name=\"pscrossplay\"/>\n\n===Arcade Battles===\nIn this mode, the game draws two teams of players (of up to 16 players on each side) with vehicles from different nations of varying combat performance. It is possible to see vehicles of the same type on different teams, and different countries on the player's own team. Damage and physics are greatly simplified (e.g. in very high-speed dives planes do not have their [[Aeroelasticity|wings ripped off]] and are still controllable, and ground vehicles receive a boost in engine power), but retain some realism (e.g. bombers are not as maneuverable as fighters). In Arcade, there are mechanics that \u2014 while unrealistic \u2014 are meant to make the player's experience easier (e.g. aircraft are able to reload midair after running out of ammunition). There is also an indicator indicating where bombs and shells would land and showing whether shells would penetrate the opponent's vehicles or not. Everyone can see everyone in this game mode.\n\nFor aircraft, games are played in either Ground Strike, where in order to win players must destroy all enemy ground units, shoot down all enemy aircraft, and destroy the enemy airfield and bombing points; Domination, which consists of seizing neutral or enemy airfields by touching down on them for about five seconds, causing the enemy team to lose points; or Air Domination, which requires players to have total control over an area of airspace for long enough to capture it. To help simplify aiming, a 'leading marker' appears when an enemy plane is in range. This shows a prediction of where the enemy plane will be by the time the bullets of the smaller caliber weapon arrive if the plane continues its current trajectory.\n\nFor ground forces, Domination revolves around the capture of three strategic zones on the map, with Conquest featuring only one. In Break, the two teams must capture a series of points in order, while in Battle, each team has its own base zone and must prevent it from being captured.\n\n===Realistic Battles===\nPreviously called Historical Battles, this mode is designed for more advanced players, and offers more realistic physics and damage modeling, while retaining some of the simplistic elements of the interface and controls of Arcade Battles. For the majority of matches in this mode, players are selected to have only collaborating nations on each team, making it possible to recreate real scenarios, such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] between the Soviet Union and Germany.\n\nIn Air Realistic Battles, players do not have the option to respawn. Once ammunition or armaments are depleted, aircraft are required to land at their airfield to rearm, refuel and repair. Enemy aircraft receive range markers and nametags within a certain range, which varies depending on the angle and distance to the aircraft. The amount of bombers available to each team is also limited.\n\nIn Ground Realistic Battles, players get to use more than one vehicle per game through the use of Spawn Points, which are obtained by destroying enemy vehicles and capturing points. These capture points are essential for ground units to repair without a battle repair kit or to restock on ammunition. Aircraft and helicopters may also be used. Like the Air Realistic Battles mode, players do not have access to enemy player markers, penetration indicators, or range indicators (except for the separate rangefinder).\n\n====Simulator Battles====\nPreviously called Full Real Battles, Simulator Battles are based on Realistic Battles with further restrictions on the user's interface and controls; only the first-person view in the cockpit and external turret gunner views for aircraft are allowed in flight. Tank players are restricted to the gunner's scope, the driver's port / cabin, and a commander's perspective located above the vehicle. Additionally, aircraft can only be played in Full Real controls (there is no \"instructor\" to prevent the aircraft [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stalling]] and the mouse can only be used to simulate a joystick). Players retain the ability to utilize their aircraft's flaps, trim, and engine(s) in Simulator mode. The [[Heads-up display (video games)|Heads up display]] is available to display speed, altitude, heading, engine/throttle settings, oil and water temperatures, and basic vehicle damage status.\n\nPlayer tags are not given for enemy units and players, while tags for friendly units and players are only provided if they are within a certain distance of the player. Combined battles do not show markers above enemy or friendly units and players. Thus, players must pay particular attention when dealing with aircraft and tanks that are available to multiple nations, and vehicles that use [[roundels]] as decoration for countries other than their own through personal customization of the vehicles.\n\n=== Custom Battles ===\nCustom battles, available for air, ground, and naval vehicles alike, is a mode allowing for the creation of battles by individual players. The creator of the custom battle can select the map, game mode, and other settings; they can also set a password to restrict who can play.\n\n=== PvE ===\n\n[[Player_versus_environment|PvE]] \"Assault\" was introduced in patch 1.67. This is an \"Arcade\" tank or a plane game mode where players try to defend a base against waves of [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] attackers.\n\n===Events===\nEvents in ''War Thunder'' provide custom missions, usually based on one of the three main game modes, but with alternative settings regarding allowed vehicles, mission specifics, etc. Examples are the recreation of historical battles by restricting available vehicles (e.g. [[Battle of Britain]])\n\nTraditionally, the developers prepare unconventional events for [[April Fools' Day]]. The 2019 event named \"Earth Thunder\" is an event for April Fools 2019 in ''War Thunder'' where it takes place in an fictional American city named \"Green Hills\" where the players get to play with UFOs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warthunder.com/en/news/6128-special-earth-thunder-we-are-not-their-playthings-en|title=[Special] Earth Thunder: We are not their playthings!|website=Warthunder.com|accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> The 2018 event named \"Silent Thunder\" was based underwater, with submarines.

That district had previously been the [[Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district|12th]], represented by three-term Republican [[Keith Rothfus]]. The district had lost much of its eastern portion, centered around [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], becoming a more compact district northwest of Pittsburgh. While the old 12th was one of Trump's strongest districts in Pennsylvania in 2016, Trump would have only barely carried the new 17th. The new 17th also voted for Democrats down the ballot.

{"title_page": "Defective verb", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|{{Refimprove|date=February 2020}}\n{{unfocused|date=August 2011|reason=Whole article is unclear, even for one with a linguistics background, to a degree that makes editing difficult}}}}\n\nIn [[linguistics]], a '''defective verb''' is a [[verb]] with an incomplete [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], or one that cannot be used in some other way as normal verbs can. Defective verbs cannot be conjugated in certain [[grammatical tense|tenses]], [[grammatical aspect|aspects]], or [[grammatical mood|moods]].\n\n== English ==\n\n=== Common defectives ===\n<!--This article should mention that modal verbs = defective is an English thing!-->\nThe most commonly recognized defective verbs in [[English language|English]] are auxiliary<!--SHOULDN'T IT BE MODAL? (modal verbs are a type of auxiliary verb, so it is correct the way it is)--> verbs\u2014the class of [[preterite-present verb]]s\u2014''can/could'', ''may/might'', ''shall/should'', ''must'', ''ought to'', and ''will/would'' (''would'' being a later historical development). Though these verbs were not originally defective, in most varieties of English today, they occur only in a [[modal auxiliary]] sense. However, unlike normal auxiliary verbs, they are not regularly conjugated in the infinitive mood. Therefore, these defective auxiliaries do not accept each other as objects. Additionally, they do not regularly appear as participles.\n\nFor example, ''can'' lacks an infinitive, future tense, participle, imperative, and [[gerund]]. The missing parts of speech are instead supplied by using the appropriate forms of ''to be'' plus ''able to''. So, while ''I could write'' and ''I was able to write'' have the same meaning, ''I could'' has two meanings depending on use, which are ''I was able to'' or ''I would be able to''. One cannot say *''I will can'', which is instead expressed as ''I will be able to''. Similarly, ''must'' has no true past tense form, this instead being supplied by ''had'' (the past tense of have), and \"to have to\" in the infinitive, an example of composite conjugation. The past tense expressing the obligatory aspect of must is expressed as \"had to\", as in ''He had to go.'' \"Must have\", on the other hand, expresses probability or likelihood in modern English, e.g., ''\"If that's thunder, there must have been lightning.\"''\n\nSome verbs are becoming more defective as time goes on; for example, although ''might'' is etymologically the past tense ([[preterite]]) of ''may'', it is no longer generally used as such (*''he might not pass'' for \"he was forbidden to pass\"). Similarly, ''should'' is no longer used as the past of ''shall'', but with a separate meaning indicating possibility or moral obligation. (However, the use of the preterite form ''should'' as a [[English subjunctive|subjunctive form]] continues, as in ''If I should go there tomorrow, ...'', which contrasts with the indicative form ''I shall go there tomorrow''.) The defective verb ''ought'' was etymologically the past tense of ''owe'' (''the affection he ought his children''), but it has since split off, leaving ''owe'' as a non-defective verb with its original sense and a regular past tense (''owed'').\n\nBeyond the modal auxiliaries, ''beware'' is a fully-fledged defective verb of English: it is used as an imperative (''Beware of the dog'') and an infinitive (''I must beware of the dog''), but very rarely or never as a finite verb, especially with inflectional endings (*''bewared'', *''bewares''). The word ''begone'' is similar: any usage other than as an imperative is highly marked. Another defective verb is the archaic ''quoth'', a past tense which is the only surviving form of the verb ''quethe'', \"to say\" (related to ''bequeath'').\n\n=== Impersonal verbs ===\n[[Impersonal verb]]s such as ''to rain'' and ''to snow'' share some characteristics with the defective verbs in that forms such as ''I rain'' or ''they snow'' are not often found; however, the crucial distinction is that impersonal verbs are \"missing\" certain forms for semantic reasons\u2014in other words, the forms themselves exist and the verb is capable of being fully conjugated with all its forms (and is therefore not defective) but some forms are unlikely to be found because they appear meaningless or nonsensical.\n\nNevertheless, native speakers can typically use and understand metaphorical or even literal sentences where the \"meaningless\" forms exist, such as ''I rained on his parade.''\n\nContrast the impersonal verb ''rain'' (all the forms of which exist, even if they sometimes look semantically odd) with the defective verb ''can'' (only ''I can'' and ''I could'' are possible). In most cases, a synonym for the defective verb must be used instead (i.e. \"to be able to\"). (The forms with an asterisk (*) are impossible, at least with respect to the relevant sense of the verb; these phonemes may by coincidence be attested with respect to a [[homograph]] [as with \"canning\" = \"the act of preserving and [[Canning|packaging in cans]]\"].)\n\n== Arabic ==\nIn [[Arabic]], defective verbs are called {{lang-ar|\u0623\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u0645\u062f\u0629|translit=\u02beaf\u02bf\u0101l j\u0101midah}} (lit., ''solid verbs''). These verbs do not change tense, nor do they form related nouns. A famous example is the verb [[wikt:\u0644\u064a\u0633|\u0644\u064a\u0633]] ''laysa'', which translates as ''it is not'', though it is not the only auxiliary verb that exhibits this property. Some Arabic grammarians argue that [[wikt:\u062f\u0627\u0645#Arabic|\u062f\u0627\u0645 \"daama\"]] (as an auxiliary verb) is also completely defective; those who refute this claim still consider it partially defective. Some other partially defective verbs are \"[[wikt:\u0641\u062a\u0626|fati'a]]\" and ''[[wikt:\u0632\u0627\u0644|zaala]]'', which have neither an imperative form nor an infinitive form when used as auxiliary verbs.\n\n== Finnish ==\nAt least one Finnish verb lacks the first infinitive (dictionary/lemma) form. In Finnish, \"kutian helposti\" (\"I'm sensitive to tickling\") can be said, but for the verb \"kutian\" (here conjugated in singular first person, present tense) there is no non-conjugated form. Hypothetically, the first infinitive could be \"kudita\", but this form is not actually used. Additionally, the [[negative verb]] (ei, et, en, emme...) has neither an infinitive form nor a 1st person singular imperative form.\n\n== French ==\n''Falloir'' (\"to be necessary\", only the third-person forms with ''il'' exist; the present indicative conjugation (''il faut'') is certainly the most often used form of a defective verb in French), ''braire'' (\"to bray\", infinitive, present participle and third-person forms only),<ref>Girodet, Jean. ''Dictionnaire du bon fran\u00e7ais'', Bordas, 1981. {{ISBN|2-04-010580-8}},</ref> ''frire'' (\"to fry\", lacks non-compound past forms; speakers paraphrase with equivalent forms of ''faire frire''), ''clore'' (\"to conclude\", lacks an imperfect conjugation, as well as first and second person plural present indicative conjugations), ''g\u00e9sir'' (\"to lie\" in the sense of \"be in or assume a supine position\" (and is the verb used for gravestones), can only be conjugated in the present, imperfect, present imperative, present participle and extremely rarely, the simple future forms, lacking all other tenses). Impersonal verbs, such as weather verbs, function as they do in English.\n== German ==\nIn contemporary German, the verb ''erkiesen'', which means \"to choose/elect\" (usually referring to a person chosen for a special task or honour), is only used in the past participle (''erkoren'') and, more rarely, the past tense (''ich erkor'' etc.). All other forms, including the infinitive, have long become obsolete and are now unknown and unintelligible to modern speakers. It remains commonplace in the closely-related [[Dutch language]] as ''verkiezen'', e.g. [[:nl:Verkiezingen in Nederland|Verkiezingen in Nederland]] (Wikipedia in Dutch).\n\n==Classical Greek==\n\"No single [[Classical Greek|Greek]] verb shows all the tenses\", and \"most verbs have only six of\" the nine classes of tense-systems, and \"[s]carcely any verb shows all nine systems\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Smyth|first=Herbert Weir|author-link=Herbert Weir Smyth|title=Greek Grammar|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1956|orig-year=1920|isbn=0-674-36250-0|pages=108\u2013109}} \u00a7\u00a7362, 368a</ref>\n\nThe verb \u03c7\u03c1\u03ae (''khr\u0113'', 'it is necessary'), only exists in the third-person-singular present and imperfect \u1f10\u03c7\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd / \u03c7\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd (''ekhr\u0113n / khr\u0113n'', 'it was necessary').\n\nThere are also verbs like \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b1 (''oida'', 'I know'), which use the perfect form for the present and the pluperfect (here \u1f94\u03b4\u03b7 ''\u0113id\u0113'', 'I was knowing') for the imperfect.\n\nAdditionally, the verb \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af (''eimi'', 'I am') only has a present, a future and an imperfect \u2013 it lacks an aorist, a perfect, a pluperfect and a future perfect.\n\n== Hungarian ==\nSome [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] verbs have either no subjunctive forms or forms which sound uncommon to native speakers, e.g. ''csuklik'' ('hiccup'). See also [[:wikt:template:U:hu-disputed-defective-verb|a short summary about them]] in the English-language Wiktionary.\n\n== Irish ==\n''Arsa'' (\"says\") can only be used in past or present tenses. The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''is'' lacks a future tense, an imperative mood, and a verbal noun. It has no distinct conditional tense forms either, but conditional expressions are possible, expressed using past tense forms; for example ''Ba mhaith liom \u00e9'', which can mean both \"I liked it\" and \"I would like it\". The imperative mood is sometimes suppletively created by using the imperative forms of the substantive verb ''b\u00ed''. Future tense forms, however, are impossible and can only be expressed periphrastically.\n\nThere is also ''dar'' (\"[it] appears\"), a temporally independent verb that always appears in combination with the preposition ''le''.\n\n== Korean ==\nKorean has several defective verbs.  \ub9d0\ub2e4 (''malda'', \"to stop or desist\") may only be used in the imperative form or in the [[hortative]] form, after an 'action verb + \uc9c0 (''ji'')' construction. Within this scope it can still conjugate for different levels of politeness, such as \"\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8!\" (''Haji ma!'', \"Stop that!\") in contrast with \"\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624\" (''Haji masipsiyo'', \"Please, don't do that\").  Also, \ub370\ub9ac\ub2e4 (''derida'', \"to bring/pick up someone\") is only used as \ub370\ub9ac\uace0 (''derigo'', \"bringing X and...\"), \ub370\ub9ac\ub7ec (''derireo'', \"in order to pick up\"), or \ub370\ub824 (''deryeo'', infinitive) in some compound forms.\n\n== Latin ==\n[[Latin]] has defective verbs that possess forms only in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tense; such verbs have no present tense forms whatsoever. These verbs are still present in ''meaning''. For example, the first-person form ''odi'' (\"I hate\") and infinitive ''odisse'' (\"to hate\") appear to be the perfect of a hypothetical verb ''*odo/odio'', but in fact have a present-tense meaning.  Similarly, the verb ''memini'', ''meminisse'' is conjugated in the perfect, yet has a present meaning:\n\n{{block indent|memin\u012b}}\n{{block indent|meminist\u012b}}\n{{block indent|meminit}}\n{{block indent|meminimus}}\n{{block indent|meministis}}\n{{block indent|memin\u0113runt}}\n\nInstead of the past-tense \"I remembered\", \"you remembered\", etc., these forms signify the present-tense \"I remember\", \"you remember\", etc.  Latin defective verbs also possess regularly formed [[pluperfect]] forms with simple past tense meanings and [[future perfect]] forms with simple future tense meanings. Compare [[deponent verb|deponent verbs]], which are passive in form but active in meaning.\n\nThe verb ''coep\u012b'', ''coepisse'', which means \"to have begun\" or \"began\", is another verb that lacks a present tense system. However, it is not present in meaning. The verb ''incipi\u014d'', ''incipere'' (\"I begin,\" \"to begin\") is used in the present tense instead. This is not a case of [[suppletion]], however, because the verb ''incipere'' can also be used in the perfect.\n\nThe verbs ''inquit'' and ''ait'', both meaning \"said\", cannot be conjugated through all forms. Both verbs lack numerous inflected forms, with entire tenses and voices missing altogether.\n\n== Polish ==\n''wida\u0107'' (\"it is evident\") and ''s\u0142ycha\u0107'' (\"it is audible\") are both highly defective in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The only forms of these verbs that exist are the infinitives.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Portuguese ==\nA large number of [[Portuguese verbs]] are defective in [[Grammatical person|person]], i.e., they lack the proper form for one of the pronouns in some tense. The verb ''colorir'' (\"to color\") has no first-person singular in the present, thus requiring a paraphrase, like ''estou colorindo'' (\"I am coloring\") or the use of another verb of a similar meaning, like ''pintar'' (\"to paint\").\n\n== Russian ==\nSome [[Russian language|Russian]] verbs are defective, in that they lack a first person singular non-past form: for example, ''\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c'' (\"to win\"), ''\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c'' (\"to convince\"), ''\u0434\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c'' (\"to play the pipe\").

Defective verbs cannot be conjugated in certain [[grammatical tense|tenses]], [[grammatical aspect|aspects]], or [[grammatical mood|moods]].\n\n== English ==\n\n=== Common defectives ===\n<!--This article should mention that modal verbs = defective is an English thing!-->\nThe most commonly recognized defective verbs in [[English language|English]] are auxiliary<!--SHOULDN'T IT BE MODAL? (modal verbs are a type of auxiliary verb, so it is correct the way it is)--> verbs\u2014the class of [[preterite-present verb]]s\u2014''can/could'', ''may/might'', ''shall/should'', ''must'', ''ought to'', and ''will/would'' (''would'' being a later historical development). Though these verbs were not originally defective, in most varieties of English today, they occur only in a [[modal auxiliary]] sense. However, unlike normal auxiliary verbs, they are not regularly conjugated in the infinitive mood. Therefore, these defective auxiliaries do not accept each other as objects. Additionally, they do not regularly appear as participles.\n\nFor example, ''can'' lacks an infinitive, future tense, participle, imperative, and [[gerund]]. The missing parts of speech are instead supplied by using the appropriate forms of ''to be'' plus ''able to''. So, while ''I could write'' and ''I was able to write'' have the same meaning, ''I could'' has two meanings depending on use, which are ''I was able to'' or ''I would be able to''. One cannot say *''I will can'', which is instead expressed as ''I will be able to''. Similarly, ''must'' has no true past tense form, this instead being supplied by ''had'' (the past tense of have), and \"to have to\" in the infinitive, an example of composite conjugation. The past tense expressing the obligatory aspect of must is expressed as \"had to\", as in ''He had to go.'' \"Must have\", on the other hand, expresses probability or likelihood in modern English, e.g., ''\"If that's thunder, there must have been lightning.\"''\n\nSome verbs are becoming more defective as time goes on; for example, although ''might'' is etymologically the past tense ([[preterite]]) of ''may'', it is no longer generally used as such (*''he might not pass'' for \"he was forbidden to pass\"). Similarly, ''should'' is no longer used as the past of ''shall'', but with a separate meaning indicating possibility or moral obligation. (However, the use of the preterite form ''should'' as a [[English subjunctive|subjunctive form]] continues, as in ''If I should go there tomorrow, ...'', which contrasts with the indicative form ''I shall go there tomorrow''.) The defective verb ''ought'' was etymologically the past tense of ''owe'' (''the affection he ought his children''), but it has since split off, leaving ''owe'' as a non-defective verb with its original sense and a regular past tense (''owed'').\n\nBeyond the modal auxiliaries, ''beware'' is a fully-fledged defective verb of English: it is used as an imperative (''Beware of the dog'') and an infinitive (''I must beware of the dog''), but very rarely or never as a finite verb, especially with inflectional endings (*''bewared'', *''bewares''). The word ''begone'' is similar: any usage other than as an imperative is highly marked. Another defective verb is the archaic ''quoth'', a past tense which is the only surviving form of the verb ''quethe'', \"to say\" (related to ''bequeath'').\n\n=== Impersonal verbs ===\n[[Impersonal verb]]s such as ''to rain'' and ''to snow'' share some characteristics with the defective verbs in that forms such as ''I rain'' or ''they snow'' are not often found; however, the crucial distinction is that impersonal verbs are \"missing\" certain forms for semantic reasons\u2014in other words, the forms themselves exist and the verb is capable of being fully conjugated with all its forms (and is therefore not defective) but some forms are unlikely to be found because they appear meaningless or nonsensical.\n\nNevertheless, native speakers can typically use and understand metaphorical or even literal sentences where the \"meaningless\" forms exist, such as ''I rained on his parade.''\n\nContrast the impersonal verb ''rain'' (all the forms of which exist, even if they sometimes look semantically odd) with the defective verb ''can'' (only ''I can'' and ''I could'' are possible). In most cases, a synonym for the defective verb must be used instead (i.e. \"to be able to\"). (The forms with an asterisk (*) are impossible, at least with respect to the relevant sense of the verb; these phonemes may by coincidence be attested with respect to a [[homograph]] [as with \"canning\" = \"the act of preserving and [[Canning|packaging in cans]]\"].)\n\n== Arabic ==\nIn [[Arabic]], defective verbs are called {{lang-ar|\u0623\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u0645\u062f\u0629|translit=\u02beaf\u02bf\u0101l j\u0101midah}} (lit., ''solid verbs''). These verbs do not change tense, nor do they form related nouns. A famous example is the verb [[wikt:\u0644\u064a\u0633|\u0644\u064a\u0633]] ''laysa'', which translates as ''it is not'', though it is not the only auxiliary verb that exhibits this property. Some Arabic grammarians argue that [[wikt:\u062f\u0627\u0645#Arabic|\u062f\u0627\u0645 \"daama\"]] (as an auxiliary verb) is also completely defective; those who refute this claim still consider it partially defective. Some other partially defective verbs are \"[[wikt:\u0641\u062a\u0626|fati'a]]\" and ''[[wikt:\u0632\u0627\u0644|zaala]]'', which have neither an imperative form nor an infinitive form when used as auxiliary verbs.\n\n== Finnish ==\nAt least one Finnish verb lacks the first infinitive (dictionary/lemma) form. In Finnish, \"kutian helposti\" (\"I'm sensitive to tickling\") can be said, but for the verb \"kutian\" (here conjugated in singular first person, present tense) there is no non-conjugated form. Hypothetically, the first infinitive could be \"kudita\", but this form is not actually useed. Additionally, the [[negative verb]] (ei, et, en, emme...) has neither an infinitive form nor a 1st person singular imperative form.\n\n== French ==\n''Falloir'' (\"to be necessary\", only the third-person forms with ''il'' exist; the present indicative conjugation (''il faut'') is certainly the most often used form of a defective verb in French), ''braire'' (\"to bray\", infinitive, present participle and third-person forms only),<ref>Girodet, Jean. ''Dictionnaire du bon fran\u00e7ais'', Bordas, 1981. {{ISBN|2-04-010580-8}},</ref> ''frire'' (\"to fry\", lacks non-compound past forms; speakers paraphrase with equivalent forms of ''faire frire''), ''clore'' (\"to conclude\", lacks an imperfect conjugation, as well as first and second person plural present indicative conjugations), ''g\u00e9sir'' (\"to lie\" in the sense of \"be in or assume a supine position\" (and is the verb used for gravestones), can only be conjugated in the present, imperfect, present imperative, present participle and extremely rarely, the simple future forms, lacking all other tenses). Impersonal verbs, such as weather verbs, function as they do in English.\n== German ==\nIn contemporary German, the verb ''erkiesen'', which means \"to choose/elect\" (usually referring to a person chosen for a special task or honour), is only used in the past participle (''erkoren'') and, more rarely, the past tense (''ich erkor'' etc.). All other forms, including the infinitive, have long become obsolete and are now unknown and unintelligible to modern speakers. It remains commonplace in the closely-related [[Dutch language]] as ''verkiezen'', e.g. [[:nl:Verkiezingen in Nederland|Verkiezingen in Nederland]] (Wikipedia in Dutch).\n\n==Classical Greek==\n\"No single [[Classical Greek|Greek]] verb shows all the tenses\", and \"most verbs have only six of\" the nine classes of tense-systems, and \"[s]carcely any verb shows all nine systems\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Smyth|first=Herbert Weir|author-link=Herbert Weir Smyth|title=Greek Grammar|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1956|orig-year=1920|isbn=0-674-36250-0|pages=108\u2013109}} \u00a7\u00a7362, 368a</ref>\n\nThe verb \u03c7\u03c1\u03ae (''khr\u0113'', 'it is necessary'), only exists in the third-person-singular present and imperfect \u1f10\u03c7\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd / \u03c7\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd (''ekhr\u0113n / khr\u0113n'', 'it was necessary').\n\nThere are also verbs like \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b1 (''oida'', 'I know'), which use the perfect form for the present and the pluperfect (here \u1f94\u03b4\u03b7 ''\u0113id\u0113'', 'I was knowing') for the imperfect.\n\nAdditionally, the verb \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af (''eimi'', 'I am') only has a present, a future and an imperfect \u2013 it lacks an aorist, a perfect, a pluperfect and a future perfect.\n\n== Hungarian ==\nSome [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] verbs have either no subjunctive forms or forms which sound uncommon to native speakers, e.g. ''csuklik'' ('hiccup'). See also [[:wikt:template:U:hu-disputed-defective-verb|a short summary about them]] in the English-language Wiktionary.\n\n== Irish ==\n''Arsa'' (\"says\") can only be used in past or present tenses. The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''is'' lacks a future tense, an imperative mood, and a verbal noun. It has no distinct conditional tense forms either, but conditional expressions are possible, expressed using past tense forms; for example ''Ba mhaith liom \u00e9'', which can mean both \"I liked it\" and \"I would like it\". The imperative mood is sometimes suppletively created by using the imperative forms of the substantive verb ''b\u00ed''. Future tense forms, however, are impossible and can only be expressed periphrastically.\n\nThere is also ''dar'' (\"[it] appears\"), a temporally independent verb that always appears in combination with the preposition ''le''.\n\n== Korean ==\nKorean has several defective verbs.  \ub9d0\ub2e4 (''malda'', \"to stop or desist\") may only be used in the imperative form or in the [[hortative]] form, after an 'action verb + \uc9c0 (''ji'')' construction. Within this scope it can still conjugate for different levels of politeness, such as \"\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8!\" (''Haji ma!'', \"Stop that!\") in contrast with \"\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624\" (''Haji masipsiyo'', \"Please, don't do that\").  Also, \ub370\ub9ac\ub2e4 (''derida'', \"to bring/pick up someone\") is only used as \ub370\ub9ac\uace0 (''derigo'', \"bringing X and...\"), \ub370\ub9ac\ub7ec (''derireo'', \"in order to pick up\"), or \ub370\ub824 (''deryeo'', infinitive) in some compound forms.\n\n== Latin ==\n[[Latin]] has defective verbs that possess forms only in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tense; such verbs have no present tense forms whatsoever. These verbs are still present in ''meaning''. For example, the first-person form ''odi'' (\"I hate\") and infinitive ''odisse'' (\"to hate\") appear to be the perfect of a hypothetical verb ''*odo/odio'', but in fact have a present-tense meaning.  Similarly, the verb ''memini'', ''meminisse'' is conjugated in the perfect, yet has a present meaning:\n\n{{block indent|memin\u012b}}\n{{block indent|meminist\u012b}}\n{{block indent|meminit}}\n{{block indent|meminimus}}\n{{block indent|meministis}}\n{{block indent|memin\u0113runt}}\n\nInstead of the past-tense \"I remembered\", \"you remembered\", etc., these forms signify the present-tense \"I remember\", \"you remember\", etc.  Latin defective verbs also possess regularly formed [[pluperfect]] forms with simple past tense meanings and [[future perfect]] forms with simple future tense meanings. Compare [[deponent verb|deponent verbs]], which are passive in form but active in meaning.\n\nThe verb ''coep\u012b'', ''coepisse'', which means \"to have begun\" or \"began\", is another verb that lacks a present tense system. However, it is not present in meaning. The verb ''incipi\u014d'', ''incipere'' (\"I begin,\" \"to begin\") is used in the present tense instead. This is not a case of [[suppletion]], however, because the verb ''incipere'' can also be used in the perfect.\n\nThe verbs ''inquit'' and ''ait'', both meaning \"said\", cannot be conjugated through all forms. Both verbs lack numerous inflected forms, with entire tenses and voices missing altogether.\n\n== Polish ==\n''wida\u0107'' (\"it is evident\") and ''s\u0142ycha\u0107'' (\"it is audible\") are both highly defective in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The only forms of these verbs that exist are the infinitives.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Portuguese ==\nA large number of [[Portuguese verbs]] are defective in [[Grammatical person|person]], i.e., they lack the proper form for one of the pronouns in some tense. The verb ''colorir'' (\"to color\") has no first-person singular in the present, thus requiring a paraphrase, like ''estou colorindo'' (\"I am coloring\") or the use of another verb of a similar meaning, like ''pintar'' (\"to paint\").\n\n== Russian ==\nSome [[Russian language|Russian]] verbs are defective, in that they lack a first person singular non-past form: for example, ''\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c'' (\"to win\"), ''\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c'' (\"to convince\"), ''\u0434\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c'' (\"to play the pipe\").

Also, the verb is unique in that the form ''m\u00e5ste'' serves as both a present (\"must\") and past (\"had to\") form. The [[Supine#Germanic_languages|supine]] ''m\u00e5st'' is rare.\n==Turkish==\nWhile the [[Turkish copula]] is not considered a verb in [[Turkish language|modern Turkish]], it originated as the defective verb \"imek\"\u2014which is now written and pronounced as a suffix of the predicate. Imek and the suffixes derived from it only exist in some tenses; in others, it is replaced by \"olmak\" (to become).\n== Ukrainian ==\n[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] Verbs ending on -\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0438 (''\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0438''-to tell, perfective and ''\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0438''-to answer, perfective) lack imperative mood forms; imperfective verbs are used instead (for example, \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u0430\u0439).\n\n== Welsh ==\n[[Welsh language|Welsh]] has several defective verbs, a number of which are archaic or literary. Some of the more common ones in everyday use include ''dylwn'' (\"I should/ought\"), found only in the imperfect and pluperfect tenses, ''meddaf'' (\"I say\"), found only in the present and imperfect, and ''geni'' (\"to be born\"), which only has a verb-noun and impersonal forms, e.g. ''Ganwyd hi'' (She was born, literally \"one bore her\").\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Unpaired word]] \u2013 another form of lexical gap\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite book |last1=Baerman |first1= Matthew |author2=Dunstan Brown |author3=Greville G.
