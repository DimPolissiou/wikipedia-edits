One of his arguments was that both Khabarov's Achan (sometimes also spelled by the explorer as Otshchan, \u041e\u0442\u0449\u0430\u043d), and Wuzhala (\u4e4c\u624e\u62c9) of the Chinese records of the 1652 engagement are based on the name of the [[Nanais|Nanai]] clan \"Odzhal\" (\u041e\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b), corresponding to the 20th-century name of the village as well. (The name of the clan was also written as \"Uzala\", as in the name of its best-known member, [[Dersu Uzala]]).<ref name=izvet/>\n\nPolevoy's view appeared to gain wide support among the Russian geographer community; petitioned by the Amur Branch of the [[Russian Geographical Society]], the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Government]] renamed the village of Odzhal to Achan in 1977, to celebrate its connection with Khabarov's raid.<ref name=izvet/>\n\nAs to the Cape Kyrma ruins, thought by Maack to be the remains of Achansk, B.P. Polevoy identified them as the remains of another ''ostrog'' - namely, Kosogorsky Ostrog, where [[Onufriy Stepanov]] stayed a few years later.<ref name=koso/>\n\n===Qing Empire===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] (1689), the area became an uncontested part of the [[Qing Empire]] for the next century and a half. Modern historical maps of the Qing period published in China mark the site of future Khabarovsk as B\u00f3l\u00ec ({{zh|s=\u4f2f\u529b}}). All of the middle and lower Amur region was nominally part of the [[Jilin]] Province, run first out of [[Ninguta]] and later out of [[Jilin City]].\n\nFrench [[Jesuit missions in China|Jesuit]]s who sailed along the [[Ussury]] and the [[Amur River|Amur]] in 1709 prepared the first more or less precise map of the region. According to them, the indigenous Nanai people were living on the [[Ussury]] and on the Amur down to the mouth of the [[Anyuy River (Khabarovsk Krai)|Dondon River]] (i.e., in the region including the site of the future Khabarovsk).

Since then, Khabarovsk's cultural life has flourished. Much of the local indigenous history has been well preserved in the Regional Lore Museum and Natural History Museum and in places like near the [[Nani people|Nanai]] settlement of [[Sikachi-Alyan]], where cliff drawings from more than 13,000 years ago can be found. The Khabarovsk Art Museum exhibits a rare collection of old Russian icons.\n\nIn 1916, the [[Khabarovsk Bridge]] across the Amur was completed, allowing [[Trans-Siberian Railway|Trans-Siberian]] trains to cross the river without using [[train ferry|ferries]] (or temporary rail tracks over the frozen river in winter).\n\n===Soviet era===\nAfter the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]],  Khabarovsk was the site of the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]], in which twelve former members of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] and [[Unit 731]] were put on [[trial (law)|trial]] for the manufacture and use of [[biological weapons]] during World War II.\n\nChinese Emperor [[Puyi]], captured by Soviet troops in [[Manchuria]], was relocated to Khabarovsk and lived there from 1945 up to 1950, when he was returned to China.<ref>http://khv9923.narod.ru/His_last_translator.pdf</ref>\n\nWhen Japan fell in September 1945 the United States reached an agreement with Stalin to build two U.S. Naval Advance Bases (Fleet Weather Centrals) in the USSR.<ref>The 114th CB cruisebook, 1946, U.S.Navy Seabee Museum Archives, Port Hueneme, Ca, p.123-125 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4nwmm4QfSXQC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=Construction+battalion+114+Russia&source=bl&ots=4R8idRsfGg&sig=xUpg07nNNod8KosWiOdp-fOj_u0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwishKHEuPLdAhWn64MKHQfOB6IQ6AEwAXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Construction%20battalion%20114%20Russia&f=false]</ref> The U.S built one 10 miles outside [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] with the code name TAMA.<ref name= \"Yanks\">Yanks in Siberia: U.S. Navy Weather Stations in Soviet East Asia, 1945, G.

The Khabarovsk television studio began broadcasting in 1960. On 1 September 1967, the Khabarovsk Institute of Physical Education, now the [[Far Eastern State Academy of Physical Culture]], opened. On 14 January 1971 Khabarovsk was awarded the [[Order of October Revolution]]. In 1975 the first stage of the urban [[Tram|trolley]] opened. In 1976 the city hosted an international ice hockey tournament with the ball for the prize of the newspaper ''[[Sovietskaya Rossia]]''. In 1981 the [[Bandy World Championship 1981|Bandy World Championship]] was played in the city.\n\n===Russian Federation===\nIn 1996, Khabarovsk held its first [[Elections in Russia|mayoral elections]]. Paul D. Filippov, whose candidacy was supported by Governor [[Viktor Ishayev]], was defeated. In 1998, reconstruction of the [[Lenin Square, Khabarovsk|central square]] of Khabarovsk was completed. In May 2000, [[President of Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]], decreed that new federal districts be formed, and Khabarovsk became the center of the [[Far Eastern Federal District]].\n\nIn 2006, the Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, a high-tech medical center, was constructed according to a Russian [[National Priority Projects|national health project]]. In 2008, the train station was completely renovated, and the adjacent square was reconstructed to include fountains and an underground passage. In 2009, Khabarovsk hosted the [[Russia\u2013European Union relations|EU-Russia summit]]. In 2010, the city hosted a meeting of the Great Circle of Ussuri [[Cossacks]].

One of his arguments was that both Khabarov's Achan (sometimes also spelled by the explorer as Otshchan, \u041e\u0442\u0449\u0430\u043d), and Wuzhala (\u4e4c\u624e\u62c9) of the Chinese records of the 1652 engagement are based on the name of the [[Nanais|Nanai]] clan \"Odzhal\" (\u041e\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b), corresponding to the 20th-century name of the village as well. (The name of the clan was also written as \"Uzala\", as in the name of its best-known member, [[Dersu Uzala]]).<ref name=izvet/>\n\nPolevoy's view appeared to gain wide support among the Russian geographer community; petitioned by the Amur Branch of the [[Russian Geographical Society]], the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Government]] renamed the village of Odzhal to Achan in 1977, to celebrate its connection with Khabarov's raid.<ref name=izvet/>\n\nAs to the Cape Kyrma ruins, thought by Maack to be the remains of Achansk, B.P. Polevoy identified them as the remains of another ''ostrog'' - namely, Kosogorsky Ostrog, where [[Onufriy Stepanov]] stayed a few years later.<ref name=koso/>\n\n===Qing Empire===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] (1689), the area became an uncontested part of the [[Qing Empire]] for the next century and a half. Modern historical maps of the Qing period published in China mark the site of future Khabarovsk as B\u00f3l\u00ec ({{zh|s=\u4f2f\u529b}}). All of the middle and lower Amur region was nominally part of the [[Jilin]] Province, run first out of [[Ninguta]] and later out of [[Jilin City]].\n\nFrench [[Jesuit missions in China|Jesuit]]s who sailed along the [[Ussury]] and the [[Amur River|Amur]] in 1709 prepared the first more or less precise map of the region. According to them, the indigenous Nanai people were living on the [[Ussury]] and on the Amur down to the mouth of the [[Anyuy River (Khabarovsk Krai)|Dondon River]] (i.e., in the region including the site of the future Khabarovsk).
