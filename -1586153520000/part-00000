They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept [[Crash (computing)|crashing]], Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job.

They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\".

''The Rise and Fall of the Cthulhu Mythos'' (Mythos Books, 2008) pp. 34-35.</ref>\n\nLovecraft was often asked about the veracity of the ''Necronomicon'', and always answered that it was completely his invention. In a letter to [[Willis Conover]], Lovecraft elaborated upon his typical answer:\n\n<blockquote>Now about the \"terrible and forbidden books\u201d\u2014I am forced to say that most of them are purely imaginary. There never was any Abdul Alhazred or ''Necronomicon'', for I invented these names myself.

As for seriously-written books on dark, occult, and supernatural themes\u2014in all truth they don\u2019t amount to much.

''Call of Cthulhu'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n==Fictional history==\nIn 1927, Lovecraft wrote a brief [[pseudo-history]] of the Necronomicon. It was published in 1938, after his death, as \"[[History of the Necronomicon|History of the ''Necronomicon'']]\". According to this account, the book was originally called ''{{lang|ar|Al Azif}}'', an Arabic word that Lovecraft defined as \"that nocturnal sound (made by insects) supposed to be the howling of demons\", drawing on a footnote by [[Samuel Henley]] in Henley's translation of \"[[Vathek]]\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories |last=H.P.

He is described as being from [[Sanaa|Sana\u00e1]] in [[Yemen]]. He visited the ruins of [[Babylon]], the \"subterranean secrets\" of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and the [[Empty Quarter]] of [[Arabia]]. In his last years, he lived in [[Damascus]], where he wrote ''Al Azif'' before his sudden and mysterious death in 738. In subsequent years, Lovecraft wrote, the ''Azif'' \"gained considerable, though surreptitious circulation amongst the philosophers of the age.\" In 950, it was translated into [[Greek language|Greek]] and given the title ''{{lang|grc|Necronomicon}}'' by Theodorus Philetas, a fictional scholar from [[Constantinople]]. This version \"impelled certain experimenters to terrible attempts\" before being \"suppressed and burnt\" in 1050 by [[Michael I Cerularius|Patriarch Michael]] (a historical figure who died in 1059).<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/hn.aspx |title=The History of the Necronomicon |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

(Lovecraft gives the date of this edition as 1228, though the real-life Danish scholar Olaus Wormius lived from 1588 to 1624.) Both the Latin and Greek text, the \"History\" relates, were banned by [[Pope Gregory IX]] in 1232, though Latin editions were apparently published in 15th century [[Germany]] and 17th century [[Spain]]. A Greek edition was printed in [[Italy]] in the first half of the 16th century. The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] magician [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] (1527-c. 1609) allegedly translated the book&mdash;presumably into English&mdash;but Lovecraft wrote that this version was never printed and only fragments survive.<ref name=\"auto\"/> (The connection between Dee and the ''Necronomicon'' was suggested by Lovecraft's friend [[Frank Belknap Long]].){{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to Lovecraft, the Arabic version of ''Al Azif'' had already disappeared by the time the Greek version was banned in 1050, though he cites \"a vague account of a secret copy appearing in San Francisco during the current [20th] century\" that \"later perished in fire\". The Greek version, he writes, has not been reported \"since the burning of a certain [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] man's library in 1692\" (an apparent reference to the [[Salem witch trials]]). (In the story \"The Diary of Alonzo Typer\", the character Alonzo Typer finds a Greek copy.) According to \"History of the ''Necronomicon''\" the very act of studying the text is inherently dangerous, as those who attempt to master its arcane knowledge generally meet terrible ends.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Appearance and contents==\nThe ''Necronomicon'' is mentioned in a number of Lovecraft's short stories and in his novellas ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' and ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]''. However, despite frequent references to the book, Lovecraft was very sparing of details about its appearance and contents. He once wrote that \"if anyone were to try to write the ''Necronomicon'', it would disappoint all those who have shuddered at cryptic references to it.\"<ref>Letter to Jim Blish and William Miller, Jr., quoted in Joshi, \"Afterword\".</ref>\n\nIn \"The Nameless City\" ([[1921 in literature|1921]]), a rhyming [[couplet]] that appears at two points in the story is ascribed to Abdul Alhazred:\n\n<blockquote><poem>That is not dead which can eternal lie. \nAnd with strange aeons even death may die.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/nc.aspx |title=\"The Nameless City\" by H. P. Lovecraft |date=20 August 2009 |website=www.hplovecraft.com |publisher=Donovan K. Loucks |access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nThe same couplet appears in \"[[The Call of Cthulhu]]\" ([[1928 in literature|1928]]), where it is identified as a quotation from the ''Necronomicon''. This \"much-discussed\" couplet, as Lovecraft calls it in the latter story, has also been quoted in works by other authors, including [[Brian Lumley]]'s ''The Burrowers Beneath'', which adds a long paragraph preceding the couplet.\n\nIn his story \"[[History of the Necronomicon|History of the ''Necronomicon'']]\", Lovecraft states that it is rumored that artist R.U. Pickman (from his story \"[[Pickman's Model]]\") owned a Greek translation of the text, but it vanished along with the artist in early 1926.\n\nThe ''Necronomicon'' is undoubtedly a substantial text, as indicated by its description in \"[[The Dunwich Horror]]\" ([[1929 in literature|1929]]). In the story, [[Wilbur Whateley]] visits [[Miskatonic University]]'s library to consult the \"unabridged\" version of the ''Necronomicon'' for a spell that would have appeared on the 751st page of his own inherited, but defective, Dee edition. The ''Necronomicon'' passage in question states:\n\n<blockquote>Nor is it to be thought...that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The [[Great Old Ones|Old Ones]] were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. [[Yog-Sothoth]] knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. [[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath|Kadath]] in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great [[Cthulhu]] is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. I\u00e4! [[Shub-Niggurath]]! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. [[Yog-Sothoth]] is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.</blockquote>\n\nThe ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s appearance and physical dimensions are not clearly stated in Lovecraft's work. Other than the obvious [[black letter]] editions, it is commonly portrayed as bound in leather of various types and having metal clasps. Moreover, editions are sometimes disguised. In ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'', for example, John Merrit pulls down a book labelled ''[[Qanoon-e-Islam]]'' from [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Curwen, Joseph|Joseph Curwen]]\u2019s bookshelf and discovers to his disquiet that it is actually the ''Necronomicon''.\n\nMany commercially available versions of the book fail to include any of the contents that Lovecraft describes. The [[Simon Necronomicon|Simon ''Necronomicon'']] in particular has been criticized for this.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080603151048/http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/16/69/ The Simon ''Necronomicon''], a review.</ref>\n\n==Locations==\nAccording to Lovecraft's \"History of the ''Necronomicon''\", copies of the original ''Necronomicon'' were held by only five institutions worldwide:\n\n* The [[British Museum]]\n* The [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]\n* [[Widener Library]] of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]\n* The [[Universidad de Buenos Aires|University of Buenos Aires]]\n* The library of the fictional [[Miskatonic University]] in the also fictitious [[Arkham]], [[Massachusetts]]\n\nThe Miskatonic University also holds the Latin translation by Olaus Wormius, printed in [[Spain]] in the 17th century.\n\nOther copies, Lovecraft wrote, were kept by private individuals. Joseph Curwen, as noted, had a copy in ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'' (1941). A version is held in [[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]] in \"[[The Festival (short story)|The Festival]]\" ([[1925 in literature|1925]]). The [[provenance]] of the copy read by the narrator of \"[[Nameless City|The Nameless City]]\" is unknown; a version is read by the protagonist in \"The Hound\" ([[1924 in literature|1924]]).\n\n==Hoaxes and alleged translations==\n[[File:Necronomicon prop.jpg|thumb|right|A [[fan art|fan-created]] prop representing the ''Necronomicon'' (2004)]]\n\nAlthough Lovecraft insisted that the book was pure invention (and other writers invented passages from the book for their own works), there are accounts of some people actually believing the ''Necronomicon'' to be a real book. Lovecraft himself sometimes received letters from fans inquiring about the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s authenticity. [[Practical joke|Pranksters]] occasionally listed the ''Necronomicon'' for sale in book store newsletters or inserted phony entries for the book in [[Library catalog|library card catalogues]] (where it may be checked out to one '[[Abdul Alhazred|A. Alhazred]]', ostensibly the book's author and original owner). [[Vatican City|The Vatican]] also receives requests for this book from those who believe the [[Vatican Library]] holds a copy.<ref name=\"Voicu2007\">{{cite news|last=Voicu |first=Sever Juan |title=Bodmer Papyrus: History Becomes Reality |url=https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/bodmer-papyrus-history-becomes-reality-9767|accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=[[Eternal Word Television Network]] |quote=Taken from: [[L'Osservatore Romano]] Weekly Edition in English, 7 February 2007, page 8}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the [[University of Troms\u00f8|university library of Troms\u00f8]], Norway, lists a translated version of the ''Necronomicon'', attributed to Petrus de Dacia and published in 1994, although the document is listed as \"unavailable\".<ref>[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=970451504&kid=biblio ''Necronomicon''.]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Owlswick Press issued an edition of the ''Necronomicon'' written in an indecipherable, apparently [[fictional language]] known as \"Duriac\".<ref>[http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/14/69/ \"''Al Azif'': The ''Necronomicon'', a Review (Owlswick/Wildside Edition)\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603131414/http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/14/69/ |date=2008-06-03 }}</ref> This was a limited edition of 348. The book contains a brief introduction by [[L. Sprague de Camp]].\n\nThe line between fact and fiction was further blurred in the late 1970s when a book purporting to be a translation of \"the real\" ''Necronomicon'' was published. This book, by the pseudonymous \"Simon,\" had little connection to the fictional [[Lovecraft Mythos]] but instead was based on [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian mythology]]. It was later dubbed the \"[[Simon Necronomicon|Simon ''Necronomicon'']]\". Going into trade paperback in 1980 it has never been out of print and has sold 800,000 copies by 2006 making it the most popular ''Necronomicon'' to date. Despite its contents, the book's marketing focused heavily on the Lovecraft connection and made sensational claims for the book's magical power. The blurb states it was \"potentially, the most dangerous Black Book known to the Western World\". Three additional volumes have since been published &mdash; ''The Necronomicon Spellbook'', a book of pathworkings with the 50 names of [[Marduk]]; ''Dead Names: The Dark History of the Necronomicon'', a history of the book itself and of the late 1970s New York occult scene; and ''The Gates Of The Necronomicon'', instructions on pathworking with the Simon ''Necronomicon''.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nA hoax version of the ''Necronomicon'', edited by George Hay, appeared in [[1978 in literature|1978]] and included an introduction by the paranormal researcher and writer [[Colin Wilson]]. [[David Langford]] described how the book was prepared from a computer analysis of a discovered \"cipher text\" by [[John Dee (mathematician)|Dr. John Dee]]. The resulting \"translation\" was in fact written by [[occult]]ist Robert Turner, but it was far truer to the Lovecraftian version than the Simon text and even incorporated quotations from Lovecraft's stories in its passages. Wilson also wrote a story, \"The Return of the Lloigor\", in which the [[Voynich manuscript]] turns out to be a copy of the ''Necronomicon''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The return of the Lloigor |last=Wilson |first=Colin |date=1974 |publisher=Village Press |language=English |oclc=2507340 }}</ref>\n\nWith the success of the Simon ''Necronomicon'' the controversy surrounding the actual existence of the ''Necronomicon'' was such that a detailed book, ''[[The Necronomicon Files]]'', was published in 1998 attempting to prove once and for all the book was pure fiction. It covered the well-known ''Necronomicon''s in depth, especially the Simon one, along with a number of more obscure ones. It was reprinted and expanded in 2003.<ref>Dan and John Wisdom Gonce III. 2003. ''The Necronomicon Files''.

The Tyson ''Necronomicon'' is generally thought to be closer to Lovecraft's vision than other published versions. Donald Tyson has clearly stated that the ''Necronomicon'' is fictional, but that has not prevented his book from being the center of some controversy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/97/72/ |title=Keys to Power beyond Reckoning: Mysteries of the Tyson Necronomicon |date=February 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205164728/http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/97/72/ |archive-date=2009-02-05 }}</ref> Tyson has since published ''[[Alhazred (novel)|Alhazred]]'', a novelization of the life of the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s author.\n\n[[Kenneth Grant]], the British occultist, disciple of [[Aleister Crowley]], and head of the [[Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis]], suggested in his book ''The Magical Revival'' (1972) that there was an unconscious connection between Crowley and Lovecraft. He thought they both drew on the same occult forces; Crowley via his magic and Lovecraft through the dreams which inspired his stories and the ''Necronomicon''. Grant claimed that the ''Necronomicon'' existed as an [[astral projection|astral]] book as part of the [[Akashic records]] and could be accessed through [[ritual magic]] or in dreams. Grant's ideas on Lovecraft were featured heavily in the introduction to the [[Simon Necronomicon|Simon ''Necronomicon'']] and also have been backed by Tyson.<ref>Harms, Dan and John Wisdom Gonce III. 2003.

Lovecraft approved of other writers building on his work, believing such common allusions built up \"a background of evil [[verisimilitude]].\" Many readers have believed it to be a real work, with booksellers and librarians receiving many requests for it; pranksters have listed it in rare book catalogues, and a student smuggled a card for it into the [[Yale University Library]]'s [[card catalog]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers |last=[[L.

T. Joshi states that Lovecraft's own etymology is \"almost entirely unsound. The last portion of it is particularly erroneous, since ''-ikon'' is nothing more than a neuter adjectival suffix and has nothing to do with ''eik\u00f5n'' (image).\" Joshi translates the title as \"Book considering (or classifying) the dead.\"<ref>Joshi, S.T. ''The Rise and Fall of the Cthulhu Mythos'' (Mythos Books, 2008) pp. 34-35.</ref>\n\nLovecraft was often asked about the veracity of the ''Necronomicon'', and always answered that it was completely his invention. In a letter to [[Willis Conover]], Lovecraft elaborated upon his typical answer:\n\n<blockquote>Now about the \"terrible and forbidden books\u201d\u2014I am forced to say that most of them are purely imaginary. There never was any Abdul Alhazred or ''Necronomicon'', for I invented these names myself. [[Robert Bloch]] devised the idea of Ludvig Prinn and his ''[[De Vermis Mysteriis]]'', while the ''[[Book of Eibon]]'' is an invention of Clark Ashton Smith's. [[Robert E. Howard]] is responsible for Friedrich von Junzt and his ''[[Unaussprechlichen Kulten]]''.... As for seriously-written books on dark, occult, and supernatural themes\u2014in all truth they don\u2019t amount to much. That is why it\u2019s more fun to invent mythical works like the ''Necronomicon'' and ''Book of Eibon''.<ref name=\"HPLA-letters\" /></blockquote>\n\nReinforcing the book's fictionalization, the name of the book's supposed author, Abdul Alhazred, is not even a grammatically correct [[Arabic name]]. \"Abdul\" means \"the worshiper/slave of the\", and standing alone it would make no sense, as Alhazred is not a surname in the Western sense, but a reference to a person's place of birth, and its English translation starts with another \"the\".<ref>Petersen, Sandy & Lynn Willis. ''Call of Cthulhu'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n==Fictional history==\nIn 1927, Lovecraft wrote a brief [[pseudo-history]] of the ''Necronomicon'' that was published in 1938, after his death, as \"[[History of the Necronomicon|History of the ''Necronomicon'']]\". According to this account, the book was originally called ''{{lang|ar|Al Azif}}'', an Arabic word that Lovecraft defined as \"that nocturnal sound (made by insects) supposed to be the howling of demons\", drawing on a footnote by [[Samuel Henley]] in Henley's translation of \"[[Vathek]]\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories |last=H.P.

He is described as being from [[Sanaa|Sana\u00e1]] in [[Yemen]]. He visited the ruins of [[Babylon]], the \"subterranean secrets\" of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and the [[Empty Quarter]] of [[Arabia]]. In his last years, he lived in [[Damascus]], where he wrote ''Al Azif'' before his sudden and mysterious death in 738. In subsequent years, Lovecraft wrote, the ''Azif'' \"gained considerable, though surreptitious circulation amongst the philosophers of the age.\" In 950, it was translated into [[Greek language|Greek]] and given the title ''{{lang|grc|Necronomicon}}'' by Theodorus Philetas, a fictional scholar from [[Constantinople]]. This version \"impelled certain experimenters to terrible attempts\" before being \"suppressed and burnt\" in 1050 by [[Michael I Cerularius|Patriarch Michael]] (a historical figure who died in 1059).<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/hn.aspx |title=The History of the Necronomicon |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

Loucks |access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter this attempted suppression, the work was \"only heard of furtively\" until it was translated from Greek into [[Latin]] by [[Ole Worm|Olaus Wormius]]. (Lovecraft gives the date of this edition as 1228, though the real-life Danish scholar Olaus Wormius lived from 1588 to 1624.) Both the Latin and Greek text, the \"History\" relates, were banned by [[Pope Gregory IX]] in 1232, though Latin editions were apparently published in 15th century [[Germany]] and 17th century [[Spain]]. A Greek edition was printed in [[Italy]] in the first half of the 16th century. The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] magician [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] (1527-c. 1609) allegedly translated the book&mdash;presumably into English&mdash;but Lovecraft wrote that this version was never printed and only fragments survive.<ref name=\"auto\"/> (The connection between Dee and the ''Necronomicon'' was suggested by Lovecraft's friend [[Frank Belknap Long]].){{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to Lovecraft, the Arabic version of ''Al Azif'' had already disappeared by the time the Greek version was banned in 1050, though he cites \"a vague account of a secret copy appearing in San Francisco during the current [20th] century\" that \"later perished in fire\". The Greek version, he writes, has not been reported \"since the burning of a certain [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] man's library in 1692\" (an apparent reference to the [[Salem witch trials]]). (In the story \"The Diary of Alonzo Typer\", the character Alonzo Typer finds a Greek copy.) According to \"History of the ''Necronomicon''\" the very act of studying the text is inherently dangerous, as those who attempt to master its arcane knowledge generally meet terrible ends.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Appearance and contents==\nThe ''Necronomicon'' is mentioned in a number of Lovecraft's short stories and in his novellas ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' and ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]''. However, despite frequent references to the book, Lovecraft was very sparing of details about its appearance and contents. He once wrote that \"if anyone were to try to write the ''Necronomicon'', it would disappoint all those who have shuddered at cryptic references to it.\"<ref>Letter to Jim Blish and William Miller, Jr., quoted in Joshi, \"Afterword\".</ref>\n\nIn \"The Nameless City\" ([[1921 in literature|1921]]), a rhyming [[couplet]] that appears at two points in the story is ascribed to Abdul Alhazred:\n\n<blockquote><poem>That is not dead which can eternal lie. \nAnd with strange aeons even death may die.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/nc.aspx |title=\"The Nameless City\" by H. P. Lovecraft |date=20 August 2009 |website=www.hplovecraft.com |publisher=Donovan K. Loucks |access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nThe same couplet appears in \"[[The Call of Cthulhu]]\" ([[1928 in literature|1928]]), where it is identified as a quotation from the ''Necronomicon''. This \"much-discussed\" couplet, as Lovecraft calls it in the latter story, has also been quoted in works by other authors, including [[Brian Lumley]]'s ''The Burrowers Beneath'', which adds a long paragraph preceding the couplet.\n\nIn his story \"[[History of the Necronomicon|History of the ''Necronomicon'']]\", Lovecraft states that it is rumored that artist R.U. Pickman (from his story \"[[Pickman's Model]]\") owned a Greek translation of the text, but it vanished along with the artist in early 1926.\n\nThe ''Necronomicon'' is undoubtedly a substantial text, as indicated by its description in \"[[The Dunwich Horror]]\" ([[1929 in literature|1929]]). In the story, [[Wilbur Whateley]] visits [[Miskatonic University]]'s library to consult the \"unabridged\" version of the ''Necronomicon'' for a spell that would have appeared on the 751st page of his own inherited, but defective, Dee edition. The ''Necronomicon'' passage in question states:\n\n<blockquote>Nor is it to be thought...that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The [[Great Old Ones|Old Ones]] were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. [[Yog-Sothoth]] knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. [[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath|Kadath]] in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great [[Cthulhu]] is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. I\u00e4! [[Shub-Niggurath]]! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. [[Yog-Sothoth]] is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.</blockquote>\n\nThe ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s appearance and physical dimensions are not clearly stated in Lovecraft's work. Other than the obvious [[black letter]] editions, it is commonly portrayed as bound in leather of various types and having metal clasps. Moreover, editions are sometimes disguised. In ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'', for example, John Merrit pulls down a book labelled ''[[Qanoon-e-Islam]]'' from [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Curwen, Joseph|Joseph Curwen]]\u2019s bookshelf and discovers to his disquiet that it is actually the ''Necronomicon''.\n\nMany commercially available versions of the book fail to include any of the contents that Lovecraft describes. The [[Simon Necronomicon|Simon ''Necronomicon'']] in particular has been criticized for this.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080603151048/http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/16/69/ The Simon ''Necronomicon''], a review.</ref>\n\n==Locations==\nAccording to Lovecraft's \"History of the ''Necronomicon''\", copies of the original ''Necronomicon'' were held by only five institutions worldwide:\n\n* The [[British Museum]]\n* The [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]\n* [[Widener Library]] of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]\n* The [[Universidad de Buenos Aires|University of Buenos Aires]]\n* The library of the fictional [[Miskatonic University]] in the also fictitious [[Arkham]], [[Massachusetts]]\n\nThe Miskatonic University also holds the Latin translation by Olaus Wormius, printed in [[Spain]] in the 17th century.\n\nOther copies, Lovecraft wrote, were kept by private individuals. Joseph Curwen, as noted, had a copy in ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'' (1941). A version is held in [[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]] in \"[[The Festival (short story)|The Festival]]\" ([[1925 in literature|1925]]). The [[provenance]] of the copy read by the narrator of \"[[Nameless City|The Nameless City]]\" is unknown; a version is read by the protagonist in \"The Hound\" ([[1924 in literature|1924]]).\n\n==Hoaxes and alleged translations==\n[[File:Necronomicon prop.jpg|thumb|right|A [[fan art|fan-created]] prop representing the ''Necronomicon'' (2004)]]\n\nAlthough Lovecraft insisted that the book was pure invention (and other writers invented passages from the book for their own works), there are accounts of some people actually believing the ''Necronomicon'' to be a real book. Lovecraft himself sometimes received letters from fans inquiring about the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s authenticity.

[[Vatican City|The Vatican]] also receives requests for this book from those who believe the [[Vatican Library]] holds a copy.<ref name=\"Voicu2007\">{{cite news|last=Voicu |first=Sever Juan |title=Bodmer Papyrus: History Becomes Reality |url=https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/bodmer-papyrus-history-becomes-reality-9767|accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=[[Eternal Word Television Network]] |quote=Taken from: [[L'Osservatore Romano]] Weekly Edition in English, 7 February 2007, page 8}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the [[University of Troms\u00f8|university library of Troms\u00f8]], Norway, lists a translated version of the ''Necronomicon'', attributed to Petrus de Dacia and published in 1994, although the document is listed as \"unavailable\".<ref>[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=970451504&kid=biblio ''Necronomicon''.]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Owlswick Press issued an edition of the ''Necronomicon'' written in an indecipherable, apparently [[fictional language]] known as \"Duriac\".<ref>[http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/14/69/ \"''Al Azif'': The ''Necronomicon'', a Review (Owlswick/Wildside Edition)\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603131414/http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/14/69/ |date=2008-06-03 }}</ref> This was a limited edition of 348. The book contains a brief introduction by [[L. Sprague de Camp]].\n\nThe line between fact and fiction was further blurred in the late 1970s when a book purporting to be a translation of \"the real\" ''Necronomicon'' was published. This book, by the pseudonymous \"Simon,\" had little connection to the fictional [[Lovecraft Mythos]] but instead was based on [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian mythology]]. It was later dubbed the \"[[Simon Necronomicon|Simon ''Necronomicon'']]\". Going into trade paperback in 1980 it has never been out of print and has sold 800,000 copies by 2006 making it the most popular ''Necronomicon'' to date. Despite its contents, the book's marketing focused heavily on the Lovecraft connection and made sensational claims for the book's magical power. The blurb states it was \"potentially, the most dangerous Black Book known to the Western World\". Three additional volumes have since been published &mdash; ''The Necronomicon Spellbook'', a book of pathworkings with the 50 names of [[Marduk]]; ''Dead Names: The Dark History of the Necronomicon'', a history of the book itself and of the late 1970s New York occult scene; and ''The Gates Of The Necronomicon'', instructions on pathworking with the Simon ''Necronomicon''.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nA hoax version of the ''Necronomicon'', edited by George Hay, appeared in [[1978 in literature|1978]] and included an introduction by the paranormal researcher and writer [[Colin Wilson]]. [[David Langford]] described how the book was prepared from a computer analysis of a discovered \"cipher text\" by [[John Dee (mathematician)|Dr. John Dee]]. The resulting \"translation\" was in fact written by [[occult]]ist Robert Turner, but it was far truer to the Lovecraftian version than the Simon text and even incorporated quotations from Lovecraft's stories in its passages. Wilson also wrote a story, \"The Return of the Lloigor\", in which the [[Voynich manuscript]] turns out to be a copy of the ''Necronomicon''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The return of the Lloigor |last=Wilson |first=Colin |date=1974 |publisher=Village Press |language=English |oclc=2507340 }}</ref>\n\nWith the success of the Simon ''Necronomicon'' the controversy surrounding the actual existence of the ''Necronomicon'' was such that a detailed book, ''[[The Necronomicon Files]]'', was published in 1998 attempting to prove once and for all the book was pure fiction. It covered the well-known ''Necronomicon''s in depth, especially the Simon one, along with a number of more obscure ones. It was reprinted and expanded in 2003.<ref>Dan and John Wisdom Gonce III. 2003. ''The Necronomicon Files''. Boston: Red Wheel Weiser. {{ISBN|9781578632695}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, ''Necronomicon: The Wanderings of Alhazred'', by Canadian occultist Donald Tyson, was published by [[Llewellyn Worldwide]]. The Tyson ''Necronomicon'' is generally thought to be closer to Lovecraft's vision than other published versions. Donald Tyson has clearly stated that the ''Necronomicon'' is fictional, but that has not prevented his book from being the center of some controversy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/97/72/ |title=Keys to Power beyond Reckoning: Mysteries of the Tyson Necronomicon |date=February 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205164728/http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/97/72/ |archive-date=2009-02-05 }}</ref> Tyson has since published ''[[Alhazred (novel)|Alhazred]]'', a novelization of the life of the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s author.\n\n[[Kenneth Grant]], the British occultist, disciple of [[Aleister Crowley]], and head of the [[Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis]], suggested in his book ''The Magical Revival'' (1972) that there was an unconscious connection between Crowley and Lovecraft. He thought they both drew on the same occult forces; Crowley via his magic and Lovecraft through the dreams which inspired his stories and the ''Necronomicon''. Grant claimed that the ''Necronomicon'' existed as an [[astral projection|astral]] book as part of the [[Akashic records]] and could be accessed through [[ritual magic]] or in dreams. Grant's ideas on Lovecraft were featured heavily in the introduction to the [[Simon Necronomicon|Simon ''Necronomicon'']] and also have been backed by Tyson.<ref>Harms, Dan and John Wisdom Gonce III. 2003.

He criticized Marxists and other social scientists for believing in [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] (the belief that institutions exist because of their effect on society) and instead tried to give Marxism a foundation in [[game theory]] (the economic notion that people make choices based on the expected benefits and the choices others are likely to make).\n\nElster wrote numerous books attempting to use rational choice theory for a wide variety of social explanations. \"Rational choice theory is far more than a technical tool for explaining behaviour,\" he once wrote. \"It is also, and very importantly, a way of coming to grips with ourselves - not only what we should do, but even what we should be.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jon |last=Elster |title=Some unresolved problems in the theory of rational behaviour |journal=[[Acta Sociologica]] |year=1993 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=179\u2013189 [p. 179] |doi=10.1177/000169939303600303 }}</ref> He attempted to apply it to topics as varied as politics (''Political Psychology''), bias and constrained preferences (''Sour Grapes''), emotions (''Alchemies of the Mind''), self-restraint (''Ulysses and the Sirens'', which was selected for the [[Norwegian Sociology Canon]]), Marxism (''[[Making Sense of Marx]]''), and more.\n\nIn doing so, he elucidated many issues with simplistic notions of rational choice: endogenous preference formation (certain actions today can change preferences tomorrow, so how does one decide which preferences one prefers?), framing (people express different preferences when the same question is asked different ways), imperfect rationality (weakness of the will, emotion, impulsiveness, habit, self-deception) and our adjustments for it, and [[time preference]]s, among others.\n\nAs time went on Elster began to sour on rational choice.

shillings or more. Each elector had as many votes as there were seats to be filled. Votes had to be cast by a spoken declaration, in public, at the [[hustings]], which took place in the town of [[Cockermouth]]. The expense and difficulty of voting at only one location in the county, together with the lack of a secret ballot contributed to the corruption and intimidation of electors, which was widespread in the unreformed British political system.\n\nThe expense, to candidates, of contested elections encouraged the leading families of the county to agree on the candidates to be returned unopposed whenever possible. Contested county elections were therefore unusual.\n\n==Election results==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}\n\n''Election results taken from the History of Parliament Trust

(1832)\n\n'''Notes'''\n<references/>\n\n==Elections==\n\nThe county franchise, from 1430, was held by the adult male owners of freehold land valued at 40 shillings or more. Each elector had as many votes as there were seats to be filled. Votes had to be cast by a spoken declaration, in public, at the [[hustings]], which took place in the town of [[Cockermouth]]. The expense and difficulty of voting at only one location in the county, together with the lack of a secret ballot contributed to the corruption and intimidation of electors, which was widespread in the unreformed British political system.\n\nThe expense, to candidates, of contested elections encouraged the leading families of the county to agree on the candidates to be returned unopposed whenever possible. Contested county elections were therefore unusual.\n\n==Election results==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}\n\n''Election results taken from the History of Parliament Trust
