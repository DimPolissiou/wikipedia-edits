At club level Rush played for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] from 1980\u20131987 and 1988\u20131996. He is the club's [[List of Liverpool F.C. records and statistics#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]], having scored a total of 346 goals in all competitions at the club. At international level, Rush made 73 appearances for the [[Wales national football team]] and remained the [[Wales national football team#Top goalscorers|record goalscorer]] for his country until 2018, with 28 goals between 1980 and 1996.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest ever Liverpool players, Rush came 3rd in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop \u2013 an official Liverpool fan poll.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/have-you-seen/100pwstk-3-ian-rush \"100PWSTK: 3.

Since retiring as a player in 2000, Rush has had a stint as manager of Chester City (2004\u201305), and has worked as a television football pundit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/ian-rush-says-could-bring-9243131|title=Liverpool legend gives the Reds even more motivation to win the Premier League|last=Jones|first=Mark|date=2016-11-11|website=mirror|access-date=2019-09-05}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2015}}\nBorn in [[St Asaph]], Rush's reputation was enhanced by scoring for Chester City in a shock 2\u20130 [[FA Cup]] third round win at [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in January 1980, with Chester City equalling their best run by reaching the last 16 where they narrowly lost to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. His last game for Chester City was a 2\u20131 win over [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] at [[Sealand Road]] on 26 April 1980 in which he did not score.\n\nDespite interest from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and in spite of Rush being a boyhood [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] fan, Liverpool won the race to sign the 18-year-old in April 1980, though he had to remain at Chester until the end of the season as the transfer deadline (27 March 1980) had passed. Recommended by chief scout [[Geoff Twentyman]], Liverpool paid a record fee for a teenager of \u00a3300,000.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Geoff Twentyman: Secret Diary of a Liverpool Scout |first=Chris |last=Wood |work=LFChistory.net |accessdate=4 February 2019 |url= https://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/2883/2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Who is Ian Rush?

Rush was managed throughout his time at Chester by [[Alan Oakes]], although much of the credit for his development is given to youth manager [[Cliff Sear]]. Nearly 20 years later, Rush and Sear worked together on the coaching staff at Wrexham.\n\n===Liverpool: 1980\u20131987===\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2015}}\nRush made his international d\u00e9but, in May 1980, just before he officially became a Liverpool player. His Reds d\u00e9but came on 13 December that year in a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] fixture at [[Portman Road]] against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He was standing in for his future strike-partner, Kenny Dalglish (out with an ankle injury but at the time one of the most highly rated strikers in the world), and wore his No 7 shirt. At this stage, Liverpool were defending the league title and the League Cup, and also contending for the [[European Cup]], while Ipswich were emerging as surprise title contenders. Liverpool finished fifth (with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] winning the title), but they did win the European Cup (for the third time) and the League Cup (for the first time).\n\nThe young Rush during his first season at Liverpool mostly played reserve team football rather than being thrown into the first team. His first goal for the club took time to arrive, but it eventually came on 30 September 1981 during a [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] first round second leg tie at Anfield against [[Oulun Palloseura]]. Liverpool had already won the first leg at the [[Raatti Stadion|Raatti Stadium]] 1\u20130. The second leg they won 7\u20130 with Rush scoring in the 67th minute after coming on three minutes earlier for [[David Johnson (footballer, born 1951)|David Johnson]].\n\nHis first two league goals came on 10 October 1981 in a 3\u20130 home win over Leeds United, and a month later he scored in the [[Merseyside derby]] at Anfield in a 3\u20131 win. After [[Christmas]] however, Rush and Liverpool moved from tenth up to the top of the league. He scored a hat-trick in the 4\u20130 away league win over [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 26 January 1982, and was on the scoresheet in both of the next two games. He managed a total of eight goals in the League Cup (one of them in the final win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]) and three of them in the [[FA Cup]] campaign which ended in a fifth round defeat by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=198182|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113063201/http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=198182|archive-date=13 November 2007|url-status=usurped|title=Liverpool Results 1981\u201382|publisher=Liverweb|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref> He ended the season as the club's top scorer, netting 30 times in 49 appearances in all competitions, a ratio of 1 goal every 1.6 games. 17 of these goals came in the League as he helped Liverpool reclaim the League championship from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He also scored a goal to help Liverpool win the [[1982 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\nHe was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in 1983 after helping Liverpool to a second successive First Division/[[Football League Cup|League Cup]] double, though once again success eluded them in the [[European Cup]]. He scored 24 League goals as Liverpool finished 11 points clear of runners-up [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. On 6 November 1982 Rush scored four goals against Everton in a 5\u20130 victory, a post-war record for goals by a single player in a [[Merseyside derby]].<ref>Doyle, Paul, [https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/19/newsstory.everton The Joys of Six: Classic Merseyside Derbys], ''theguardian.com'', 19 October 2007; Retrieved 11 July 2014</ref>\n\nLiverpool's third successive League Cup triumph in this was added through a 2\u20131 win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after extra time at Wembley. He was voted [[PFA Player of the Year]] and [[BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1984 as Liverpool retained both the League and the League Cup and won the European Cup to complete a unique treble that season.<ref name=\"BBC 1\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/2525091.stm|publisher=BBC|date=8 December 2008|title=BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year|accessdate=28 October 2009|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> Rush also added the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year|Football Writers Footballer of the Year]] to the PFA award he had already claimed \u2013 the same feat that his strike partner [[Kenny Dalglish]] had achieved a year earlier.\n\nHe scored 47 goals in 65 games (making him the highest goalscorer in all competitions for any professional club that season), a goal every 1.4 matches, as Liverpool finished three points clear of closest rivals [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the League. They beat [[Merseyside derby|derby]] rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 1\u20130 in the replayed final of the League Cup (after a 0\u20130 draw in the first ever all-[[Merseyside]] final). They also won their fourth European Cup by defeating [[AS Roma]] 4\u20132 on penalties (Rush made it 3\u20132 before [[Bruce Grobbelaar]]'s famous 'jelly legs' antics) following a 1\u20131 draw after extra time.\n\nThe [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]] season was Liverpool's first trophyless season in ten years, though they did reach their fifth European Cup final against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the game of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Before the match kicked off rioting football hooligans caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 Juventus supporters. The game ended in a 1\u20130 win for Juventus. Liverpool were beaten to the title by neighbours [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who were crowned champions with four matches to spare. The sequel to the Heysel disaster was an indefinite ban on all English clubs in European competition, with Liverpool set to serve an extra season once the ban was lifted on other English clubs. This meant that Rush and Liverpool were unable to compete in the [[1985\u201386 UEFA Cup]].\n\nThe [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386 season]] Rush scored twice as Liverpool beat Southampton 2\u20130 in the FA Cup semi-final at [[White Hart Lane]], booking a place at Wembley to face Everton in the first all-Merseyside [[1986 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]]. Liverpool had pipped their city rivals to the League title (which had also been contested with the likes of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]) by beating [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 1\u20130 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. Everton opened the scoring when [[Gary Lineker]] outpaced [[Alan Hansen]] to shoot past Grobbelaar at the second attempt and held this lead until half-time. In the second half Liverpool drew level in the 57th minute when Rush latched onto a pass from [[Jan M\u00f8lby]] to round Everton goalkeeper [[Bobby Mimms]] and slot the ball into an empty net. Six minutes later, M\u00f8lby was again at the heart of another attack. Picking the ball up inside the Everton penalty area, he drilled a cross for [[Craig Johnston]] to score. Liverpool were now 2\u20131 up, but the game was in the balance until the 84th minute, when [[Ronnie Whelan]] led another attack. With the game stretched, he picked the ball up and drove towards the edge of the Everton area. Dalglish made a run across his path into space, but Whelan used it as a dummy and clipped a pass over three Everton defenders into the path of Rush who, from the angle of the six-yard area, scored past Mimms. Liverpool held on to win 3\u20131 and completed the first (and so far only) League and FA Cup double in the club's history. Rush added the Man of the Match award to his winner's medal. However, the ban on English clubs in European competition was continued, and Liverpool were unable to enter [[1986\u201387 European Cup]].\n\nSince Dalglish's appointment as player manager in the 1985 close season, Rush had often found himself partnered with [[Paul Walsh]] in the Liverpool first team as Dalglish selected himself as a player less frequently.\n\n===Juventus: 1987\u20131988===\nAfter attracting much interest from top European sides, Rush accepted an offer to sign for Italian club Juventus on 2 July 1986 for a British record transfer fee of \u00a33.2m.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/sport/ian_rush.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204060122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/sport/ian_rush.shtml|archivedate=4 February 2011|title=Ian Rush Biography|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> However, he continued to play at Liverpool for one season on loan before making his d\u00e9but for Juventus. He was the second highest goalscorer in the [[Football League]] for the [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387 season]] with 30 First Division goals, but failed to win any major trophies as the Reds finished second to Everton in the league<ref>[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-fc-news/2012/05/04/neil-pointon-remembers-everton-fc-battle-to-play-in-1987-title-winning-team-100252-30898266/ Neil Pointon remembers Everton FC battle to play in 1987 title-winning team] Liverpool Echo, 4 May 2012</ref> and were defeated by Arsenal in the [[1987 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] despite Rush's opening goal, a result that also ended a long sequence \u2013 Liverpool had not lost any of the previous 144 games in which he had scored.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2012/02/21/lfc-in-the-league-cup-final-1987-arsenal-fightback-ends-ian-rush-s-astonishing-scoring-run-100252-30374691/ LFC in the League Cup final: 1987 \u2013 Arsenal fightback ends Ian Rush's astonishing scoring run] Liverpool Echo, 21 February 2012</ref>\n\nHowever, it was viewed as a new challenge for Rush who would have the task of unlocking the much tighter defences in [[Serie A]]. His time at Juventus was less than successful, as he scored only eight times in 29 games; though this was partly explained by the Italian tradition at this time of tighter defences meaning that strikers tended to score fewer goals in Italy than they did in England.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1146782/Charles-Platt-Souness-Walker-Rush-Gascoigne--best-worst-British-footballers-whove-played-Italy.html|work=Mail Online|title=Charles, Platt, Souness, Walker, Rush and Gascoigne \u2013 the best and worst British footballers who've played in Italy|first=Mark|last=Lawford|date=17 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nIt has been said that he had a hard time settling in [[Turin]], and that once he remarked \"It's like living in a foreign country.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/quotes.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126105755/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/quotes.htm|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Famous Liverpool FC Quotes|publisher=LiverpoolFC.com|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> However, he has denied both the feeling and the quote, stating as \"absolutely untrue\" that he was homesick and did not enjoy his time in Turin. \"I was homesick at times, but it is one of the best things I've done in my life\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Honeyball|first1=Lee|title='It was like living in a foreign country'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,1404050,00.html|accessdate=5 April 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 February 2005}}</ref> In his autobiography Rush says that the quote was a joke made up by Kenny Dalglish, then in an interview published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' in 2008, claimed that the quote was fictional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N158326080108-1710.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211222636/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N158326080108-1710.htm|archivedate=11 February 2008|title=60 minutes with Ian Rush|first=Paul|last=Eaton|publisher=LiverpoolFC.com|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter just one season at the [[Stadio Grande Torino|Stadio Comunale]], he returned to Anfield, rejoining Liverpool for \u00a32.7m on 18 August 1988 \u2013 a record signing for an English club at the time, which remained unbroken for three years. It was the third time that summer that the national transfer record had been broken. The news of Rush's imminent return was given to Liverpool fans before they journeyed south to London for yet another Charity Shield match. Before the game started, they were in full voice. However, this time they had a new song: \"Rushie is back, Rushie is back\". Although the Liverpool team of [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388]] had played some outstanding football, such was Rush's stature amongst the [[Kopites|Anfield faithful]], they were pleased to see him return to the club.\n\nRush's departure from Liverpool had sparked the acquisition of new strikers [[John Aldridge]] (whose physical resemblance to Rush was often remarked upon<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19871002&id=dOM0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=h5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6671,402012|title=New Straits Times - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>) and [[Peter Beardsley]], and on his return to the Liverpool side he was partnered alongside these players to form a 4\u20133\u20133 formation. Rush's former strike partner [[Kenny Dalglish]] (who had been appointed player-manager in 1985) was still registered as a player but by then he was in his 37th year and rarely played in the first team, retiring completely in 1990. Rush published a diary of his frustrating time in Italy titled ''My Italian Diary, 1989''. In it, he reflected on his struggles to integrate himself in the dressing room at Juventus and adapt to the Italian style of play.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Liverpool (second spell): 1988\u20131996===\n[[File:Ian Rush en Terry Yorath.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ian Rush with Wales's coach [[Terry Yorath]], September 1988]]\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2015}}\nOn his return to [[Anfield]], Rush had serious competition for a place in the new-look Liverpool attack, with [[John Aldridge]] having arrived at the club just before Rush's move to Juventus and [[Peter Beardsley]] having arrived shortly afterwards. It was deemed that Rush and Aldridge were too similar in style to be able to play together. Aldridge started the season in front of Rush and consistently scored goals, thus keeping the Welshman on the bench. As the season progressed, Rush came into some form. Rush had again scored twice against Everton in a thrilling 3\u20132 win in the [[1989 FA Cup Final]]. He came off the bench to replace Aldridge, who had opened the scoring for Liverpool in the fourth minute of the game. The sides were locked at 1\u20131 after 90 minutes, but Rush put the Reds ahead in the fourth minute of extra time. Everton midfielder [[Stuart McCall]] then brought the scores level for a second time, but Rush came up with the goods once more with an incisive finish in the 103rd minute to win the Cup for Liverpool.\n\nThe 1989 FA Cup Final carried even greater significance because of the events of 15 April that year. In the semi-final, Liverpool had been drawn against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], home of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. However, the game was brought to an abrupt end at 3.06&nbsp;pm due to the unfolding [[Hillsborough disaster|disaster]]. 94 fans were crushed to death that day, with the final death toll eventually reaching 96. Rush, along with his teammates, attended many of the funerals.\n\nRush featured in the 1989 [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|League title decider]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Anfield. The Gunners needed to win by a two-goal margin to become champions, with a last-minute [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] goal famously giving them the title. Rush was injured during the first half of the game and had to be replaced by [[Peter Beardsley]].\n\nAt the end of that season, [[UEFA]] voted for the ban on English teams in European competitions to continue for at least one more season, meaning that Rush and his teammates would be unable to challenge for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]].\n\nThe 1989\u201390 season saw Rush win another League title, his fifth and last, as Liverpool finished nine points clear of Aston Villa, with Rush scoring 18 times in 36 games. However, another bid for the League\u2013FA Cup double failed as the Reds suffered a shock FA Cup semi-final defeat to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], even though Rush had given the Reds the lead with a goal in the 14th minute. The game ended in a 4\u20133 defeat, even more incredible considering that Liverpool had crushed the newly promoted [[South London]]ers [[Liverpool 9\u20130 Crystal Palace (1989)|9\u20130]] in a league game earlier in the season.\n\nAlthough the ban on English clubs in European competition was lifted for the 1990\u201391 season, Liverpool were unable to compete in the [[1990\u201391 European Cup|European Cup]] as [[UEFA]] ruled that they would have to serve an extra year's suspension.\n\n[[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391]] saw Rush continue to score regularly and Liverpool led the table from the start of the season until January, having won their opening eight league games, but they were then overhauled by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and on 22 February 1991 Dalglish announced his resignation as manager. He was replaced by [[Graeme Souness]] but the change of manager was not enough to prevent the league title from slipping away from [[Anfield]]. Shortly after Dalglish's resignation, Liverpool were eliminated from the FA Cup in the fifth round by neighbours Everton, seeing their double hopes eliminated for the fourth season running (though this time at a much earlier stage). However, Liverpool finished second and were finally readmitted to European competition, qualifying for the [[UEFA Cup]] and giving Rush and his teammates their first chance of European action since 1984\u201385.\n\nIn 1992, he picked up a third FA Cup winners' medal, scoring Liverpool's second goal, in the 67th minute, in the 2\u20130 win against [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at Wembley. This gave Rush and his colleagues another chance of European football, this time in the shape of the Cup Winners' Cup. It was a successful end to a season where Rush had struggled with injuries, and Liverpool had finished sixth in the league. However, his third goal came in a crucial 2\u20130 home win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 26 April 1992 which denied their arch-rivals the championship, the title going instead to [[Leeds United]] \u2013 the conclusion to a campaign where the title challenge had been mostly a two-horse race in which Liverpool had merely been on the fringes. Surprisingly, this was the first time he had scored against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Liverpool managed only a sixth-place finish in the league that season, the first time since 1981 that they had not finished champions or runners-up.\n\n[[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] was perhaps Liverpool's hardest season since beginning their current top flight tenure in 1962. They failed to mount a challenge for the new [[Premier League]] title, and as late as March they stood 15th in the table. Dismal form in the league had seen Rush dropped from the starting line-up, having scoring only three league goals by the beginning of March, with Souness favouring the likes of [[Ronny Rosenthal]] and [[Paul Stewart (footballer, born 1964)|Paul Stewart]], but Rush returned to his peak during the final weeks of the season with 11 goals during the final two months, and he finished the season as the club's top scorer with 14 league goals. He topped the goalscoring charts once again in [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]], beginning the season with [[Nigel Clough]] as his strike-partner until the brilliant young [[Robbie Fowler]] broke into the first team. It was another disappointing season for Liverpool, however, as they continued to perform unremarkably in the Premier League and manager Graeme Souness stepped down in late January following a shock [[FA Cup]] exit at the hands of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. Long-serving coach [[Roy Evans]] took over as manager. Liverpool finished eighth in the league, once again missing out on European competition.\n\nRush picked up his fifth League Cup winner's medal in 1995, when two goals from [[Steve McManaman]] saw off a spirited challenge from outsiders [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], as Liverpool triumphed 2\u20131. Earlier in the competition Rush scored a [[hat-trick]] as Liverpool beat Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park, the team who would go on to win the Premier League that season. Liverpool themselves achieved their best league finish since 1991, as they finished fourth in the Premier League.\n\nThe 1995 close season saw Liverpool pay a national record fee of \u00a38.4million for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] striker [[Stan Collymore]], putting Rush's future at Anfield - and most of all his place in the first team - under doubt. However, he began the season as Liverpool's first choice striker alongside Collymore, only to be replaced by Robbie Fowler as Collymore's regular partner after a few games.\n\nInevitably, his loss of a regular place in the first team sparked rumours of a transfer during the season. [[Peter Reid]] made an offer to Liverpool to sign Rush on loan for Division One promotion challengers [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in January 1996, but Liverpool manager [[Roy Evans]] rejected this offer, despite having not fielded Rush in his first eleven for two months, saying that he needed Rush as cover for Fowler and Collymore, as Liverpool began their quest for the [[FA Cup]] and were distant challengers in the league title race.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/No+Rush+to+Roker.-a061311714 No Rush to Roker] The Mirror, 23 January 1996</ref>\n\nIn late February 1996, it was announced that Rush would be leaving [[Anfield]] on a free transfer when his contract expired on 1 June. Numerous clubs were quick to express an interest in signing him. These included Everton, Sunderland, [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C|Oldham Athletic]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]],<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Royle+eyes+Rush.-a061279267 Royle eyes Rush] Daily Record, 29 February 1996</ref> Leeds United and [[Tranmere Rovers]].<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Leeds+join+rush+for+Ian.-a061323773 Leeds join rush for Ian] The Mirror, 12 March 1996</ref>\n\nHis long association with the Reds ended with a substitute appearance in the [[1996 FA Cup Final]] against Manchester United.  A hugely disappointing game looked to be heading for extra time and even a replay until [[Eric Cantona]] popped up with a late winner to give the [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]] side a 1\u20130 victory. Rush's last touch of the ball in a Liverpool shirt was when it bounced off his shoulder to set Eric Cantona up for his winning goal.\n\n===Later career: 1996\u20132000===\nRush said farewell to [[Anfield]] on 20 May 1996 when he agreed to sign for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Rush spent a season with the [[Yorkshire]] side but scored just three times in 36 [[Premier League]] games and was given a free transfer at the end of the [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u201397 campaign]].\n\nHe had been brought to [[Elland Road]] by manager [[Howard Wilkinson]], who was sacked a month into the season to be replaced by [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]].\n\nHe then linked up with [[Kenny Dalglish]] at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a one-year contract but lost his place in the side after Christmas, when [[Alan Shearer]] returned from a long-term injury. However, Rush did score an important goal in a 1\u20130 win over Everton in the 3rd round of the FA Cup, his 43rd in the competition (a 20th-century record). He scored one other goal for Newcastle in a League Cup tie with Hull City.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.newcastleunited-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/ian_rush_remembers_toon_v_hull_with_fond_memories_406363/index.shtml\n|title=Ian Rush Remembers Toon v Hull With Fond Memories!\n|work=Newcastle United Mad |publisher=Digital Sports Group|date=15 October 1997 |accessdate=20 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe had a loan spell with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] later in the season, before leaving St James's Park in the summer of 1998 to sign, amid much fanfare, for [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]]. The 37-year-old Rush failed to score in 18 [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] starts for the [[North Wales]] club, and was moved into [[Midfielder|midfield]] towards the end of the season. He made a brief playing comeback with [[Sydney Olympic]] in Australia, scoring one goal in three games, before finally retiring, aged 38, in 2000.\n\n==International career==\n{{see also|List of international goals scored by Ian Rush}}\nRush made his [[Wales national football team|Welsh]] debut before he had been handed his first start for Liverpool, playing his first match on 21 May 1980 against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], a 0\u20131 loss. He played his last international match on 24 January 1996 \u2013 a friendly match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Terni]] which Wales lost 0\u20133. Rush played regularly for the Welsh national team for more than 15 years, scoring 28 goals (Welsh record) in 73 games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/rush-intlg.html|title=Rush record at www.rsssf.com}}</ref>\n\nHe scored in a friendly against Italy in [[Brescia]] on 4 June 1988, the only goal in a shock win.

Chester had made a dreadful start to their first season back in the [[Football League]] and Rush had a hard time at the helm. After losing 3\u20131 at [[Boston United]] in their first game in charge, they strung together a two-month unbeaten run and he led the club to the [[FA Cup]] third round. Rush seemed to be answering his critics, including former Liverpool teammate [[Mark Lawrenson]], who doubted whether his tactical and coaching abilities could match his striking history.<ref>{{cite news| title= Determined to be successful| url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-columnists/ian-rush-column/2004/08/31/determined-to-be-successful-at-chester-no-matter-what-mark-lawrenson-might-think-100252-14588795/| newspaper= Liverpool Echo | date= 31 August 2004 | accessdate= 8 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nBut after Rush ruled himself out of the running for the vacant Welsh manager's job on 1 November 2004 things never seemed to go as well.

At club level Rush played for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] from 1980\u20131987 and 1988\u20131996. He is the club's [[List of Liverpool F.C. records and statistics#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]], having scored a total of 346 goals in all competitions at the club. At international level, Rush made 73 appearances for the [[Wales national football team]] and remained the [[Wales national football team#Top goalscorers|record goalscorer]] for his country until 2018, with 28 goals between 1980 and 1996.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest ever Liverpool players, Rush came 3rd in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop \u2013 an official Liverpool fan poll.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/have-you-seen/100pwstk-3-ian-rush \"100PWSTK: 3.

Since retiring as a player in 2000, Rush has had a stint as manager of Chester City (2004\u201305), and has worked as a television football pundit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/ian-rush-says-could-bring-9243131|title=Liverpool legend gives the Reds even more motivation to win the Premier League|last=Jones|first=Mark|date=2016-11-11|website=mirror|access-date=2019-09-05}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2015}}\nBorn in [[St Asaph]], Rush's reputation was enhanced by scoring for Chester City in a shock 2\u20130 [[FA Cup]] third round win at [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in January 1980, with Chester City equalling their best run by reaching the last 16 where they narrowly lost to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. His last game for Chester City was a 2\u20131 win over [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] at [[Sealand Road]] on 26 April 1980 in which he did not score.\n\nDespite interest from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and in spite of Rush being a boyhood [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] fan, Liverpool won the race to sign the 18-year-old in April 1980, though he had to remain at Chester until the end of the season as the transfer deadline (27 March 1980) had passed. Recommended by chief scout [[Geoff Twentyman]], Liverpool paid a record fee for a teenager of \u00a3300,000.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Geoff Twentyman: Secret Diary of a Liverpool Scout |first=Chris |last=Wood |work=LFChistory.net |accessdate=4 February 2019 |url= https://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/2883/2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Who is Ian Rush?

Rush was managed throughout his time at Chester by [[Alan Oakes]], although much of the credit for his development is given to youth manager [[Cliff Sear]]. Nearly 20 years later, Rush and Sear worked together on the coaching staff at Wrexham.\n\n===Liverpool: 1980\u20131987===\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2015}}\nRush made his international d\u00e9but, in May 1980, just before he officially became a Liverpool player. His Reds d\u00e9but came on 13 December that year in a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] fixture at [[Portman Road]] against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He was standing in for his future strike-partner, Kenny Dalglish (out with an ankle injury but at the time one of the most highly rated strikers in the world), and wore his No 7 shirt. At this stage, Liverpool were defending the league title and the League Cup, and also contending for the [[European Cup]], while Ipswich were emerging as surprise title contenders. Liverpool finished fifth (with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] winning the title), but they did win the European Cup (for the third time) and the League Cup (for the first time).\n\nThe young Rush during his first season at Liverpool mostly played reserve team football rather than being thrown into the first team. His first goal for the club took time to arrive, but it eventually came on 30 September 1981 during a [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] first round second leg tie at Anfield against [[Oulun Palloseura]]. Liverpool had already won the first leg at the [[Raatti Stadion|Raatti Stadium]] 1\u20130. The second leg they won 7\u20130 with Rush scoring in the 67th minute after coming on three minutes earlier for [[David Johnson (footballer, born 1951)|David Johnson]].\n\nHis first two league goals came on 10 October 1981 in a 3\u20130 home win over Leeds United, and a month later he scored in the [[Merseyside derby]] at Anfield in a 3\u20131 win. After [[Christmas]] however, Rush and Liverpool moved from tenth up to the top of the league. He scored a hat-trick in the 4\u20130 away league win over [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 26 January 1982, and was on the scoresheet in both of the next two games. He managed a total of eight goals in the League Cup (one of them in the final win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]) and three of them in the [[FA Cup]] campaign which ended in a fifth round defeat by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=198182|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113063201/http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=198182|archive-date=13 November 2007|url-status=usurped|title=Liverpool Results 1981\u201382|publisher=Liverweb|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref> He ended the season as the club's top scorer, netting 30 times in 49 appearances in all competitions, a ratio of 1 goal every 1.6 games. 17 of these goals came in the League as he helped Liverpool reclaim the League championship from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He also scored a goal to help Liverpool win the [[1982 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\nHe was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in 1983 after helping Liverpool to a second successive First Division/[[Football League Cup|League Cup]] double, though once again success eluded them in the [[European Cup]]. He scored 24 League goals as Liverpool finished 11 points clear of runners-up [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

They beat [[Merseyside derby|derby]] rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 1\u20130 in the replayed final of the League Cup (after a 0\u20130 draw in the first ever all-[[Merseyside]] final). They also won their fourth European Cup by defeating [[AS Roma]] 4\u20132 on penalties (Rush made it 3\u20132 before [[Bruce Grobbelaar]]'s famous 'jelly legs' antics) following a 1\u20131 draw after extra time.\n\nThe [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]] season was Liverpool's first trophyless season in ten years, though they did reach their fifth European Cup final against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the game of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Before the match kicked off rioting football hooligans caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 Juventus supporters. The game ended in a 1\u20130 win for Juventus. Liverpool were beaten to the title by neighbours [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who were crowned champions with four matches to spare. The sequel to the Heysel disaster was an indefinite ban on all English clubs in European competition, with Liverpool set to serve an extra season once the ban was lifted on other English clubs. This meant that Rush and Liverpool were unable to compete in the [[1985\u201386 UEFA Cup]].\n\nThe [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386 season]] Rush scored twice as Liverpool beat Southampton 2\u20130 in the FA Cup semi-final at [[White Hart Lane]], booking a place at Wembley to face Everton in the first all-Merseyside [[1986 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]]. Liverpool had pipped their city rivals to the League title (which had also been contested with the likes of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]) by beating [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 1\u20130 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. Everton opened the scoring when [[Gary Lineker]] outpaced [[Alan Hansen]] to shoot past Grobbelaar at the second attempt and held this lead until half-time. In the second half Liverpool drew level in the 57th minute when Rush latched onto a pass from [[Jan M\u00f8lby]] to round Everton goalkeeper [[Bobby Mimms]] and slot the ball into an empty net. Six minutes later, M\u00f8lby was again at the heart of another attack. Picking the ball up inside the Everton penalty area, he drilled a cross for [[Craig Johnston]] to score. Liverpool were now 2\u20131 up, but the game was in the balance until the 84th minute, when [[Ronnie Whelan]] led another attack. With the game stretched, he picked the ball up and drove towards the edge of the Everton area. Dalglish made a run across his path into space, but Whelan used it as a dummy and clipped a pass over three Everton defenders into the path of Rush who, from the angle of the six-yard area, scored past Mimms. Liverpool held on to win 3\u20131 and completed the first (and so far only) League and FA Cup double in the club's history. Rush added the Man of the Match award to his winner's medal. However, the ban on English clubs in European competition was continued, and Liverpool were unable to enter [[1986\u201387 European Cup]].\n\nSince Dalglish's appointment as player manager in the 1985 close season, Rush had often found himself partnered with [[Paul Walsh]] in the Liverpool first team as Dalglish selected himself as a player less frequently.\n\n===Juventus: 1987\u20131988===\nAfter attracting much interest from top European sides, Rush accepted an offer to sign for Italian club Juventus on 2 July 1986 for a British record transfer fee of \u00a33.2m.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/sport/ian_rush.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204060122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/sport/ian_rush.shtml|archivedate=4 February 2011|title=Ian Rush Biography|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> However, he continued to play at Liverpool for one season on loan before making his d\u00e9but for Juventus.

His time at Juventus was less than successful, as he scored only eight times in 29 games; though this was partly explained by the Italian tradition at this time of tighter defences meaning that strikers tended to score fewer goals in Italy than they did in England.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1146782/Charles-Platt-Souness-Walker-Rush-Gascoigne--best-worst-British-footballers-whove-played-Italy.html|work=Mail Online|title=Charles, Platt, Souness, Walker, Rush and Gascoigne \u2013 the best and worst British footballers who've played in Italy|first=Mark|last=Lawford|date=17 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nIt has been said that he had a hard time settling in [[Turin]], and that once he remarked \"It's like living in a foreign country.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/quotes.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126105755/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/quotes.htm|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Famous Liverpool FC Quotes|publisher=LiverpoolFC.com|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> However, he has denied both the feeling and the quote, stating as \"absolutely untrue\" that he was homesick and did not enjoy his time in Turin. \"I was homesick at times, but it is one of the best things I've done in my life\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Honeyball|first1=Lee|title='It was like living in a foreign country'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,1404050,00.html|accessdate=5 April 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 February 2005}}</ref> In his autobiography Rush says that the quote was a joke made up by Kenny Dalglish, then in an interview published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' in 2008, claimed that the quote was fictional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N158326080108-1710.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211222636/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N158326080108-1710.htm|archivedate=11 February 2008|title=60 minutes with Ian Rush|first=Paul|last=Eaton|publisher=LiverpoolFC.com|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter just one season at the [[Stadio Grande Torino|Stadio Comunale]], he returned to Anfield, rejoining Liverpool for \u00a32.7m on 18 August 1988 \u2013 a record signing for an English club at the time, which remained unbroken for three years. It was the third time that summer that the national transfer record had been broken. The news of Rush's imminent return was given to Liverpool fans before they journeyed south to London for yet another Charity Shield match. Before the game started, they were in full voice. However, this time they had a new song: \"Rushie is back, Rushie is back\". Although the Liverpool team of [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388]] had played some outstanding football, such was Rush's stature amongst the [[Kopites|Anfield faithful]], they were pleased to see him return to the club.\n\nRush's departure from Liverpool had sparked the acquisition of new strikers [[John Aldridge]] (whose physical resemblance to Rush was often remarked upon<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19871002&id=dOM0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=h5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6671,402012|title=New Straits Times - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>) and [[Peter Beardsley]], and on his return to the Liverpool side he was partnered alongside these players to form a 4\u20133\u20133 formation. Rush's former strike partner [[Kenny Dalglish]] (who had been appointed player-manager in 1985) was still registered as a player but by then he was in his 37th year and rarely played in the first team, retiring completely in 1990. Rush published a diary of his frustrating time in Italy titled ''My Italian Diary, 1989''. In it, he reflected on his struggles to integrate himself in the dressing room at Juventus and adapt to the Italian style of play.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Liverpool (second spell): 1988\u20131996===\n[[File:Ian Rush en Terry Yorath.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ian Rush with Wales's coach [[Terry Yorath]], September 1988]]\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2015}}\nOn his return to [[Anfield]], Rush had serious competition for a place in the new-look Liverpool attack, with [[John Aldridge]] having arrived at the club just before Rush's move to Juventus and [[Peter Beardsley]] having arrived shortly afterwards. It was deemed that Rush and Aldridge were too similar in style to be able to play together. Aldridge started the season in front of Rush and consistently scored goals, thus keeping the Welshman on the bench. As the season progressed, Rush came into some form. Rush had again scored twice against Everton in a thrilling 3\u20132 win in the [[1989 FA Cup Final]]. He came off the bench to replace Aldridge, who had opened the scoring for Liverpool in the fourth minute of the game. The sides were locked at 1\u20131 after 90 minutes, but Rush put the Reds ahead in the fourth minute of extra time. Everton midfielder [[Stuart McCall]] then brought the scores level for a second time, but Rush came up with the goods once more with an incisive finish in the 103rd minute to win the Cup for Liverpool.\n\nThe 1989 FA Cup Final carried even greater significance because of the events of 15 April that year. In the semi-final, Liverpool had been drawn against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], home of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. However, the game was brought to an abrupt end at 3.06&nbsp;pm due to the unfolding [[Hillsborough disaster|disaster]]. 94 fans were crushed to death that day, with the final death toll eventually reaching 96. Rush, along with his teammates, attended many of the funerals.\n\nRush featured in the 1989 [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|League title decider]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Anfield. The Gunners needed to win by a two-goal margin to become champions, with a last-minute [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] goal famously giving them the title. Rush was injured during the first half of the game and had to be replaced by [[Peter Beardsley]].\n\nAt the end of that season, [[UEFA]] voted for the ban on English teams in European competitions to continue for at least one more season, meaning that Rush and his teammates would be unable to challenge for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]].\n\nThe 1989\u201390 season saw Rush win another League title, his fifth and last, as Liverpool finished nine points clear of Aston Villa, with Rush scoring 18 times in 36 games. However, another bid for the League\u2013FA Cup double failed as the Reds suffered a shock FA Cup semi-final defeat to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], even though Rush had given the Reds the lead with a goal in the 14th minute. The game ended in a 4\u20133 defeat, even more incredible considering that Liverpool had crushed the newly promoted [[South London]]ers [[Liverpool 9\u20130 Crystal Palace (1989)|9\u20130]] in a league game earlier in the season.\n\nAlthough the ban on English clubs in European competition was lifted for the 1990\u201391 season, Liverpool were unable to compete in the [[1990\u201391 European Cup|European Cup]] as [[UEFA]] ruled that they would have to serve an extra year's suspension.\n\n[[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391]] saw Rush continue to score regularly and Liverpool led the table from the start of the season until January, having won their opening eight league games, but they were then overhauled by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and on 22 February 1991 Dalglish announced his resignation as manager. He was replaced by [[Graeme Souness]] but the change of manager was not enough to prevent the league title from slipping away from [[Anfield]]. Shortly after Dalglish's resignation, Liverpool were eliminated from the FA Cup in the fifth round by neighbours Everton, seeing their double hopes eliminated for the fourth season running (though this time at a much earlier stage). However, Liverpool finished second and were finally readmitted to European competition, qualifying for the [[UEFA Cup]] and giving Rush and his teammates their first chance of European action since 1984\u201385.\n\nIn 1992, he picked up a third FA Cup winners' medal, scoring Liverpool's second goal, in the 67th minute, in the 2\u20130 win against [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at Wembley. This gave Rush and his colleagues another chance of European football, this time in the shape of the Cup Winners' Cup. It was a successful end to a season where Rush had struggled with injuries, and Liverpool had finished sixth in the league. However, his third goal came in a crucial 2\u20130 home win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 26 April 1992 which denied their arch-rivals the championship, the title going instead to [[Leeds United]] \u2013 the conclusion to a campaign where the title challenge had been mostly a two-horse race in which Liverpool had merely been on the fringes. Surprisingly, this was the first time he had scored against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Liverpool managed only a sixth-place finish in the league that season, the first time since 1981 that they had not finished champions or runners-up.\n\n[[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] was perhaps Liverpool's hardest season since beginning their current top flight tenure in 1962. They failed to mount a challenge for the new [[Premier League]] title, and as late as March they stood 15th in the table. Dismal form in the league had seen Rush dropped from the starting line-up, having scoring only three league goals by the beginning of March, with Souness favouring the likes of [[Ronny Rosenthal]] and [[Paul Stewart (footballer, born 1964)|Paul Stewart]], but Rush returned to his peak during the final weeks of the season with 11 goals during the final two months, and he finished the season as the club's top scorer with 14 league goals. He topped the goalscoring charts once again in [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]], beginning the season with [[Nigel Clough]] as his strike-partner until the brilliant young [[Robbie Fowler]] broke into the first team. It was another disappointing season for Liverpool, however, as they continued to perform unremarkably in the Premier League and manager Graeme Souness stepped down in late January following a shock [[FA Cup]] exit at the hands of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. Long-serving coach [[Roy Evans]] took over as manager. Liverpool finished eighth in the league, once again missing out on European competition.\n\nRush picked up his fifth League Cup winner's medal in 1995, when two goals from [[Steve McManaman]] saw off a spirited challenge from outsiders [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], as Liverpool triumphed 2-1. Earlier in the competition Rush scored a [[hat-trick]] as Liverpool beat Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park, the team who would go on to win the Premier League that season. Liverpool themselves achieved their best league finish since 1991, as they finished fourth in the Premier League.\n\nThe 1995 close season saw Liverpool pay a national record fee of \u00a38.4million for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] striker [[Stan Collymore]], putting Rush's future at Anfield - and most of all his place in the first team - under doubt. However, he began the season as Liverpool's first choice striker alongside Collymore, only to be replaced by Robbie Fowler as Collymore's regular partner after a few games.\n\nInevitably, his loss of a regular place in the first team sparked rumours of a transfer during the season. [[Peter Reid]] made an offer to Liverpool to sign Rush on loan for Division One promotion challengers [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in January 1996, but Liverpool manager [[Roy Evans]] rejected this offer, despite having not fielded Rush in his first eleven for two months, saying that he needed Rush as cover for Fowler and Collymore, as Liverpool began their quest for the [[FA Cup]] and were distant challengers in the league title race.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/No+Rush+to+Roker.-a061311714 No Rush to Roker] The Mirror, 23 January 1996</ref>\n\nIn late February 1996, it was announced that Rush would be leaving [[Anfield]] on a free transfer when his contract expired on 1 June. Numerous clubs were quick to express an interest in signing him. These included Everton, Sunderland, [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C|Oldham Athletic]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]],<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Royle+eyes+Rush.-a061279267 Royle eyes Rush] Daily Record, 29 February 1996</ref> Leeds United and [[Tranmere Rovers]].<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Leeds+join+rush+for+Ian.-a061323773 Leeds join rush for Ian] The Mirror, 12 March 1996</ref>\n\nHis long association with the Reds ended with a substitute appearance in the [[1996 FA Cup Final]] against Manchester United.  A hugely disappointing game looked to be heading for extra time and even a replay until [[Eric Cantona]] popped up with a late winner to give the [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]] side a 1\u20130 victory. Rush's last touch of the ball in a Liverpool shirt was when it bounced off his shoulder to set Eric Cantona up for his winning goal.\n\n===Later career: 1996\u20132000===\nRush said farewell to [[Anfield]] on 20 May 1996 when he agreed to sign for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Rush spent a season with the [[Yorkshire]] side but scored just three times in 36 [[Premier League]] games and was given a free transfer at the end of the [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u201397 campaign]].\n\nHe had been brought to [[Elland Road]] by manager [[Howard Wilkinson]], who was sacked a month into the season to be replaced by [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]].\n\nHe then linked up with [[Kenny Dalglish]] at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a one-year contract but lost his place in the side after Christmas, when [[Alan Shearer]] returned from a long-term injury. However, Rush did score an important goal in a 1\u20130 win over Everton in the 3rd round of the FA Cup, his 43rd in the competition (a 20th-century record). He scored one other goal for Newcastle in a League Cup tie with Hull City.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.newcastleunited-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/ian_rush_remembers_toon_v_hull_with_fond_memories_406363/index.shtml\n|title=Ian Rush Remembers Toon v Hull With Fond Memories!\n|work=Newcastle United Mad |publisher=Digital Sports Group|date=15 October 1997 |accessdate=20 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe had a loan spell with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] later in the season, before leaving St James's Park in the summer of 1998 to sign, amid much fanfare, for [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]]. The 37-year-old Rush failed to score in 18 [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] starts for the [[North Wales]] club, and was moved into [[Midfielder|midfield]] towards the end of the season. He made a brief playing comeback with [[Sydney Olympic]] in Australia, scoring one goal in three games, before finally retiring, aged 38, in 2000.\n\n==International career==\n{{see also|List of international goals scored by Ian Rush}}\nRush made his [[Wales national football team|Welsh]] debut before he had been handed his first start for Liverpool, playing his first match on 21 May 1980 against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], a 0\u20131 loss. He played his last international match on 24 January 1996 \u2013 a friendly match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Terni]] which Wales lost 0\u20133.

An example is [[Cadillac]], which developed a prototype vehicle named the [[Cadillac Cyclone]] which used the new radar technology to detect objects in front of the car with the radar sensors mounted inside \"nose cones\". It was deemed too costly to manufacture.\n\nThe first modern forward collision avoidance system was demonstrated in 1995 by a team of scientists and engineers at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]] in [[Malibu, California]]. The project was funded by [[Delco Electronics]], and was led by HRL physicist Ross D. Olney. The technology was marketed as ''Forewarn''. The system was radar based{{snd}} a technology that was readily available at [[Hughes Electronics]], but not commercially elsewhere.

The system first provides warning of an impending accident, activating hazard warning lights, closing windows and sunroof, and pretensioning front seat belts. The warning is followed by light braking to get the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of {{cvt|3|m/s2|ft/s2|1}}. The fourth phase increases braking to {{cvt|5|m/s2|ft/s2|1}} followed by automatic full braking power, roughly half a second before projected impact. \"Pre sense rear\", is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The seats are moved forward to protect the car's occupants. 2015 introduced the \"avoidance assistant\" system that intervenes in the steering to help the driver avoid an obstacle. If an accident occurs, the \"turning assistant\" monitors opposing traffic when turning left at low speeds.

Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a full brake application. Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about {{convert|72|km/h|abbr=on}} , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible belt tensioners, are deployed. If the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary{{snd}} by depressing the brake pedal, activating the hold function, or moving the selector lever to \"P\"{{snd}} the system increases the brake pressure to keep the vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> Pre-Safe Impulse works an early phase of the crash, before the resulting deceleration starts to increase, the front occupants are pulled away from the direction of impact and deeper into their seats by their seat belts. By the time the accident enters the phase when loads peak, the extra distance they are retracted by can be used while dissipating energy in a controlled fashion. Pre-acceleration and force limitation allow the occupants to be temporarily isolated from the effects of the crash, significantly reducing the risk and severity of injuries in a frontal collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/>\n\n===Nissan===\nNissan's [[Infiniti]] brand offers both [[lidar|laser-based]] and [[radar|radar-based]] systems.  Brake assist with preview function anticipates the need to apply emergency braking and pre-pressurize the brake system to help improve brake response. Intelligent brake assist (IBA) with forward emergency braking (FEB) (on QX80) uses radar to monitor approaching speed to the vehicle ahead, helping detect an imminent collision. It provides a two-stage warning to alert the driver, and if the driver takes no action, the system automatically engages the brakes to mitigate the collision speed and impact. Predictive forward collision warning system warns the driver of risks that may be obscured from the driver's view. It senses the relative velocity and distance of a vehicle directly ahead, as well as a vehicle travelling in front of the preceding one. The forward emergency braking system judges that deceleration is required, it alerts the driver using both a screen display and sound, then generates a force that pushes the accelerator pedal up and applies partial braking to assist the driver in slowing the vehicle down. When the system judges that there is the possibility of a collision, it will automatically apply harder braking to help avoid one.\n\n===Subaru===\nSubaru's system, branded \"EyeSight\", was announced in May 2008 using stereo camera technology to detect pedestrians and bicyclists.

An example is [[Cadillac]], which developed a prototype vehicle named the [[Cadillac Cyclone]] which used the new radar technology to detect objects in front of the car with the radar sensors mounted inside \"nose cones\". It was deemed too costly to manufacture.\n\nThe first modern forward collision avoidance system was demonstrated in 1995 by a team of scientists and engineers at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]] in [[Malibu, California]]. The project was funded by [[Delco Electronics]], and was led by HRL physicist Ross D. Olney. The technology was marketed as ''Forewarn''. The system was radar based{{snd}} a technology that was readily available at [[Hughes Electronics]], but not commercially elsewhere.

Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a full brake application. Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about {{convert|72|km/h|abbr=on}} , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible belt tensioners, are deployed. If the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary{{snd}} by depressing the brake pedal, activating the hold function, or moving the selector lever to \"P\"{{snd}} the system increases the brake pressure to keep the vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> Pre-Safe Impulse works an early phase of the crash, before the resulting deceleration starts to increase, the front occupants are pulled away from the direction of impact and deeper into their seats by their seat belts. By the time the accident enters the phase when loads peak, the extra distance they are retracted by can be used while dissipating energy in a controlled fashion. Pre-acceleration and force limitation allow the occupants to be temporarily isolated from the effects of the crash, significantly reducing the risk and severity of injuries in a frontal collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/>\n\n===Nissan===\nNissan's [[Infiniti]] brand offers both [[lidar|laser-based]] and [[radar|radar-based]] systems.  Brake assist with preview function anticipates the need to apply emergency braking and pre-pressurize the brake system to help improve brake response. Intelligent brake assist (IBA) with forward emergency braking (FEB) (on QX80) uses radar to monitor approaching speed to the vehicle ahead, helping detect an imminent collision. It provides a two-stage warning to alert the driver, and if the driver takes no action, the system automatically engages the brakes to mitigate the collision speed and impact. Predictive forward collision warning system warns the driver of risks that may be obscured from the driver's view. It senses the relative velocity and distance of a vehicle directly ahead, as well as a vehicle travelling in front of the preceding one. The forward emergency braking system judges that deceleration is required, it alerts the driver using both a screen display and sound, then generates a force that pushes the accelerator pedal up and applies partial braking to assist the driver in slowing the vehicle down. When the system judges that there is the possibility of a collision, it will automatically apply harder braking to help avoid one.\n\n===Subaru===\nSubaru's system, branded \"EyeSight\", was announced in May 2008 using stereo camera technology to detect pedestrians and bicyclists.

He reluctantly agrees and the unlikely pair create quite a stir in the redneck sport of short course off-road truck racing.\n\nRanarivelo has recently directed \"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6102104/combined Ride]\", about a troubled boy from a Neo-Nazi family who is sent to a juvenile detention center after stabbing his dad and ends up being fostered by an interracial couple.

The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years.

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States since the information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review |date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it's incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China\".<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn 31 August 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure. Officials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on 7 July 2017, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\".

The town of Angelica was formed in 1805 from the town of [[Leicester, New York|Leicester]] in [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston County]], before Allegany County was formed. Angelica is the oldest town in Allegany County. The town hall is housed in the [[Old Allegany County Courthouse]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> [[Belvidere (Belmont, New York)|Belvidere]] was also listed in 1972, and the [[Moses Van Campen House]] was listed in 2004.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n[[File:Drawing of Philip Church from the New York Times.png|thumb|upright|Wood engraving of a portrait of [[Philip Schuyler Church]] ]]\n[[John Barker Church]] was a British-born merchant who made a fortune supplying the American and French armies during the Revolutionary war and helped fund the war. He married [[Angelica Schuyler Church]], the eldest daughter of General [[Philip Schuyler]]. Angelica Church's sister [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]] was married to [[Alexander Hamilton]]. In 1797, the young United States paid back its war debt to Church in the form of 100,000 acres of land in [[Western New York]]. John and Angelica Church's son [[Philip Schuyler Church]] travelled to what is now Allegheny and Genessee Counties to take possession of the land, with his surveyor [[Moses Van Campen]]. A planned village was laid out with the plots and design to be reminiscent of [[Paris, France]] (a circular drive in the center, streets coming to that drive to form a star, and five churches situated around the circle). In the center of the circular drive is the village park. Philip named his planned village ''Angelica'', after his mother.\n\nThe historian John S. Minard wrote of the town's establishment in ''Allegany County and Its People'' (1896):<blockquote>\"The town was formed by an act of the Legislature, passed Feb. 25, 1805, and described as \"being in width twelve miles,\" just that of the Morris Reserve, and in length \"from south to north extending thirty-four miles from the Pennsylvania line,\" taking in about two-thirds of the towns of Granger and Grove. It was taken from Leicester, and when erected was a part of Genesee county. (The village had been founded three or four years before, and named by Capt. Philip Church for his mother, Angelica, the eldest daughter of Gen. Philip Schuyler.<sup>[[Angelica Schuyler Church|[2]]]\"</sup></blockquote>Philip left to marry Anna Matilda Stewart, daughter of General [[Walter Stewart (general)|Walter Stewart]] in Philadelphia. For their [[honeymoon]], they traveled first by boat, then by raft as far west as Bath, New York, then on horseback to the banks of the [[Genesee River]]. They constructed a small house, soon to be [[whitewash]]ed and known as the \"white house\". In 1804, they had their [[mansion]] built (known as [[Belvidere (Belmont, New York)|\"Belvidere\"]]). It still stands on the banks of the Genesee near Angelica, New York.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|94.4|sqkm|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|94.3|sqkm|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqkm|disp=flip}}, or 0.10%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nThe Southern Tier Expressway ([[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] and [[New York State Route 17]]) passes through the town.\n\nThe [[Genesee River]] flows northward through the southwest part of the town.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 1510\n|1830= 998\n|1840= 1251\n|1850= 1592\n|1860= 1708\n|1870= 1643\n|1880= 1620\n|1890= 1749\n|1900= 1639\n|1910= 1668\n|1920= 1502\n|1930= 1338\n|1940= 1410\n|1950= 1390\n|1960= 1335\n|1970= 1306\n|1980= 1438\n|1990= 1446\n|2000= 1411\n|2010= 1403\n|estyear=2016\n|estimate=1358\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 1,411 people, 564 households, and 382 families residing in the town.

The town of Angelica was formed in 1805 from the town of [[Leicester, New York|Leicester]] in [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston County]], before Allegany County was formed. Angelica is the oldest town in Allegany County. The town hall is housed in the [[Old Allegany County Courthouse]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> [[Belvidere (Belmont, New York)|Belvidere]] was also listed in 1972, and the [[Moses Van Campen House]] was listed in 2004.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n[[File:Drawing of Philip Church from the New York Times.png|thumb|upright|Wood engraving of a portrait of [[Philip Schuyler Church]] ]]\n[[John Barker Church]] was a British-born merchant who made a fortune supplying the American and French armies during the Revolutionary war and helped fund the war. He married [[Angelica Schuyler Church]], the eldest daughter of General [[Philip Schuyler]]. Angelica Church's sister [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]] was married to [[Alexander Hamilton]]. In 1797, the young United States paid back its war debt to Church in the form of 100,000 acres of land in [[Western New York]]. John and Angelica Church's son [[Philip Schuyler Church]] travelled to what is now Allegheny and Genessee Counties to take possession of the land, with his surveyor [[Moses Van Campen]]. A planned village was laid out with the plots and design to be reminiscent of [[Paris, France]] (a circular drive in the center, streets coming to that drive to form a star, and five churches situated around the circle). In the center of the circular drive is the village park. Philip named his planned village ''Angelica'', after his mother.\n\nThe historian John S. Minard wrote of the town's establishment in ''Allegany County and Its People'' (1896):<blockquote>\"The town was formed by an act of the Legislature, passed Feb. 25, 1805, and described as \"being in width twelve miles,\" just that of the Morris Reserve, and in length \"from south to north extending thirty-four miles from the Pennsylvania line,\" taking in about two-thirds of the towns of Granger and Grove. It was taken from Leicester, and when erected was a part of Genesee county. (The village had been founded three or four years before, and named by Capt. Philip Church for his mother, Angelica, the eldest daughter of Gen. Philip Schuyler.<sup>[[Angelica Schuyler Church|[2]]]\"</sup></blockquote>Philip left to marry Anna Matilda Stewart, daughter of General [[Walter Stewart (general)|Walter Stewart]] in Philadelphia. For their [[honeymoon]], they traveled first by boat, then by raft as far west as Bath, New York, then on horseback to the banks of the [[Genesee River]]. They constructed a small house, soon to be [[whitewash]]ed and known as the \"white house\". In 1804, they had their [[mansion]] built (known as [[Belvidere (Belmont, New York)|\"Belvidere\"]]). It still stands on the banks of the Genesee near Angelica, New York.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|94.4|sqkm|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|94.3|sqkm|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqkm|disp=flip}}, or 0.10%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nThe Southern Tier Expressway ([[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] and [[New York State Route 17]]) passes through the town.\n\nThe [[Genesee River]] flows northward through the southwest part of the town.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 1510\n|1830= 998\n|1840= 1251\n|1850= 1592\n|1860= 1708\n|1870= 1643\n|1880= 1620\n|1890= 1749\n|1900= 1639\n|1910= 1668\n|1920= 1502\n|1930= 1338\n|1940= 1410\n|1950= 1390\n|1960= 1335\n|1970= 1306\n|1980= 1438\n|1990= 1446\n|2000= 1411\n|2010= 1403\n|estyear=2016\n|estimate=1358\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 1,411 people, 564 households, and 382 families residing in the town.
