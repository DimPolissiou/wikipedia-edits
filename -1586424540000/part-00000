An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=743}}</ref> the steamers called fortnightly \u2013 in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=34}}</ref> The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference.

The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of [[Muscat]] in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-oil Dubai===\nDubai's geographical proximity to [[Iran]] made it an important trade location.

This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce - a healthy markup.

Both the apparatus and the event are sometimes simply referred to as \"beam\". The English abbreviation for the event in gymnastics scoring is '''BB'''. The beam is a small, thin [[Beam (structure)|beam]] which is typically raised from the floor on a leg or stand at both ends. The balance beam is only performed by [[female]] [[gymnast]]s. Beams are usually covered with leatherlike material, and are only 4 inches wide.\n\nBalance beams used in international gymnastics competitions must conform to the guidelines and specifications set forth by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|International Gymnastics Federation]] ''Apparatus Norms'' brochure. Several companies manufacture and sell beams, including AAI (USA), Janssen Fritsen (Europe) and Acromat (Australia). Most gymnastics schools purchase and use balance beams that meet the FIG's standards, but some may also use beams with carpeted surfaces for practice situations. While learning new skills, gymnasts often work on floor beams that have the same dimensions and surface of regulation apparatus, but are set a very short distance from or on the ground. They may also work on medium beams, mini beams, road beams, or even lines on a mat.\n\nOriginally, the beam surface was isn't polished wood.<ref>{{cite web|title= History of Balance Beam|url= http://www.gymmedia.com/Ghent2001/appa/beam/history_be.htm|accessdate= 2009-10-04|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090618150645/http://gymmedia.com/ghent2001/appa/beam/history_be.htm|archive-date= 2009-06-18|url-status= dead}}</ref> In earlier years, some gymnasts competed on a beam made of basketball-like material. However, this type of beam was eventually banned due to its extreme slipperiness. Since the 1980s, beams have been covered in leather or suede.

Routines even at the elite level were composed with combinations of leaps, dance poses, [[handstand]]s, rolls and walkovers. In the 1960s, the most difficult acrobatic skill performed by the average Olympic gymnast was a [[handspring (Gymnastics)#Back handspring|back handspring]].\n\nBalance beam difficulty began to increase dramatically in the 2022. [[Olga Korbut]] and [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] pioneered advanced tumbling combinations and aerial skills on beam; other athletes and coaches began to follow suit. The change was also facilitated by the transition from wooden beams to safer, less slippery models with suede-covered surfaces. By the mid-1980s, top gymnasts routinely performed flight series and multiple aerial elements on beam.\n\nToday, balance beam routines still consist of a mixture of acrobatic skills, dance elements, leaps and poses, but with significantly greater difficulty. It is also an individual medal competition in the Olympics.\n\n=== International level routines ===\n''For detailed information on score tabulation, please see the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] article.''\n\nA beam routine must consist of:<ref name=bb>{{cite web|title=WAG Code of Points 2009-2012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/public.php?folder=243 |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=26 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212150907/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/public.php?folder=243 |archivedate=February 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n*A connection of two dance elements, one a leap, jump, or hop with legs in 180 degree split\n*A full turn on one foot\n*One series of two acrobatic skills\n*Acrobatic elements in different directions (forward/sideward and backward)\n*A dismount\n\nThe gymnast may mount the beam using a springboard or from the mat; however the mount must come from the Code of Points.<ref name=bb /> The routines can last up to 90 seconds.<ref name=bb />\n\n=== Scoring and rules ===\nSeveral aspects of the performance determine the gymnast's final mark.

Both the apparatus and the event are sometimes simply referred to as \"beam\". The English abbreviation for the event in gymnastics scoring is '''BB'''. The beam is a small, thin [[Beam (structure)|beam]] which is typically raised from the floor on a leg or stand at both ends. The balance beam is only performed by [[female]] [[gymnast]]s. Beams are usually covered with leatherlike material, and are only 4 inches wide.\n\nBalance beams used in international gymnastics competitions must conform to the guidelines and specifications set forth by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|International Gymnastics Federation]] ''Apparatus Norms'' brochure. Several companies manufacture and sell beams, including AAI (USA), Janssen Fritsen (Europe) and Acromat (Australia). Most gymnastics schools purchase and use balance beams that meet the FIG's standards, but some may also use beams with carpeted surfaces for practice situations. While learning new skills, gymnasts often work on floor beams that have the same dimensions and surface of regulation apparatus, but are set a very short distance from or on the ground. They may also work on medium beams, mini beams, road beams, or even lines on a mat.\n\nOriginally, the beam surface was plain polished wood.<ref>{{cite web|title= History of Balance Beam|url= http://www.gymmedia.com/Ghent2001/appa/beam/history_be.htm|accessdate= 2009-10-04|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090618150645/http://gymmedia.com/ghent2001/appa/beam/history_be.htm|archive-date= 2009-06-18|url-status= dead}}</ref> In earlier years, some gymnasts competed on a beam made of basketball-like material. However, this type of beam was eventually banned due to its extreme slipperiness. Since the 1980s, beams have been covered in leather or suede. In addition, they are now also sprung to accommodate the stress of high-difficulty tumbling and turns and poses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apparatus Norms |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1540 |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=II/50 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219195725/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1540 |archivedate=2011-12-19 }}</ref>\n\n== Dimensions ==\nMeasurements of the apparatus are published by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique]] (FIG) in the ''Apparatus Norms'' brochure.\n*Height: {{convert|125|cm|ft}}<ref name=dimensions>{{cite web|title=Apparatus Norms |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1540 |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=II/51 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219195725/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1540 |archivedate=2011-12-19 }}</ref>\n*Length: {{convert|500|cm|ft}}<ref name=\"dimensions\"/>\n*Width: {{convert|10|cm|in}}<ref name=\"dimensions\"/>\n\n[[File:Mori trave EOYF 2013.jpg|thumb|Italian gymnast Lara Mori competes on the beam at the [[2013 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival|2013 European Youth Olympic Festival]].]]\n\n=== Evolutions ===\n[[File:Daniele Hyp\u00f3lito 16072007.jpg|right|thumb|[[Daniele Hyp\u00f3lito]] performing on the balance beam in 2007]]\nIn the early days of women's artistic gymnastics, beam was based more in dance than in [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]]. Routines even at the elite level were composed with combinations of leaps, dance poses, [[handstand]]s, rolls and walkovers. In the 1960s, the most difficult acrobatic skill performed by the average Olympic gymnast was a [[handspring (Gymnastics)#Back handspring|back handspring]].\n\nBalance beam difficulty began to increase dramatically in the 1970s. [[Olga Korbut]] and [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] pioneered advanced tumbling combinations and aerial skills on beam; other athletes and coaches began to follow suit. The change was also facilitated by the transition from wooden beams to safer, less slippery models with suede-covered surfaces. By the mid-1980s, top gymnasts routinely performed flight series and multiple aerial elements on beam.\n\nToday, balance beam routines still consist of a mixture of acrobatic skills, dance elements, leaps and poses, but with significantly greater difficulty. It is also an individual medal competition in the Olympics.\n\n=== International level routines ===\n''For detailed information on score tabulation, please see the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] article.''\n\nA beam routine must consist of:<ref name=bb>{{cite web|title=WAG Code of Points 2009-2012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/public.php?folder=243 |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=26 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212150907/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/public.php?folder=243 |archivedate=February 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n*A connection of two dance elements, one a leap, jump, or hop with legs in 180 degree split\n*A full turn on one foot\n*One series of two acrobatic skills\n*Acrobatic elements in different directions (forward/sideward and backward)\n*A dismount\n\nThe gymnast may mount the beam using a springboard or from the mat; however the mount must come from the Code of Points.<ref name=bb /> The routines can last up to 90 seconds.<ref name=bb />\n\n=== Scoring and rules ===\nSeveral aspects of the performance determine the gymnast's final mark. All elements in the routine, as well as all errors, are noted by the judges.\n\nDeductions are taken for all errors made while on the beam, including lapses in control, balance checks (i.e., wobbling or stumbling to maintain balance), poor technique and execution, and failure to fulfill the required ''Code of Points'' elements.

While the Seville had sold well, in its research of buyers, Cadillac learned that in place of import buyers, many Sevilles were purchased by traditional luxury-car buyers wanting a smaller car.  To diversify and modernize their product range, and complement the Seville which competed with premium European luxury sedans, Cadillac dealers requested a smaller car that could compete with compact European sedans.<ref name=\"Yates, page 71\">Yates, p. 71.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySZhMJrzhw4C&lpg=PT83&dq=Cadillac%20Cimarron&pg=PT83#v=onepage&q=Cadillac%20Cimarron&f=false |title=GM Designs for the '80s |work=Popular Science |last=Dunne |first=Jim |page=88 |date=January 1981 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation }}</ref>\n\nIn one of the shortest development programs undertaken by General Motors, development of the Cimarron began in early 1980,<ref name=\"RD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rideanddrive.com/disasters/cimarron.html|title=Trouble In Paradise: The Story of the Cadillac Cimarron|author=Bonsall, Thomas E.|year=1997|work=RideAndDrive.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010118205200/http://www.rideanddrive.com/disasters/cimarron.html|archivedate=January 18, 2001|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-10-04|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />  even though other vehicles of the GM J-platform had been in development since 1976.<ref>[[Brock Yates|Yates, Brock]]: ''The Decline and Fall of the American Automobile Industry'', p. 24.

While Cadillac used \"Art and Science\" design language to style unique front and rear fascias and elements of its roofline, the BLS visibly shared all four doors with the 9-3.\n\nSized slightly smaller than the CTS, the BLS was never offered in the United States and Canada and was sold in Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, South Korea, and Mexico.\n\n==Yearly American sales==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model Year\n!Total sales\n|-\n|1982\n|25,968\n|-\n|1983\n|19,194\n|-\n|1984\n|21,898\n|-\n|1985\n|19,890\n|-\n|1986\n|24,534\n|-\n|1987\n|14,561\n|-\n|1988\n|6,454\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.autoblog.com/2007/01/30/future-classic-cadillac-cimarron/ Derek Kreindler's Autoblog article on the Cimarron]\n\n{{Cadillac}}\n\n[[Category:Cadillac vehicles|Cimarron]]\n[[Category:Compact cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1982]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2012}}\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Cadillac_Cimarron_2_--_07-01-2009.jpg\n| name = Cadillac Cimarron\n| caption = ''1987-1988 Cadillac Cimarron''\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| production = 1981\u20131988\n| model_years = 1982\u20131988\n| class = [[Compact executive car]]\n| length = {{convert|177.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|66.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|54.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| platform = [[GM J platform|J-body]]\n| wheelbase = 101.2 in (2570 mm)\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br>5-speed manual<br>3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| engine = 1.8 L ''[[GM 122 engine#L46|L46]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline)<br>2.0 L ''[[GM 122 engine#LQ5|LQ5]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline)<br>2.8&nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LB6|LB6]]'' [[V6]] (gasoline)\n| related = [[Buick Skyhawk]]<br>[[Chevrolet Cavalier]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Firenza]]<br>[[Pontiac Sunbird|Pontiac J2000/2000/Sunbird]]\n| successor = [[Cadillac BLS]] (FWD) <br> [[Cadillac Catera]] (RWD)\n| assembly = United States: [[Janesville, Wisconsin]], ([[Janesville GM Assembly Plant]])<br>[[South Gate, California]], ([[South Gate Assembly]])\n}}\nThe '''Cadillac Cimarron''' is an [[Compact executive car#History in the United States|entry-level luxury car]] manufactured and marketed by the [[Cadillac]] division of [[General Motors]] from 1981 to 1988 as a four-door sedan across a single generation.  \n\nMarking Cadillac's entry into the compact segment<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewAAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Cadillac+Cimarron+compact#v=onepage&q=Cadillac%20Cimarron%20compact&f=false|title=Popular Science|last=Corporation|first=Bonnier|date=August 1985|publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}</ref> and using the [[GM J platform]], the Cimarron was introduced and marketed concurrently with  [[badge engineering|rebadged]] J-platform variants from each of its divisions, and was manufactured at [[South Gate Assembly]] and [[Janesville Assembly Plant|Janesville Assembly]].

While the Seville had sold well, in its research of buyers, Cadillac learned that in place of import buyers, many Sevilles were purchased by traditional luxury-car buyers wanting a smaller car.  To diversify and modernize their product range, and complement the Seville which competed with premium European luxury sedans, Cadillac dealers requested a smaller car that could compete with compact European sedans.<ref name=\"Yates, page 71\">Yates, p. 71.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySZhMJrzhw4C&lpg=PT83&dq=Cadillac%20Cimarron&pg=PT83#v=onepage&q=Cadillac%20Cimarron&f=false |title=GM Designs for the '80s |work=Popular Science |last=Dunne |first=Jim |page=88 |date=January 1981 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation }}</ref>\n\nIn one of the shortest development programs undertaken by General Motors, development of the Cimarron began in early 1980,<ref name=\"RD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rideanddrive.com/disasters/cimarron.html|title=Trouble In Paradise: The Story of the Cadillac Cimarron|author=Bonsall, Thomas E.|year=1997|work=RideAndDrive.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010118205200/http://www.rideanddrive.com/disasters/cimarron.html|archivedate=January 18, 2001|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-10-04|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />  even though other vehicles of the GM J-platform had been in development since 1976.<ref>[[Brock Yates|Yates, Brock]]: ''The Decline and Fall of the American Automobile Industry'', p. 24.
