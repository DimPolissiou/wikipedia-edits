For around 100 years this species was absent from the estuary but have now returned and can be seen on the flats at Seal Sands.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100322231211/http://www.naturesworld.org.uk/old/tees/map.htm \"Natures World\"] Natures World Tees Feature</ref> The Seal Sands area is now designated as the Teesmouth National Nature Reserve.\n\n==Alterations==\n[[File:A19 Tees Viaduct rom Maze Park viewing hill-2-1088.jpg|thumb|The River Tees (Portrack Cut) passing through the ''Green-Blue Heart'' of the Tees Corridor between [[Middlesbrough]] and [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]] District.]]\nIn the first half of the 19th&nbsp;century, the river was straightened to enable ships to save time and money in navigation.  Between Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough, the river previously meandered first south and then north of its current channel.  Two \"cuts\", known as the [[Tees Navigation Company#The Mandale Cut|Mandale Cut]] and the [[Tees Navigation Company#The Portrack Cut|Portrack Cut]], were made to straighten its course in 1810 and 1831 respectively.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilford Wardell |first1=John |title=A History of Yarm; an Ancient North Riding Town |date=1957 |publisher=Wardell |location=Yarm |page=123|oclc=504283667}}</ref> Before these cuts were made, the journey by sailing barge from Thornaby to the mouth of the Tees, allowing for tides and other factors, could take as long as seven days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leatherdale |first1=Duncan |title=Where and what is Middlesbrough? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-48024370 |accessdate=10 August 2019 |work=BBC News |date=18 May 2019}}</ref> The Mandale Cut was the shorter of the two, at about {{convert|220|yd|m}}, with the Portrack Cut being considerably longer, although the northern meander it removed was smaller than the southern meander. Neither meander is visible today, except for the flow of [[Acklam, Middlesbrough#Stainsby|Stainsby Beck]] into a waterway which is marked on maps first as \"The Fleet\" and then \"Old River Tees\". The current [[Tees Barrage]] is close to the site of the Mandale Cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/railway/stockton/3165797.Efforts_that_kept_the_mines_afloat/|title=Tees Navigation Company|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince the cuts were made, the river has continued to undergo alterations to its bed and banks to make it deeper and more navigable. The channel has been made considerably narrower by dumping ship's ballast and ironworks slag along the former banks, increasing the scouring due to its natural flow. Maps made prior to 1900<ref>The History of the River Tees in Maps, 3rd. Ed. (2001), D.W. Pattenden, published by Cleveland and Teesside Local History Society {{ISBN|0-9507199-6-X}}</ref> show that between Stockton and Middlesbrough the river flowed in a channel up to {{convert|330|yd|m}} wide in places, with many shoals and sandbars. The modern channel varies between about {{convert|110|yd|m}} and {{convert|220|yd|m}}.\n\n==Industrialisation of the River Tees==\nThe River Tees has been used for transporting industrial goods since the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly for the shipment of [[coal]] from the [[Durham Coalfield]]s and also for the [[Steel industry|steel industries]] that later developed around [[Middlesbrough]].  In the early years merchant ships left the River Tees after loading in [[Yarm]] and [[Stockton on Tees]]; but as merchant ships became bigger, these smaller docks were superseded by bigger and deeper docks in Middlesbrough, and later even further downstream at [[Teesport]] close to the mouth of the River Tees.  The emergence of the Steel industry in the late 19th&nbsp;century earned it the nickname \"The Steel River\" owing to the many steelworks that operated along the banks of the Tees. In the 20th&nbsp;century the river also became important to the developing [[chemical industry]], contributing particularly to the development of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).\n\nThe move to loading coal on bigger ships in Middlesbrough was the economic driver for the development not only of the town of Middlesbrough itself but also of the railway between [[Stockton and Darlington Railway|Stockton and Darlington]].  This is where [[George Stephenson]] developed his railway engine \"Locomotion\" and this railway was the first steam railway to carry passengers, as well as industrial materials. The [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] was founded after an initial shareholders' meeting in a room in a public house in [[Yarm on Tees]].\n\nToday Teesport is owned by [[PD Ports]]; it is located {{convert|5.6|mi}} from the North Sea and {{convert|3.1|mi}} east of Middlesbrough.  Teesport is currently the third largest port in the United Kingdom, and among the ten biggest in Western Europe, handling over 56 million tonnes of domestic and international cargo per year.  The vast majority of these products are still related to the steel and chemical industries made by companies that are members of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC).  The areas where large scale commodity [[chemical industry]] continues to be based are [[Billingham]] and [[Seal Sands]], both on the north bank of the River Tees, and [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]] on the south bank. The [[Teesside Steelworks]] at [[Redcar]] operated until closure in 2015.\n\nOther industrial companies that use the River Tees are manufacturing and servicing the [[North Sea oil]] and gas industry as well as the [[renewable energy industry]] sector, including [[offshore wind turbine]]s.  The south bank of the mouth of the River Tees has the 62-megawatt [[Teesside Wind Farm|Teesside Offshore Wind Farm]], built 2011\u201313.\n\nNear the mouth of the River Tees is the large [[dry dock]] facility of [[ABLE UK]], named TERRC ([[Teesside Environmental Reclamation and Recycling Centre]]), used to dismantle or oil rigs and other large vessels. [[Hartlepool Nuclear Power Station]] is adjacent to the east.\n\n==Legends and folklore==\n[[Peg Powler]] is a [[hag]] in English folklore who is said to inhabit the River Tees.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Donnell|first=Elliot |authorlink=Elliott O'Donnell |title=Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful (1924) |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ghosts_Helpful_and_Harmful_1924.html?id=DP1f08e5Wr8C&redir_esc=y |accessdate=14 December 2012 |year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing|location= |isbn=9780766179080 |page=199 |pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Longstaffe |first=William Hylton Dyer |authorlink= |title=The History and Antiquities of the Parish of Darlington, in the Bishoprick |url=https://archive.org/details/historyandantiq00longgoog |accessdate=14 December 2012 |year=1854 |publisher=Darlington and Stockton Times |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Roalfe Cox |first=Marian |authorlink= |title=Introduction to Folklore (1904) |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Folklore.html?id=pd-bKE_bslEC&redir_esc=y |accessdate=14 December 2012 |year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn=9780766149403 |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe River Tees was featured in the television series ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'' as one of the wonders of the North, and in the post-apocalyptic drama ''[[The Last Train (TV series)|The Last Train]]'' having blown its banks.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of crossings of the River Tees]]\n* [[List of settlements on the River Tees]]\n* [[List of tributaries of the River Tees]]\n* [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]]\n* [[Rivers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Stockton & Darlington Railway]]\n* [[Tees Valley]]\n* [[Teesdale]]\n* [[Teesdale Way]]\n* [[Teesside]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2014}}<!-- footntoes needed for the text copyed from EB1911 see http://tools.wmflabs.org/dupdet/ -->\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911 |wstitle=Tees |volume=26 |page=499}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.bridgesonthetyne.co.uk/intro3.html Bridges On the Tees]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/tide_tables/4/185/ Tide times for the River Tees Entrance from the BBC]\n{{Rivers of Yorkshire}}\n{{stockton}}\n\n[[Category:River Tees| ]]\n[[Category:Rivers of County Durham|Tees]]\n[[Category:Rivers of North Yorkshire|Tees]]\n[[Category:Tees catchment| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Tees|the item of sports equipment|Tee|other uses|Tee (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox river\n| name               = River Tees\n| name_native        = \n| name_native_lang   = \n| name_other         = \n| name_etymology     = \n<!---------------------- IMAGE & MAP -->\n| image              = High force.jpg\n| image_size         = \n| image_caption      = [[High Force]] on the River Tees\n| map                = Tees (rivi\u00e8re).png\n| map_size           = \n| map_caption        = Path of the Tees [http://u.osmfr.org/m/375509/]\n| pushpin_map        = \n| pushpin_map_size   = \n| pushpin_map_caption= \n<!---------------------- LOCATION -->\n| subdivision_type1  = Country\n| subdivision_name1  = [[England]]\n| subdivision_type2  = \n| subdivision_name2  = \n| subdivision_type3  = Region\n| subdivision_name3  = [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Yorkshire]]\n| subdivision_type4  = \n| subdivision_name4  = \n| subdivision_type5  = \n| subdivision_name5  = \n<!---------------------- PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS -->\n| length             = {{convert|137|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} \n| width_min          = \n| width_avg          = \n| width_max          = \n| depth_min          = \n| depth_avg          = \n| depth_max          = \n| discharge1_location= \n| discharge1_min     = \n| discharge1_avg     = \n| discharge1_max     = \n<!---------------------- BASIN FEATURES -->\n| source1            = \n| source1_location   = [[Cross Fell]]\n| source1_coordinates= {{coord|54.7006|-2.4673|display=inline}}\n| source1_elevation  = {{convert|754|m|abbr=on}}\n| mouth              = [[North Sea]]\n| mouth_location     = between [[Hartlepool]] and [[Redcar]]\n| mouth_coordinates  = {{coord|54.6483|-1.1474|display=inline,title}}\n| mouth_elevation    = {{convert|0|m|abbr=on}}\n| progression        = \n| river_system       = \n| basin_size         = {{convert|1834|km2|abbr=on}}\n| tributaries_left   = Harwood Beck, Hudeshope Beck,<br/>Eggleston Burn, [[River Skerne|Skerne]], Billingham Beck\n| tributaries_right  = Maize Beck, [[River Lune, Durham|Lune]], [[River Balder|Balder]], [[River Greta, Durham|Greta]], [[River Leven, North Yorkshire|Leven]]\n| custom_label       = \n| custom_data        = \n| extra              = \n}}\nThe '''River Tees''' ({{IPAc-en|t|i\u02d0|z}}) is a river in northern [[England]].

This locality has [[lead]] and [[ironstone]] resources. Just to the east of Middleton-in-Teesdale, the [[River Lune, Durham|River Lune]] joins the Tees. After passing the village of [[Romaldkirk]] to the west, the river is joined by the [[River Balder]] at [[Cotherstone]]. The ancient town of [[Barnard Castle]], [[Egglestone Abbey]], and [[Rokeby Park]], well known through Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s poem, are all passed. At Rokeby the Tees is joined by the [[River Greta, Durham|River Greta]]. From the area near Eggleston, the river is crossing over [[millstone grit]].<ref name=\"Tees\">{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/durham.jpg|title=Tees Valley Geology|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> From here the valley begins to open out, and traverses the rich plain east and south of [[Darlington]] in large meandering curves.<ref name=\"Survey\"/>\n\nThe course of the valley down to here has been generally east-south-east, but it now turns north-east near the village of [[Whorlton, County Durham|Whorlton]]. Passing [[Ovington, County Durham|Ovington]] and [[Winston, County Durham|Winston]] it runs parallel to the [[A67 road|A67]] south-east past [[Gainford, County Durham|Gainford]] and [[Piercebridge]] to [[Darlington]], passing under the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and [[A66 road|A66]]. The section from Piercebridge to Hurworth flows over [[Magnesian Limestone|magnesian limestone]].<ref name=\"Tees\"/> It is at [[Croft-on-Tees]] that the [[River Skerne]] joins the Tees. The river now flows south past Croft-on-Tees before swinging northwards past [[Hurworth-on-Tees]]. A series of large meanders takes the course past [[Neasham]], [[Low Dinsdale]] and [[Sockburn]] to [[Middleton St George]].<ref name=\"Survey\"/> In the lower reaches of the river valley the water flows over [[Bunter (geology)|bunter sandstone]] and [[Gravel|pebble beds]].<ref name=\"Tees\"/>\n\nJust past Yarm, the [[River Leven, North Yorkshire|River Leven]] joins the Tees, before passing the settlements of [[Eaglescliffe]], [[Ingleby Barwick]] and [[Thornaby-on-Tees]].

For around 100 years this species was absent from the estuary but have now returned and can be seen on the flats at Seal Sands.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100322231211/http://www.naturesworld.org.uk/old/tees/map.htm \"Natures World\"] Natures World Tees Feature</ref> The Seal Sands area is now designated as the Teesmouth National Nature Reserve.\n\n==Alterations==\n[[File:A19 Tees Viaduct rom Maze Park viewing hill-2-1088.jpg|thumb|The River Tees (Portrack Cut) passing through the ''Green-Blue Heart'' of the Tees Corridor between [[Middlesbrough]] and [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]] District.]]\nIn the first half of the 19th&nbsp;century, the river was straightened to enable ships to save time and money in navigation.  Between Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough, the river previously meandered first south and then north of its current channel.  Two \"cuts\", known as the [[Tees Navigation Company#The Mandale Cut|Mandale Cut]] and the [[Tees Navigation Company#The Portrack Cut|Portrack Cut]], were made to straighten its course in 1810 and 1831 respectively.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilford Wardell |first1=John |title=A History of Yarm; an Ancient North Riding Town |date=1957 |publisher=Wardell |location=Yarm |page=123|oclc=504283667}}</ref> Before these cuts were made, the journey by sailing barge from Thornaby to the mouth of the Tees, allowing for tides and other factors, could take as long as seven days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leatherdale |first1=Duncan |title=Where and what is Middlesbrough? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-48024370 |accessdate=10 August 2019 |work=BBC News |date=18 May 2019}}</ref> The Mandale Cut was the shorter of the two, at about {{convert|220|yd|m}}, with the Portrack Cut being considerably longer, although the northern meander it removed was smaller than the southern meander. Neither meander is visible today, except for the flow of [[Acklam, Middlesbrough#Stainsby|Stainsby Beck]] into a waterway which is marked on maps first as \"The Fleet\" and then \"Old River Tees\". The current [[Tees Barrage]] is close to the site of the Mandale Cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/railway/stockton/3165797.Efforts_that_kept_the_mines_afloat/|title=Tees Navigation Company|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince the cuts were made, the river has continued to undergo alterations to its bed and banks to make it deeper and more navigable. The channel has been made considerably narrower by dumping ship's ballast and ironworks slag along the former banks, increasing the scouring due to its natural flow. Maps made prior to 1900<ref>The History of the River Tees in Maps, 3rd. Ed. (2001), D.W. Pattenden, published by Cleveland and Teesside Local History Society {{ISBN|0-9507199-6-X}}</ref> show that between Stockton and Middlesbrough the river flowed in a channel up to {{convert|330|yd|m}} wide in places, with many shoals and sandbars. The modern channel varies between about {{convert|110|yd|m}} and {{convert|220|yd|m}}.\n\n==Industrialisation of the River Tees==\nThe River Tees has been used for transporting industrial goods since the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly for the shipment of [[coal]] from the [[Durham Coalfield]]s and also for the [[Steel industry|steel industries]] that later developed around [[Middlesbrough]].  In the early years merchant ships left the River Tees after loading in [[Yarm]] and [[Stockton on Tees]]; but as merchant ships became bigger, these smaller docks were superseded by bigger and deeper docks in Middlesbrough, and later even further downstream at [[Teesport]] close to the mouth of the River Tees.  The emergence of the Steel industry in the late 19th&nbsp;century earned it the nickname \"The Steel River\" owing to the many steelworks that operated along the banks of the Tees. In the 20th&nbsp;century the river also became important to the developing [[chemical industry]], contributing particularly to the development of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).\n\nThe move to loading coal on bigger ships in Middlesbrough was the economic driver for the development not only of the town of Middlesbrough itself but also of the railway between [[Stockton and Darlington Railway|Stockton and Darlington]].  This is where [[George Stephenson]] developed his railway engine \"Locomotion\" and this railway was the first steam railway to carry passengers, as well as industrial materials. The [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] was founded after an initial shareholders' meeting in a room in a public house in [[Yarm on Tees]].\n\nToday Teesport is owned by [[PD Ports]]; it is located {{convert|5.6|mi}} from the North Sea and {{convert|3.1|mi}} east of Middlesbrough.  Teesport is currently the third largest port in the United Kingdom, and among the ten biggest in Western Europe, handling over 56 million tonnes of domestic and international cargo per year.  The vast majority of these products are still related to the steel and chemical industries made by companies that are members of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC).  The areas where large scale commodity [[chemical industry]] continues to be based are [[Billingham]] and [[Seal Sands]], both on the north bank of the River Tees, and [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]] on the south bank. The [[Teesside Steelworks]] at [[Redcar]] operated until closure in 2015.\n\nOther industrial companies that use the River Tees are manufacturing and servicing the [[North Sea oil]] and gas industry as well as the [[renewable energy industry]] sector, including [[offshore wind turbine]]s.  The south bank of the mouth of the River Tees has the 62-megawatt [[Teesside Wind Farm|Teesside Offshore Wind Farm]], built 2011\u201313.\n\nNear the mouth of the River Tees is the large [[dry dock]] facility of [[ABLE UK]], named TERRC ([[Teesside Environmental Reclamation and Recycling Centre]]), used to dismantle or oil rigs and other large vessels. [[Hartlepool Nuclear Power Station]] is adjacent to the east.\n\n==Legends and folklore==\n[[Peg Powler]] is a [[hag]] in English folklore who is said to inhabit the River Tees.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Donnell|first=Elliot |authorlink=Elliott O'Donnell |title=Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful (1924) |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ghosts_Helpful_and_Harmful_1924.html?id=DP1f08e5Wr8C&redir_esc=y |accessdate=14 December 2012 |year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing|location= |isbn=9780766179080 |page=199 |pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Longstaffe |first=William Hylton Dyer |authorlink= |title=The History and Antiquities of the Parish of Darlington, in the Bishoprick |url=https://archive.org/details/historyandantiq00longgoog |accessdate=14 December 2012 |year=1854 |publisher=Darlington and Stockton Times |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Roalfe Cox |first=Marian |authorlink= |title=Introduction to Folklore (1904) |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Folklore.html?id=pd-bKE_bslEC&redir_esc=y |accessdate=14 December 2012 |year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn=9780766149403 |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe River Tees was featured in the television series ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'' as one of the wonders of the North, and in the post-apocalyptic drama ''[[The Last Train (TV series)|The Last Train]]'' having blown its banks.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of crossings of the River Tees]]\n* [[List of settlements on the River Tees]]\n* [[List of tributaries of the River Tees]]\n* [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]]\n* [[Rivers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Stockton & Darlington Railway]]\n* [[Tees Valley]]\n* [[Teesdale]]\n* [[Teesdale Way]]\n* [[Teesside]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2014}}<!-- footntoes needed for the text copyed from EB1911 see http://tools.wmflabs.org/dupdet/ -->\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911 |wstitle=Tees |volume=26 |page=499}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.bridgesonthetyne.co.uk/intro3.html Bridges On the Tees]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/tide_tables/4/185/ Tide times for the River Tees Entrance from the BBC]\n{{Rivers of Yorkshire}}\n{{stockton}}\n\n[[Category:River Tees| ]]\n[[Category:Rivers of County Durham|Tees]]\n[[Category:Rivers of North Yorkshire|Tees]]\n[[Category:Tees catchment| ]]\n", "name_user": "T J WIreless", "label": "safe", "comment": "More specification of the location.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tees"}

Those should have been top four clubs, but since third-placed [[NK Croatia Sesvete|Croatia Sesvete]] and sixth-placed [[NK Beli\u0161\u0107e|Beli\u0161\u0107e]] had decided to step back from promotion, 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th placed second level teams were automatically promoted for the following season ([[NK Kamen Ingrad|Kamen Ingrad]], [[NK Pomorac Kostrena|Pomorac Kostrena]], [[NK Zadar|Zadar]] and [[NK T\u0160K Topolovac|T\u0160K Topolovac]] respectively). Therefore, the 12th placed [[NK Marsonia|Marsonia]] played a two-legged relegation play-off against the 7th placed team of Druga HNL, [[NK Solin|Solin]].

The club aimed to build a 20,000-capacity stadium on the land in time for the 2016\u201317 season, with the option of extending to 25,000 seats.
