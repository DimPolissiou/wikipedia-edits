According to the legend, when the noblemen from [[Asturias]] came down during the Reconquest to conquer what was to become the Condado Portucalense (Portugal), a young noblemen challenged the King Stag to a face-to-face duel. And the old Lord accepted. The duel took place among the trees and weeds on a trenched site. And, so the legend tells, the King Stag swept to victory! He kept the nobleman's flag that turned to be the King's coat of arms. But the Gods deceived the old King. He wouldn't be immortal... Tired of living and ill, the old Lord died in the loneliness of the crags and with him disappeared for good the Terra da Cervaria.\"\n\nBut the legend wasn't forgotten, and the coat of arms still bears a golden passant stag in silver armour standing in a green field.\n\n==History==\nVila Nova de Cerveira was established by the King [[Denis of Portugal]] on 1 October 1321, who also ordered the construction of [[Castelo de Vila Nova de Cerveira]], the castle that still dominates the town center.\n\n==Attractions==\n*The castle, today transformed to a ''[[pousada]]'',<ref>Pousada de Vila Nova de Cerveira - D.

And so the stag decided to move, together with other stags, to this uninhabited territory that began to be known as \"Terras de Cervaria\" (Land of the Stags). Many years flew past. Fights, skirmishes, and disasters gradually devastated the colony until only the King Stag was left. According to the legend, when the noblemen from [[Asturias]] came down during the Reconquest to conquer what was to become the Condado Portucalense (Portugal), a young noblemen challenged the King Stag to a face-to-face duel. And the old Lord accepted. The duel took place among the trees and weeds on a trenched site. And, so the legend tells, the King Stag swept to victory! He kept the nobleman's flag that turned to be the King's coat of arms. But the Gods deceived the old King. He wouldn't be immortal... Tired of living and ill, the old Lord died in the loneliness of the crags and with him disappeared for good the Terra da Cervaria.\"\n\nBut the legend wasn't forgotten, and the coat of arms still bears a golden passant stag in silver armour standing in a green field.\n\n==History==\nVila Nova de Cerveira was established by the King [[Denis of Portugal]] on 1 October 1321, who also ordered the construction of [[Castelo de Vila Nova de Cerveira]], the castle that still dominates the town center.\n\n==Attractions==\n*The castle, today transformed to a ''[[pousada]]'',<ref>Pousada de Vila Nova de Cerveira - D.

It lies on a small hill that rises next to the [[Minho River]], thus overlooking the town and passages between Vila Nova de Cerveira and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The castle still preserves the old wall shield as well as some gates. Inside the walls, it is possible to find the old Town Hall, the old Court, the pillory (''pelourinho'' in Portuguese), old barracks, and warehouses.\n*The Parish Church, or ''Igreja Matriz'', was built in the 18th century and is dedicated to S\u00e3o Cipriano, the patron Saint of Vila Nova de Cerveira.\n[[Image:VNCerveira - Solar dos Castros.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Solar dos Castros'']]\n*The pillory, or ''pelourinho'', is a symbol of municipal jurisdiction and is located inside the castle in front of the old Town Hall, or ''Pa\u00e7os do Concelho''.

In the 12th century, the defence of this border was in charge of the [[Knights Templar]], who built several castles along the river. One of these is the [[Castle of Almourol]], built by the Master of the Portuguese Templars, [[Gualdim Pais]], in 1171. The picturesque castle is located on an island in the [[Tagus river]] and can be visited by boat. Nowadays it is the most visited historical site in Vila Nova da Barquinha.\n\n[[Image:Castelo Almourol Portugal 3.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Castle of Almourol]].]]\nIn the end of the 13th century, when the Reconquista was finished, the importance of the castles of the region declined. The villages along the Tagus then became important fluvial ports for the transport of agricultural goods of the region to [[Lisbon]]. In the 16th century, the port of the village of Tancos became the most important of all, being granted a [[foral]] (letter of feudal rights) in 1517 by [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]]. From the early 16th century date the main church (''matriz'') of the village of Atalaia, with a magnificent portal and interior in [[Renaissance]] style.\n\nThe village of Vila Nova da Barquinha, current seat of the municipality, was created in the 17th century around a fluvial port (hence the name ''Barquinha'' = ''Barca'' = Boat). In the 18th and 19th centuries the village became the most important in the region, and it was turned into the seat of the municipality in 1836. The importance of the river in the development of the municipality is reflected in its [[coat-of-arms]], which shows the picture of a boat.

This Latin phrase means \"Who is like God?\"  It is a reference to [[St. Michael the Archangel]] for whom the island of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]] is named; in Hebrew, the name, [[Michael]], means \"he who is like God\".\n\nFounded in the middle of the 15th century by Gon\u00e7alo Vaz Botelho, the settlement was elevated to the status of ''vila'' (''town'') in 1472; Vila Franca do Campo quickly grew into the largest settlement and administrative seat of the island of S\u00e3o Miguel.\n\nThe greatest tragedy to befall the Azores occurred on 20 October 1522, when a violent earthquake hit the area of Vila Franca do Campo, then capital of the archipelago and most important Azorean settlement.<ref name=\"MeloBento33\">Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.33</ref> During the earthquake and subsequent landslide, 5000 people were killed, with then Captain-Donat\u00e1rio [[Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara II]] escaping the tragedy: he was relaxing in his summer home in Lagoa at the time of the tragedy.<ref>C\u00e2mara had been Donat\u00e1rio since 1504, the date when his mother D. In\u00eas and siblings mysteriously disappeared at sea during a voyage to Lisbon.</ref> Many of the residents were buried alive from a landslide and debris.<ref name=MeloBento33/> Because of its destruction, the capital of S\u00e3o Miguel was transferred to Ponta Delgada, where the Captain-Donat\u00e1rio installed his administration in a residence near the Church of S\u00e3o Pedro.<ref name=MeloBento33/> King John III eventually elevated Ponta Delgada to the status of city on 2 April 1546, attracting more and more economic activity and settlement.<ref name=MeloBento33/>\n\nIn the sequel of the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada|1582 naval battle]] off the coast of S\u00e3o Miguel, the Spanish victors had several hundred French and Portuguese prisoners executed in the town.\n\nThe town began to prosper again from the 18th century onwards from orange plantations, and later, from pineapple production.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Porto e Marina de Vila Franca do Campo, ilha de S\u00e3o Miguel, Arquip\u00e9lago dos A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The main port and marina in [[S\u00e3o Miguel (Vila Franca do Campo)|S\u00e3o Miguel]]]]\n[[File:Praia de \u00c1gua de Alto.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The Beach of \u00c1gua de Alto, showing the Bahia Palace Hotel, one of the summer destinations of sunseekers]]\n[[File:Lagoa do Congro, Ilha de S\u00e3o Miguel, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A view of the Lagoa da Congro, a volcanic lake that marks the interior of the municipality]]\nVila Franca do Campo Municipality is located east of [[Ponta Delgada Municipality|Ponta Delgada]] via the Regional E.R.1-1\u00aa roadway, while it is linked by mountain roads to the eastern and northern communities (including [[Lagoa (Azores)|Lagoa]], [[Furnas]] and [[Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o]]). Most of the mountainous areas of the municipality are forested, interspersed with pasturelands and fields dedicated to agriculture and grazing.\n\nThe climate in this region is mild and humid, with temperatures oscillating between {{convert|14|C|F}} and {{convert|22|C|F}}, and with regular precipitation, responsible for the fertile soils and ravines. These ravines that cross the municipality include the ''Ribeira da s Tr\u00eas Voltas'', ''Ribeira da Praia'' and ''Ribeira da M\u00e3e d'\u00c1gua''.\n\nThe relief of this region is characterized by basaltic rock and projectiles from volcanic activities on the island, forming many of the distinctive geomorophological structures, such as: the islet of Vila Franca, Pico d'El-Rei (674 m), Monte Escuro (890 m), Lombados Pis\u00f5es (258 m), Miradouro (685 m), Lagoa do Fogo and  Ponta da Pir\u00e2mide.\n\nAdministratively, the six parishes of Vila Franca do Campo Municipality include:\n\n* [[\u00c1gua de Alto]], the 1624 resident population (2001 Census), located on the western border of the municipality is known for the beaches and coves that hug the coast; initially a settlement of

This Latin phrase means \"Who is like God?\"  It is a reference to [[St. Michael the Archangel]] for whom the island of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]] is named; in Hebrew, the name, [[Michael]], means \"he who is like God\".\n\nFounded in the middle of the 15th century by Gon\u00e7alo Vaz Botelho, the settlement was elevated to the status of ''vila'' (''town'') in 1472; Vila Franca do Campo quickly grew into the largest settlement and administrative seat of the island of S\u00e3o Miguel.\n\nThe greatest tragedy to befall the Azores occurred on 20 October 1522, when a violent earthquake hit the area of Vila Franca do Campo, then capital of the archipelago and most important Azorean settlement.<ref name=\"MeloBento33\">Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.33</ref> During the earthquake and subsequent landslide, 5000 people were killed, with then Captain-Donat\u00e1rio [[Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara II]] escaping the tragedy: he was relaxing in his summer home in Lagoa at the time of the tragedy.<ref>C\u00e2mara had been Donat\u00e1rio since 1504, the date when his mother D. In\u00eas and siblings mysteriously disappeared at sea during a voyage to Lisbon.</ref> Many of the residents were buried alive from a landslide and debris.<ref name=MeloBento33/> Because of its destruction, the capital of S\u00e3o Miguel was transferred to Ponta Delgada, where the Captain-Donat\u00e1rio installed his administration in a residence near the Church of S\u00e3o Pedro.<ref name=MeloBento33/> King John III eventually elevated Ponta Delgada to the status of city on 2 April 1546, attracting more and more economic activity and settlement.<ref name=MeloBento33/>\n\nIn the sequel of the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada|1582 naval battle]] off the coast of S\u00e3o Miguel, the Spanish victors had several hundred French and Portuguese prisoners executed in the town.\n\nThe town began to prosper again from the 18th century onwards from orange plantations, and later, from pineapple production.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Porto e Marina de Vila Franca do Campo, ilha de S\u00e3o Miguel, Arquip\u00e9lago dos A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The main port and marina in [[S\u00e3o Miguel (Vila Franca do Campo)|S\u00e3o Miguel]]]]\n[[File:Praia de \u00c1gua de Alto.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The Beach of \u00c1gua de Alto, showing the Bahia Palace Hotel, one of the summer destinations of sunseekers]]\n[[File:Lagoa do Congro, Ilha de S\u00e3o Miguel, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A view of the Lagoa da Congro, a volcanic lake that marks the interior of the municipality]]\nVila Franca do Campo Municipality is located east of [[Ponta Delgada Municipality|Ponta Delgada]] via the Regional E.R.1-1\u00aa roadway, while it is linked by mountain roads to the eastern and northern communities (including [[Lagoa (Azores)|Lagoa]], [[Furnas]] and [[Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o]]). Most of the mountainous areas of the municipality are forested, interspersed with pasturelands and fields dedicated to agriculture and grazing.\n\nThe climate in this region is mild and humid, with temperatures oscillating between {{convert|14|C|F}} and {{convert|22|C|F}}, and with regular precipitation, responsible for the fertile soils and ravines. These ravines that cross the municipality include the ''Ribeira da s Tr\u00eas Voltas'', ''Ribeira da Praia'' and ''Ribeira da M\u00e3e d'\u00c1gua''.\n\nThe relief of this region is characterized by basaltic rock and projectiles from volcanic activities on the island, forming many of the distinctive geomorophological structures, such as: the islet of Vila Franca, Pico d'El-Rei (674 m), Monte Escuro (890 m), Lombados Pis\u00f5es (258 m), Miradouro (685 m), Lagoa do Fogo and  Ponta da Pir\u00e2mide.\n\nAdministratively, the six parishes of Vila Franca do Campo Municipality include:\n\n* [[\u00c1gua de Alto]], the 1624 resident population (2001 Census), located on the western border of the municipality is known for the beaches and coves that hug the coast; initially a settlement of thirty homes in the 15th century, it was a locality within the civil parish of [[S\u00e3o Pedro (Vila Franca do Campo)|S\u00e3o Pedro]] until 1908, when it was deannexed from the local administrative authority and incorporated;\n* [[Ponta Gar\u00e7a]], the largest within Vila Franca, and longest by extension in the Azores, Ponta Gar\u00e7a includes a population of 3577 inhabitants located along a lateral roadway that hugs the clifftops of the south-central region to the small faj\u00e3s/beaches of Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o;\n* [[Ribeira das Tainhas]], with 782 residents, the smallest parish in area,
