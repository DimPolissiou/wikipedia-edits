The show venue for this season continues to be at the [[MasterCard Centre]] in [[Etobicoke]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].\n\nThere are no Monday night results show this season; therefore, elimination takes place at the end of each Sunday night performance show from Week 2 onwards.  The judges score and viewer votes from the previous week determine the bottom two couples on the current week's show, which are announced at the top of the programme.  The bottom two couples perform their new routines in the \"Skate-Off\" at the end of the episode after the couples who are safe have skated.  The judges would then score their performances and the couple with the lower judges score is eliminated.  The score for the remaining couple's performance would count as their score for the week.  The one-time use Judge's Save returned for this season.\n\nViewer voting this season is solely done on the show's official website, eliminating the telephone and texting options.  Each unregistered visitor gets one vote.  Registered visitors can earn additional votes by completing their profile and other activities and challenges on the website.\n\n==Casting==\nThe official cast announcement were made from September 15 to September 20 on the show's website.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=CBCbattle|author=Battle of the Blades|number=377135781468721152|date=9 September 2013|title=BIG NEWS: We reveal the skating line up starting Sunday! #WhoWillSkate? #BattleIsBack #BOTB}}</ref>  Along with the eight new ex-NHL hockey players, the female figure skating professionals were also announced; but the pairings of the two were only announced on the season premiere preview show, \"Made in Canada\", which aired on September 22.  Unlike the previous season, which introduced a female hockey player competitor, this season featured solely male hockey players, as per the first two seasons.\n\nOf the eight female skaters, four were returning participants: season 1 & 2 first runner-up [[Shae-Lynn Bourne]], season 1 second runner-up & season 3 first runner-up [[Marie-France Dubreuil]], season 2 & 3 competitor [[Violetta Afanasieva]], and season 3 competitor [[Marcy Hinzmann]].

The show venue for this season continues to be at the [[MasterCard Centre]] in [[Etobicoke]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].\n\nThere are no Monday night results show this season; therefore, elimination takes place at the end of each Sunday night performance show from Week 2 onwards.  The judges score and viewer votes from the previous week determine the bottom two couples on the current week's show, which are announced at the top of the programme.  The bottom two couples perform their new routines in the \"Skate-Off\" at the end of the episode after the couples who are safe have skated.  The judges would then score their performances and the couple with the lower judges score is eliminated.  The score for the remaining couple's performance would count as their score for the week.  The one-time use Judge's Save returned for this season.\n\nViewer voting this season is solely done on the show's official website, eliminating the telephone and texting options.  Each unregistered visitor gets one vote.  Registered visitors can earn additional votes by completing their profile and other activities and challenges on the website.\n\n==Casting==\nThe official cast announcement were made from September 15 to September 20 on the show's website.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=CBCbattle|author=Battle of the Blades|number=377135781468721152|date=9 September 2013|title=BIG NEWS: We reveal the skating line up starting Sunday! #WhoWillSkate? #BattleIsBack #BOTB}}</ref>  Along with the eight new ex-NHL hockey players, the female figure skating professionals were also announced; but the pairings of the two were only announced on the season premiere preview show, \"Made in Canada\", which aired on September 22.

Le\u015bnica (now part of Wroc\u0142aw), 7 or 8 December 1201) was [[Duke]] of [[Wroclaw]] from 1163 until his death in 1201.\n\nHe was the eldest son of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]] by his wife [[Agnes of Babenberg]], daughter of Margrave [[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria|Leopold III of Austria]] and half-sister of King [[Conrad III of Germany]].\n\n==Life==\n\n=== Early Years ===\nBoles\u0142aw spent his childhood in the court of his grandfather and namesake, [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]], in [[P\u0142ock]]. It was not until 1138, after the death of Boles\u0142aw III, that he moved with his parents to [[Krak\u00f3w]], which became the capital of the [[Seniorate Province]], ruled by his father as High Duke and overlord of Poland.\n\nThe reign of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was short and extremely stormy. The conflicts began when the High Duke tried to remove his half-brothers, the Junior Dukes, from their districts. According to the chronicler [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], the confrontation between the siblings was mainly instigated by W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's wife, Agnes of Babenberg, who believed that her husband, as the eldest son, was the rightful sole ruler of the whole country. On the other hand, [[Salomea of Berg]], widow of Boles\u0142aw III and W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's stepmother, attempted to form alliances with foreign rulers and took every opportunity to secure the reign of her sons, the Junior Dukes. She feared that they would be relegated from their positions to make way for W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's sons, the young Boles\u0142aw and his brothers [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot|Mieszko Tanglefoot]] and [[Konrad Spindleshanks|Konrad]].\n\nThe conflict erupted in 1141, when Salomea of Berg, without the knowledge of the High Duke, decided to leave her sons the land of [[\u0141\u0119czyca]], her [[dower]] (pl: ''oprawa wdowia'') and tried to give her youngest daughter Agnes in marriage to one of the sons of [[Vsevolod II Olgovich]], Grand Prince of [[Kiev]]. W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was faster, however, and he gave Grand Prince Vsevolod II several additional political advantages, including a marriage between Boles\u0142aw and Vsevolod II's daughter, [[Zvenislava of Kiev|Zvenislava]], which took place in 1142.\n\n===Trip to Ruthenia===\n[[Image:Boles\u0142aw I Wysoki.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Boles\u0142aw I the Tall in a drawing by [[Jan Matejko]].]]\nThe Polish-Ruthenian alliance soon proved to be extremely important in the struggle between W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and the Junior Dukes. The final conflicts took place after the death of Salomea of Berg in 1144. It seemed that a victory for the High Duke - thanks to his military predominance - was just a matter of time. In fact, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was so confident of winning at home that he sent Boles\u0142aw to aid Grand Prince Vsevolod II during a revolt in Kiev.\n\nUnfortunately, Boles\u0142aw's expedition ended in complete disaster, as the Grand Prince's death from disease created general confusion in Kiev. Then in 1146, Boles\u0142aw had to return quickly to Poland to help his father. The few troops which he recruited were not enough to stop the general rebellion against W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, who was completely defeated by the Junior Dukes. The deposed High Duke and his family initially escaped to the [[Prague]] court of Duke [[Vladislaus II, Duke and King of Bohemia|Vladislav II of Bohemia]].\n\n===Unsuccessful attempt at restoration===\nAfter a short time in Bohemia, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and his family moved to Germany, where King [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] (half-brother of his wife Agnes) offered his hospitality and assistance toward the High Duke's restoration. At first, it seemed that the exile would just be for a few months, thanks to the family connections of Duchess Agnes; however, their hurried and insufficiently prepared expedition failed to cross the [[Oder River]], and ultimately failed because of strong opposition from W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's former subjects and problems Conrad III had within Germany as a result of his extended travels. The King gave W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and his family the town of [[Altenburg]] in [[Saxony]]. This was intended as a temporary residence, but W\u0142adys\u0142aw II would spend the rest of his life there.\n\n===Knight at the court of Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa===\nTired of a tedious life in Altenburg, Boles\u0142aw traveled to the court of his protector, King Conrad III. With him, the young Polish prince extensively took part in German political affairs. In 1148 he joined in the [[Second Crusade]] with Conrad III, during which he visited [[Constantinople]] and the [[Holy Land]].\n\nConrad III died in 1152 without having secured the return of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II to Poland. His successor was his energetic nephew [[Frederick Barbarossa]], whose service Boles\u0142aw almost immediately joined. The first action of the new German ruler, however, was not to help W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, but instead to march against Rome and be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Boles\u0142aw accompanied him.\n\n===Expedition of Frederick Barbarossa to Poland===\nIt was not until 1157 that the Emperor finally organized an expedition against Poland. It is unknown whether Boles\u0142aw, his brothers, or his father directly participated in the expedition. However, despite the military victory and the humiliating submission of High Duke [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]] to Frederick Barbarossa, the Emperor decided to maintain the rule of Boles\u0142aw IV and the Junior Dukes in Poland, and not to restore W\u0142adys\u0142aw II to the throne. Two years later, on 30 May 1159, the disappointed former High Duke died in his exile in Altenburg.\n\n===Restoration of the Silesian Inheritance===\n[[Image:POL wojew\u00f3dztwo dolno\u015bl\u0105skie COA.svg|thumb|left|150px|The black crownless eagle of the [[Silesian Piasts]].]]\nDespite his dissatisfaction at the Emperor's treatment of his father, Boles\u0142aw remained at the side of the Emperor, participating in his many wars. From 1158-1162 he took part in the Barbarossa's expedition to Italy, where he won fame after killing a well-known Italian knight in a duel on the walls of [[Milan]].\n\nBoles\u0142aw's faithful service to the Emperor was finally rewarded in 1163, when Barbarossa succeeded through diplomacy in restoring to the descendants of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II their inheritance over [[Silesia]]. By an agreement signed in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, Boles\u0142aw IV agreed to accept the return of the exiled princes. He did so because, after the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, his sons could not directly challenge his authority as the senior duke, and they had not yet established any support within Poland. In addition, seating them would satisfy \nBarbarossa and thus keep him away from Poland.<ref name=\"Kalendarium Historii Polski\">{{cite book | author = [[Andrzej Chwalba]] | editor = Wydawnictwo Literackie| title = Kalendarium Historii Polski| url = | format = | year = 2000 | publisher =  | location = Krak\u00f3w  | isbn = 83-08-03136-6 | pages = :51\u201352| chapter = | chapterurl = | quote =|language=pl}}</ref> However Boles\u0142aw IV decided to maintain the security of his lands and retain the control over the main Silesian cities of [[Wroclaw]], [[Opole]], [[Racib\u00f3rz]], [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]], and [[Legnica]].\n\nAfter almost 16 years of exile, Boles\u0142aw returned to Silesia with his second wife, Christina (Zvenislava had died around 1155); his elder children, [[Jaros\u0142aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros\u0142aw]] and Olga; and his younger brother [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot|Mieszko Tanglefoot]]. The youngest brother, [[Konrad Spindleshanks|Konrad]], remained in Germany.\n\nBoles\u0142aw and Mieszko initially ruled jointly and two years later (1165) both retook the major Silesian cities handed back by the High Duke and obtained full control over all Silesia. However Boles\u0142aw, as the eldest brother, held overall authority. Three years after taking control over Silesia, Boles\u0142aw felt strong enough to lead a retaliatory expedition against the High Duke Boles\u0142aw IV to try and recover supremacy over Poland.\n\n===Rebellion of Mieszko Tanglefoot===\n[[Image:Silesia 1172-1177.jpg|thumb|right|200pz|Fragmentation of the Duchy of Silesia begins. Period 1172/3-1177<br/>{{legend|orange|Boles\u0142aw I the Tall}}<br/>{{legend|green|Jaros\u0142aw Opolski}}<br/>{{legend|yellow|Mieszko I Tanglefoot}}]]\nBoles\u0142aw's exercise of overall power at the expense of his younger brother caused a revolt by Mieszko Tanglefoot in 1172. In a major disturbance in the Silesian ducal family, Mieszko supported Jaros\u0142aw, the eldest son of Boles\u0142aw, who was resentful against his father because had been forced to become a priest due to the intrigues of his stepmother Christina, who wished for her sons to be the only heirs. The rebellion was a complete surprise to Boles\u0142aw, who was forced to escape to [[Erfurt]], Germany. This time, Frederick Barbarossa decided to support Boles\u0142aw with a strong armed intervention to restore him to his Duchy. Eventually Mieszko III the Old was sent by the High Duke to calm the fury of the Emperor and keep him away from Polish affairs. Mieszko III gave Barbarossa 8000 pieces of silver and promised him the restoration of Boles\u0142aw, who finally returned home at the beginning of 1173. However, despite his reconciliation with his brother and son, he was forced to divide Silesia and create the Duchies of Racib\u00f3rz (granted to Mieszko) and Opole (to Jaros\u0142aw).\n\n===Rebellion against Mieszko III the Old===\nFour years later, it seemed that Boles\u0142aw was close to achieving the main objective of his life, the recovery of the Seniorate Province, and with this the title of High Duke. He conspired with his uncle [[Casimir II the Just]] and his cousin [[Odon of Greater Poland|Odon]] (Mieszko III's eldest son) to deprive [[Mieszko III the Old]] of the government. The coup gained the support of [[Lesser Poland]], which was mastered{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} by Casimir and shortly afterwards [[Greater Poland]] sided with Odon.  Boles\u0142aw, however, suffered a sudden and surprising defeat at the hands of his brother Mieszko and his son Jaros\u0142aw who had allied with Mieszko III. This left the way free for Casimir II to be proclaimed High Duke, and Boles\u0142aw again had to escape to Germany. Thanks to the mediation of Casimir II, Boles\u0142aw returned to his Duchy without major troubles in 1177; however, he suffered a further diminution of his authority when he was compelled to give G\u0142og\u00f3w to his youngest brother Konrad.\n\n===Retirement from political affairs===\nAfter this defeat, Boles\u0142aw retired from the Polish political scene and concentrated his efforts on the rule over his duchy. His brother Konrad's death without issue in 1190 resulted in the return of G\u0142og\u00f3w to his domains.\n\nDuring the last years of his reign, Boles\u0142aw devoted himself to economic and business activity. Colonization, initially from poor German areas, substantially accelerated the economic development of the duchy, and was continued by his son [[Henry I the Bearded]]. Boles\u0142aw founded the Cistercian [[Abbatia Lubensis abbey]] in [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] with the collaboration of monks from [[Pforta]], across the [[Saale River]] in [[Thuringia]]. Later the abbey became the Silesian ducal burial place.\n\n===Papal bull and death===\nTo safeguard his lands from other [[Piast]] princes, Boles\u0142aw obtained a protective [[Papal bull|bull]] from [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1198. There was a reconciliation between Boles\u0142aw and his eldest son, Jaros\u0142aw, who was elected [[List of bishops of Wroc\u0142aw|Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]].

Le\u015bnica (now part of Wroc\u0142aw), 7 or 8 December 1201) was [[Duke]] of [[Wroclaw]] from 1163 until his death in 1201.\n\nHe was the eldest son of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]] by his wife [[Agnes of Babenberg]], daughter of Margrave [[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria|Leopold III of Austria]] and half-sister of King [[Conrad III of Germany]].\n\n==Life==\n\n=== Early Years ===\nBoles\u0142aw spent his childhood in the court of his grandfather and namesake, [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]], in [[P\u0142ock]]. It was not until 1138, after the death of Boles\u0142aw III, that he moved with his parents to [[Krak\u00f3w]], which became the capital of the [[Seniorate Province]], ruled by his father as High Duke and overlord of Poland.\n\nThe reign of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was short and extremely stormy. The conflicts began when the High Duke tried to remove his half-brothers, the Junior Dukes, from their districts. According to the chronicler [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], the confrontation between the siblings was mainly instigated by W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's wife, Agnes of Babenberg, who believed that her husband, as the eldest son, was the rightful sole ruler of the whole country. On the other hand, [[Salomea of Berg]], widow of Boles\u0142aw III and W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's stepmother, attempted to form alliances with foreign rulers and took every opportunity to secure the reign of her sons, the Junior Dukes. She feared that they would be relegated from their positions to make way for W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's sons, the young Boles\u0142aw and his brothers [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot|Mieszko Tanglefoot]] and [[Konrad Spindleshanks|Konrad]].\n\nThe conflict erupted in 1141, when Salomea of Berg, without the knowledge of the High Duke, decided to leave her sons the land of [[\u0141\u0119czyca]], her [[dower]] (pl: ''oprawa wdowia'') and tried to give her youngest daughter Agnes in marriage to one of the sons of [[Vsevolod II Olgovich]], Grand Prince of [[Kiev]]. W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was faster, however, and he gave Grand Prince Vsevolod II several additional political advantages, including a marriage between Boles\u0142aw and Vsevolod II's daughter, [[Zvenislava of Kiev|Zvenislava]], which took place in 1142.\n\n===Trip to Ruthenia===\n[[Image:Boles\u0142aw I Wysoki.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Boles\u0142aw I the Tall in a drawing by [[Jan Matejko]].]]\nThe Polish-Ruthenian alliance soon proved to be extremely important in the struggle between W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and the Junior Dukes. The final conflicts took place after the death of Salomea of Berg in 1144. It seemed that a victory for the High Duke - thanks to his military predominance - was just a matter of time. In fact, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was so confident of winning at home that he sent Boles\u0142aw to aid Grand Prince Vsevolod II during a revolt in Kiev.\n\nUnfortunately, Boles\u0142aw's expedition ended in complete disaster, as the Grand Prince's death from disease created general confusion in Kiev. Then in 1146, Boles\u0142aw had to return quickly to Poland to help his father. The few troops which he recruited were not enough to stop the general rebellion against W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, who was completely defeated by the Junior Dukes. The deposed High Duke and his family initially escaped to the [[Prague]] court of Duke [[Vladislaus II, Duke and King of Bohemia|Vladislav II of Bohemia]].\n\n===Unsuccessful attempt at restoration===\nAfter a short time in Bohemia, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and his family moved to Germany, where King [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] (half-brother of his wife Agnes) offered his hospitality and assistance toward the High Duke's restoration. At first, it seemed that the exile would just be for a few months, thanks to the family connections of Duchess Agnes; however, their hurried and insufficiently prepared expedition failed to cross the [[Oder River]], and ultimately failed because of strong opposition from W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's former subjects and problems Conrad III had within Germany as a result of his extended travels. The King gave W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and his family the town of [[Altenburg]] in [[Saxony]]. This was intended as a temporary residence, but W\u0142adys\u0142aw II would spend the rest of his life there.\n\n===Knight at the court of Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa===\nTired of a tedious life in Altenburg, Boles\u0142aw traveled to the court of his protector, King Conrad III. With him, the young Polish prince extensively took part in German political affairs. In 1148 he joined in the [[Second Crusade]] with Conrad III, during which he visited [[Constantinople]] and the [[Holy Land]].\n\nConrad III died in 1152 without having secured the return of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II to Poland. His successor was his energetic nephew [[Frederick Barbarossa]], whose service Boles\u0142aw almost immediately joined. The first action of the new German ruler, however, was not to help W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, but instead to march against Rome and be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Boles\u0142aw accompanied him.\n\n===Expedition of Frederick Barbarossa to Poland===\nIt was not until 1157 that the Emperor finally organized an expedition against Poland. It is unknown whether Boles\u0142aw, his brothers, or his father directly participated in the expedition. However, despite the military victory and the humiliating submission of High Duke [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]] to Frederick Barbarossa, the Emperor decided to maintain the rule of Boles\u0142aw IV and the Junior Dukes in Poland, and not to restore W\u0142adys\u0142aw II to the throne. Two years later, on 30 May 1159, the disappointed former High Duke died in his exile in Altenburg.\n\n===Restoration of the Silesian Inheritance===\n[[Image:POL wojew\u00f3dztwo dolno\u015bl\u0105skie COA.svg|thumb|left|150px|The black crownless eagle of the [[Silesian Piasts]].]]\nDespite his dissatisfaction at the Emperor's treatment of his father, Boles\u0142aw remained at the side of the Emperor, participating in his many wars. From 1158-1162 he took part in the Barbarossa's expedition to Italy, where he won fame after killing a well-known Italian knight in a duel on the walls of [[Milan]].\n\nBoles\u0142aw's faithful service to the Emperor was finally rewarded in 1163, when Barbarossa succeeded through diplomacy in restoring to the descendants of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II their inheritance over [[Silesia]]. By an agreement signed in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, Boles\u0142aw IV agreed to accept the return of the exiled princes. He did so because, after the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, his sons could not directly challenge his authority as the senior duke, and they had not yet established any support within Poland. In addition, seating them would satisfy \nBarbarossa and thus keep him away from Poland.<ref name=\"Kalendarium Historii Polski\">{{cite book | author = [[Andrzej Chwalba]] | editor = Wydawnictwo Literackie| title = Kalendarium Historii Polski| url = | format = | year = 2000 | publisher =  | location = Krak\u00f3w  | isbn = 83-08-03136-6 | pages = :51\u201352| chapter = | chapterurl = | quote =|language=pl}}</ref> However Boles\u0142aw IV decided to maintain the security of his lands and retain the control over the main Silesian cities of [[Wroclaw]], [[Opole]], [[Racib\u00f3rz]], [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]], and [[Legnica]].\n\nAfter almost 16 years of exile, Boles\u0142aw returned to Silesia with his second wife, Christina (Zvenislava had died around 1155); his elder children, [[Jaros\u0142aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros\u0142aw]] and Olga; and his younger brother [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot|Mieszko Tanglefoot]]. The youngest brother, [[Konrad Spindleshanks|Konrad]], remained in Germany.\n\nBoles\u0142aw and Mieszko initially ruled jointly and two years later (1165) both retook the major Silesian cities handed back by the High Duke and obtained full control over all Silesia. However Boles\u0142aw, as the eldest brother, held overall authority. Three years after taking control over Silesia, Boles\u0142aw felt strong enough to lead a retaliatory expedition against the High Duke Boles\u0142aw IV to try and recover supremacy over Poland.\n\n===Rebellion of Mieszko Tanglefoot===\n[[Image:Silesia 1172-1177.jpg|thumb|right|200pz|Fragmentation of the Duchy of Silesia begins. Period 1172/3-1177<br/>{{legend|orange|Boles\u0142aw I the Tall}}<br/>{{legend|green|Jaros\u0142aw Opolski}}<br/>{{legend|yellow|Mieszko I Tanglefoot}}]]\nBoles\u0142aw's exercise of overall power at the expense of his younger brother caused a revolt by Mieszko Tanglefoot in 1172. In a major disturbance in the Silesian ducal family, Mieszko supported Jaros\u0142aw, the eldest son of Boles\u0142aw, who was resentful against his father because had been forced to become a priest due to the intrigues of his stepmother Christina, who wished for her sons to be the only heirs. The rebellion was a complete surprise to Boles\u0142aw, who was forced to escape to [[Erfurt]], Germany. This time, Frederick Barbarossa decided to support Boles\u0142aw with a strong armed intervention to restore him to his Duchy. Eventually Mieszko III the Old was sent by the High Duke to calm the fury of the Emperor and keep him away from Polish affairs. Mieszko III gave Barbarossa 8000 pieces of silver and promised him the restoration of Boles\u0142aw, who finally returned home at the beginning of 1173. However, despite his reconciliation with his brother and son, he was forced to divide Silesia and create the Duchies of Racib\u00f3rz (granted to Mieszko) and Opole (to Jaros\u0142aw).\n\n===Rebellion against Mieszko III the Old===\nFour years later, it seemed that Boles\u0142aw was close to achieving the main objective of his life, the recovery of the Seniorate Province, and with this the title of High Duke. He conspired with his uncle [[Casimir II the Just]] and his cousin [[Odon of Greater Poland|Odon]] (Mieszko III's eldest son) to deprive [[Mieszko III the Old]] of the government. The coup gained the support of [[Lesser Poland]], which was mastered{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} by Casimir and shortly afterwards [[Greater Poland]] sided with Odon.  Boles\u0142aw, however, suffered a sudden and surprising defeat at the hands of his brother Mieszko and his son Jaros\u0142aw who had allied with Mieszko III. This left the way free for Casimir II to be proclaimed High Duke, and Boles\u0142aw again had to escape to Germany. Thanks to the mediation of Casimir II, Boles\u0142aw returned to his Duchy without major troubles in 1177; however, he suffered a further diminution of his authority when he was compelled to give G\u0142og\u00f3w to his youngest brother Konrad.\n\n===Retirement from political affairs===\nAfter this defeat, Boles\u0142aw retired from the Polish political scene and concentrated his efforts on the rule over his duchy. His brother Konrad's death without issue in 1190 resulted in the return of G\u0142og\u00f3w to his domains.\n\nDuring the last years of his reign, Boles\u0142aw devoted himself to economic and business activity. Colonization, initially from poor German areas, substantially accelerated the economic development of the duchy, and was continued by his son [[Henry I the Bearded]]. Boles\u0142aw founded the Cistercian [[Abbatia Lubensis abbey]] in [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] with the collaboration of monks from [[Pforta]], across the [[Saale River]] in [[Thuringia]]. Later the abbey became the Silesian ducal burial place.\n\n===Papal bull and death===\nTo safeguard his lands from other [[Piast]] princes, Boles\u0142aw obtained a protective [[Papal bull|bull]] from [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1198. There was a reconciliation between Boles\u0142aw and his eldest son, Jaros\u0142aw, who was elected [[List of bishops of Wroc\u0142aw|Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]. This enabled him, after Jaros\u0142aw's death on 22 March 1201, to inherit Opole, which was again reunited with his lands.\n\nBoles\u0142aw survived his son by only nine months, however, and died on 7 or 8 December 1201 in his {{ill|castle in Le\u015bnica|pl|Zamek w Le\u015bnicy}}, west of Wroc\u0142aw. He was buried in the [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] Cistercian [[Abbatia Lubensis abbey|monastery]] which he had founded.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nIn 1142 Boles\u0142aw married his first wife [[Zvenislava of Kiev|Zvenislava]] (d. ca. 1155), daughter of [[Vsevolod II Olgovich]], Grand Prince of [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Raffensperger|2018|p=114}} They had two children:\n#[[Jaros\u0142aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros\u0142aw]] (b. aft. 1143 \u2013 d. 22 March 1201)\n#Olga (b. ca. 1155 \u2013 d. 27 June 1175/1180)\n\nBy 1157, Boles\u0142aw married his second wife Christina (d. 21 February 1204/1208), a German; according to the historian [[Kazimierz Jasi\u0144ski]], she was probably a member of the [[comital]] house of [[Everstein]], [[House of Homburg|Homburg]], or [[Pappenheim]].

Lives are lost, questions and uncertainty loom over the trapped townspeople, and, as they realize they might be stuck for a while, panic and chaos become the new normal. As the townspeople frantically try to find resources to stay alive, an opportunistic town councilman with malicious intent makes himself the [[de facto]] dictator over the town, while an unknown stranger causes secrets about the town to be revealed. As the season progresses, the characters start to learn more about the dome, including finding a mysterious egg that supposedly serves as the Dome's power source, and although every little piece of answer gives more insight into what's happening and why, every answer also causes many more questions.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nThe cast members portray characters that were mostly taken from the original novel, \"although some have been combined and others have changed jobs.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=King |title=A Letter From Stephen |url=http://stephenking.com/promo/utd_on_tv/letter.html |publisher=StephenKing.com |date=June 27, 2013 |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}</ref>\n{{Columns-start|num=2}}\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Mike Vogel]] as Dale 'Barbie' Barbara\n* [[Rachelle Lefevre]] as Julia Shumway\n* [[Natalie Martinez]] as Linda Esquivel\n* [[Britt Robertson]] as Angie McAlister\n* [[Alexander Koch (actor)|Alexander Koch]] as James 'Junior' Rennie\n* [[Colin Ford]] as Joe McAlister\n* Nicholas Strong as Phil Bushey\n* [[Jolene Purdy]] as Dodee Weaver\n* [[Aisha Hinds]] as Carolyn Hill\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as Sheriff Howard 'Duke' Perkins\n* [[Dean Norris]] as James 'Big Jim' Rennie\n{{column}}\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as Dr. Alice Calvert\n* [[Mackenzie Lintz]] as Norrie Calvert-Hill\n* [[Beth Broderick]] as Rose Twitchell\n* [[Dale Raoul]] as Andrea Grinnell\n* John Elvis as Ben Drake\n* R.

That deal, estimated at $750,000 for each episode, covered one quarter of each episode's estimated production cost. Additionally, the article says that foreign markets also played an important role in the financing, bringing in approximately $1.9 million, and with the [[North Carolina]] state tax credits the show earned for filming in the state, an estimated $400,000, meant CBS had already earned back the money they paid for each episode before the episodes even aired on TV.

Additionally, the article says that foreign markets also played an important role in the financing, bringing in approximately $1.9 million, and with the [[North Carolina]] state tax credits the show earned for filming in the state, an estimated $400,000, meant CBS had already earned back the money they paid for each episode before the episodes even aired on TV.

Curry was critical of \"groupthink\", and was engaging actively with the climate change denial community,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} because she believes that some of them brought up valid points, and that lumping the good with the bad could lead to missed opportunities to improve the science. \n\nCurry is critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), a United Nations\u2013sponsored body who reports the consensus on climate science. She does not have confidence in their process, and has stated: \"So it's not so much as finding things that were wrong, but rather ignorance that was unrecognized and confidence that was overstated\".<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nCurry also asserts that scientists have not adequately dealt with the uncertainty in their calculations. She argues that: \"There's a whole host of unknown unknowns that we don't even know how to quantify but that should be factored into our confidence level\". The IPCC estimates are uncertain by a few percent, and the consensus of climate scientists other than Curry who have discussed the matter is that this is not enough to significantly impact the projections.\n<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nCurry retired in 2017 from her tenured position as a professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology at age 63, because of what she calls \"the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around human-caused global warming\". [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann]] said climate science would be stronger without her because of her \"confusionism and denialism\".

Though these arguments place her outside the academic consensus, Curry said that her findings were compatible with those presented by the [[International Panel on Climate Change]].

Curry was critical of \"groupthink\", and was engaging actively with the climate change denial community,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} because she believes that some of them brought up valid points, and that lumping the good with the bad could lead to missed opportunities to improve the science. \n\nCurry is critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), a United Nations\u2013sponsored body who reports the consensus on climate science. She does not have confidence in their process, and has stated: \"So it's not so much as finding things that were wrong, but rather ignorance that was unrecognized and confidence that was overstated\".<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nCurry also asserts that scientists have not adequately dealt with the uncertainty in their calculations. She argues that: \"There's a whole host of unknown unknowns that we don't even know how to quantify but that should be factored into our confidence level\".

Taking advice from his friend Rick Lagados, Steven bribes cable installer Ernie \"Chip\" Douglas into giving him free movie channels. Chip gets Steven to hang out with him the next day and makes him one of his \"preferred customers\". Chip takes Steven to the city's central [[satellite dish]], where he confides to Steven about being raised on television due to the frequent absences of his single mother. Chip soon proves to be intrusive as he crashes a basketball game between Steven and his friends and leaves several messages on Steven's answering machine. Following a passionate knight battle between Chip and Steven at [[Medieval Times]], Steven finds that Chip has secretly installed an expensive [[home theater system]] in his living room as a gift in return for Steven's friendship. Although Steven declines the gift, he agrees to host a party attended by Chip's other preferred customers before having the system returned. In the fervor the party, Steven sleeps with a young guest, whom Chip reveals the next morning to have been a prostitute that he had hired specifically for Steven. Upon this revelation, Steven angrily ejects Chip from his apartment.\n\nTo make amends, Chip tracks down Robin, who is dating another man. A disguised Chip severely beats the man in a restaurant bathroom and tells him to stay away from Robin. He later upgrades Robin's cable, ostensibly as a gift from Steven. Robin decides to get back together with Steven as a result. However, when Chip informs Steven of his role in reuniting him with Robin, Steven politely ends his relationship with Chip. Devastated, Chip sets out on a series of vengeful acts. He gets Steven arrested for possession of the stolen property and mocks him through a prison visitation window. After being released on [[bail]], Steven is further embarrassed when Chip attends dinner with his family and Robin. Following a sexualized version of the game ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', Steven openly berates Chip and punches him. The next day, Steven is fired from his job when Chip transmits a privately-recorded conversation, in which Steven insults his boss, onto the company's computers.\n\nRick investigates Chip at Steven's request and finds that Chip was fired from the cable company for [[stalking]] customers, and uses the names of television characters as aliases such as Chip Douglas from ''[[My Three Sons]]'' and Larry Tate from ''[[Bewitched]]''. Chip calls Steven that night, telling him he is paying Robin a visit. After visiting Robin's empty apartment, Steven tracks them down to the satellite dish, where Chip holds Robin hostage in a rainstorm. After a physical altercation and a chase, Steven is able to save Robin. As the police arrive, Chip apologizes to Steven for being a bad friend. Chip, proclaiming that he must \"kill the babysitter\" to prevent others from becoming like him, dives backward from the top of a ladder above the satellite dish, falling onto it and knocking out the television signal to the entire city. Chip survives the fall with an injured back, and bids Steven farewell before being hauled away in a rescue helicopter. When one of the paramedics addresses him as \"buddy\", Chip asks the paramedic if he is truly his buddy, to which the paramedic replies \"Yeah, sure you are\", causing Chip to smile deviously.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Steven M.

Taking advice from his friend Rick Lagados, Steven bribes cable installer Ernie \"Chip\" Douglas into giving him free movie channels. Chip gets Steven to hang out with him the next day and makes him one of his \"preferred customers\". Chip takes Steven to the city's central [[satellite dish]], where he confides to Steven about being raised on television due to the frequent absences of his single mother. Chip soon proves to be intrusive as he crashes a basketball game between Steven and his friends and leaves several messages on Steven's answering machine. Following a passionate knight battle between Chip and Steven at [[Medieval Times]], Steven finds that Chip has secretly installed an expensive [[home theater system]] in his living room as a gift in return for Steven's friendship. Although Steven declines the gift, he agrees to host a party attended by Chip's other preferred customers before having the system returned. In the fervor the party, Steven sleeps with a young guest, whom Chip reveals the next morning to have been a prostitute that he had hired specifically for Steven. Upon this revelation, Steven angrily ejects Chip from his apartment.\n\nTo make amends, Chip tracks down Robin, who is dating another man. A disguised Chip severely beats the man in a restaurant bathroom and tells him to stay away from Robin. He later upgrades Robin's cable, ostensibly as a gift from Steven. Robin decides to get back together with Steven as a result. However, when Chip informs Steven of his role in reuniting him with Robin, Steven politely ends his relationship with Chip. Devastated, Chip sets out on a series of vengeful acts. He gets Steven arrested for possession of the stolen property and mocks him through a prison visitation window. After being released on [[bail]], Steven is further embarrassed when Chip attends dinner with his family and Robin. Following a sexualized version of the game ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', Steven openly berates Chip and punches him. The next day, Steven is fired from his job when Chip transmits a privately-recorded conversation, in which Steven insults his boss, onto the company's computers.\n\nRick investigates Chip at Steven's request and finds that Chip was fired from the cable company for [[stalking]] customers, and uses the names of television characters as aliases such as Chip Douglas from ''[[My Three Sons]]'' and Larry Tate from ''[[Bewitched]]''. Chip calls Steven that night, telling him he is paying Robin a visit. After visiting Robin's empty apartment, Steven tracks them down to the satellite dish, where Chip holds Robin hostage in a rainstorm. After a physical altercation and a chase, Steven is able to save Robin. As the police arrive, Chip apologizes to Steven for being a bad friend. Chip, proclaiming that he must \"kill the babysitter\" to prevent others from becoming like him, dives backward from the top of a ladder above the satellite dish, falling onto it and knocking out the television signal to the entire city. Chip survives the fall with an injured back, and bids Steven farewell before being hauled away in a rescue helicopter. When one of the paramedics addresses him as \"buddy\", Chip asks the paramedic if he is truly his buddy, to which the paramedic replies \"Yeah, sure you are\", causing Chip to smile deviously.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Steven M.
