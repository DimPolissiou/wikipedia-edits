It is the traditional centre of the densely-forested [[Bosanska Krajina]] region of northwestern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. {{As of|2013||alt=According to the 2013 census|df=}}, the city proper has a population of 138,963, while its administrative area comprises a total of 185,042 inhabitants.\n\nThe city is home to the [[University of Banja Luka]] as well as numerous state and entity institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The city lies on the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas River]] and is well known in the countries of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] for being full of tree-lined avenues, boulevards, gardens, and parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|title=\u0410\u0421\u0411\u041b >> General information|website=www.banjaluka.rs.ba|access-date=2 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815215526/http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|archive-date=15 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe name 'Banja Luka' was first mentioned in a document dated to 6 February 1494 by [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Ladislaus II of Hungary]]. The name is interpreted as the 'Ban's meadow', from the words ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' (a mediaeval noble title), and ''luka'' ('valley' or 'meadow'). The identity of the ban and the meadow in question remain uncertain, and [[popular etymology]] combines the modern words ''banja'' ('bath' or 'spa'), or ''bajna'' ('marvelous') and ''luka'' ('port'). A different interpretation is suggested by the Hungarian name ''Luk\u00e1csb\u00e1nya'', in English 'Luke's Mine',  which is also the meaning of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''ba\u0148a Luka''. In modern usage, the name is pronounced and usually [[declension|declined]] (''u Banjaluci'') as one word, and often written as such. The citizens reportedly prefer the form with inflected adjective (''u Banjoj Luci'').<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&reportid=151 Ivan Lovrenovi\u0107, \" \u2018Serb\u2019 towns in Bosnia\"], BH Dani, 20 July 2001</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Overview===\nBanja Luka covers some {{convert|96.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is situated on either bank of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] in the Banja Luka valley, which is characteristically flat within the otherwise hilly region. Banja Luka's centre lies {{convert|163|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\nThe source of the Vrbas River is about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to the south at the [[Vranica]] mountain. Its tributaries\u2014the Suturlija, the Crkvena, and the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja]]\u2014flow into the Vrbas at various points in the city.

Later periodic intrusions by the Austrian army stimulated military developments in Banja Luka, which made it into a strategic military centre. Orthodox churches and monasteries near Banja Luka were built in the 19th century. Also, [[Sephardic Jew]]s and [[Trappists]] migrated to the city in the 19th century and contributed to the early industrialisation of the region by building mills, breweries, brick factories, textile factories and other important structures.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe [[Mariastern Abbey, Banja Luka|Trappist monastery]] built in the 19th century lent its name to the neighbourhood of ''Trapisti'' and has left a large legacy in the area through its famous [[Trappista cheese|Trappist cheese]] and its beer production.\n\nIn 1835 and 1836, during Ottoman administration, numerous people from Banja Luka emigrated to [[Le\u0161nica, Serbia|Le\u0161nica]], [[Lipnica (Loznica)|Lipnica]] and [[Loznica]], the villages around Loznica, and to [[\u0160abac]].<ref>Jovan Cviji\u0107, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju\u017enoslovenske zemlje /Balkan Peninsula and South Slav Countries/ (Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud\u017ebenika, 1966), pp. 151-152.</ref>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\nDespite its leading position in the region, Banja Luka as a city was not modernised until [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]] in the late 19th century.

Banja Luka is the centre of the government for the Municipality of Banja Luka. A number of entity and state institutions are seated in the city. The Republika Srpska Government and the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]] are based in Banja Luka.\n\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina State Agencies based in the city include the Indirect Taxation (VAT) Authority, the Deposit Insurance Agency as well as a branch of the [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (formerly the National Bank of Republika Srpska). [[Austria]], Croatia, France, Germany, [[Serbia]], the United Kingdom and the United States maintain diplomatic representation through [[Consul (representative)|consulates-general]] in Banja Luka.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. In this period Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established [[Banja Luka Stock Exchange]]. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as [[Telekom Srpske]], Rafinerija ulja Modri\u010da, [[Banjalu\u010dka Pivara]] and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Serbia]], now include a number of investment funds from the EU, and from [[Norway]], the United States, Japan and China.\n\nA number of financial services regulators, such as the [[Republika Srpska Securities Commission]] and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n;Economic preview\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The local [[handball]], basketball and football teams bear the traditional name [[Borac Banja Luka|Borac]] (''fighter''). The three football teams from Banja Luka are [[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]] (2010/2011 season champions of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), [[FK BSK Banja Luka|BSK Banja Luka]], and [[FK Omladinac Banja Luka|Omladinac Banja Luka]] (both in the [[First League of the Republika Srpska]]), FK Naprijed Banja Luka and FK Vrbas Banja Luka\n\n[[FK Borac Banja Luka]] is the most popular football club in the Republika Srpska. The club has won several major trophies in its history such as trophies as a champion of [[Mitropa Cup]], [[Yugoslav Cup]], [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup]], [[2007\u201308 First League of the Republika Srpska|First League of the Republika Srpska]], [[Republika Srpska Cup|Republic Srpska Cup]]. They have participated in [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]].\n\nThe city has a long tradition of handball. [[RK Borac Banja Luka]] was the European Champion in 1976, the European Vice-Champion in 1975 and the winner of the IHF Cup in 1991.\n\nRecently, tennis has taken on a bigger role in the city. The local tennis tournament, [[Banja Luka Challenger|\"Memorijal Trive Vuji\u0107a\"]], has become professional and has been awarded [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] status in 2001, with the rank of a [[ATP Challenger Series|Challenger]]. The Banja Luka Challenger takes place in September each year. In 2005, the European Championships in [[Rafting]] were held on the Vrbas river.  In 2006, the [[Davis Cup]] matches of the Europe/Africa Zone Group III took place in the city. Since 2015, the city hosts the Banjaluka Half-marathon.\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:TranzitBL.jpg|thumb|right|Banja Luka west transit road]]\n[[File:Isto\u010dni tranzit, Banja Luka.jpg|thumb|Banja Luka east transit road]]\n[[File:BH Airlines - Banja Luka airport - Aug-10 v1.jpg|thumb|right|B&H Airlines [[ATR 72]] at Banja Luka airport preparing for the flight to Z\u00fcrich, August 2010]]\n\nPublic transportation within Banja Luka is exclusively operated by the bus services. Over thirty bus lines connect downtown with the rest of the city and its suburbs. The oldest bus link in the city is line No 1. Taxis are also readily available. The expressway E-661 (locally known as M-16) leads north to [[Croatia]] from Banja Luka by way of [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi\u0161ka]], near the Bosnian/Croatian border. A wide range of bus services are available to most neighbouring and larger towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to regional and European destinations such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, France, Italy, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia.\n\nBanja Luka is the hub of the railway services of [[Republika Srpska Railways|\u017deljeznice Republike Srpske]], comprising one half of the railway network of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Services operate to most northern Bosnian towns, and two modern air-conditioned 'Talgo' trains run to [[Sarajevo]] every day. However, services are relatively slow and infrequent compared with neighbouring countries.\n\n[[Banja Luka International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: BNX, [[ICAO]]: LQBK) is located {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Banja Luka. The airport is served by [[Air Serbia]], which operates flights to [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport|Belgrade]] and summer charters to [[Antalya Airport|Antalya]] and [[Athens International Airport|Athens]], while [[Ryanair]] operates flights to [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport|Brussels]], [[Memmingen Airport|Memmingen]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Berlin]] and [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Stockholm]].

The name is interpreted as the 'Ban's meadow', from the words ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' (a mediaeval noble title), and ''luka'' ('valley' or 'meadow'). The identity of the ban and the meadow in question remain uncertain, and [[popular etymology]] combines the modern words ''banja'' ('bath' or 'spa'), or ''bajna'' ('marvelous') and ''luka'' ('port'). A different interpretation is suggested by the Hungarian name ''Luk\u00e1csb\u00e1nya'', in English 'Luke's Mine',  which is also the meaning of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''ba\u0148a Luka''. In modern usage, the name is pronounced and usually [[declension|declined]] (''u Banjaluci'') as one word, and often written as such. The citizens reportedly prefer the form with inflected adjective (''u Banjoj Luci'').<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&reportid=151 Ivan Lovrenovi\u0107, \" \u2018Serb\u2019 towns in Bosnia\"], BH Dani, 20 July 2001</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Overview===\nBanja Luka covers some {{convert|96.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is situated on either bank of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] in the Banja Luka valley, which is characteristically flat within the otherwise hilly region.

A number of springs can be found nearby.\n\nThe area around Banja Luka is mostly woodland, although there are mountains further from the city. The most notable of these mountains are Manja\u010da (1,214 m), \u010cemernica (1,338 m), and Tisovac.

The area comprising Banja Luka was entirely in the kingdom of Illyria and then a part of the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], which split into provinces of [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia]] of which Castra became a part.

It was also the central sanjak in the Bosnia Eyalet. In 1688, the city was burned down by the [[Austria]]n army, but it quickly recovered. Later periodic intrusions by the Austrian army stimulated military developments in Banja Luka, which made it into a strategic military centre. Orthodox churches and monasteries near Banja Luka were built in the 19th century. Also, [[Sephardic Jew]]s and [[Trappists]] migrated to the city in the 19th century and contributed to the early industrialisation of the region by building mills, breweries, brick factories, textile factories and other important structures.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe [[Mariastern Abbey, Banja Luka|Trappist monastery]] built in the 19th century lent its name to the neighbourhood of ''Trapisti'' and has left a large legacy in the area through its famous [[Trappista cheese|Trappist cheese]] and its beer production.\n\nIn 1835 and 1836, during Ottoman administration, numerous people from Banja Luka emigrated to [[Le\u0161nica, Serbia|Le\u0161nica]], [[Lipnica (Loznica)|Lipnica]] and [[Loznica]], the villages around Loznica, and to [[\u0160abac]].<ref>Jovan Cviji\u0107, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju\u017enoslovenske zemlje /Balkan Peninsula and South Slav Countries/ (Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud\u017ebenika, 1966), pp. 151-152.</ref>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\nDespite its leading position in the region, Banja Luka as a city was not modernised until [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]] in the late 19th century. Railroads, schools, factories, and infrastructure appeared, and were developed, which turned Banja Luka into a modern city.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nAfter World War I, the town became the capital of the [[Vrbas Banovina]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\nThe provincial capital owed its rapid progress to the first Ban Svetislav Milosavljevi\u0107. During that time, the Banski dvor and its twin sister, the Administration building, the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, a theatre and a museum were built, the Grammar School was renovated, the Teachers College enlarged, a city bridge was built and the park renovated.\n125 elementary schools were functioning in Banja Luka in 1930. The revolutionary ideas of the time were incubated by the \"Pelagi\u0107\" association and the Students' Club.

Banja Luka is the centre of the government for the Municipality of Banja Luka. A number of entity and state institutions are seated in the city. The Republika Srpska Government and the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]] are based in Banja Luka.\n\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina State Agencies based in the city include the Indirect Taxation (VAT) Authority, the Deposit Insurance Agency as well as a branch of the [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (formerly the National Bank of Republika Srpska). [[Austria]], Croatia, France, Germany, [[Serbia]], the United Kingdom and the United States maintain diplomatic representation through [[Consul (representative)|consulates-general]] in Banja Luka.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. In this period Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established [[Banja Luka Stock Exchange]]. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as [[Telekom Srpske]], Rafinerija ulja Modri\u010da, [[Banjalu\u010dka Pivara]] and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Serbia]], now include a number of investment funds from the EU, and from [[Norway]], the United States, Japan and China.\n\nA number of financial services regulators, such as the [[Republika Srpska Securities Commission]] and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n;Economic preview\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The local [[handball]], basketball and football teams bear the traditional name [[Borac Banja Luka|Borac]] (''fighter''). The three football teams from Banja Luka are [[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]] (2010/2011 season champions of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), [[FK BSK Banja Luka|BSK Banja Luka]], and [[FK Omladinac Banja Luka|Omladinac Banja Luka]] (both in the [[First League of the Republika Srpska]]), FK Naprijed Banja Luka and FK Vrbas Banja Luka\n\n[[FK Borac Banja Luka]] is the most popular football club in the Republika Srpska. The club has won several major trophies in its history such as trophies as a champion of [[Mitropa Cup]], [[Yugoslav Cup]], [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup]], [[2007\u201308 First League of the Republika Srpska|First League of the Republika Srpska]], [[Republika Srpska Cup|Republic Srpska Cup]]. They have participated in [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]].\n\nThe city has a long tradition of handball. [[RK Borac Banja Luka]] was the European Champion in 1976, the European Vice-Champion in 1975 and the winner of the IHF Cup in 1991.\n\nRecently, tennis has taken on a bigger role in the city. The local tennis tournament, [[Banja Luka Challenger|\"Memorijal Trive Vuji\u0107a\"]], has become professional and has been awarded [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] status in 2001, with the rank of a [[ATP Challenger Series|Challenger]]. The Banja Luka Challenger takes place in September each year. In 2005, the European Championships in [[Rafting]] were held on the Vrbas river.  In 2006, the [[Davis Cup]] matches of the Europe/Africa Zone Group III took place in the city. Since 2015, the city hosts the Banjaluka Half-marathon.\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:TranzitBL.jpg|thumb|right|Banja Luka west transit road]]\n[[File:Isto\u010dni tranzit, Banja Luka.jpg|thumb|Banja Luka east transit road]]\n[[File:BH Airlines - Banja Luka airport - Aug-10 v1.jpg|thumb|right|B&H Airlines [[ATR 72]] at Banja Luka airport preparing for the flight to Z\u00fcrich, August 2010]]\n\nPublic transportation within Banja Luka is exclusively operated by the bus services. Over thirty bus lines connect downtown with the rest of the city and its suburbs. The oldest bus link in the city is line No 1. Taxis are also readily available. The expressway E-661 (locally known as M-16) leads north to [[Croatia]] from Banja Luka by way of [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi\u0161ka]], near the Bosnian/Croatian border. A wide range of bus services are available to most neighbouring and larger towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to regional and European destinations such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, France, Italy, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia.\n\nBanja Luka is the hub of the railway services of [[Republika Srpska Railways|\u017deljeznice Republike Srpske]], comprising one half of the railway network of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Services operate to most northern Bosnian towns, and two modern air-conditioned 'Talgo' trains run to [[Sarajevo]] every day. However, services are relatively slow and infrequent compared with neighbouring countries.\n\n[[Banja Luka International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: BNX, [[ICAO]]: LQBK) is located {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Banja Luka. The airport is served by [[Air Serbia]], which operates flights to [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport|Belgrade]] and summer charters to [[Antalya Airport|Antalya]] and [[Athens International Airport|Athens]], while [[Ryanair]] operates flights to [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport|Brussels]], [[Memmingen Airport|Memmingen]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Berlin]] and [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Stockholm]].
