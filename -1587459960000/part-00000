1839-1930 by David Hoadley Munroe</ref>\n<ref>https://www.grandnationalultimatehistory.com/races-1929.html</ref>\n{{Inc-results}}\n\n==Media Coverage and Aftermath==\nThe media largely praised Aintree's decision to fill in the ditch at The Canal Turn in the wake of the pile up that happened there the previous year but the sheer volume of entries again led to criticism, despite Aintree having introduced an additional forfeit stage in the conditions. The Hon George Lambton claimed that the conditions of the race encouraged poor horses to be entered and that the framing of the weights was also unfair and that the top weights should not be forced to burden as much as 35lbs more than those at the foot of the handicap. Aintree responded the following year by increasing the minimum entry age from five to six years, though changes to the handicap remained unaltered until 1960.<ref>Sporting Life Souvenir Magazine, 4 April 1987, page 22</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Grand National}}\n\n[[Category:Grand National| 1929]]\n[[Category:1929 in horse racing|Grand National]]\n[[Category:1929 in English sport|Grand National]]\n[[Category:20th century in Lancashire]]\n\n\n{{horseracing-race-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox Horse race\n|pagename=1929 Grand National\n|horse race=[[Grand National]]\n|location=[[Aintree Racecourse]]\n|date= 22 March 1929\n|winning horse= Gregalach\n|starting price = 100/1\n|winning jockey= [[Robert W.

1839-1930 by David Hoadley Munroe</ref>\n<ref>https://www.grandnationalultimatehistory.com/races-1929.html</ref>\n{{Inc-results}}\n\n==Media Coverage and Aftermath==\nThe media largely praised Aintree's decision to fill in the ditch at The Canal Turn in the wake of the pile up that happened there the previous year but the sheer volume of entries again led to criticism, despite Aintree having introduced an additional forfeit stage in the conditions. The Hon George Lambton claimed that the conditions of the race encouraged poor horses to be entered and that the framing of the weights was also unfair and that the top weights should not be forced to burden as much as 35lbs more than those at the foot of the handicap. Aintree responded the following year by increasing the minimum entry age from five to six years, though changes to the handicap remained unaltered until 1960.<ref>Sporting Life Souvenir Magazing, 4 April 1987, page 22</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Grand National}}\n\n[[Category:Grand National| 1929]]\n[[Category:1929 in horse racing|Grand National]]\n[[Category:1929 in English sport|Grand National]]\n[[Category:20th century in Lancashire]]\n\n\n{{horseracing-race-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Grand_National"}

She then joined the company of players at the theatre in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], where she earned \"the not very magnificent salary of fifteen shillings,\" but her success and beauty made her the toast of the beaux.

Her pictures were in great demand, songs and verses were written to her and books published about her, and she was the most talked-of person in London.  [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]'s picture shows her in one of the scenes, with her future husband, the [[Duke of Bolton]], in a box. After the play's first run, Fenton's salary was doubled, and she appeared as Alida in [[John Vanbrugh]]'s adaptation of ''[[The Pilgrim (play)|The Pilgrim]]''.
