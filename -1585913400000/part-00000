We shall therefore not be contradicted if we class the Malay race among the Mongoloid nations. Yet their linguistic characters entitle them to a separate place.\" When Peschel said that the linguistic characters of Malays \"entitle them to a separate place\", Peschel did not mean make Malays not Mongoloid. Peschel makes his thoughts about language being grounds for subdivision of Mongoloids clear in the second-to-last and last sentences of the third paragraph of page 347, when Peschel said, \"Their (Peschel is referring to Mongoloids) other characters occur in so many gradations that local types pass into one another, as will be shown in each group. The linguistic characters alone afford grounds for subdivision.\"--> Peschel said that the race of the [[Ainu people]] was not clear.<!--Although Peschel talked about the Ainu in Chapter V in his section about Mongoloids, Peschel said in the first sentence of the second paragraph of page 387, \"This chapter is not a description of a new group of the Mongolian family, but a candid confession that the system which we set forth is given in an incomplete condition...\" Furthermore, Peschel said in the first sentence of the third paragraph of page 388, \"It is far more difficult to define the position of the third race, which has given itself the name of Aino, or Ainu, the people.\"--><ref>Peschel, O.

Forbes, professor of Native American Studies and Anthropology at the [[University of California, Davis]], said that the racial type of the indigenous people of the Americas does not fall into the Mongoloid racial category.<ref name=\"Forbes\" /> Forbes said that due to the various physical traits indigenous Americans exhibit, some with \"head shapes which seem hardly distinct from many Europeans\", indigenous Americans must have either been formed from a mixture of Mongoloid and Caucasoid races or they descend from the ancestral, common type of both Mongoloid and Caucasoid races.<ref name=\"Forbes\">Forbes, J.D.

Nearly one-third of Native American genes come from an early West Eurasian people linked to the ancestors of Middle Easterners and Europeans, with the remaining two thirds deriving from early East Asian populations, rather than entirely from East Asians as previously thought, according to a newly sequenced genome. Based on the arm bone of a 24,000-year-old Siberian youth, the research could uncover new origins for America's indigenous peoples, as well as stir up fresh debate on Native American identities, experts say.

In the [[Caucasian race|CAUCASIAN RACE]], the head is of the most symmetrical shape, almost round; the forehead of moderate extent; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] rather narrow, without any projection, but having a direction downwards from the [[Zygomatic process|malar process]] of the frontal bone; the [[Alveolar ridge|alveolar edge]] well rounded; the front teeth of both jaws placed perpendicularly. The face is of an oval shape, and straight; the features moderately prominent; the forehead arched; nose narrow, and slightly arched, or at least with the bridge somewhat convex; cheek-bones not projecting; mouth small, with the lips slightly turned out, particularly the lower one; chin full and round. The Caucasians are of [[Human skin color|all complexions]], from the [[Hindus|Hindoos]] and [[Arabs]], some of whom are as [[dark skin|black]] as African [[negro]]es, to the [[Danes]] and [[Swedes]], and [[Norsemen]], who are [[light skin|fair]], with [[blond|flaxen hair]] and light [[Eye color#blue|blue eyes]]. In this class are comprised the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Europe]] (except the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] and [[Finns]]), the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Western Asia]], as far as the [[Ob River|Oby]], the Belurtagh, and the [[Ganges]], such as the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Babylon|Bablyonians]], [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], and [[Syrians]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Tatars]] properly so called, the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|tribes of Caucasus]], the [[Armenians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]], and [[Hindus|Hindoos]]; the [[North Africans|Africans who live on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea]], and throughout the [[Sahara]], the [[Egyptians]] and [[Copts]], the [[Habesha peoples|Abyssinians]], and the [[Guanches]], or ancient people of the [[Canary Islands]]. To these we need hardly add the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists who have settled in America]] and other parts of the world. The complexion of this class of people seems to depend very much upon climate and the degree of solar heat to which they are exposed; for they are all, without exception, born with [[light skin|light complexions]], and become dark only as they grow up, and are more [[Sun tanning|exposed to the sun]]. Their colour is found to deepen by regular gradation from the furthest north, where the people of this race are very fair, through the [[Olive (color)|olive-coloured]] people of the [[Southern France|south of France]], and of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the swarthy [[Moors]], till the gradation ends with the [[Black people|deep-black natives]] of the [[African desert|African]] and [[Arabian Desert|Arabian deserts]], and of [[wikt:intertropical|intertropical]] [[India]]. White seems to be the characteristic of the race, but it is everywhere subject to the influence of climate. The Caucasians are therefore properly enough called the [[White people|WHITE RACE]], though some of them are perfectly black. Their hair, whether [[wikt:melanic|melanic]] or [[wikt:xanthous|xanthous]], is always long and lank, and never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]] like that of the [[negro]]es.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|II.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongolian Class\n|-\n|<p>II. The MONGOLIAN CLASS has the head almost square; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] projecting; the nose flat; the [[nasal bone]]s and the space between the eyebrows nearly on the same horizontal plane with the cheek-bones; the arches of the eyebrows scarcely to be perceived; the nostrils narrow; the chin slightly prominent. The face is broad and flat, with the parts imperfectly distinguished; the space between the eyes flat and very broad; nose flat; cheeks projecting, round, and narrow; the linear opening of the eyelids extending towards the temples; the [[Epicanthic fold|inner corner]] of the eye sunk towards the nose, and the upper eyelid at that part continued into the lower by a rounded sweep. The complexion is generally [[Olive (color)|olive]], which is sometimes very slight, and approaching to yellow, or what is called [[wikt:sallow|sallow]]; and none of this class are known to be [[light skin|fair-complexioned]]. The iris of their eyes is black; their [[Black hair|hair black]], straight, and strong, but seldom curled, or in great abundance; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprised the numerous tribes that occupy the [[Central Asia|central]], [[Northeast Asia|north-east]], [[East Asia|east]] and [[Southeast Asia|south-east parts of Asia]]; the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]; the [[Tibetan people|people of Tibet]], [[Bhutan|Boutan]], and [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indo-china]]; the [[Finns|Fins]] and the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] of the [[Northern Europe|north of Europe]], and the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], who live along the shores of the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]], in [[Americas|America]] and [[Greenland]]. The colour of the class is influenced in a slight degree by climate; those of them, and those parts of the body most [[sun tanning|exposed to the sun]] and the air, being the darkest.<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<sup>*</sup> Dr. Abel, physician to the last [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom#Asia|British embassy to China]], mentions in his volume of travels, that when any of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] boatmen cast off their clothes for the purpose of leaping into the water to push along the boats, they appeared to be dressed in light-coloured trowsers, though quite naked.\n\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|III. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Ethiopic]] or [[Black people|Black Race]]\n|-\n|<p>III.

The face is narrow, with the lower part projecting; eyes prominent; nose spread, and almost confounded with the cheeks; the lips, particularly the upper one, very thick; the jaws prominent, and the chin retracted. The skin of this class, and the iris of the eye, are deep black; the [[Black hair|hair black]] and [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]; characteristics that vary less in the [[negro]]es than in the two former classes, for this very obvious reason, that the [[Negroid|Ethiopic race]] are to be found native mostly in [[tropical climate]]s, where there is little variety of temperature; and not like the Mongolian and [[Caucasian race]]s who are spread over all climates, from the [[equator]] to the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]]. In this class are comprised all the natives of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa to the south of the Sahara]] and [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]; also the [[Aboriginal Australians|natives of New Holland]], [[Van Diemen's Land]] or [[Tasmania]], [[New Guinea|Papua, or New Guinea]], [[New Britain]], the [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Isles]], [[New Georgia]], the [[New Hebrides]], [[New Caledonia]], the [[Fiji|Feejee Islands]], and also various tribes throughout the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indian archipelago]].</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Class]]\n|-\n|<p>IV. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|AMERICAN CLASS]] approaches the Mongolian. The [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] are prominent, but more arched and rounded than in the [[Mongols|Mongol]], without being so angular, or projecting at the sides; the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] almost always deep; the shape of the forehead and the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] often [[Artificial cranial deformation|artificially modified]]; the skull generally light. The face is broad, without being flat; the features, viewed in profile, are prominent, and deeply marked; the forehead low, eyes deep-seated, nose rather flat, but prominent. The [[redskin|skin is red]], more or less [[dark skin|dark]], or [[Copper (color)|copper-coloured]], and approaching to [[dark skin|black]], according to climate and other circumstances. The hair is like that of the Mongolian class; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprehended all the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American tribes and nations]], excepting, of course, the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], and the descendants of [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[African diaspora in the Americas|African]] colonists.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|V. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Malay race|Malay Class]]\n|-\n|<p>V.

The face is less narrow than that of the [[negro]], somewhat advancing in the lower part, when seen in profile; the features generally more prominent than those of the negro, the nose full, broad, and thick towards the point, or what is called a [[wikt:bottle-nose|bottle-nose]].

The colour of the skin is some shade of chocolate brown, and the eyes very dark [[Brown eye|brown]] or black. Fine silky hair, usually [[wikt:raven-haired|raven black]], never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]], but wavy and tolerably long. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]] are [[Cephalic index|doliocephalic]] (long-skulled), the cranial index often not amounting to more than seventy-one or seventy-two. Nose broad rather than flat, jaws heavy, lips very coarse and flexible. ''Norma occipitalis'' sharply [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. [[Brow ridge|Brow-ridges]] strong and prominent, teeth large, and [[Incisor|fangs]] strong. These marks are seen in the [[Dasa|Dasyu]] hill-tribes inhabiting the interior of the [[Deccan Plateau|Dekhan]].

The [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], too, though changed by [[Ancient Egypt|civilisation]] and probably [[DNA history of Egypt|admixture]], has also the [[dark skin]], black silky wavy hair, long skull, fleshy lips, and broad [[Ala of nose|''alae'' of the nose]].</p><!--This quote is in the right column of page 585.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(2)  &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Negroid Type]]\n|-\n|<p>(2) The [[Negroid|Negroid type]] is best represented by the [[negro]] of [[South Africa|S. Africa]] (including [[Madagascar]]), between the [[Sahara]] and the region of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]]. He is of fair [[Human height|stature]]; his body and limbs are well made; his [[dark skin|skin is black]], with shades of brown; his eyes, [[Brown eye|brown]] or black; his [[black hair|hair is black]], short, and crisp; his [[beard]] and [[body hair|body-hair]] scanty. He is [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], the cranial index being often only seventy-three. His forehead is [[neoteny in humans|childlike]] and [[Femininity|feminine]]. The ''norma occipitalis'' is often [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. Like the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]], there is generally [[prognathism]] (protruding jaws). The [[nasal bone]]s are depressed, giving a characteristic flat nose. The lips are coarse and projecting. The [[San people|Bushmen]] of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]] area are a special type, marked by low [[Human height|stature]], the males not much exceeding 4 feet in height; both [[sex]]es, however, are well made. The skin is yellowish brown, the eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]. The [[wikt:anteroposterior|antero-posterior]] [[diameter]] of female [[pelvis]] is of great relative length. The [[steatopygia|accumulation of fat on the buttocks]], and the large [[Labia minora|nymphae]] of females, are also characteristic. [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] are said to be a cross between [[San people|Bushmen]] and [[Negro]]es. Another modification, the [[Negrito]]s, occurs in the [[Andaman Islands|Andamans]], [[Malacca]], [[Philippines]], [[Tasmania]], and the islands parallel to the [[Coastline of Australia|Australian coast]], from [[Wallace Line|Wallace's Line]] to [[New Caledonia]]. The [[Andamanese|Andamans]] have a cranial index of eighty; all the rest are doliocephalic, though some in the [[South|S.]] and [[East|E.]] approach the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]] in large [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]] and otherwise (''[[exempli gratia|e.g.]]'', [[Tasmania]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Guinea]], and [[Torres Strait]]s).

This type shades off into the [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]] and the [[Deccan Plateau|Dekhan]] variety of [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]].</p><!--This quote is in the left column of page 586.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongoloid Type\n|-\n|<p>(4) The great area [[East|E.]] of a line drawn from [[S\u00e1pmi|Lapland]] to [[Thailand|Siam]] is peopled chiefly by the Mongoloid, who are short, squat, with yellow-brown skin; eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter coarse, straight, long on the scalp, but [[body hair|scanty on the body]] and [[beard|face]]. They are sometimes very [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]], without prominent [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]], nose flat and small, eyes oblique. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays proper]] and the [[Filipinos|indigenes of the Philippines]], who are not [[Negrito]]s, probably belong to this group. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]], on the other hand, are distinguished chiefly by being [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]]; this characteristic occurs also in the ancient [[Ainu people|Ainos]] (found, for example, in [[Hokkaido|Yesso]]), who are further remarkable for the development of [[beard|hair on face]] and [[body hair|body]], and the dull-red earthy skin. The [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] of [[Borneo]], the [[Batak|Battaks]] of [[Sumatra]], the [[Alfur people|Alfures]] of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], are all [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], and seem to pass through the people of the [[Palau|Pelew Islands]] and of the [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and [[Mariana Islands|Ladrone]] [[Archipelago]]s into the [[Polynesians]], in whom the straight hair and oblique eye have disappeared, the skull being long and coming back to the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid type]]. The [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type is best seen in the [[M\u0101ori people|Maoris]] of [[New Zealand]]; [[cephalic index|brachycephaly]] occurs in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich]] and [[Samoan Islands]]. [[Polynesian languages|Language]] shows that [[Polynesia]] was peopled from the west, and it is thought that the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type may be a cross between the [[Dayak people|Dyak]]-[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and the [[Negrito]] elements in [[Indonesia|Indo-nesia]]. In [[Northeast Asia|N.E. Asia]] the [[Chukchi people|Tchuktchi]] are said to be the same as the [[Eskimo]]s and [[Greenlandic Inuit|Greenlanders]] of [[North America|N. America]]; with Mongoloid hair and skin they have very long skulls. [[cephalic index|Doliocephaly]] also distinguishes the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aborigines of both Americas]] from the [[Asian people|Asiatic]] Mongoloid; only the [[Tehuelche people|Patagonians]] and the ancient [[Mound Builders|mound-builders]] are [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]].

Of these the [[Negroid|Ethiopian]] is secondarily divided into the African [[Negro]]es, the [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] and [[San people|Bushmen]], the [[wikt:oceanic|Oceanic]] [[Negro]]es or [[Melanesians]], and the [[Negrito]]s as represented by the inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and other [[list of islands in the Pacific Ocean|Pacific islands]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]], whom [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] takes as the type of a separate race, he considers to be a mixed people, as they combine the [[Negro]] type of face and skeleton, with hair of a different type. His second race is the Mongolian, represented in an exaggerated form by the [[Eskimo]], in its typical condition by most of the natives of [[North Asia|northern]] and [[East Asia|eastern Asia]], and in a modified type by the [[Malay race|Malays]]. Excluding the [[Eskimo]], the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]] form one group, whose closest affinity is with the Mongolian, yet which has so many special features that it might be viewed as a fourth primary division.

The [[brow ridge]]s with their cold-vulnerable [[frontal sinus|sinuses]] are reduced; the [[Zygomatic bone|malars]] are extended forward and enlarged hence the external nose protrusion is reduced; the eye is protected by fatty lids whose borders are brought closer together, which in turn helps reduce the glare of light. The distended malars and [[maxillary sinus]]es are also protected by fatty pads, which helps to give the typical mongoloid face its flat appearance.

Typically, the nose is not very prominent on the face of a Mongoloid. Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow more room for padding to protect from their cold environment.

In the [[Caucasian race|CAUCASIAN RACE]], the head is of the most symmetrical shape, almost round; the forehead of moderate extent; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] rather narrow, without any projection, but having a direction downwards from the [[Zygomatic process|malar process]] of the frontal bone; the [[Alveolar ridge|alveolar edge]] well rounded; the front teeth of both jaws placed perpendicularly. The face is of an oval shape, and straight; the features moderately prominent; the forehead arched; nose narrow, and slightly arched, or at least with the bridge somewhat convex; cheek-bones not projecting; mouth small, with the lips slightly turned out, particularly the lower one; chin full and round. The Caucasians are of [[Human skin color|all complexions]], from the [[Hindus|Hindoos]] and [[Arabs]], some of whom are as [[dark skin|black]] as African [[negro]]es, to the [[Danes]] and [[Swedes]], and [[Norsemen]], who are [[light skin|fair]], with [[blond|flaxen hair]] and light [[Eye color#blue|blue eyes]]. In this class are comprised the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Europe]] (except the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] and [[Finns]]), the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Western Asia]], as far as the [[Ob River|Oby]], the Belurtagh, and the [[Ganges]], such as the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Babylon|Bablyonians]], [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], and [[Syrians]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Tatars]] properly so called, the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|tribes of Caucasus]], the [[Armenians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]], and [[Hindus|Hindoos]]; the [[North Africans|Africans who live on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea]], and throughout the [[Sahara]], the [[Egyptians]] and [[Copts]], the [[Habesha peoples|Abyssinians]], and the [[Guanches]], or ancient people of the [[Canary Islands]]. To these we need hardly add the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists who have settled in America]] and other parts of the world. The complexion of this class of people seems to depend very much upon climate and the degree of solar heat to which they are exposed; for they are all, without exception, born with [[light skin|light complexions]], and become dark only as they grow up, and are more [[Sun tanning|exposed to the sun]]. Their colour is found to deepen by regular gradation from the furthest north, where the people of this race are very fair, through the [[Olive (color)|olive-coloured]] people of the [[Southern France|south of France]], and of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the swarthy [[Moors]], till the gradation ends with the [[Black people|deep-black natives]] of the [[African desert|African]] and [[Arabian Desert|Arabian deserts]], and of [[wikt:intertropical|intertropical]] [[India]]. White seems to be the characteristic of the race, but it is everywhere subject to the influence of climate. The Caucasians are therefore properly enough called the [[White people|WHITE RACE]], though some of them are perfectly black. Their hair, whether [[wikt:melanic|melanic]] or [[wikt:xanthous|xanthous]], is always long and lank, and never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]] like that of the [[negro]]es.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|II.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongolian Class\n|-\n|<p>II. The MONGOLIAN CLASS has the head almost square; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] projecting; the nose flat; the [[nasal bone]]s and the space between the eyebrows nearly on the same horizontal plane with the cheek-bones; the arches of the eyebrows scarcely to be perceived; the nostrils narrow; the chin slightly prominent. The face is broad and flat, with the parts imperfectly distinguished; the space between the eyes flat and very broad; nose flat; cheeks projecting, round, and narrow; the linear opening of the eyelids extending towards the temples; the [[Epicanthic fold|inner corner]] of the eye sunk towards the nose, and the upper eyelid at that part continued into the lower by a rounded sweep. The complexion is generally [[Olive (color)|olive]], which is sometimes very slight, and approaching to yellow, or what is called [[wikt:sallow|sallow]]; and none of this class are known to be [[light skin|fair-complexioned]]. The iris of their eyes is black; their [[Black hair|hair black]], straight, and strong, but seldom curled, or in great abundance; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprised the numerous tribes that occupy the [[Central Asia|central]], [[Northeast Asia|north-east]], [[East Asia|east]] and [[Southeast Asia|south-east parts of Asia]]; the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]; the [[Tibetan people|people of Tibet]], [[Bhutan|Boutan]], and [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indo-china]]; the [[Finns|Fins]] and the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] of the [[Northern Europe|north of Europe]], and the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], who live along the shores of the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]], in [[Americas|America]] and [[Greenland]]. The colour of the class is influenced in a slight degree by climate; those of them, and those parts of the body most [[sun tanning|exposed to the sun]] and the air, being the darkest.<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<sup>*</sup> Dr. Abel, physician to the last [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom#Asia|British embassy to China]], mentions in his volume of travels, that when any of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] boatmen cast off their clothes for the purpose of leaping into the water to push along the boats, they appeared to be dressed in light-coloured trowsers, though quite naked.\n\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|III. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Ethiopic]] or [[Black people|Black Race]]\n|-\n|<p>III.

The face is narrow, with the lower part projecting; eyes prominent; nose spread, and almost confounded with the cheeks; the lips, particularly the upper one, very thick; the jaws prominent, and the chin retracted. The skin of this class, and the iris of the eye, are deep black; the [[Black hair|hair black]] and [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]; characteristics that vary less in the [[negro]]es than in the two former classes, for this very obvious reason, that the [[Negroid|Ethiopic race]] are to be found native mostly in [[tropical climate]]s, where there is little variety of temperature; and not like the Mongolian and [[Caucasian race]]s who are spread over all climates, from the [[equator]] to the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]]. In this class are comprised all the natives of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa to the south of the Sahara]] and [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]; also the [[Aboriginal Australians|natives of New Holland]], [[Van Diemen's Land]] or [[Tasmania]], [[New Guinea|Papua, or New Guinea]], [[New Britain]], the [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Isles]], [[New Georgia]], the [[New Hebrides]], [[New Caledonia]], the [[Fiji|Feejee Islands]], and also various tribes throughout the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indian archipelago]].</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Class]]\n|-\n|<p>IV.

The [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] are prominent, but more arched and rounded than in the [[Mongols|Mongol]], without being so angular, or projecting at the sides; the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] almost always deep; the shape of the forehead and the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] often [[Artificial cranial deformation|artificially modified]]; the skull generally light. The face is broad, without being flat; the features, viewed in profile, are prominent, and deeply marked; the forehead low, eyes deep-seated, nose rather flat, but prominent. The [[redskin|skin is red]], more or less [[dark skin|dark]], or [[Copper (color)|copper-coloured]], and approaching to [[dark skin|black]], according to climate and other circumstances. The hair is like that of the Mongolian class; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprehended all the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American tribes and nations]], excepting, of course, the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], and the descendants of [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[African diaspora in the Americas|African]] colonists.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|V. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Malay race|Malay Class]]\n|-\n|<p>V.

The face is less narrow than that of the [[negro]], somewhat advancing in the lower part, when seen in profile; the features generally more prominent than those of the negro, the nose full, broad, and thick towards the point, or what is called a [[wikt:bottle-nose|bottle-nose]].

Fine silky hair, usually [[wikt:raven-haired|raven black]], never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]], but wavy and tolerably long.

He is of fair [[Human height|stature]]; his body and limbs are well made; his [[dark skin|skin is black]], with shades of brown; his eyes, [[Brown eye|brown]] or black; his [[black hair|hair is black]], short, and crisp; his [[beard]] and [[body hair|body-hair]] scanty. He is [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], the cranial index being often only seventy-three. His forehead is [[neoteny in humans|childlike]] and [[Femininity|feminine]]. The ''norma occipitalis'' is often [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. Like the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]], there is generally [[prognathism]] (protruding jaws). The [[nasal bone]]s are depressed, giving a characteristic flat nose. The lips are coarse and projecting. The [[San people|Bushmen]] of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]] area are a special type, marked by low [[Human height|stature]], the males not much exceeding 4 feet in height; both [[sex]]es, however, are well made. The skin is yellowish brown, the eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]. The [[wikt:anteroposterior|antero-posterior]] [[diameter]] of female [[pelvis]] is of great relative length. The [[steatopygia|accumulation of fat on the buttocks]], and the large [[Labia minora|nymphae]] of females, are also characteristic. [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] are said to be a cross between [[San people|Bushmen]] and [[Negro]]es. Another modification, the [[Negrito]]s, occurs in the [[Andaman Islands|Andamans]], [[Malacca]], [[Philippines]], [[Tasmania]], and the islands parallel to the [[Coastline of Australia|Australian coast]], from [[Wallace Line|Wallace's Line]] to [[New Caledonia]]. The [[Andamanese|Andamans]] have a cranial index of eighty; all the rest are doliocephalic, though some in the [[South|S.]] and [[East|E.]] approach the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]] in large [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]] and otherwise (''[[exempli gratia|e.g.]]'', [[Tasmania]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Guinea]], and [[Torres Strait]]s).

They are sometimes very [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]], without prominent [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]], nose flat and small, eyes oblique. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays proper]] and the [[Filipinos|indigenes of the Philippines]], who are not [[Negrito]]s, probably belong to this group. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]], on the other hand, are distinguished chiefly by being [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]]; this characteristic occurs also in the ancient [[Ainu people|Ainos]] (found, for example, in [[Hokkaido|Yesso]]), who are further remarkable for the development of [[beard|hair on face]] and [[body hair|body]], and the dull-red earthy skin. The [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] of [[Borneo]], the [[Batak|Battaks]] of [[Sumatra]], the [[Alfur people|Alfures]] of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], are all [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], and seem to pass through the people of the [[Palau|Pelew Islands]] and of the [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and [[Mariana Islands|Ladrone]] [[Archipelago]]s into the [[Polynesians]], in whom the straight hair and oblique eye have disappeared, the skull being long and coming back to the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid type]]. The [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type is best seen in the [[M\u0101ori people|Maoris]] of [[New Zealand]]; [[cephalic index|brachycephaly]] occurs in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich]] and [[Samoan Islands]]. [[Polynesian languages|Language]] shows that [[Polynesia]] was peopled from the west, and it is thought that the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type may be a cross between the [[Dayak people|Dyak]]-[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and the [[Negrito]] elements in [[Indonesia|Indo-nesia]]. In [[Northeast Asia|N.E. Asia]] the [[Chukchi people|Tchuktchi]] are said to be the same as the [[Eskimo]]s and [[Greenlandic Inuit|Greenlanders]] of [[North America|N. America]]; with Mongoloid hair and skin they have very long skulls. [[cephalic index|Doliocephaly]] also distinguishes the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aborigines of both Americas]] from the [[Asian people|Asiatic]] Mongoloid; only the [[Tehuelche people|Patagonians]] and the ancient [[Mound Builders|mound-builders]] are [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]].

Of these the [[Negroid|Ethiopian]] is secondarily divided into the African [[Negro]]es, the [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] and [[San people|Bushmen]], the [[wikt:oceanic|Oceanic]] [[Negro]]es or [[Melanesians]], and the [[Negrito]]s as represented by the inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and other [[list of islands in the Pacific Ocean|Pacific islands]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]], whom [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] takes as the type of a separate race, he considers to be a mixed people, as they combine the [[Negro]] type of face and skeleton, with hair of a different type. His second race is the Mongolian, represented in an exaggerated form by the [[Eskimo]], in its typical condition by most of the natives of [[North Asia|northern]] and [[East Asia|eastern Asia]], and in a modified type by the [[Malay race|Malays]]. Excluding the [[Eskimo]], the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]] form one group, whose closest affinity is with the Mongolian, yet which has so many special features that it might be viewed as a fourth primary division.

It is not in the original text of the Creed, attributed to the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), the [[second ecumenical council]], which says that the [[Holy Spirit]] proceeds \"from the Father\", without additions of any kind, such as \"and the Son\" or \"alone\".{{sfn|RCA|2002|p=70}}\n\nIn the late 6th century, some [[Latin Church]]es added the words \"and from the Son\" (''Filioque'') to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.x.html Canon VII]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}} of the [[Council of Ephesus]], since the words were not included in the text by either the [[First Council of Nicaea]] or that of Constantinople.<ref>For a different view, see e.g. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.xi.html Excursus on the Words \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f11\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}} This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014,<ref name=\"Catholic Greek-Latin\" /> but was rejected by Eastern Christianity.\n\nWhether that term ''Filioque'' is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], which is central to the majority of Christian churches. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of [[God the Father]]'s role in the Trinity; for others, its denial implies a serious underestimation of the role of [[God the Son]] in the Trinity.\n\nThe term has been an ongoing source of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, contributing, in major part, to the [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054 and proving to be an obstacle to attempts to reunify the two sides.{{sfnm|Congar|1959|1p=44|Meyendorff|1987|2p=181|NAOCTC|2003}} There have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of [[Maximus the Confessor]], who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches. Differences over this doctrine and the question of [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal primacy]] have been and remain primary causes of schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches.{{sfn|Larchet|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|WCCFO|1979}}\n\n==Nicene Creed==\nThe Nicene Creed as amended by the Second Ecumenical Council held in Constantinople in 381 includes the section\n<blockquote><poem>''Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem\n'''qui ex Patre procedit'''\n''qui cum Patre, et Filio simul adoratur, et cum glorificatur.''</poem></blockquote>\n\nTranslated in English:\n<blockquote><poem>''[I believe] in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,''\n'''who proceeds from the Father,'''\n''who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.''{{refn|{{OED|filioque, n|70207}}}}</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe controversy arises from the insertion of the word ''Filioque'' (\"and the Son\") in the line:\n<blockquote><poem>...''qui ex Patre '''Filioque''' procedit''...\n\n...''who proceeds from the Father '''and the Son'''''...</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Controversy==\nThe controversy referring to the term ''Filioque'' involves four separate disagreements:\n* about the term itself\n* about the orthodoxy of the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, to which the term refers\n* about the legitimacy of inserting the term into the  Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed,\n* about the authority of the Pope to define the orthodoxy of the doctrine or to insert the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. \n\nAlthough the disagreement about the doctrine preceded the disagreement about the insertion into the Creed, the two disagreements became linked to the third when the pope approved insertion of the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in the 11th century. Anthony Siecienski writes that \"Ultimately what was at stake was not only God's trinitarian nature, but also the nature of the Church, its teaching authority and the distribution of power among its leaders.\"{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[Hubert Cunliffe-Jones]] identifies two opposing Eastern Orthodox opinions about the ''Filioque'', a \"liberal\" view and a \"rigorist\" view. The \"liberal\" view sees the controversy as being largely a matter of mutual miscommunication and misunderstanding. In this view, both East and West are at fault for failing to allow for a \"plurality of theologies\". Each side went astray in considering their theological framework as the only one that was doctrinally valid and applicable. Thus, neither side would accept that the dispute was not so much about conflicting dogmas as it was about different ''[[theologoumenon|theologoumena]]'' or theological perspectives. While all Christians must be in agreement on questions of [[dogma]], there is room for diversity in theological approaches.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nThis view is vehemently opposed by those in Eastern Orthodox Church whom Cunliffe-Jones identifies as holding a \"rigorist\" view. According to standard Eastern Orthodox position, as pronounced by [[Photius]], [[Mark of Ephesus]] and 20th century Eastern Orthodox theologians such as [[Vladimir Lossky]], the ''Filioque'' question hinges on fundamental issues of dogma and cannot be dismissed as simply one of different ''theologoumena''. Many in the \"rigorist\" camp consider the ''Filioque'' to have resulted in the role of the Holy Spirit being underestimated by the Western Church and thus leading to serious doctrinal error.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nIn a similar vein, Siecienski comments that, although it was common in the 20th century to view the ''Filioque'' as just another weapon in the power struggle between Rome and Constantinople and although this was occasionally the case, for many involved in the dispute, the theological issues outweighed by far the ecclesiological concerns. According to Siecienski, the deeper question was perhaps whether Eastern and Western Christianity had wound up developing \"differing and ultimately incompatible teachings about the nature of God\". Moreover, Siecienski asserts that the question of whether the teachings of East and West were truly incompatible became almost secondary to the fact that, starting around the 8th or 9th century, Christians on both sides of the dispute began to believe that the differences ''were'' irreconcilable.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nFrom the view of the West, the Eastern rejection of the ''Filioque'' denied the [[consubstantiality]] of the Father and the Son and was thus a form of crypto-[[Arianism]]. In the East, the interpolation of the ''Filioque'' seemed to many to be an indication that the West was teaching a \"substantially different faith\". Siecienski asserts that, as much as power and authority were central issues in the debate, the strength of emotion rising even to the level of hatred can be ascribed to a belief that the other side had \"destroyed the purity of the faith and refused to accept the clear teachings of the fathers on the Spirit's procession\".{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20136}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Filioque controversy}}\n\n===New Testament===\nIt is argued that in the relations between the Persons of the [[Trinity]], one Person cannot \"take\" or \"receive\" ({{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03c8\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}}) anything from either of the others except by way of procession.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Double Procession of the Holy Spirit\"}} Texts such as {{bibleverse||John|20:22}} (\"He breathed on them and said: Receive the Holy Spirit\"), were seen by Fathers of the Church, especially [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] as grounds for saying that the Spirit \"proceeds substantially from both\" the Father and the Son.{{refn|Maximus the Confessor, ''Letter to Marinus'' (PG 91:136), cited in {{harvtxt|Meyendorff|1987|p=93}}}} Other texts that have been used include {{bibleverse||Galatians|4:6}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|8:9}}, {{bibleverse||Philippians|1:19}}, where the Holy Spirit is called \"the Spirit of the Son\", \"the Spirit of Christ\", \"the Spirit of Jesus Christ\", and texts in the [[Gospel of John]] on the sending of the Holy Spirit by Jesus ({{bibleverse-nb||John|14:16}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|15:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|16:7}}).{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Double Procession of the Holy Spirit\"}} {{bibleverse||Revelation|22:1}} (possibly written by John, who identifies the Water of Life as the Holy Spirit in {{bibleverse||John|7:39}}) states that the river of the Water of Life in Heaven is \"flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb\" (the Lamb is Christ, cf. {{bibleverse||John|1:29}}), which may be interpreted as the Holy Spirit proceeding from both the Father and the Son.\n\nSiecienski asserts that \"the New Testament does not explicitly address the procession of the Holy Spirit as later theology would understand the doctrine\", although there are \"certain principles established in the New Testament that shaped later Trinitarian theology, and particular texts that both Latins and Greeks exploited to support their respective positions vis-\u00e0-vis the ''Filioque''\".{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=17}} In contrast, [[Veli-Matti K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen]] says that Eastern Orthodox believe that the absence of an explicit mention of the double procession of the Holy Spirit is a strong indication that the ''Filioque'' is a theologically erroneous doctrine.{{sfn|K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen|2010|p=276}}\n\n===Church fathers===\n\n====Cappadocian Fathers====\n{{see also|Cappadocian Fathers}}\n[[Basil of Caesarea]] wrote: \"Through the one Son [the Holy Spirit] is joined to the Father\".{{refn|Basil of Caesarea ''De Spiritu Sancto'' 18.45 ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume VIII/De Spiritu Sancto/Chapter 18|NPNF2 8:28]]), in {{harvtxt|Anderson|1980|p=72}}}} He also said that the \"natural goodness, inherent holiness, and royal dignity reaches from the Father through the only-begotten ({{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}}) to the Spirit\".{{refn|Basil of Caesarea ''De Spiritu Sancto'' 18.47 ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume VIII/De Spiritu Sancto/Chapter 18|NPNF2 8:29\u201330]]), in {{harvtxt|Anderson|1980|p=75}}}} However, Siecienski comments that \"there are passages in Basil that are certainly capable of being read as advocating something like the ''Filioque'', but to do so would be to misunderstand the inherently soteriological thrust of his work\".{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=40}}\n\n[[Gregory of Nazianzus]] distinguished the coming forth ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ca\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd}}) of the Spirit from the Father from that of the Son from the Father by saying that the latter is by generation, but that of the Spirit by procession ({{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}),{{refn|Gregory of Nazianzus ''Oratio 39'' 12 ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume VII/Orations of Gregory Nazianzen/Oration 39|NPNF2 7:356]]), in {{harvtxt|Daley|2006|p=133}}}} a matter on which there is no dispute between East and West, as shown also by the Latin Father [[Augustine of Hippo]], who wrote that although biblical exegetes had not adequately discussed the individuality of the Holy Spirit,{{quote|they predicate Him to be the Gift of God, {{interp|and they infer|orig=so that we may believe}} God not to give a gift inferior to Himself. {{interp|From that, they|orig=At the same time they hold by this position, namely, to}} predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten, like the Son, of the Father;

Among the Church leaders in Frankish Kingdom of that time a notion was developing that Filioque clause was in fact an authentic part of the original Creed.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=92}} Trying to deal with that problem and its potentially dangerous consequences, the Church of Rome found itself in the middle of a widening rift between its own Daughter-Church in Frankish Kingdom and Sister-Churches of the East. Popes of that time, [[Pope Hadrian I|Hadrian I]] and [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]], had to face various challenges while trying to find solutions that would preserve the unity of the Church.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|p=38}}\n\nFirst signs of the problems were starting to show by the end of the reign of Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]] (751-768). Use of the ''Filioque'' clause in the Frankish Kingdom led to controversy with envoys of the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] at the Synod of Gentilly (767).{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|Hinson|1995|p=315}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=90}} As the practice of chanting the interpolated Latin ''{{lang|la|Credo}}'' at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] spread in the West, the ''Filioque'' became a part of the [[Latin Rite]] liturgy throughout the Frankish Kingdom. The practice of chanting the Creed was adopted in Charlemagne's court by the end of the 8th century and spread through all of his realms, including some northern parts of Italy, but not to Rome, where its use was not accepted until 1014.{{sfn|Dix|2005|pp=485\u2013488}}{{sfn|Louth|2007|p=142}}\n\nSerious problems erupted in 787 after the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] when Charlemagne accused the Patriarch [[Tarasios of Constantinople]] of infidelity to the faith of the First Council of Nicaea, allegedly because he had not professed the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father \"and the Son\", but only \"through the Son\". [[Pope Adrian I]] rejected those accusations and tried to explain to the Frankish king that pneumatology of Tarasios was in accordance with the teachings of the holy Fathers.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}}{{efn|Charlemagne's legates claimed that Tarasius, at his installation, did not follow the Nicene faith and profess that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but confessed rather his procession from the Father ''through the Son'' (Mansi 13.760). The Pope strongly rejected Charlemagne's protest, showing at length that Tarasius and the Council, on this and other points, maintained the faith of the Fathers (ibid. 759\u2013810).}} Surprisingly, efforts of the pope had no effect.\n\nTrue scale of the problem became evident during the following years. The Frankish view of the ''Filioque'' was emphasized again in the ''[[Libri Carolini]]'', composed around 791\u2013793.{{efn|Following this exchange of letters with the pope, Charlemagne commissioned the ''Libri Carolini'' (791\u2013793) to challenge the positions both of the iconoclast council of 754 and of the Council of Nicaea of 787 on the veneration of icons. Again because of poor translations, the Carolingians misunderstood the actual decision of the latter Council.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}}} Openly arguing that the word ''Filioque'' was part of the Creed of 381, the authors of ''Libri Carolini'' demonstrated not only the surprising lack of basic knowledge but also the lack of will to receive right advice and council from the Mother-Church in Rome. Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father ''through the Son''.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}} That claim was both erroneous and dangerous for the preservation of the unity of the Church.\n\nIn those days, another theological problem appeared to be closely connected with the use of Filioque in the West. In the late 8th century, a controversy arose between Bishop [[Elipandus of Toledo]] and [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]] over the former's teaching (which has been called [[Spanish Adoptionism]]) that Christ in his humanity was the adoptive son of God. Elipandus was supported by Bishop [[Felix of Urgel]]. In 785, Pope Hadrian I condemned the teaching of Elipandus. In 791, Felix appealed to Charlemagne in defense of the Spanish Adoptionist teaching, sending him a tract outlining it. He was condemned at the Synod of Regensburg (792) and was sent to Pope Hadrian in Rome, where he made of profession of orthodox faith, but returned to Spain and there reaffirmed Adoptionism. Elipandus wrote to the bishops of the territories controlled by Charlemagne in defence of his teaching, which was condemned at the [[Council of Frankfurt]] (794) and at the Synod of [[Friuli]] (796). The controversy encouraged those who rejected Adoptionism to introduce into the liturgy the use of the Creed, with the ''Filioque'', to profess belief that Christ was the Son from eternity, not adopted as a son at his baptism.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93-94}}{{sfn|Dales|2013|pp=61\u201367}}\n\nAt the Synod of Friuli, [[Paulinus II of Aquileia]] stated that the insertion of ''Filioque'' in the 381 Creed of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] was no more a violation of the prohibition of new creeds than were the insertions into the 325 Creed of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] that were done by the First Council of Constantinople itself. What was forbidden, he said, was adding or removing something \"craftily ... contrary to the sacred intentions of the fathers\", not a council's addition that could be shown to be in line with the intentions of the Fathers and the faith of the ancient Church. Actions such as that of the First Council of Contantinople were sometimes called for in order to clarify the faith and do away with heresies that appear.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=364}} The views of Paulinus show that some advocates of Filioque clause were quite aware of the fact that it actually was not part of the Creed.{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}\n\nPolitical events that followed additionally complicated the issue. According to [[John Meyendorff]],{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|pp=41\u201343, 195\u2013197}} and [[John Romanides]]<ref name=\"Romanides1\"/> the Frankish efforts to get new [[Pope Leo III]] to approve the addition of ''Filioque'' to the Creed were due to a desire of [[Charlemagne]], who in 800 had been crowned in Rome as Emperor, to find grounds for accusations of heresy against the East. The Pope's refusal to approve the interpolation of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed avoided arousing a conflict between East and West about this matter. During his reign ({{Reign|795|816|lk=abbr}}), and for another two centuries, there was no Creed at all in the [[Roman rite]] Mass.\n\nReasons for the continuing refusal of the Frankish Church to adopt the positions of the Church of Rome on necessity of leaving Filioque outside of Creed remained unknown. Faced with another endorsement of the Filioque clause at the Frankish [[Council of Aachen (809)]] pope Leo III denied his approval and publicly posted the Creed in Rome without the Filioque, written in Greek and Latin on two silver plaques, in defense of the Orthodox Faith (810) stating his opposition to the addition of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238-239}} Although Leo III did not disapprove the ''Filioque'' doctrine, the Pope strongly believed the clause should not be included into the Creed.{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{efn|\"Leo III defended the Filioque outside the Creed.}} In spite of the efforts of the Church of Rome, the acceptance of the Filioque clause in the Creed of the Frankish Church proved to be irreversible.\n\nIn 808 or 809 apparent controversy arose in Jerusalem between the Greek monks of one monastery and the Frankish Benedictine monks of another: the Greeks reproached the latter for, among other things, singing the creed with the ''Filioque'' included.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Schmaus|1975}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}} In response, the theology of the ''Filioque'' was expressed in the 809 local [[Council of Aachen (809)]].{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}}{{sfn|Bray|1983|p=121}}\n\n===Photian controversy===\nAround 860 the controversy over the ''Filioque'' broke out in the course of the disputes between Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] and [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople]].

And this is so precisely because the Spirit is distinguished by two specific properties. Therefore He is inferior to the Son, Who in turn is of the same nature as the Father!

All the other divergences which, historically, accompanied or followed the first dogmatic controversy about the Filioque, in the measure in which they too had some dogmatic importance, are more or less dependent upon that original issue. ... If other questions have arisen and taken the first place in more recent inter-confessional debates, that is chiefly because the dogmatic plane on which the thought of theologians operates is no longer the same as it was in the medieval period.\"{{sfn|Lossky|2003|p=163}}}}\n\nWestern churches have arrived at the position that, although the ''Filioque'' is doctrinally sound, the way that it was inserted into the Nicene Creed has created an unnecessary obstacle to ecumenical dialogue. Thus, without abandoning the ''Filioque'', some Western churches have come to accept that it could be omitted from the Creed without violating any core theological principles. This accommodation on the part of Western Churches has the objective of allowing both East and West to once again to share a common understanding of the Creed as the traditional and fundamental statement of the Christian faith.<!-- hubpages.com is on the spam blacklist; need to get this page whitelisted before it can be included <ref name=MacKinlay>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=McKinlay |title=The Filioque in the Nicene Creed: a hindrance to Christian unity |url=http://brianmckinlay.hubpages.com/hub/The-Filioque-in-the-Nicene-Creed |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> -->\n\n===Old Catholic Church===\nImmediately after the [[Old Catholic Church]] separated from the [[Catholic Church]] in 1871, its theologians initiated contact with the Orthodox Church.

The conferences discussed a number of issues including the filioque controversy. From the outset, Old Catholic theologians agreed with the Orthodox position that the ''Filioque'' had been introduced in the West in an unacceptably non-canonical way. It was at these Bonn conferences that the Old Catholics became the first Western church to omit the ''Filioque'' from the Nicene Creed.{{sfn|Guretzki|2009|p=11}}{{sfn|Moltmann|1993|pp=179\u2013180}}<ref name=\"ThomasWondra2002\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Owen C. |last2=Wondra|first2=Ellen K.|author-link2=Ellen Wondra |title=Introduction to theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dK4Ay-bhbcC&pg=PA221|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=1 July 2002|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8192-1897-1|page=221}}</ref>\n\n===Anglican Communion===\nThree [[Lambeth Conferences]] (1888, 1978 and 1988) have recommended that the ''Filioque'' be dropped from the Nicene Creed by churches that belong to the Anglican Communion.<!--<ref name=MacKinlay />-->\n\nThe 1930 Lambeth Conference initiated formal theological dialogue between representatives of the Anglican and Orthodox churches.<ref name=\"KennedyKennedy2008\">{{cite book|author1=David J.

In October 2003, the Consultation issued an agreed statement, ''The Filioque: a Church-dividing issue?'', which provides an extensive review of Scripture, history, and theology.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}} The recommendations include:\n\n#That all involved in such dialogue expressly recognize the limitations of our ability to make definitive assertions about the inner life of God.\n#That, in the future, because of the progress in mutual understanding that has come about in recent decades, Orthodox and Catholics refrain from labeling as heretical the traditions of the other side on the subject of the procession of the Holy Spirit.\n#That Orthodox and Catholic theologians distinguish more clearly between the divinity and hypostatic identity of the Holy Spirit (which is a received dogma of our Churches) and the manner of the Spirit's origin, which still awaits full and final ecumenical resolution.\n#That those engaged in dialogue on this issue distinguish, as far as possible, the theological issues of the origin of the Holy Spirit from the ecclesiological issues of primacy and doctrinal authority in the Church, even as we pursue both questions seriously, together.\n#That the theological dialogue between our Churches also give careful consideration to the status of later councils held in both our Churches after those seven generally received as ecumenical.\n#That the Catholic Church, as a consequence of the normative and irrevocable dogmatic value of the [[Nicene Creed#Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed|Creed of 381]], use the original Greek text alone in making translations of that Creed for catechetical and liturgical use.\n#That the Catholic Church, following a growing theological consensus, and in particular the statements made by [[Pope Paul VI]], declare that the condemnation made at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] (1274) of those \"who presume to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son\" is no longer applicable.\n\nIn the judgment of the consultation, the question of the ''Filioque'' is no longer a \"Church-dividing\" issue, which would impede full reconciliation and full communion. It is for the bishops of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches to review this work and to make whatever decisions would be appropriate.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}\n\n==Summary==\nWhile the Filioque doctrine was traditional in the West, being declared dogmatically in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope whose ''Tome'' was approved at the [[Council of Chalcedon]],{{refn|Leo I Letter 28 ''to Flavian'' ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume XIV/The Fourth Ecumenical Council/The Tome of St. Leo|NPNF2 14:254\u2013258]]); {{CCC|247}}.}} its inclusion in the Creed appeared in the [[Arian controversy|anti-Arian]] situation of [[History of Spain#Visigothic Hispania (5th\u20138th centuries)|7th-century Spain]]. However, this dogma was never accepted in the East.

It is not in the original text of the Creed, attributed to the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), the [[second ecumenical council]], which says that the [[Holy Spirit]] proceeds \"from the Father\", without additions of any kind, such as \"and the Son\" or \"alone\".{{sfn|RCA|2002|p=70}}\n\nIn the late 6th century, some [[Latin Church]]es added the words \"and from the Son\" (''Filioque'') to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.x.html Canon VII]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}} of the [[Council of Ephesus]], since the words were not included in the text by either the [[First Council of Nicaea]] or that of Constantinople.<ref>For a different view, see e.g. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.xi.html Excursus on the Words \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f11\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}} This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014,<ref name=\"Catholic Greek-Latin\" /> but was rejected by Eastern Christianity.\n\nWhether that term ''Filioque'' is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], which is central to the majority of Christian churches. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of [[God the Father]]'s role in the Trinity; for others, its denial implies a serious underestimation of the role of [[God the Son]] in the Trinity.\n\nThe term has been an ongoing source of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, contributing, in major part, to the [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054 and proving to be an obstacle to attempts to reunify the two sides.{{sfnm|Congar|1959|1p=44|Meyendorff|1987|2p=181|NAOCTC|2003}} There have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of [[Maximus the Confessor]], who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches. Differences over this doctrine and the question of [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal primacy]] have been and remain primary causes of schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches.{{sfn|Larchet|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|WCCFO|1979}}\n\n==Nicene Creed==\nThe Nicene Creed as amended by the Second Ecumenical Council held in Constantinople in 381 includes the section\n<blockquote><poem>''Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem\n'''qui ex Patre procedit'''\n''qui cum Patre, et Filio simul adoratur, et cum glorificatur.''</poem></blockquote>\n\nTranslated in English:\n<blockquote><poem>''[I believe] in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,''\n'''who proceeds from the Father,'''\n''who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.''{{refn|{{OED|filioque, n|70207}}}}</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe controversy arises from the insertion of the word ''Filioque'' (\"and the Son\") in the line:\n<blockquote><poem>...''qui ex Patre '''Filioque''' procedit''...\n\n...''who proceeds from the Father '''and the Son'''''...</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Controversy==\nThe controversy referring to the term ''Filioque'' involves four separate disagreements:\n* about the term itself\n* about the orthodoxy of the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, to which the term refers\n* about the legitimacy of inserting the term into the  Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed,\n* about the authority of the Pope to define the orthodoxy of the doctrine or to insert the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. \n\nAlthough the disagreement about the doctrine preceded the disagreement about the insertion into the Creed, the two disagreements became linked to the third when the pope approved insertion of the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in the 11th century. Anthony Siecienski writes that \"Ultimately what was at stake was not only God's trinitarian nature, but also the nature of the Church, its teaching authority and the distribution of power among its leaders.\"{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[Hubert Cunliffe-Jones]] identifies two opposing Eastern Orthodox opinions about the ''Filioque'', a \"liberal\" view and a \"rigorist\" view. The \"liberal\" view sees the controversy as being largely a matter of mutual miscommunication and misunderstanding. In this view, both East and West are at fault for failing to allow for a \"plurality of theologies\". Each side went astray in considering their theological framework as the only one that was doctrinally valid and applicable. Thus, neither side would accept that the dispute was not so much about conflicting dogmas as it was about different ''[[theologoumenon|theologoumena]]'' or theological perspectives. While all Christians must be in agreement on questions of [[dogma]], there is room for diversity in theological approaches.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nThis view is vehemently opposed by those in Eastern Orthodox Church whom Cunliffe-Jones identifies as holding a \"rigorist\" view. According to standard Eastern Orthodox position, as pronounced by [[Photius]], [[Mark of Ephesus]] and 20th century Eastern Orthodox theologians such as [[Vladimir Lossky]], the ''Filioque'' question hinges on fundamental issues of dogma and cannot be dismissed as simply one of different ''theologoumena''. Many in the \"rigorist\" camp consider the ''Filioque'' to have resulted in the role of the Holy Spirit being underestimated by the Western Church and thus leading to serious doctrinal error.{{sfn|Cunliffe-Jones|2006|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nIn a similar vein, Siecienski comments that, although it was common in the 20th century to view the ''Filioque'' as just another weapon in the power struggle between Rome and Constantinople and although this was occasionally the case, for many involved in the dispute, the theological issues outweighed by far the ecclesiological concerns. According to Siecienski, the deeper question was perhaps whether Eastern and Western Christianity had wound up developing \"differing and ultimately incompatible teachings about the nature of God\". Moreover, Siecienski asserts that the question of whether the teachings of East and West were truly incompatible became almost secondary to the fact that, starting around the 8th or 9th century, Christians on both sides of the dispute began to believe that the differences ''were'' irreconcilable.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nFrom the view of the West, the Eastern rejection of the ''Filioque'' denied the [[consubstantiality]] of the Father and the Son and was thus a form of crypto-[[Arianism]].

Among the Church leaders in Frankish Kingdom of that time a notion was developing that Filioque clause was in fact an authentic part of the original Creed.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=92}} Trying to deal with that problem and its potentially dangerous consequences, the Church of Rome found itself in the middle of a widening rift between its own Daughter-Church in Frankish Kingdom and Sister-Churches of the East. Popes of that time, [[Pope Hadrian I|Hadrian I]] and [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]], had to face various challenges while trying to find solutions that would preserve the unity of the Church.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|p=38}}\n\nFirst signs of the problems were starting to show by the end of the reign of Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]] (751-768). Use of the ''Filioque'' clause in the Frankish Kingdom led to controversy with envoys of the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] at the Synod of Gentilly (767).{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|Hinson|1995|p=315}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=90}} As the practice of chanting the interpolated Latin ''{{lang|la|Credo}}'' at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] spread in the West, the ''Filioque'' became a part of the [[Latin Rite]] liturgy throughout the Frankish Kingdom. The practice of chanting the Creed was adopted in Charlemagne's court by the end of the 8th century and spread through all of his realms, including some northern parts of Italy, but not to Rome, where its use was not accepted until 1014.{{sfn|Dix|2005|pp=485\u2013488}}{{sfn|Louth|2007|p=142}}\n\nSerious problems erupted in 787 after the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] when Charlemagne accused the Patriarch [[Tarasios of Constantinople]] of infidelity to the faith of the First Council of Nicaea, allegedly because he had not professed the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father \"and the Son\", but only \"through the Son\". [[Pope Adrian I]] rejected those accusations and tried to explain to the Frankish king that pneumatology of Tarasios was in accordance with the teachings of the holy Fathers.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}}{{efn|Charlemagne's legates claimed that Tarasius, at his installation, did not follow the Nicene faith and profess that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but confessed rather his procession from the Father ''through the Son'' (Mansi 13.760). The Pope strongly rejected Charlemagne's protest, showing at length that Tarasius and the Council, on this and other points, maintained the faith of the Fathers (ibid. 759\u2013810).}} Surprisingly, efforts of the pope had no effect.\n\nTrue scale of the problem became evident during the following years. The Frankish view of the ''Filioque'' was emphasized again in the ''[[Libri Carolini]]'', composed around 791\u2013793.{{efn|Following this exchange of letters with the pope, Charlemagne commissioned the ''Libri Carolini'' (791\u2013793) to challenge the positions both of the iconoclast council of 754 and of the Council of Nicaea of 787 on the veneration of icons. Again because of poor translations, the Carolingians misunderstood the actual decision of the latter Council.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}}} Openly arguing that the word ''Filioque'' was part of the Creed of 381, the authors of ''Libri Carolini'' demonstrated not only the surprising lack of basic knowledge but also the lack of will to receive right advice and council from the Mother-Church in Rome. Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father ''through the Son''.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=237}} That claim was both erroneous and dangerous for the preservation of the unity of the Church.\n\nIn those days, another theological problem appeared to be closely connected with the use of Filioque in the West. In the late 8th century, a controversy arose between Bishop [[Elipandus of Toledo]] and [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]] over the former's teaching (which has been called [[Spanish Adoptionism]]) that Christ in his humanity was the adoptive son of God. Elipandus was supported by Bishop [[Felix of Urgel]]. In 785, Pope Hadrian I condemned the teaching of Elipandus. In 791, Felix appealed to Charlemagne in defense of the Spanish Adoptionist teaching, sending him a tract outlining it. He was condemned at the Synod of Regensburg (792) and was sent to Pope Hadrian in Rome, where he made of profession of orthodox faith, but returned to Spain and there reaffirmed Adoptionism. Elipandus wrote to the bishops of the territories controlled by Charlemagne in defence of his teaching, which was condemned at the [[Council of Frankfurt]] (794) and at the Synod of [[Friuli]] (796). The controversy encouraged those who rejected Adoptionism to introduce into the liturgy the use of the Creed, with the ''Filioque'', to profess belief that Christ was the Son from eternity, not adopted as a son at his baptism.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93-94}}{{sfn|Dales|2013|pp=61\u201367}}\n\nAt the Synod of Friuli, [[Paulinus II of Aquileia]] stated that the insertion of ''Filioque'' in the 381 Creed of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] was no more a violation of the prohibition of new creeds than were the insertions into the 325 Creed of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] that were done by the First Council of Constantinople itself. What was forbidden, he said, was adding or removing something \"craftily ... contrary to the sacred intentions of the fathers\", not a council's addition that could be shown to be in line with the intentions of the Fathers and the faith of the ancient Church. Actions such as that of the First Council of Contantinople were sometimes called for in order to clarify the faith and do away with heresies that appear.{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=364}} The views of Paulinus show that some advocates of Filioque clause were quite aware of the fact that it actually was not part of the Creed.{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238}}\n\nPolitical events that followed additionally complicated the issue. According to [[John Meyendorff]],{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|pp=41\u201343, 195\u2013197}} and [[John Romanides]]<ref name=\"Romanides1\"/> the Frankish efforts to get new [[Pope Leo III]] to approve the addition of ''Filioque'' to the Creed were due to a desire of [[Charlemagne]], who in 800 had been crowned in Rome as Emperor, to find grounds for accusations of heresy against the East. The Pope's refusal to approve the interpolation of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed avoided arousing a conflict between East and West about this matter. During his reign ({{Reign|795|816|lk=abbr}}), and for another two centuries, there was no Creed at all in the [[Roman rite]] Mass.\n\nReasons for the continuing refusal of the Frankish Church to adopt the positions of the Church of Rome on necessity of leaving Filioque outside of Creed remained unknown. Faced with another endorsement of the Filioque clause at the Frankish [[Council of Aachen (809)]] pope Leo III denied his approval and publicly posted the Creed in Rome without the Filioque, written in Greek and Latin on two silver plaques, in defense of the Orthodox Faith (810) stating his opposition to the addition of the ''Filioque'' into the Creed.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{sfn|Siecienski|2010|p=91-93}}{{sfn|Nichols|2010|p=238-239}} Although Leo III did not disapprove the ''Filioque'' doctrine, the Pope strongly believed the clause should not be included into the Creed.{{sfn|Maas|1909}}{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|ODCC|2005|loc=\"Filioque\"}}{{efn|\"Leo III defended the Filioque outside the Creed.}} In spite of the efforts of the Church of Rome, the acceptance of the Filioque clause in the Creed of the Frankish Church proved to be irreversible.\n\nIn 808 or 809 apparent controversy arose in Jerusalem between the Greek monks of one monastery and the Frankish Benedictine monks of another: the Greeks reproached the latter for, among other things, singing the creed with the ''Filioque'' included.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Schmaus|1975}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}} In response, the theology of the ''Filioque'' was expressed in the 809 local [[Council of Aachen (809)]].{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}{{sfn|Harnack|1898|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html ch. 6 \u00a72]}}{{sfn|Bray|1983|p=121}}\n\n===Photian controversy===\nAround 860 the controversy over the ''Filioque'' broke out in the course of the disputes between Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] and [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople]].

And this is so precisely because the Spirit is distinguished by two specific properties. Therefore He is inferior to the Son, Who in turn is of the same nature as the Father!

All the other divergences which, historically, accompanied or followed the first dogmatic controversy about the Filioque, in the measure in which they too had some dogmatic importance, are more or less dependent upon that original issue. ... If other questions have arisen and taken the first place in more recent inter-confessional debates, that is chiefly because the dogmatic plane on which the thought of theologians operates is no longer the same as it was in the medieval period.\"{{sfn|Lossky|2003|p=163}}}}\n\nWestern churches have arrived at the position that, although the ''Filioque'' is doctrinally sound, the way that it was inserted into the Nicene Creed has created an unnecessary obstacle to ecumenical dialogue. Thus, without abandoning the ''Filioque'', some Western churches have come to accept that it could be omitted from the Creed without violating any core theological principles. This accommodation on the part of Western Churches has the objective of allowing both East and West to once again to share a common understanding of the Creed as the traditional and fundamental statement of the Christian faith.<!-- hubpages.com is on the spam blacklist; need to get this page whitelisted before it can be included <ref name=MacKinlay>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=McKinlay |title=The Filioque in the Nicene Creed: a hindrance to Christian unity |url=http://brianmckinlay.hubpages.com/hub/The-Filioque-in-the-Nicene-Creed |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> -->\n\n===Old Catholic Church===\nImmediately after the [[Old Catholic Church]] separated from the [[Catholic Church]] in 1871, its theologians initiated contact with the Orthodox Church.

The conferences discussed a number of issues including the filioque controversy. From the outset, Old Catholic theologians agreed with the Orthodox position that the ''Filioque'' had been introduced in the West in an unacceptably non-canonical way. It was at these Bonn conferences that the Old Catholics became the first Western church to omit the ''Filioque'' from the Nicene Creed.{{sfn|Guretzki|2009|p=11}}{{sfn|Moltmann|1993|pp=179\u2013180}}<ref name=\"ThomasWondra2002\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Owen C. |last2=Wondra|first2=Ellen K.|author-link2=Ellen Wondra |title=Introduction to theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dK4Ay-bhbcC&pg=PA221|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=1 July 2002|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8192-1897-1|page=221}}</ref>\n\n===Anglican Communion===\nThree [[Lambeth Conferences]] (1888, 1978 and 1988) have recommended that the ''Filioque'' be dropped from the Nicene Creed by churches that belong to the Anglican Communion.<!--<ref name=MacKinlay />-->\n\nThe 1930 Lambeth Conference initiated formal theological dialogue between representatives of the Anglican and Orthodox churches.<ref name=\"KennedyKennedy2008\">{{cite book|author1=David J.

In October 2003, the Consultation issued an agreed statement, ''The Filioque: a Church-dividing issue?'', which provides an extensive review of Scripture, history, and theology.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}} The recommendations include:\n\n#That all involved in such dialogue expressly recognize the limitations of our ability to make definitive assertions about the inner life of God.\n#That, in the future, because of the progress in mutual understanding that has come about in recent decades, Orthodox and Catholics refrain from labeling as heretical the traditions of the other side on the subject of the procession of the Holy Spirit.\n#That Orthodox and Catholic theologians distinguish more clearly between the divinity and hypostatic identity of the Holy Spirit (which is a received dogma of our Churches) and the manner of the Spirit's origin, which still awaits full and final ecumenical resolution.\n#That those engaged in dialogue on this issue distinguish, as far as possible, the theological issues of the origin of the Holy Spirit from the ecclesiological issues of primacy and doctrinal authority in the Church, even as we pursue both questions seriously, together.\n#That the theological dialogue between our Churches also give careful consideration to the status of later councils held in both our Churches after those seven generally received as ecumenical.\n#That the Catholic Church, as a consequence of the normative and irrevocable dogmatic value of the [[Nicene Creed#Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed|Creed of 381]], use the original Greek text alone in making translations of that Creed for catechetical and liturgical use.\n#That the Catholic Church, following a growing theological consensus, and in particular the statements made by [[Pope Paul VI]], declare that the condemnation made at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] (1274) of those \"who presume to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son\" is no longer applicable.\n\nIn the judgment of the consultation, the question of the ''Filioque'' is no longer a \"Church-dividing\" issue, which would impede full reconciliation and full communion. It is for the bishops of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches to review this work and to make whatever decisions would be appropriate.{{sfn|NAOCTC|2003}}\n\n==Summary==\nWhile the Filioque doctrine was traditional in the West, being declared dogmatically in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope whose ''Tome'' was approved at the [[Council of Chalcedon]],{{refn|Leo I Letter 28 ''to Flavian'' ([[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume XIV/The Fourth Ecumenical Council/The Tome of St. Leo|NPNF2 14:254\u2013258]]); {{CCC|247}}.}} its inclusion in the Creed appeared in the [[Arian controversy|anti-Arian]] situation of [[History of Spain#Visigothic Hispania (5th\u20138th centuries)|7th-century Spain]]. However, this dogma was never accepted in the East.

This makes them more visible and the content more relevant, interlinked and useful.<ref name=WassermanSocialNetworkAnalysis /> Centrality from a graph-theoretical perspective describes unidirectional relationships, not making a distinction between receiving and sending information. From this point of view, it includes the inbound links considered in the definition of \u201cprestige\u201d complemented with outgoing links. Another difference between prestige and centrality is that the measure of prestige counts for a complete website or an author, whereas centrality can be considered on a more granular level like one individual blog post.\nSearch engines look at various factors to judge the quality of outgoing links, i.e., on link-centrality, describing the quality and quantity as well as the relevance of outgoing links and the prestige of its destination. They also look at the frequency of new content publication (\u201cfreshness of information\u201d) to be sure that the website is still an active player in the community.<ref name=OnPage.orgDomainAuthority />\n\n==Competitive situation around a subject==\nThe domain authority that a website attains is not the only factor which defines its positioning in the SERPs of search engines. The second important factor is the competitiveness of a specific sector. Subjects like [[SEO]] are very competitive. A website needs to outperform the prestige of competing websites to attain domain authority. This prestige, relative to other websites, can be defined as \u201crelative domain authority.\u201d{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:World Wide Web]]\n", "name_user": "SaranMusic", "label": "safe", "comment": "high quality con improve domain authority and page authority of website.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Authority"}

The district headquarters is located at [[Mayiladuthurai]]. Mayiladuthurai district was carved out of [[Nagapattinam district]] after the announcement of the bifurcation of the districts on 24 March 2020.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe district is bounded on the north by [[Cuddalore district]] near kollidam, on the south by [[Tiruvarur district]] near kollumangudi, on the west by [[Thanjavur district]] near aduthurai, on the east by the [[Bay of Bengal]] and on the southeast near porayar by [[Karaikal district]] of the union territory [[Puducherry]]\n\n== Taluks ==\nIn 2020, When Mayiladuthurai District was carved out of Nagapattinam it had four taluks,\n*[[Kuthalam taluk]] \n*[[Mayiladuthurai taluk]]\n*[[Sirkazhi taluk]]\n*[[Tharangambadi taluk]]\n\n==Administration==\nThe Collector is the administrative head of each district and is the principle representative of the government for the district. The Collector's main responsibilities include revenue administration, Executive Magistracy, maintaining law and order, licensing and regulatory functions, disaster management, civil supplies, public distribution, social welfare, excise, transport, mining, labour laws, elections, legal affairs, census, general administration, treasury management and co-ordination with various departments of the state and central governments. The Collector is also the head of various committees formed at the district level for the various central and state government schemes.\n\nThere are 38 districts in Tamil Nadu, each divided for revenue administration purposes into [[List of Revenue Divisions of Tamil Nadu|revenue divisions]], which are further divided into [[Talukas]]. Each of these Talukas has a list of revenue villages and is headed by a Tahsildar. Developmental administration of the district is carried out by Panchayat Unions (or Town Panchayats) in rural areas.  These panchayat unions have a set of panchayat villages under them.  In urban areas, the governance is done by municipal corporations, municipalities or town panchayats based on the size of the town; each of these has a set of wards. The functions of the municipality are devolved into six departments: general administration/personnel, Engineering, Revenue, Public Health, Town Planning, and Information Technology (IT). The municipalities are administered by a Municipal Commissioner, who is the executive head. The legislative powers are vested in a body of elected members from each ward of the municipality. The legislative body is headed by an elected Chairperson assisted by a Deputy Chairperson.\n\nMayiladuthurai District was formerly a part of [[Nagapattinam District]]. The district boundary is shared by Tiruvarur, Karaikal, Thanjavur and Cuddalore districts. Its population at the 2001 [[Census]] was nearly 1 million. The district has four [[taluk]]s, five administrative blocks, four town panchayats, and two municipalities. Two of the talukas are coastal, two are non-coastal and all are named after their main towns, which are their administrative centres.  From north to south, they are [[Sirkazhi]], [[Mayiladuthurai]] (non-coastal), [[Kuthalam]] (non-coastal) and [[Tharangambadi]].  It is bordered on the east by the [[Bay of Bengal]] and on the south by the [[Thiruvarur]].  On the east lies the small district of [[Karaikal]], an enclave belonging administratively to the [[Puducherry]] [[Union Territory]].\n\n==Politics==\n{| style=\"clear:right; float:right; background:#ffffff; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;\" class=\"toccolours\" width=\"220\" font-size : \"90%\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#A8BDEC\" align=\"center\" colspan=2|Member of Parliament\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Mayiladuthurai||S Ramalingam\n|-\n!style=\"background:#A8BDEC\" align=\"center\" colspan=2|Members of Legislative Assembly\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sirkali (SC)|| M.

Pavunraj Poompouhar MLA\n|-\n|}\n\nThe district has one Lok Sabha constituency, namely [[Mayiladuthurai (Lok Sabha constituency)]]. The Mayiladuthurai constituency was constituted during the third Lok Sabha as Mayuram until 1980 elections, when it was renamed to Mayiladuthurai. The current Member of Parliament from the constituency is S. Ramalingam from the DMK party. From 1962, the Mayiladuthurai parliament seat was held by the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) two times during 1967\u201371, and 1971\u201377, [[Tamil Maanila Congress]] for two times during 1998\u201399 and 1999\u20132004, [[Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] once during 2009 elections, [[Indian National Congress]] for 8 times during 1962\u201367, 1977\u201380, 1980\u201384, 1984\u201389, 1989\u201391, 1991\u201396, 1999\u20132004 and 2004\u201309.\n\nThere are a total of three legislative assembly constituencies in the district, namely, [[Sirkazhi (State Assembly Constituency)|Sirkazhi]], [[Poompuhar (State Assembly Constituency)|Poompuhar]] and [[Mayiladuthurai (State Assembly Constituency)|Mayiladuthurai]]. Out of these, Sirkazhi is reserved for [[Scheduled Caste]] (SC).\n\n==Culture and Tourism==\nTourism plays a key economic role for the town even though Agriculture, fishing & sugar/rice factories is the major occupation.\n\nFort Dansborg, locally called Danish Fort, is a [[Denmark|Danish]] fort located in the shores of [[Bay of Bengal]] in [[Tranquebar]] (Tharangambadi) in the [[South Indian]] state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Fort Dansborg was built in the land ceded by [[Thanjavur]] king [[Raghunatha Nayak|Ragunatha Nayak]] in an agreement with Danish Admiral [[Ove Gjedde]] in 1620 and acted as the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. The fort is the second largest Danish fort after [[Kronborg]]. The fort was sold to the British in 1845 and along with Tranquebar, the fort lost its significance as the town was not an active trading post for the British. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort. The fort is now used as a museum where the major artifacts of the fort and the Danish empire are displayed.\n[[File:Tharangambadi (15).jpg|250px|right|A view of the Dansborg Fort|alt=A view of Dansborg Fort with Bay of Bengal in the background|thumb]]\n[[File:Fort Dansborg in Tharangambadi, Tamil Nadu.jpg|thumb|Fort Dansborg in Tharangambadi, Tamil Nadu]]\nThe fort was renovated twice in modern times, once by Tranquebar Association with the help of the Danish royal family and the State Archaeology Department in 2001 and secondly by a project named Destination Development of Tranquebar by the Department of Tourism of the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2011 in consultation with Intach, Pondicherry chapter. The fort is one of the prominent tourist destinations in the region.\n\nPuhar (also known as Poompuhar) is a town in the Mayiladuthurai district in the southern Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It was once a flourishing ancient port city known as Kaveri poompattinam, which for a while served as the capital of the [[early Cholas|Early Chola]] kings in [[Tamilakam]]. Puhar is located near the end point of the [[Kaveri]] river, aside the sea coast. It is mentioned in the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]].\n\nIt has now been established by marine archaeological research (conducted by the National institute of marine archaeology, Goa) that much of the town was washed away by progressive erosion and floods. In the 1960s and 1970s, archaeological researches were conducted under the leadership of the noted archaeologist K. V. Soundararajan. Submerged wharves and several meter lengths of pier walls excavated in recent times have corroborated the literary references to Poompuhar. It was rebuilt several times after that. Ancient Pottery dating back to the 4th century BCE have been discovered off shore by marine archaeologists east of this town.\n\n[[File:Puhar-Beach.jpg|thumb|Poompuhar Beach, Mayiladuthurai, Tamil Nadu]]\n\n===Spritual Tourism===\n\nSri Amirthagateswarar Abhirami Temple (\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0 \u0b85\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bcb\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd) is a [[Hindu]] temple dedicated to [[Shiva]] in his manifestation as \"Destroyer of Death\" and his wife [[Parvati]] as Abhirami.

The district headquarters is located at [[Mayiladuthurai]]. Mayiladuthurai district was carved out of [[Nagapattinam district]] after the announcement of the bifurcation of the districts on 24 March 2020.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe district is bounded on the north by [[Cuddalore district]] near kollidam, on the south by [[Tiruvarur district]] near kollumangudi, on the west by [[Thanjavur district]] near aduthurai, on the east by the [[Bay of Bengal]] and on the southeast near porayar by [[Karaikal district]] of the union territory [[Puducherry]]\n\n== Taluks ==\nIn 2020, When Mayiladuthurai District was carved out of Nagapattinam it had four taluks,\n*[[Kuthalam taluk]] \n*[[Mayiladuthurai taluk]]\n*[[Sirkazhi taluk]]\n*[[Tharangambadi taluk]]\n\n==Administration==\nThe Collector is the administrative head of each district and is the principle representative of the government for the district. The Collector's main responsibilities include revenue administration, Executive Magistracy, maintaining law and order, licensing and regulatory functions, disaster management, civil supplies, public distribution, social welfare, excise, transport, mining, labour laws, elections, legal affairs, census, general administration, treasury management and co-ordination with various departments of the state and central governments.

Each of these Talukas has a list of revenue villages and is headed by a Tahsildar. Developmental administration of the district is carried out by Panchayat Unions (or Town Panchayats) in rural areas.  These panchayat unions have a set of panchayat villages under them.  In urban areas, the governance is done by municipal corporations, municipalities or town panchayats based on the size of the town; each of these has a set of wards. The functions of the municipality are devolved into six departments: general administration/personnel, Engineering, Revenue, Public Health, Town Planning, and Information Technology (IT). The municipalities are administered by a Municipal Commissioner, who is the executive head. The legislative powers are vested in a body of elected members from each ward of the municipality. The legislative body is headed by an elected Chairperson assisted by a Deputy Chairperson.\n\nMayiladuthurai District was formerly a part of [[Nagapattinam District]]. The district boundary is shared by Tiruvarur, Karaikal, Thanjavur and Cuddalore districts. Its population at the 2001 [[Census]] was nearly 1 million. The district has four [[taluk]]s, five administrative blocks, four town panchayats, and two municipalities. Two of the talukas are coastal, two are non-coastal and all are named after their main towns, which are their administrative centres.  From north to south, they are [[Sirkazhi]], [[Mayiladuthurai]] (non-coastal), [[Kuthalam]] (non-coastal) and [[Tharangambadi]].  It is bordered on the east by the [[Bay of Bengal]] and on the south by the [[Thiruvarur]].  On the east lies the small district of [[Karaikal]], an enclave belonging administratively to the [[Puducherry]] [[Union Territory]].\n\n==Politics==\n{| style=\"clear:right; float:right; background:#ffffff; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;\" class=\"toccolours\" width=\"220\" font-size : \"90%\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#A8BDEC\" align=\"center\" colspan=2|Member of Parliament\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Mayiladuthurai||S Ramalingam\n|-\n!style=\"background:#A8BDEC\" align=\"center\" colspan=2|Members of Legislative Assembly\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sirkali (SC)|| M.

Fort Dansborg was built in the land ceded by [[Thanjavur]] king [[Raghunatha Nayak|Ragunatha Nayak]] in an agreement with Danish Admiral [[Ove Gjedde]] in 1620 and acted as the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. The fort is the second largest Danish fort after [[Kronborg]]. The fort was sold to the British in 1845 and along with Tranquebar, the fort lost its significance as the town was not an active trading post for the British. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort. The fort is now used as a museum where the major artifacts of the fort and the Danish empire are displayed.\n[[File:Tharangambadi (15).jpg|250px|right|A view of the Dansborg Fort|alt=A view of Dansborg Fort with Bay of Bengal in the background|thumb]]\n[[File:Fort Dansborg in Tharangambadi, Tamil Nadu.jpg|thumb|Fort Dansborg in Tharangambadi, Tamil Nadu]]\nThe fort was renovated twice in modern times, once by Tranquebar Association with the help of the Danish royal family and the State Archaeology Department in 2001 and secondly by a project named Destination Development of Tranquebar by the Department of Tourism of the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2011 in consultation with Intach, Pondicherry chapter.

Puhar is located near the end point of the [[Kaveri]] river, aside the sea coast. It is mentioned in the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]].\n\nIt has now been established by marine archaeological research (conducted by the National institute of marine archaeology, Goa) that much of the town was washed away by progressive erosion and floods. In the 1960s and 1970s, archaeological researches were conducted under the leadership of the noted archaeologist K. V. Soundararajan. Submerged wharves and several meter lengths of pier walls excavated in recent times have corroborated the literary references to Poompuhar. It was rebuilt several times after that. Ancient Pottery dating back to the 4th century BCE have been discovered off shore by marine archaeologists east of this town.\n\n[[File:Puhar-Beach.jpg|thumb|Poompuhar Beach, Mayiladuthurai, Tamil Nadu]]\n\n===Spritual Tourism===\n\nSri Amirthagateswarar Abhirami Temple (\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0 \u0b85\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bcb\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd) is a [[Hindu]] temple dedicated to [[Shiva]] in his manifestation as \"Destroyer of Death\" and his wife [[Parvati]] as Abhirami.
