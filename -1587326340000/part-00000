To be \"[[between Scylla and Charybdis]]\" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both. Three times a day, Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water, before belching it back out again, creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater. In some variations of the story, Charybdis was simply a large [[whirlpool]] instead of a sea monster.\n\nThe theoretical size of Charybdis remains unknown, yet in order to consume [[Greece|Greek]] ships the whirlpool can be estimated to about 23 meters (75&nbsp;ft) across. Through the descriptions of Greek mythical chroniclers and Greek historians such as [[Thucydides]], modern scholars generally agree that Charybdis was said to have been located in the [[Strait of Messina]], off the [[coast]] of [[Sicily]] and opposite a rock on the mainland identified with Scylla.<ref>[[Thucydides]].

Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient. It resulted, among other government actions, on the Island's government declaring a curfew on March 15.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|title=Gobernadora decreta toque de queda por el coronavirus|last=Rivera Clementa|first=Yaritza|date=2020-03-15|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013700/https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|archive-date=March 16, 2020|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"END Toque de Queda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|title=Wanda V\u00e1zquez decreta toque de queda para todo Puerto Rico para contener el coronavirus [Wanda V\u00e1zquez declares curfew for all of Puerto Rico to contain coronavirus]|date=2020-03-15|website=El Nuevo Dia|language=es-pr|access-date=2020-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320052615/https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|archive-date=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The first death recorded was that of the 68-year-old Italian woman tourist; a few days later her husband was reported to have recovered from the virus.

On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient.

The Legislative Assembly has existed since 1867 when the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]] severed the [[Province of Canada]] into two new provinces, with the portion then called [[Canada West]] becoming Ontario.  For the Parliaments prior to Confederation, see [[Parliament of the Province of Canada]] (1841 to 1867) and [[Parliament of Upper Canada]] (1791 to 1841).\n\n==List of Parliaments==\n\n{|
