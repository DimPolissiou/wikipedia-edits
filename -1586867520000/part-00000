The name \"harmonic balance\" is descriptive of the method, which starts with Kirchhoff's Current Law written in the frequency domain and a chosen number of harmonics.  A sinusoidal signal applied to a nonlinear component in a system will generate [[harmonics]] of the fundamental frequency.   Effectively the method assumes the solution can be represented by a linear combination of sinusoids, then balances current and voltage sinusoids to satisfy Kirchhoff's law. The method is commonly used to simulate circuits which include [[nonlinear]] elements,<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Maas\n  | first = Stephen A.\n  | title = Nonlinear microwave and RF circuits\n  | publisher = Artech House\n  | year = 2003\n  | isbn = 978-1-58053-484-0 }}</ref>  and is most applicable to systems with [[feedback]] in which [[limit cycle]]s occur.\n\nMicrowave circuits were the original application for harmonic balance methods in electrical engineering. Microwave circuits were well-suited because, historically, microwave circuits consist of many linear components which can be directly represented in the frequency domain, plus a few nonlinear components.  System sizes were typically small. For more general circuits, the method was considered impractical for all but these very small circuits until the mid-1990s, when [[Krylov subspace|Krylov subspace methods]] were applied to the problem.<ref>{{cite book \n|author1=Feldmann, P. |author2=Melville, B. |author3=Long, D. |title= Efficient frequency domain analysis of large nonlinear analog circuits\n|journal=Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference\n|year=1996 \n|pages=461&ndash;464\n|doi = 10.1109/CICC.1996.510597 \n|isbn=978-0-7803-3117-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Brachtendorf, H.G. |author2=Welsch, G. |author3=Laur, R. |title=Fast simulation of the steady-state of circuits by the harmonic balance technique\n|journal=Proceedings, International Symposium on Circuits and Systems\n|pages=1388\n|year=1995\n|doi=10.1109/ISCAS.1995.520406\n|volume=2\n|isbn=978-0-7803-2570-8}}</ref> \nThe application of preconditioned Krylov subspace methods allowed much larger systems to be solved, both in size of circuit and in numbers of harmonics. This made practical the present-day use of harmonic balance methods to analyze radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs).\n\n==Algorithm==\n\nThe harmonic balance algorithm is a special version of [[:Galerkin method|Galerkin's method]]. It is used for the calculation of periodic solutions of autonomous and non-autonomous [[:Differential algebraic equation|differential-algebraic systems of equations]]. The treatment of non-autonomous systems is slightly simpler than the treatment of autonomous ones. A non-autonomous DAE system has the representation\n:<math>\n0=F(t,x,\\dot x)\n</math>\nwith a sufficiently smooth function <math>F:\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{C}^n\\times\\mathbb{C}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}^n</math>\nwhere <math>n</math> is the number of equations and <math>t,x,\\dot x</math> are placeholders for time, the vector of unknowns and the vector of time-derivatives.\n\nThe system is non-autonomous if the function <math>t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mapsto F(t,x,\\dot x)</math> is not constant for (some) fixed <math>x</math> and <math>\\dot x</math>. Nevertheless, we require that there is a known ''excitation period'' <math>T>0</math> such that <math>t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mapsto F(t,x,\\dot x)</math> is <math>T</math>-periodic.\n\nA natural candidate set for the <math>T</math>-periodic solutions of the system equations is the Sobolev space <math>H^1_{\\rm per}((0,T),\\mathbb{C}^n)</math> of weakly differentiable functions on the interval <math>[0,T]</math> with periodic boundary conditions <math>x(0)=x(T)</math>.\nWe assume that the smoothness and the structure of <math>F</math> ensures that <math>F(t,x(t),\\dot x(t))</math> is [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]] for all <math>x\\in H^1_{\\rm per}((0,T),\\mathbb{C}^n)</math>.\n\nThe system <math>B:=\\left\\{\\psi_k \\mid k\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}</math> of harmonic functions <math>\\psi_k:=\\exp\\left(i k\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)</math> is a [[Schauder basis]] of <math>H^1_{\\rm per}((0,T),\\mathbb{C}^n)</math> and forms a [[Hilbert basis (linear programming)|:Hilbert basis]] of the [[Hilbert space]] <math>H:=L^2([0,T],\\mathbb{C})</math> of square-integrable functions. Therefore, each solution candidate <math>x\\in H^1_{\\rm per}((0,T),\\mathbb{C}^n)</math> can be represented by a Fourier-series <math>x(t)=\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat x_k \\exp\\left(i k\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right) </math> with Fourier-coefficients <math>\\hat x_k:=\\frac1T\\int_0^T\\psi^*_k(t)\\cdot x(t)dt</math> and the system equation is satisfied in the weak sense if for every base function <math>\\psi\\in B</math> the variational equation\n:<math>\n0=\\langle \\psi, F(t,x,\\dot x)\\rangle_H := \\frac 1 T \\int_0^T \\psi^*(t) \\cdot F(t,x,\\dot x) dt\n</math>\nis fulfilled. This variational equation represents an infinite sequence of scalar equations since it has to be tested for the infinite number of base functions <math>\\psi</math> in <math>B</math>.\n\nThe Galerkin approach to the harmonic balance is to project the candidate set as well as the test space for the variational equation to the finitely dimensional sub-space spanned by the finite base <math>B_N:=\\{\\psi_k \\mid k\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\text{ with } -N \\leq k \\leq N\\}</math>.\n\nThis gives the finite-dimensional solution <math> x(t) = \\sum_{k=-N}^N \\hat x_k \\psi_k(t) = \\sum_{k=-N}^N \\hat x_k \\exp\\left(i k \\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)</math> and the finite set of equations\n:<math>\n0 = \\langle \\psi_k , F(t,x,\\dot x)\\rangle\\quad\\text{ with }k=-N,\\ldots,N\n</math>\nwhich can be solved numerically.\n\nIn the special context of electronics the algorithm starts with Kirchhoff's current law written in the [[frequency-domain]]. To increase the efficiency of the procedure, the circuit may be partitioned into its linear and nonlinear parts, since the linear part is readily described and calculated using [[nodal analysis]] directly in the frequency domain.\n\nFirst, an initial guess is made for the solution, then an iterative process continues:\n\n# Voltages <math>V</math> are used to calculate the currents of the linear part, <math>I_\\text{linear}</math> in the frequency domain.\n# Voltages <math>V</math> are then used to calculate the currents in the nonlinear part, <math>I_\\text{nonlinear}</math>. Since nonlinear devices are described in the time domain, the frequency-domain voltages <math>V</math> are transformed into the time domain, typically using inverse Fast Fourier transforms. The nonlinear devices are then evaluated using the time-domain voltage waveforms to produce their time-domain currents.

The name \"harmonic balance\" is descriptive of the method, which starts with Kirchhoff's Current Law written in the frequency domain and a chosen number of harmonics.  A sinusoidal signal applied to a nonlinear component in a system will generate [[harmonics]] of the fundamental frequency.   Effectively the method assumes the solution can be represented by a linear combination of sinusoids, then balances current and voltage sinusoids to satisfy Kirchhoff's law. The method is commonly used to simulate circuits which include [[nonlinear]] elements,<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Maas\n  | first = Stephen A.\n  | title = Nonlinear microwave and RF circuits\n  | publisher = Artech House\n  | year = 2003\n  | isbn = 978-1-58053-484-0 }}</ref>  and is most applicable to systems with [[feedback]] in which [[limit cycle]]s occur.\n\nMicrowave circuits were the original application for harmonic balance methods in electrical engineering. Microwave circuits were well-suited because, historically, microwave circuits consist of many linear components which can be directly represented in the frequency domain, plus a few nonlinear components.  System sizes were typically small. For more general circuits, the method was considered impractical for all but these very small circuits until the mid-1990s, when [[Krylov subspace|Krylov subspace methods]] were applied to the problem.<ref>{{cite book \n|author1=Feldmann, P. |author2=Melville, B. |author3=Long, D. |title= Efficient frequency domain analysis of large nonlinear analog circuits\n|journal=Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference\n|year=1996 \n|pages=461&ndash;464\n|doi = 10.1109/CICC.1996.510597 \n|isbn=978-0-7803-3117-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Brachtendorf, H.G. |author2=Welsch, G. |author3=Laur, R. |title=Fast simulation of the steady-state of circuits by the harmonic balance technique\n|journal=Proceedings, International Symposium on Circuits and Systems\n|pages=1388\n|year=1995\n|doi=10.1109/ISCAS.1995.520406\n|volume=2\n|isbn=978-0-7803-2570-8}}</ref> \nThe application of preconditioned Krylov subspace methods allowed much larger systems to be solved, both in size of circuit and in numbers of harmonics. This made practical the present-day use of harmonic balance methods to analyze radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs).\n\n==Algorithm==\n\nThe harmonic balance algorithm is a special version of [[:Galerkin method|Galerkin's method]]. It is used for the calculation of periodic solutions of autonomous and non-autonomous [[:Differential algebraic equation|differential-algebraic systems of equations]]. The treatment of non-autonomous systems is slightly simpler than the treatment of autonomous ones. A non-autonomous DAE system has the representation\n:<math>\n0=F(t,x,\\dot x)\n</math>\nwith a sufficiently smooth function <math>F:\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{C}^n\\times\\mathbb{C}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}^n</math>\nwhere <math>n</math> is the number of equations and <math>t,x,\\dot x</math> are placeholders for time, the vector of unknowns and the vector of time-derivatives.\n\nThe system is non-autonomous if the function <math>t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mapsto F(t,x,\\dot x)</math> is not constant for (some) fixed <math>x</math> and <math>\\dot x</math>. Nevertheless, we require that there is a known ''excitation period'' <math>T>0</math> such that <math>t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mapsto F(t,x,\\dot x)</math> is <math>T</math>-periodic.\n\nA natural candidate set for the <math>T</math>-periodic solutions of the system equations is the Sobolev space <math>H^1_{\\rm per}((0,T),\\mathbb{C}^n)</math> of weakly differentiable functions on the interval <math>[0,T]</math> with periodic boundary conditions <math>x(0)=x(T)</math>.\nWe assume that the smoothness and the structure of <math>F</math> ensures that <math>F(t,x(t),\\dot x(t))</math> is [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]] for all <math>x\\in H^1_{\\rm per}((0,T),\\mathbb{C}^n)</math>.\n\nThe system <math>B:=\\left\\{\\psi_k \\mid k\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}</math> of harmonic functions <math>\\psi_k:=\\exp\\left(i k\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)</math> is a [[Schauder basis]] of <math>H^1_{\\rm per}((0,T),\\mathbb{C}^n)</math> and forms a [[Hilbert basis (linear programming)|:Hilbert basis]] of the [[Hilbert space]] <math>H:=L^2([0,T],\\mathbb{C})</math> of square-integrable functions. Therefore, each solution candidate <math>x\\in H^1_{\\rm per}((0,T),\\mathbb{C}^n)</math> can be represented by a Fourier-series <math>x(t)=\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat x_k \\exp\\left(i k\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right) </math> with Fourier-coefficients <math>\\hat x_k:=\\frac1T\\int_0^T\\psi^*_k(t)\\cdot x(t)dt</math> and the system equation is satisfied in the weak sense if for every base function <math>\\psi\\in B</math> the variational equation\n:<math>\n0=\\langle \\psi, F(t,x,\\dot x)\\rangle_H := \\frac 1 T \\int_0^T \\psi^*(t) \\cdot F(t,x,\\dot x) dt\n</math>\nis fulfilled. This variational equation represents an infinite sequence of scalar equations since it has to be tested for the infinite number of base functions <math>\\psi</math> in <math>B</math>.\n\nThe Galerkin approach to the harmonic balance is to project the candidate set as well as the test space for the variational equation to the finitely dimensional sub-space spanned by the finite base <math>B_N:=\\{\\psi_k \\mid k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\text{ with } -N \\leq k \\leq N\\}</math>.\n\nThis gives the finite-dimensional solution <math> x(t) = \\sum_{k=-N}^N \\hat x_k \\psi_k(t) = \\sum_{k=-N}^N \\hat x_k \\exp\\left(i k \\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)</math> and the finite set of equations\n:<math>\n0 = \\langle \\psi_k , F(t,x,\\dot x)\\rangle\\quad\\text{ with }k=-N,\\ldots,N\n</math>\nwhich can be solved numerically.\n\nIn the special context of electronics the algorithm starts with Kirchhoff's current law written in the [[frequency-domain]]. To increase the efficiency of the procedure, the circuit may be partitioned into its linear and nonlinear parts, since the linear part is readily described and calculated using [[nodal analysis]] directly in the frequency domain.\n\nFirst, an initial guess is made for the solution, then an iterative process continues:\n\n# Voltages <math>V</math> are used to calculate the currents of the linear part, <math>I_\\text{linear}</math> in the frequency domain.\n# Voltages <math>V</math> are then used to calculate the currents in the nonlinear part, <math>I_\\text{nonlinear}</math>. Since nonlinear devices are described in the time domain, the frequency-domain voltages <math>V</math> are transformed into the time domain, typically using inverse Fast Fourier transforms. The nonlinear devices are then evaluated using the time-domain voltage waveforms to produce their time-domain currents. The currents are then transformed back into the frequency domain.\n# According to [[Kirchhoff's current law|Kirchhoff's circuit laws]], the sum of the currents must be zero, <math>\\epsilon = I_\\text{linear} + I_\\text{nonlinear} = 0</math>.

These were the principal activities on the island until the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nAfter the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] rule [[Expedition of the Thousand|collapsed in 1860]], the Scottish industrialist and philanthropist, [[James Croesus Stevenson|James Stevenson]], bought the northern part of the island. He then built a [[villa]], reopened the local mines, and planted [[vineyard]]s for making [[Malmsey|Malmsey wine]]. Stevenson lived on Vulcano until the last major eruption on the island happened in 1888. This eruption lasted the better part of two years, by which time Stevenson had sold all of his property to the local populace. He never returned to the island. His villa is still intact.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Fumarola, Vulcano, Sicilia, Italia, 2015.gif|thumb|Alternating views of fumaroles]]\nThe volcanic activity in the region is largely the result of the northward-moving [[African Plate]] meeting the [[Eurasian Plate]]. There are three volcanic centres on the island:\n\n* At the southern end of the island are old [[stratovolcano]] cones, Monte Aria ({{convert|501|m|abbr=on}}), Monte Saraceno ({{convert|481|m|abbr=on}}), and Monte Luccia ({{convert|188|m|abbr=on}}), which have partially collapsed into the Il Piano [[Caldera]].\n* The most recently active centre is the Gran Cratere at the top of the Fossa cone, the cone having grown in the Lentia Caldera in the middle of the island, and has had at least nine major eruptions in the last 6,000 years.\n* At the north of the island is the islet, Vulcanello ({{convert|123|m|abbr=on}}), connected to Vulcano by an isthmus that may be flooded in bad weather. It emerged from the sea during an eruption in 183 BCE, as a separate islet. Occasional eruptions from its three cones with both pyroclastic flow deposits and lavas occurred from then until 1550, with the last eruption creating a narrow isthmus connecting it to Vulcano.\n\nVulcano has been quiet since the eruption of the Fossa cone on 3 August 1888 to 1890, which deposited about {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} of [[pyroclastic]] material on the summit. The style of eruption seen on the Fossa cone is called a [[Vulcanian eruption]], being the explosive emission of [[pyroclastic]] fragments of viscous [[magma]]s caused by the high viscosity preventing gases from escaping easily. This eruption of Vulcano was carefully documented at the time by [[Giuseppe Mercalli]]. Mercalli described the eruptions as \"...explosions sounding like a cannon at irregular intervals...\" As a result, [[vulcanian eruptions]] are based on his description. A typical vulcanian eruption can hurl blocks of solid material several hundreds of metres from the vent. Mercalli reported that blocks from the 1888\u20131890 eruption fell into the sea between Vulcano and Lipari, and several that had fallen on the island of Vulcano were photographed by him or his assistants.\n \nVolcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multicomponent gas analyzer system, which detects degassing of rising magmas before an eruption, improving [[prediction of volcanic activity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Chemical mapping of a fumarolic field: La Fossa Crater, Vulcano Island (Aeolian Islands, Italy) |doi=10.1029/2005GL023207 |bibcode=2005GeoRL..3213309A |volume=32 |issue= 13|pages=L13309 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters|last1 = Aiuppa|first1 = A.|last2= Federico|first2= C.|last3= Giudice|first3= G.|last4= Gurrieri|first4= S.|year=2005 }}</ref>\n\nA survey on local groundwater occurred during 1995\u20131997 showed temperatures up to 49\u201375&nbsp;\u00b0C, sodium sulfate-chloride chemical composition, and near neutral pH in the water wells closest to the slopes of the volcanic cone.

The island appeared in their [[Greek mythology|myths]] as the private foundry of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian god]] [[Hephaestus]], the patron of [[blacksmith]]s. Their myths noted two more of his foundries, at [[Mount Etna|Etna]] and [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]]. [[Strabo]] also mentions Thermessa as ''sacred place of Hephaestus'' (\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5), but it is not certain whether this was a third name for the island, or merely an [[adjective]].<ref>Strabo Geographica 1.2.10</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the Romans believed that Vulcano was the chimney of their god [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan's]] workshop and, therefore, named the island after him. According to the Roman myths, the island had grown due to his periodic clearing of cinders and ashes from his forge. They also explained earthquakes that either preceded or accompanied the explosions of ash as being due to Vulcan making weapons for their god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] for his armies to wage war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/PopCulture/mythology.html |title=CVO Menu \u2013 Volcanoes in Historical and Popular Culture |publisher=Vulcan.wr.usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Isola vulcano.jpg|thumb|center|x240px|View from the island of Lipari of the northern profile of Vulcano on which the low Fossa cone is visible (center), the green islet in the foreground is Vulcanello and the isthmus connecting Vulcanello to Vulcan is barely visible]]\n\n==Appearances in contemporary culture==\nThe motion picture [[Volcano (1950 film)|''Vulcano'']] (released in the U.S. as, ''Volcano'') was filmed on Vulcano and the nearby island of Salina between 1949 and 1950.\n\nAn asteroid is named for this island, [[4464 Vulcano]].<ref>[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/1996/MPC_19960305.pdf M.P.C. 26762 del 5 marzo 1996]</ref>\n\nThe island of Vulcano is featured in the ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' story arc of the manga ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' by [[Hirohiko Araki]], as the scene of the final clash between the protagonist [[Joseph Joestar]] and the antagonist Kars, leader of the Pillar Men.\n\nThe American attorney and writer, Richard Paul Roe, asserts that the play ''[[The Tempest]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] is set on the island of Vulcano,<ref>{{cite book | author=Richard Paul Roe | year=2011 | title=The Shakespeare Guide to Italy: Retracing the Bard's Unknown Travels | pages=265\u2013296 | publisher=HarperCollins | isbn=978-0-06-207427-0}}</ref> rather than the more authoritative interpretation that the setting was based on reports about Bermuda in the Americas and a hurricane encountered there.\n\nThe island is referred to by the Da Vinci character in the [[Star Trek: Voyager]] episode \"[[Concerning Flight]]\" while speaking to Tuvok, [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|an alien]] from a planet named Vulcan.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of volcanoes in Italy]]\n* [[List of islands of Italy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal | author=Ezio Giunta, dir. | title=Vulcano | journal=Estateolie 2005 The Essential Guide (English Version of Tourist Guidebook)| year=2005 | pages=80\u201387}}\n* {{cite gvp\n | vnum = 0101-05=\n | name = Vulcano\n | accessdate = 2008-12-18 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons and category|Vulcano (Isola)}}\n{{wikivoyage|Vulcano}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031210050426/http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/europe_west_asia/vulcano.html Photos and explanatory captions]\n\n{{Portalbar|Geography|Islands|Italy}}\n{{Aeolian Islands}}\n{{Magna Graecia}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Stratovolcanoes of Italy]]\n[[Category:Calderas of Italy]]\n[[Category:VEI-4 volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Aeolian Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Vulcano (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox mountain\n| name = Vulcano\n| photo = Isola vulcano.jpg\n| photo_caption = \n| elevation_m = 501\n| elevation_ref = \n| prominence_m = 501\n| prominence_ref = \n| map_image = Aeolian Islands map.png\n| map_caption = Vulcano and the Aeolian Islands\n| location = [[Aeolian Islands]], [[Italy]]\n| range = \n| coordinates = {{coord|38.399434|N|14.963955|E|format=dms|region:IT_type:isle|display=inline,title}}\n| topo = \n| type = [[Complex volcano|Complex]] [[stratovolcano]]es\n| age = \n| last_eruption = 1888 to 1890\n| first_ascent = \n| easiest_route = \n}}\n[[File:Aeolian Islands (17).jpg|thumb|The Gran Cratere]]\n'''Vulcano''' ({{lang-scn|Vurcanu}}) or '''Vulcan''' is a small volcanic island in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], about {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Sicily]] and located at the southernmost end of the seven [[Aeolian Islands]].<ref>[https://www.smartertravel.com/hidden-italian-islands-to-visit/ Vulcano, Sicily] 8 Hidden Italian Islands Where You Can Escape the Crowds.

A typical vulcanian eruption can hurl blocks of solid material several hundreds of metres from the vent. Mercalli reported that blocks from the 1888\u20131890 eruption fell into the sea between Vulcano and Lipari, and several that had fallen on the island of Vulcano were photographed by him or his assistants.\n \nVolcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multicomponent gas analyzer system, which detects degassing of rising magmas before an eruption, improving [[prediction of volcanic activity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Chemical mapping of a fumarolic field: La Fossa Crater, Vulcano Island (Aeolian Islands, Italy) |doi=10.1029/2005GL023207 |bibcode=2005GeoRL..3213309A |volume=32 |issue= 13|pages=L13309 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters|last1 = Aiuppa|first1 = A.|last2= Federico|first2= C.|last3= Giudice|first3= G.|last4= Gurrieri|first4= S.|year=2005 }}</ref>\n\nA survey on local groundwater occurred during 1995\u20131997 showed temperatures up to 49\u201375&nbsp;\u00b0C, sodium sulfate-chloride chemical composition, and near neutral pH in the water wells closest to the slopes of the volcanic cone.

In fact, the hyperthermophilic [[archaea]] ''[[Pyrococcus furiosus]]'' was described for the first time when it was isolated from sediments of this island by Gerhard Fiala and Karl Stetter.<ref>Fiala, G., & Stetter, K.

The island appeared in their [[Greek mythology|myths]] as the private foundry of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian god]] [[Hephaestus]], the patron of [[blacksmith]]s. Their myths noted two more of his foundries, at [[Mount Etna|Etna]] and [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]]. [[Strabo]] also mentions Thermessa as ''sacred place of Hephaestus'' (\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5), but it is not certain whether this was a third name for the island, or merely an [[adjective]].<ref>Strabo Geographica 1.2.10</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the Romans believed that Vulcano was the chimney of their god [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan's]] workshop and, therefore, named the island after him. According to the Roman myths, the island had grown due to his periodic clearing of cinders and ashes from his forge. They also explained earthquakes that either preceded or accompanied the explosions of ash as being due to Vulcan making weapons for their god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] for his armies to wage war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/PopCulture/mythology.html |title=CVO Menu \u2013 Volcanoes in Historical and Popular Culture |publisher=Vulcan.wr.usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Isola vulcano.jpg|thumb|center|x240px|View from the island of Lipari of the northern profile of Vulcano on which the low Fossa cone is visible (center), the green islet in the foreground is Vulcanello and the isthmus connecting Vulcanello to Vulcan is barely visible]]\n\n==Appearances in contemporary culture==\nThe motion picture [[Volcano (1950 film)|''Vulcano'']] (released in the U.S. as, ''Volcano'') was filmed on Vulcano and the nearby island of Salina between 1949 and 1950.\n\nAn asteroid is named for this island, [[4464 Vulcano]].<ref>[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/1996/MPC_19960305.pdf M.P.C. 26762 del 5 marzo 1996]</ref>\n\nThe island of Vulcano is featured in the ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' story arc of the manga ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' by [[Hirohiko Araki]], as the scene of the final clash between the protagonist [[Joseph Joestar]] and the antagonist Kars, leader of the Pillar Men.\n\nThe American attorney and writer, Richard Paul Roe, asserts that the play ''[[The Tempest]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] is set on the island of Vulcano,<ref>{{cite book | author=Richard Paul Roe | year=2011 | title=The Shakespeare Guide to Italy: Retracing the Bard's Unknown Travels | pages=265\u2013296 | publisher=HarperCollins | isbn=978-0-06-207427-0}}</ref> rather than the more authoritative interpretation that the setting was based on reports about Bermuda in the Americas and a hurricane encountered there.\n\nThe island is referred to by the Da Vinci character in the [[Star Trek: Voyager]] episode \"[[Concerning Flight]]\" while speaking to Tuvok, [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|an alien]] from a planet named Vulcan.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of volcanoes in Italy]]\n* [[List of islands of Italy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal | author=Ezio Giunta, dir. | title=Vulcano | journal=Estateolie 2005 The Essential Guide (English Version of Tourist Guidebook)| year=2005 | pages=80\u201387}}\n* {{cite gvp\n | vnum = 0101-05=\n | name = Vulcano\n | accessdate = 2008-12-18 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons and category|Vulcano (Isola)}}\n{{wikivoyage|Vulcano}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031210050426/http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/europe_west_asia/vulcano.html Photos and explanatory captions]\n\n{{Portalbar|Geography|Islands|Italy}}\n{{Aeolian Islands}}\n{{Magna Graecia}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Stratovolcanoes of Italy]]\n[[Category:Calderas of Italy]]\n[[Category:VEI-4 volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Aeolian Islands]]\n", "name_user": "146.241.225.108", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcano"}
