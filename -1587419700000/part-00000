She brought [[Arkan]] and his [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] to Bijeljina, and she continued to visit him after their activities in [[Bijeljina]] and the surrounding area [...] Radovan Karadzic [...] believed her to be more extreme than himself in every way. He thought that the Western protagonists who tried eliminate him at any cost would have an even greater problem with her [...] Radovan Karadzic believed that she would continue to occupy her patriotic positions until the end.

Based on his service during the war, his commander nominated him to [[West Point]], where he graduated in 1869, leading to service as an Army officer until his death.\n\n==Biography==\nJohn G. Bourke was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to [[irish people|Irish]] [[immigrant]] parents, Edward Joseph and Anna (Morton) Bourke.  His early education was extensive and included Latin, Greek, and Gaelic.  When the Civil War began, John Bourke was fourteen.  At sixteen he ran away and lied about his age; claiming to be nineteen, he enlisted in the [[15th Pennsylvania Cavalry|Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry]], in which he served until July 1865. He received a [[Medal of Honor]] for \"gallantry in action\" at the [[Battle of Stones River]], [[Tennessee]], in December 1862.<ref name=\"CMHcivAL\">{{Cite web|title=Medal of Honor recipients, Civil War (A\u2013L)|publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]]|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html|accessdate= 2009-04-04}}</ref> He later saw action at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]].\n\nHis commander, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George H. Thomas]], nominated Bourke for [[West Point]].  He was appointed cadet in the [[United States Military Academy]] on October 17, 1865. He graduated on June 15, 1869, and was assigned as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[3d Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Third U.S. Cavalry]]. He served with his [[regiment]] at [[Fort Craig]], [[New Mexico Territory]], from September 29, 1869 to February 19, 1870.\n\nHe served as an aide to [[George Crook|General George Crook]] in the [[Apache Wars]] from 1872 to 1883. As Crook's aide, Bourke had the opportunity to witness every facet of life in the [[Old West]]&mdash;the battles, wildlife, the internal squabbling among the military, the Indian Agency, settlers, and Native Americans.\n\n==Work==\n===Observer===\nBourke kept a diary in sequential journals throughout his adult life, documenting his observations in the West. He used these notes as the basis for his later monographs and writings.\n\nDuring his time as aide to General Crook during the Apache Wars, Bourke kept journals of his observations that were later published as ''[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33834478-on-the-border-with-crook On the Border with Crook].'' This book is considered one of the best firsthand accounts of frontier army life, as Bourke gives equal time to both the soldier and the Native American. Within it, Bourke describes the landscape, Army life on long campaigns, and his observations of the Native Americans. His passages recounts General Crook's meetings with Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and Geronimo as the General attempted to sign peace treaties and relocate tribes to reservations. Bourke provides considerable detail of towns and their citizens in the Southwest, specifically the Arizona Territory.\n\nIn 1881 Bourke was a guest of the Zuni Indians, where he was allowed to attend the ceremony of a Newekwe priest. His report of this experience was published in 1888 as ''The use of human odure and human urine in rites of a religious or semi religious character among various nations''.\n\nWhile in Washington he was on the board of the Anthropological Society.\n\n===''{{sic|hide=y|Scat|alogic}} Rites of All Nations''===\nSeveral subsequent studies led in 1891 to the completion of his major work ''{{sic|hide=y|Scat|alogic}} Rites of All Nations: A Dissertation upon the Employment of Excrementicious Remedial Agents in Religion, Therapeutics, Divination, Witch-Craft, Love-Philters, etc. in all part of the Globe''. This work was distributed only among selected specialists. A revised German translation by [[Friedrich Salomon Krauss|Friedrich S.

He was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions while a cavalryman in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Based on his service during the war, his commander nominated him to [[West Point]], where he graduated in 1869, leading to service as an Army officer until his death.\n\n==Biography==\nJohn G. Bourke was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to [[irish people|Irish]] [[immigrant]] parents, Edward Joseph and Anna (Morton) Bourke.  His early education was extensive and included Latin, Greek, and Gaelic.  When the Civil War began, John Bourke was fourteen.  At sixteen he ran away and lied about his age; claiming to be nineteen, he enlisted in the [[15th Pennsylvania Cavalry|Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry]], in which he served until July 1865. He received a [[Medal of Honor]] for \"gallantry in action\" at the [[Battle of Stones River]], [[Tennessee]], in December 1862.<ref name=\"CMHcivAL\">{{Cite web|title=Medal of Honor recipients, Civil War (A\u2013L)|publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]]|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html|accessdate= 2009-04-04}}</ref> He later saw action at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]].\n\nHis commander, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George H. Thomas]], nominated Bourke for [[West Point]].  He was appointed cadet in the [[United States Military Academy]] on October 17, 1865. He graduated on June 15, 1869, and was assigned as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[3d Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Third U.S. Cavalry]]. He served with his [[regiment]] at [[Fort Craig]], [[New Mexico Territory]], from September 29, 1869 to February 19, 1870.\n\nHe served as an aide to [[George Crook|General George Crook]] in the [[Apache Wars]] from 1872 to 1883. As Crook's aide, Bourke had the opportunity to witness every facet of life in the [[Old West]]&mdash;the battles, wildlife, the internal squabbling among the military, the Indian Agency, settlers, and Native Americans.\n\n==Work==\n===Observer===\nBourke kept a diary in sequential journals throughout his adult life, documenting his observations in the West. He used these notes as the basis for his later monographs and writings.\n\nDuring his time as aide to General Crook during the Apache Wars, Bourke kept journals of his observations that were later published as ''[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33834478-on-the-border-with-crook On the Border with Crook].'' This book is considered one of the best firsthand accounts of frontier army life, as Bourke gives equal time to both the soldier and the Native American. Within it, Bourke describes the landscape, Army life on long campaigns, and his observations of the Native Americans. His passages recounts General Crook's meetings with Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and Geronimo as the General attempted to sign peace treaties and relocate tribes to reservations. Bourke provides considerable detail of towns and their citizens in the Southwest, specifically the Arizona Territory.\n\nIn 1881 Bourke was a guest of the Zuni Indians, where he was allowed to attend the ceremony of a Newekwe priest. His report of this experience was published in 1888 as ''The use of human odure and human urine in rites of a religious or semi religious character among various nations''.\n\nWhile in Washington he was on the board of the Anthropological Society.\n\n===''{{sic|hide=y|Scat|alogic}} Rites of All Nations''===\nSeveral subsequent studies led in 1891 to the completion of his major work ''{{sic|hide=y|Scat|alogic}} Rites of All Nations: A Dissertation upon the Employment of Excrementicious Remedial Agents in Religion, Therapeutics, Divination, Witch-Craft, Love-Philters, etc. in all part of the Globe''. This work was distributed only among selected specialists. A revised German translation by [[Friedrich Salomon Krauss|Friedrich S. Krauss]] was published posthumously in 1913,<ref>''Der Unrat in Sitte, Brauch, Glauben und Gewohnheitrecht der V\u00f6lker, von John Gregory Bourke. Verdeutscht und neubearbeitet von Friedrich S.

Horbach of [[Omaha, Nebraska]], on July 25, 1883. They had three daughters together.\n\nBourke died in the Polyclinic Hospital in Philadelphia on June 8, 1896, and is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

They formed nearly one-fifth (18.9%) of the population of the [[Baku]] province and over one-quarter (25.3%) of the [[Quba Rayon|Kuba]] Province\u2014both on the [[Caspian Sea]].  Either through misrepresentation, data manipulation or simple assimilation, the Tat portion of the population of Azerbaijan has shrunk to insignificance, facing assimilation.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tats in azerbaijan 1890.png|thumb|300px|Distribution of the Tats in Azerbaijan (then [[Baku Governorate]], part of the [[Russian Empire]]) in 1886\u20131890.]]\nThe earliest mention of [[Persia]]ns in the [[Caucasus]] is found in the [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]]' account of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] expansion of 558\u2013330 BC, during which they annexed [[Transcaucasia]] (South Caucasus) as the X, XI, XVIII and XIX [[satrap]]ies of their empire.<ref>Herodotus.

[[Book of the Conquests of Lands]] ([[Kitab Futuh al-Buldan]])</ref>\n\nAfter the region had been conquered by [[Arabs]] (7th and 8th centuries) [[Islamization]] of the local population began.\n\nSince the 11th century [[Oghuz (tribe)|Oghuz]] tribes, led by [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] dynasts started to penetrate into the region. The gradual formation of the [[Azeris|Azeri]] people started. Apparently in this period the Turkic [[exonym]] ''Tat'' or ''Tati'', which designated settled farmers, was assigned to the South Caucasian dialect of the Persian language.<ref>[http://www.box.net/shared/khn970ksjr  B. Miller. Taty, ikh rasseleniye i govory (in Russian)]</ref>\n\nThe [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] conquered South Caucasus in the 1230s and the [[Ilkhanate]] state was founded in 1250s. Mongol domination lasted until 1360\u20131370, but that did not stop prominent poets and scientists to emerge.\n\nIn the end of the 14th century South Caucasus was invaded by [[Tamerlane]]. By the end of the 15th century the state of [[Shirvanshahs]] had obtained a considerable power, its diplomatic and economic ties had become stronger. In the middle of the 16th century the state of Shirvanshahs was eliminated and South Caucasus joined to [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] Iran almost completely.\n\nIn the late 18th century Russia actively started to contest the hegemony of Iran in the Caucasus.

This term relates to ''P\u0101rs\u012bk'', the [[Middle Persian]] self-designation of Persians, cf. Middle Persian ''P\u0101rs\u012bk ut Pahlav\u012bk'' \u2013 Persian and Parthian. During the [[New Persian]] language period the final consonant was lost and the ethnonym became ''P\u0101rs\u012b''.

Lahij is the largest Tat village (about 10.000). Its isolation has prevented local population from contacts with the outside world which has led their own isolated self-designation. A small community of the Lohijon, descendants of the 1910\u201320s migrants from Lahij, live in the village of Gombori in [[Kakheti]], in the east of Georgia.

As a result of the spread of Azeri Turkic the term ''Daghli'' has strongly come into use and the local Tats started to use it themselves.\n\nOn December 14, 1990, the ''Azeri'' cultural and educational society for studying and development of Tati language, history and ethnography was founded by the board of the Ministry of justice of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]. A primer and textbook of the Tat language together with literary and folklore pieces were published.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Persian settlers of South Caucasus have long interacted with the surrounding ethnic groups, exchanging elements of their cultures. Arts like [[carpet]]-making, hand-[[weaving]], metal manufacture, [[Repouss\u00e9 and chasing|embossing]] and [[incrustation]] are highly developed. The arts of ornamental design and miniature are also very popular.<ref>Great Soviet Encyclopedia, vol. 25 (in Russian)</ref>\n\nThere is a rich tradition of Tat spoken folk art. Genres of national poetry like [[Ruba'i|ruba\u2019is]], [[ghazal]]s, [[beit]]s are highly developed.

Traditional Tat female clothes are long shirt, wide trousers worn outside, slim line dress, outer unbuttoned dress, headscarf and \"Moroccan\" stockings. Male clothes are the [[Adyghe people|Circassian]] coat and high fur-cap.\n\n===Farming===\nTraditional occupations of the Tat population are agriculture, vegetable-growing, gardening and cattle-breeding. The main cultures are [[barley]], [[rye]], [[wheat]], [[millet]], [[sunflower]], [[maize]], [[potato]]es and [[pea]]s. Large [[vineyard]]s and fruit gardens are widespread. [[Sheep]], cows, [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]]s and rarely [[camel]]s are kept as domestic cattle.\n\nThe traditional one or two storeyed houses made of rectangular [[limestone]] blocks or river shingles and also have blank walls facing the street. The roof is flat with an opening for a stone fireplace chimney. The upper floor is used for habitation and living areas where the family gets together (kitchen etc.) were situated on the ground floor. Typically one of the living room walls has several niches for the storage of clothes, bed linens and sometimes crockery. Rooms were illuminated by lamps or by a skylight through an opening in the roof. House furniture consisted of low couches, carpeted floors and mattresses. Fireplaces, [[brazier]]s and ovens were used for heating the home in winter and cooking year round.\n\nThe property usually has a walled or fenced in yard and almost always has a garden. There is a [[veranda]] (''ayvan''), a paved drain or a small basin (''tendir''), covered cattle-pan, [[stable]] and hen-house.\n\n===Religion===\nOriginally the Persians were [[Zoroastrians]]. After they had been conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], Islam became widespread. Today the Tats are mainly Shia Muslims, with a sizeable minority of Sunni Muslims and Jews.\n\n==Other Tat-speaking ethnic groups==\nThe Tat language was widely spread in Eastern South Caucasus. Up to the 20th century it was also used by non-Muslim groups: [[Mountain Jews]], part of the [[Armenians]] and the [[Udins]].<ref>\u0130smay\u0131lov R. Az\u0259rbaycan tarixi (in Azeri Turkic)</ref> This has led some to the idea that Muslim Tats, Tat-speaking Mountain Jews and Tat-speaking Christian Armenians are one nation, practicing three different religions.\n\n===Tats and Mountain Jews===\n{{Main|Mountain Jews}}\nThe \"Mountain Jews\" belong to the community of Persian-speaking Jews. Some groups of this community live in Iran, Israel (especially), North America (especially), Europe, and Central Asia ([[Bukharan Jews]]). The Jews of Central Asia were classified \"Mountain Jews\" only in 19th-century official Russian documentation. The Mountain Jews call themselves ''Juhuro''.\n\nIn the year 1888 A. Sh. Anisimov showed the closeness of language of the Mountain Jews and the Tats. In his work ''Caucasian Jews-Mountaineers'' he came to the conclusion that the Mountain Jews were representatives of the Iranian family of the Tats, which had adopted Judaism in Iran and later moved to South Caucasus. The ideas of Anisimov were supported during the Soviet period: the popularization of the idea of the Mountain Jews' Tat origin started in the 1930s. Through efforts of several Mountain Jews, closely connected with the regime, the idea of mountain Jews being not really Jews at all but judaized Tats became widely spread. Some Mountain Jews started to register themselves as Tats because of secret pressure from the authorities.\n\nAs a result of this the words Tat and Mountain Jew became almost synonymous. The term \"Tat\" was used in research literature as the second or even first name for Mountain Jews. This caused the whole cultural heritage (literature, theatre, music) created by Mountain Jews during the Soviet period to be attributed to the Tats.\n\nComparing physic-anthropological characteristics of Tats and Mountain Jews together with information about their languages suggests no signs of ethnic unity between these two nations.\n\nLike most \"Jewish\" languages, the grammatical structure of [[Juhuri language|Juhuri]] retains archaic features of the language it is derived from. At the same time all of these languages are satiated with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words. The loanwords from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and Hebrew in Juhuri include words not directly connected with Judaic rituals (e.g. ''zoft'' resin, ''nokumi'' envy, ''ghuf'' body, ''keton'' linen, etc.) Some syntactical features of Juhuri have are ones typical for Hebrew.\n\nThe physical-anthropological types of Tats and Mountain Jews are also dissimilar.\n\nIn 1913 the anthropologist K.M. Kurdov carried out measurements of a large group of Tat population of Lahij village and revealed fundamental differences<ref>(cephalic index average value is 79,21)</ref> of their physical-anthropological type from the Mountain Jews. Measurements of Tats and Mountain Jews were also made by some other researchers.<ref>Cephalic index average value for the Tats of The Republic of Azerbaijan differs from 77,13 to 79,21, for Mountain Jews of Daghestan and The Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 form 86,1 \u0434\u043e 87,433.</ref> [[Cephalic index]] measurements have showed that while for Tats [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mesocephalic mesocephalia] and [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dolichocephalic dolichocephalia] are typical, extreme [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brachycephalic brachycephalia] is typical for Mountain Jews.

It was suggested that a part of the Persians of Eastern South Caucasus had adopted [[Armenian Christianity]], but this did not take into consideration the fact that those citizens identify themselves as Armenians, because conversion to religion is strongly attached to ethnical identity in eastern cultures.<ref>[http://www.karabah88.ru/history/adr/21.html  \u0410. \u0410\u043a\u043e\u043f\u044f\u043d. \u0423\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u044f\u043d \u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 20-\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304020249/http://www.karabah88.ru/history/adr/21.html |date=2009-03-04 }} ''A.

There are also Armenian affricates (\u056e, \u0581, \u0571) in words of Iranian origin, which do not exist in the Tat language. This can only be explained by Armenian influence.\n\nAlthough they have lost their language these Armenians managed to preserve their national identity. It has a distinct \"us versus them\" dichotomy, \"Hay\" (us) to \"Muslims\" (Tats and Azeri together).\n\n==Tat people of northern Iran==\n{{main|Tat people (Iran)}}\nStarting from the Middle Ages, the term ''Tati'' was used not only for the Caucasus but also for northern Iran, where it was extended to almost all of the local Iranian languages except Persian and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].\n\nCurrently the term ''Tati'' and ''Tati language'' is used to refer to a particular group of north-western Iranian dialects (Chali, Danesfani, Hiaraji, Hoznini, Esfarvarini, Takestani, Sagzabadi, Ebrahimabadi, Eshtehardi, Hoini, Kajali, Shahroudi, Harzani) in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], as well as south of it in the provinces of [[Qazv\u012bn Province|Qazvin]] and [[Zanjan Province|Zanjan]].<ref>''\u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430. \u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438. \u0441. 106\u2013107. \u041c., \u0418\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043a, 1999 \u0433.''</ref> These dialects have a certain affinity to the [[Talysh language]] as one of the descendants of the [[Old Azari language]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=3003 \u062a\u0627\u062a] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306083525/http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=3003 |date=2012-03-06 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tati language (Iran)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.shirvan.info/ Parsis of Transcaucasia] {{in lang|ru}}\n\n{{Peoples of the Caucasus}}\n{{Ethnic groups in Azerbaijan}}\n{{Ethnic groups in Russia}}\n{{Iranian peoples}}\n{{European Muslims}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Azerbaijan]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Dagestan]]\n[[Category:Iranian ethnic groups]]\n[[Category:Iranian peoples in the Caucasus]]\n[[Category:Muslim communities of Russia]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Peoples of the Caucasus]]\n[[Category:Persian people]]\n[[Category:Persian communities outside Iran]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group=Tat people\n|image=\n|pop=10,900\u201322,041\n|popplace=[[Azerbaijan]], [[Dagestan]] ([[Russia]])\n|langs=[[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat language]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]\n|rels= [[Islam]]\n|related = Other [[Iranian peoples]], [[Armeno-Tats]]\n}}\nThe '''Tat people''' (also: ''Tati'', ''Parsi'', ''Daghli'', ''Lohijon'') are an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] people, presently living within [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Russia]] (mainly Southern [[Dagestan]]).

This term relates to ''P\u0101rs\u012bk'', the [[Middle Persian]] self-designation of Persians, cf. Middle Persian ''P\u0101rs\u012bk ut Pahlav\u012bk'' \u2013 Persian and Parthian. During the [[New Persian]] language period the final consonant was lost and the ethnonym became ''P\u0101rs\u012b''.

Lahij is the largest Tat village (about 10.000). Its isolation has prevented local population from contacts with the outside world which has led their own isolated self-designation. A small community of the Lohijon, descendants of the 1910\u201320s migrants from Lahij, live in the village of Gombori in [[Kakheti]], in the east of Georgia.

As a result of the spread of Azeri Turkic the term ''Daghli'' has strongly come into use and the local Tats started to use it themselves.\n\nOn December 14, 1990, the ''Azeri'' cultural and educational society for studying and development of Tati language, history and ethnography was founded by the board of the Ministry of justice of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]. A primer and textbook of the Tat language together with literary and folklore pieces were published.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Persian settlers of South Caucasus have long interacted with the surrounding ethnic groups, exchanging elements of their cultures. Arts like [[carpet]]-making, hand-[[weaving]], metal manufacture, [[Repouss\u00e9 and chasing|embossing]] and [[incrustation]] are highly developed. The arts of ornamental design and miniature are also very popular.<ref>Great Soviet Encyclopedia, vol. 25 (in Russian)</ref>\n\nThere is a rich tradition of Tat spoken folk art. Genres of national poetry like [[Ruba'i|ruba\u2019is]], [[ghazal]]s, [[beit]]s are highly developed.

Traditional Tat female clothes are long shirt, wide trousers worn outside, slim line dress, outer unbuttoned dress, headscarf and \"Moroccan\" stockings. Male clothes are the [[Adyghe people|Circassian]] coat and high fur-cap.\n\n===Farming===\nTraditional occupations of the Tat population are agriculture, vegetable-growing, gardening and cattle-breeding. The main cultures are [[barley]], [[rye]], [[wheat]], [[millet]], [[sunflower]], [[maize]], [[potato]]es and [[pea]]s. Large [[vineyard]]s and fruit gardens are widespread. [[Sheep]], cows, [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]]s and rarely [[camel]]s are kept as domestic cattle.\n\nThe traditional one or two storeyed houses made of rectangular [[limestone]] blocks or river shingles and also have blank walls facing the street. The roof is flat with an opening for a stone fireplace chimney. The upper floor is used for habitation and living areas where the family gets together (kitchen etc.) were situated on the ground floor. Typically one of the living room walls has several niches for the storage of clothes, bed linens and sometimes crockery. Rooms were illuminated by lamps or by a skylight through an opening in the roof. House furniture consisted of low couches, carpeted floors and mattresses. Fireplaces, [[brazier]]s and ovens were used for heating the home in winter and cooking year round.\n\nThe property usually has a walled or fenced in yard and almost always has a garden. There is a [[veranda]] (''ayvan''), a paved drain or a small basin (''tendir''), covered cattle-pan, [[stable]] and hen-house.\n\n===Religion===\nOriginally the Persians were [[Zoroastrians]]. After they had been conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], Islam became widespread. Today the Tats are mainly Shia Muslims, with a sizeable minority of Sunni Muslims and Jews.\n\n==Other Tat-speaking ethnic groups==\nThe Tat language was widely spread in Eastern South Caucasus. Up to the 20th century it was also used by non-Muslim groups: [[Mountain Jews]], part of the [[Armenians]] and the [[Udins]].<ref>\u0130smay\u0131lov R. Az\u0259rbaycan tarixi (in Azeri Turkic)</ref> This has led some to the idea that Muslim Tats, Tat-speaking Mountain Jews and Tat-speaking Christian Armenians are one nation, practicing three different religions.\n\n===Tats and Mountain Jews===\n{{Main|Mountain Jews}}\nThe \"Mountain Jews\" belong to the community of Persian-speaking Jews. Some groups of this community live in Iran, Israel (especially), North America (especially), Europe, and Central Asia ([[Bukharan Jews]]). The Jews of Central Asia were classified \"Mountain Jews\" only in 19th-century official Russian documentation. The Mountain Jews call themselves ''Juhuro''.\n\nIn the year 1888 A. Sh. Anisimov showed the closeness of language of the Mountain Jews and the Tats. In his work ''Caucasian Jews-Mountaineers'' he came to the conclusion that the Mountain Jews were representatives of the Iranian family of the Tats, which had adopted Judaism in Iran and later moved to South Caucasus. The ideas of Anisimov were supported during the Soviet period: the popularization of the idea of the Mountain Jews' Tat origin started in the 1930s. Through efforts of several Mountain Jews, closely connected with the regime, the idea of mountain Jews being not really Jews at all but judaized Tats became widely spread. Some Mountain Jews started to register themselves as Tats because of secret pressure from the authorities.\n\nAs a result of this the words Tat and Mountain Jew became almost synonymous. The term \"Tat\" was used in research literature as the second or even first name for Mountain Jews. This caused the whole cultural heritage (literature, theatre, music) created by Mountain Jews during the Soviet period to be attributed to the Tats.\n\nComparing physic-anthropological characteristics of Tats and Mountain Jews together with information about their languages suggests no signs of ethnic unity between these two nations.\n\nLike most \"Jewish\" languages, the grammatical structure of [[Juhuri language|Juhuri]] retains archaic features of the language it is derived from. At the same time all of these languages are satiated with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words. The loanwords from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and Hebrew in Juhuri include words not directly connected with Judaic rituals (e.g. ''zoft'' resin, ''nokumi'' envy, ''ghuf'' body, ''keton'' linen, etc.) Some syntactical features of Juhuri have are ones typical for Hebrew.\n\nThe physical-anthropological types of Tats and Mountain Jews are also dissimilar.\n\nIn 1913 the anthropologist K.M. Kurdov carried out measurements of a large group of Tat population of Lahij village and revealed fundamental differences<ref>(cephalic index average value is 79,21)</ref> of their physical-anthropological type from the Mountain Jews. Measurements of Tats and Mountain Jews were also made by some other researchers.<ref>Cephalic index average value for the Tats of The Republic of Azerbaijan differs from 77,13 to 79,21, for Mountain Jews of Daghestan and The Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 form 86,1 \u0434\u043e 87,433.</ref> [[Cephalic index]] measurements have showed that while for Tats [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mesocephalic mesocephalia] and [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dolichocephalic dolichocephalia] are typical, extreme [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brachycephalic brachycephalia] is typical for Mountain Jews.

It was suggested that a part of the Persians of Eastern South Caucasus had adopted [[Armenian Christianity]], but this did not take into consideration the fact that those citizens identify themselves as Armenians, because conversion to religion is strongly attached to ethnical identity in eastern cultures.<ref>[http://www.karabah88.ru/history/adr/21.html  \u0410. \u0410\u043a\u043e\u043f\u044f\u043d. \u0423\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u044f\u043d \u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 20-\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304020249/http://www.karabah88.ru/history/adr/21.html |date=2009-03-04 }} ''A.

There are also Armenian affricates (\u056e, \u0581, \u0571) in words of Iranian origin, which do not exist in the Tat language. This can only be explained by Armenian influence.\n\nAlthough they have lost their language these Armenians managed to preserve their national identity.

AnneFrank.org, 31 March 2015</ref> was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German]]-[[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch]] diarist of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin. One of the most discussed Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]], she gained fame posthumously with the publication of ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' (originally {{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}} in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; {{lang-en|The Secret Annex}}), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] in [[World War II]]. It is one of the world's best known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.\n\nBorn in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], she lived most of her life in or near [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], having moved there with her family at the age of four and a half when the [[Nazi]]s gained control over Germany. Born a German national, she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became [[statelessness|stateless]]. By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As [[History of the Jews during World War II|persecutions of the Jewish population]] increased in July 1942, the Franks went into hiding in some [[Anne Frank House|concealed rooms]] behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father, [[Otto Frank]], worked. From then until the family's arrest by the [[Gestapo]] in August 1944, she kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly. Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. In October or November 1944, Anne and her sister, [[Margot Frank|Margot]], were transferred from [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where they died (probably of [[typhus]]) a few months later. They were originally estimated by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death, but research by the [[Anne Frank House]] in 2015 suggests it is more likely that they died in February.<ref name=\"DeathResearch\" />\n\nOtto, the only survivor of the Franks, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved by his secretary, [[Miep Gies]], and his efforts led to its publication in 1947.

This hiding place became known as the ''Achterhuis'' (translated into \"Secret Annex\" in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland. The need for secrecy forced them to leave behind Anne's cat, Moortje. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, they walked several kilometres from their home.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=105\u2013106}} The door to the ''Achterhuis'' was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|pp=45, 107\u2013187}}\n\n[[Victor Kugler]], [[Johannes Kleiman]], [[Miep Gies]], and [[Bep Voskuijl]] were the only employees who knew of the people in hiding.

The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, they kept the occupants informed of war news and political developments. They catered to all of their needs, ensured their safety, and supplied them with food, a task that grew more difficult with the passage of time. Frank wrote of their dedication and of their efforts to boost morale within the household during the most dangerous of times.

Frank wrote of her pleasure at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, she found him to be insufferable and resented his intrusion,{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=120\u201321}} and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom she regarded as foolish. She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food they consumed.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=117}} Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance.

She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, \"I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999||p=203}} The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, \"Margot's much nicer&nbsp;...

With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=204}}\n\nThe Frank sisters each hoped to return to school as soon as they were able, and continued with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a [[shorthand]] [[correspondence course|course by correspondence]] in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited (after March 1944) her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, dreams and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=194}}\n\nFrank aspired to become a journalist, writing in her diary on Wednesday, 5 April 1944:\n{{quote\n| I finally realized that I must do my schoolwork to keep from being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, because that's what I want!

Two days later they were transported to the [[Westerbork transit camp]], through which by that time more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, they were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for [[hard labor|hard labour]].{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=233}}\n\nVictor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman were arrested and jailed at the penal camp for enemies of the regime at [[Amersfoort]].

They returned to the ''Achterhuis'' the following day, and found Anne's papers strewn on the floor. They collected them, as well as several family photograph albums, and Gies resolved to return them to Anne after the war. On 7 August 1944, Gies attempted to facilitate the release of the prisoners by confronting Silberbauer and offering him money to intervene, but he refused.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=279}}\n\nAlthough there have been persistent claims of betrayal by an informant, the source of the information that led the authorities to raid the ''Achterhuis'' has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by [[Carol Ann Lee]], biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer [[Melissa M\u00fcller]]. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration.

Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549\u2014including all children younger than 15\u2014were sent directly to the [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]]. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the ''Achterhuis'' had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|pp=246\u2013247}}\n\nWith the other women and girls not selected for immediate death, Frank was forced to strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed with an identifying number]] on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread [[Rationing|rations]] for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by [[scabies]]. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which was in a state of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|pp=248\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Anne frank memorial bergen belsen.jpg|thumb|alt=A Memorial for Margot and Anne Frank shows a Star of David and the full names, birthdates, and year of death of each of the sisters, in white lettering on a large black stone.

Bloeme Evers-Emden was scheduled to be on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going because she had developed scabies, and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them.{{sfn|Laeredt|1995}}\n\nOn 28 October, selections began for women to be relocated to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. More than 8,000 women, including Anne and Margot Frank, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. Edith Frank was left behind and died of starvation.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=252}} Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly. Frank was briefly reunited with two friends, [[Hanneli Goslar]] and [[Nanette Blitz]], who were confined in another section of the camp. Goslar and Blitz survived the war, and discussed the brief conversations they had conducted with Frank through a fence. Blitz described Anne as bald, emaciated, and shivering. Goslar noted Auguste van Pels was with Anne and Margot Frank, and was caring for Margot, who was severely ill. Neither of them saw Margot, as she was too weak to leave her bunk. Anne told Blitz and Goslar she believed her parents were dead, and for that reason she did not wish to live any longer. Goslar later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=255}}\n\nIn early 1945, a [[typhus]] epidemic spread through the camp, killing 17,000 prisoners.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=261}} Other diseases, including [[typhoid fever]], were rampant.{{sfn|Gedenkst\u00e4tten Bergen-Belsen}} Due to these chaotic conditions, it is not possible to determine the specific cause of Anne's death; however, there is evidence that she died from the epidemic.

An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the Netherlands, with many people aided by the [[Dutch underground]].

After the war ended, he returned to Amsterdam in June 1945 where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family. He learned of the death of his wife, Edith, in Auschwitz, but remained hopeful that his daughters had survived. After several weeks, he discovered Margot and Anne had also died. He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters' friends and learned many had been murdered. [[Sanne Ledermann]], often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara, a close friend of Margot's, had survived.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=211\u2013212}} Several of the Frank sisters' school friends had survived, as had the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank, as they had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2013|pp=39, 48\u201349}}\n\n== ''The Diary of a Young Girl'' ==\n{{main|The Diary of a Young Girl}}\n\n=== Publication ===\n[[File:Het Achterhuis (Diary of Anne Frank) - front cover, first edition.jpg|thumb|upright|{{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}}, the first Dutch edition of Anne Frank's diary, published in 1947, later translated into English as ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]''.]]\n\nIn July 1945, after the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] confirmed the deaths of the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw for the first time the more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, \"For me it was a revelation&nbsp;... I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings&nbsp;... She had kept all these feelings to herself\".{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=216}} Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=74}}\n\nFrank's diary began as a private expression of her thoughts; she wrote several times that she would never allow anyone to read it. She candidly described her life, her family and companions, and their situation, while beginning to recognize her ambition to write fiction for publication. In March 1944, she heard a radio broadcast by [[Gerrit Bolkestein]]\u2014a member of the Dutch [[government in exile]], based in [[London]]\u2014who said that when the war ended, he would create a public record of the Dutch people's oppression under German occupation.{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=242}} He mentioned the publication of letters and diaries, and Frank decided to submit her work when the time came. She began editing her writing, removing some sections and rewriting others, with a view to publication. Her original notebook was supplemented by additional notebooks and loose-leaf sheets of paper. She created pseudonyms for the members of the household and the helpers. The van Pels family became Hermann, Petronella, and Peter van Daan, and Fritz Pfeffer became Albert D\u00fcssell. In this edited version, she addressed each entry to \"Kitty,\" a fictional character in [[Cissy van Marxveldt]]'s {{lang|nl|[[Joop ter Heul]]}} novels that Anne enjoyed reading. Otto Frank used her original diary, known as \"version A\", and her edited version, known as \"version B\", to produce the first version for publication. Although he restored the true identities of his own family, he retained all of the other pseudonyms.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=75}}\n\nOtto Frank gave the diary to the historian [[Annie Romein-Verschoor]], who tried unsuccessfully to have it published. She then gave it to her husband [[Jan Romein]], who wrote an article about it, titled {{lang|nl|\"Kinderstem\"}} (\"A Child's Voice\"), which was published in the newspaper {{lang|nl|[[Het Parool]]}} on 3 April 1946. He wrote that the diary \"stammered out in a child's voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] put together.\"{{sfn|Romein}} His article attracted attention from publishers, and the diary was published in the Netherlands as {{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}} (''The Annex'') in 1947,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=223}} followed by five more printings by 1950.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=80}}\n\nIt was first published in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, was first published in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, Anne Frank quickly was identified as an important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=225}}\n\nA play by [[Albert Hackett|Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett]] based upon the diary premiered in New York City on 5 October 1955, and later won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. It was followed by the film ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959), which was a critical and commercial success. Biographer [[Melissa M\u00fcller]] later wrote that the dramatization had \"contributed greatly to the romanticizing, sentimentalizing and universalizing of Anne's story.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=276}} Over the years the popularity of the diary grew, and in many schools, particularly in the United States, it was included as part of the curriculum, introducing Anne Frank to new generations of readers.{{sfn|Prose|2009|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nIn 1986 the [[Dutch Institute for War Documentation]] published the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary.

The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother.{{sfn|Blumenthal|1998}} Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001.

Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist [[Meyer Levin]] commended Frank for \"sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel\",{{sfn|Levin|1952}} and was so impressed by the quality of her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication.{{sfn|Michaelsen|1997}} Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote about in his autobiography ''The Obsession''. The poet [[John Berryman]] called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the \"conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty\".{{sfn|Berryman|2000|p=78}}\n\nIn her introduction to the diary's first American edition, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] described it as \"one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings that I have ever read.\"{{sfn|Rosow|1996|p=156}} [[John F.

Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we would not be able to live.\"{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}} In her closing message in M\u00fcller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that \"Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust\", writing: \"Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives&nbsp;... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=305}}\n\nOtto Frank spent the remainder of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, \"It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed.\" He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, \"he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally\".{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=222\u201333}} Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the [[Nuremberg Trials]], because \"people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this.\"{{sfn|Stichting, \"Simon Wiesenthal\"}}\n\nIn June 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a special edition titled \"[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]\". Anne Frank was selected as one of the \"Heroes & Icons\", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, \"The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world\u2014the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and hope for the future of human beings.\" He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, \"The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition.\"{{sfn|Rosenblatt|1999}}\n\n=== Denials of authenticity and legal action ===\nAfter the diary became widely known in the late 1950s, various allegations against the veracity of the diary and/or its contents appeared, with the earliest published criticisms occurring in Sweden and Norway.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=241}}\n\nIn 1957, ''{{lang|sv|Fria ord}}'' (\"Free Words\"), the magazine of the Swedish [[neofascist]] organization [[National League of Sweden]], published an article by Danish author and critic Harald Nielsen, who had previously written antisemitic articles about the Danish-Jewish author [[Georg Brandes]].{{sfn|Frank|Holmer|2005|p=340}} Among other things, the article claimed that the diary had been written by Meyer Levin.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nIn 1958, at a performance of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' in Vienna, [[Simon Wiesenthal]] was challenged by a group of protesters who asserted that Anne Frank had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence by finding the man who had arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for [[Karl Silberbauer]] and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=241\u2013246}}\n\nIn 1959, Otto Frank took legal action in [[L\u00fcbeck]] against Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former [[Hitler Youth]] member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\". The complaint was extended to include Heinrich Buddegerg, who wrote a letter in support of Stielau, which was published in a L\u00fcbeck newspaper. The court examined the diary in 1960 and authenticated the handwriting as matching that in letters known to have been written by Anne Frank. They declared the diary to be genuine. Stielau recanted his earlier statement, and Otto Frank did not pursue the case any further.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nIn 1976, Otto Frank took action against Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\". The judge ruled that if Roth  was to publish any further statements he would be subjected to a fine of 500,000 German marks and a six-month jail sentence. Roth appealed against the court's decision. He died in 1978, and after a year his appeal was rejected.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nOtto Frank mounted a lawsuit in 1976 against Ernst R\u00f6mer, who distributed a pamphlet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie\". When a man named Edgar Geiss distributed the same pamphlet in the courtroom, he too was prosecuted. R\u00f6mer was fined 1,500 Deutschmarks,{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}} and Geiss was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The sentence of Geiss was reduced on appeal, and the case was eventually dropped following a subsequent appeal because the time limit for filing a libel case had expired.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Legal rulings\"}}\n\nWith Otto Frank's death in 1980, the original diary, including letters and loose sheets, was willed to the Dutch Institute for War Documentation,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=233}} which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986. They examined the handwriting against known examples and found that they matched. They determined that the paper, glue, and ink were readily available during the time the diary was said to have been written. They concluded that the diary is authentic, and their findings were published in what has become known as the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary.{{sfn|Prose|2009|pp=247\u2013248}} In 1990, the Hamburg Regional Court confirmed the diary's authenticity.{{sfn|Frank|1989|p=102}}\n\nIn 1991, [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] [[Robert Faurisson]] and [[Siegfried Verbeke]] produced a booklet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank: A Critical Approach\", in which they revived the allegation that Otto Frank wrote the diary. Purported evidence, as before, included several contradictions in the diary, that the prose style and handwriting were not those of a teenager, and that hiding in the ''Achterhuis'' would have been impossible.{{sfn|Faurisson|2000}}{{sfn|Barnouw|Van Der Stroom|2003|pp=93\u201396}} In 1993, the [[Anne Frank House]] in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel filed a civil lawsuit to prohibit further distribution of Faurisson and Verbeke's booklet in the Netherlands. In 1998, the Amsterdam District Court ruled in favour of the claimants, forbade any further denial of the authenticity of the diary and unsolicited distribution of publications to that effect, and imposed a penalty of 25,000 guilders per infringement.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Ten Questions\"}}\n\n=== Unabridged version ===\n<!-- DO NOT INSERT MATERIAL THAT IS NOT IN THE O'TOOLE SOURCE WITHOUT ADDING A RELIABLE THIRD PARTY SOURCE THAT *DOES* SUPPORT IT! --> \nAn unabridged edition of Anne Frank's work was published in 1995.{{sfn|Boretz|1995}} This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage that had previously been edited out by Otto Frank.{{sfn|O'Toole|2013}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:AnneFrankMuseumLine.jpg|thumb|People waiting in line in front of the Anne Frank House entrance in Amsterdam]]\n\nOn 3 May 1957, a group of citizens, including Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting in an effort to rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The [[Anne Frank House]] opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the ''{{lang|nl|Achterhuis}}'', all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], all now protected behind [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic glass]]. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.{{sfn|Anne Frank House Annual Report|2005}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank M01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=A bronze statue of a smiling Anne Frank, wearing a short dress and standing with her arms behind her back, sits upon a stone [[plinth]] with a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] reading \"Anne Frank 1929\u20131945\". The statue is in a small square, and behind it is a brick building with two large windows, and a bicycle. The statue stands between the two windows.|Statue of Anne Frank, by [[Mari Andriessen]], outside the [[Westerkerk]] in Amsterdam]]\n\nIn 1963, Otto Frank and his second wife, [[Elfriede Geiringer-Markovits]], set up the Anne Frank Fonds as a [[Charitable organization|charitable foundation]], based in [[Basel]], Switzerland. Upon his death, Otto willed the diary's copyright to the Fonds, on the provision that the first 80,000 [[Swiss franc]]s in income each year was to be distributed to his heirs. The Anne Frank Fonds represents the Frank family. It administers the rights, \u00abinter alia\u00bb, to the writings of Anne and Otto Frank and to the letters of the Frank family. It is the owner of the rights to translations, editions, compilations, and authorised books about Anne Frank and her family. The Fonds aims to educate young people against racism, and loaned some of Anne Frank's papers to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington for an exhibition in 2003. Its annual report that year outlined its efforts to contribute on a global level, with support for projects in Germany, Israel, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.{{sfn|Anne Frank-Fonds Annual Report|2003}}\n\nIn 1997, the [[Anne Frank Educational Centre (Frankfurt)|Anne Frank Educational Centre]] (''{{lang|de|Jugendbegegnungsst\u00e4tte Anne Frank}}'') was opened in the [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] neighbourhood of Frankfurt, where Frank lived with her family until 1934. The Centre is \"a place where both young people and adults can learn about the history of National Socialism and discuss its relevance to today.\"{{sfn|Anne Frank Educational Centre website|2012}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank Schule Rivierenbuurt.jpg|thumb|upright|The {{ill|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank|lt=Anne Frank School|nl|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank}} in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Annefranktree edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A large tree, devoid of foliage|The Anne Frank tree in the garden behind the Anne Frank House]]\n\nThe Merwedeplein apartment, where the Frank family lived from 1933 until 1942, remained privately owned until the 2000s. After becoming the focus of a television documentary, the building\u2014in a serious state of disrepair\u2014was purchased by a Dutch housing corporation. Aided by photographs taken by the Frank family and descriptions in letters written by Anne Frank, it was restored to its 1930s appearance. Teresien da Silva of the Anne Frank House and Frank's cousin, Bernhard \"Buddy\" Elias, contributed to the restoration project. It opened in 2005. Each year, a writer who is unable to write freely in his or her own country is selected for a year-long tenancy, during which they reside and write in the apartment. The first writer selected was the Algerian novelist and poet El-Mahdi Acherchour.{{sfn|Anne Frank House Annual Report|2005}}\n\nAnne Frank is included as one of the topics in the [[Canon of Dutch History]], which was prepared by a committee headed by [[Frits van Oostrom]] and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, [[Maria van der Hoeven]], in 2006; the Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her as one of the topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007.\n\nIn June 2007, \"Buddy\" Elias donated some 25,000 family documents to the Anne Frank House. Among the artefacts are Frank family photographs taken in Germany and the Netherlands and the letter Otto Frank sent his mother in 1945, informing her that his wife and daughters had perished in Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|Max|2007}}\n\nIn November 2007, the [[Anne Frank tree]]\u2014by then infected with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk\u2014was scheduled to be cut down to prevent it from falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist [[Arnold Heertje]] said about the tree: \"This is not just any tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews.\"{{sfn|Thomasson|Balmforth|2008}} The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the [[Aesculus|horse chestnut]], which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution.{{sfn|Kreijger|2007}} The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years.{{sfn|Thomasson|Balmforth|2008}} However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree.{{sfn|''Radio Netherlands''|2010}} Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]. Saplings were also sent to a school in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], the scene of a desegregation battle; [[Liberty Park (Manhattan)]], which honours victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]; and other sites in the United States.{{sfn|Engel|2013}} Another horse chestnut tree honoring Frank was planted in 2010 at [[Kelly Ingram Park]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article130975789.html|title=Man wants Anne Frank story shared through national monument|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|work=[[News & Observer]]|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, several [[List of films about Anne Frank|films about Anne Frank]] appeared. Her life and writings have inspired a diverse group of artists and social commentators to make [[Cultural depictions of Anne Frank|reference to her]] in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include ''The Anne Frank Ballet'' by [[Adam Darius]],{{sfn|Stevens|1989}} first performed in 1959, and the choral work ''[[Annelies (Whitbourn)|Annelies]]'', first performed in 2005.{{sfn|Chester and Novello}} The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the Anne Frank House.{{sfn|Gabbatt|2009}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank USA.JPG|thumb|Anne Frank Center in New York]]\n\nIn 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named Anne Frank among the heroes and icons of the 20th century on their list ''The Most Important People of the Century'', stating: \"With a diary kept in a secret attic, she braved the Nazis and lent a searing voice to the fight for human dignity\".{{sfn|Rosenblatt|1999}} [[Philip Roth]] called her the \"lost little daughter\" of [[Franz Kafka]].{{sfn|McCrum|2010}} [[Madame Tussauds]] wax museum unveiled an exhibit featuring a likeness of Anne Frank in 2012.{{sfn|Ferguson|2012}} Asteroid [[5535 Annefrank]] was named in her honour in 1995, after having been discovered in 1942.<ref name=\"JPL\">{{JPL small body|id=2005535}}</ref>\n\nOne school in Amsterdam is named after Frank, {{ill|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank|lt=6<sup>e</sup> Openbare Montessori Basischool ''Anne Frank''|nl|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank}} (No. 6 Montessori Primary School Anne Frank).<ref>[http://www.annefrank-montessori.nl/ Home]. 6<sup>3</sup> Openbare Montessori Basischool ''Anne Frank''.

AnneFrank.org, 31 March 2015</ref> was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German]]-[[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch]] diarist of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin. One of the most discussed Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]], she gained fame posthumously with the publication of ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' (originally ''Het Achterhuis'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; {{lang-en|The Secret Annex}}), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] in [[World War II]]. It is one of the world's best known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.\n\nBorn in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], she lived most of her life in or near [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], having moved there with her family at the age of four and a half when the [[Nazi]]s gained control over Germany. Born a German national, she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became [[statelessness|stateless]]. By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As [[History of the Jews during World War II|persecutions of the Jewish population]] increased in July 1942, the Franks went into hiding in some [[Anne Frank House|concealed rooms]] behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father, [[Otto Frank]], worked. From then until the family's arrest by the [[Gestapo]] in August 1944, she kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly. Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. In October or November 1944, Anne and her sister, [[Margot Frank|Margot]], were transferred from [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where they died (probably of [[typhus]]) a few months later. They were originally estimated by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death, but research by the [[Anne Frank House]] in 2015 suggests it is more likely that they died in February.<ref name=\"DeathResearch\" />\n\nOtto, the only survivor of the Franks, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved by his secretary, [[Miep Gies]], and his efforts led to its publication in 1947. It was translated from its original Dutch version and first published in English in 1952 as ''The Diary of a Young Girl'', and has since been translated into over 70 languages.\n\n== Early life ==\nFrank was born Annelies{{sfn|Anne Frank Fonds}} or Anneliese{{sfn|Barnouw|Van Der Stroom|2003|pp=3, 17}} Marie Frank on 12 June 1929 at the [[Maingau Red Cross Clinic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rotkreuzkliniken.de/drk_schwesternschaft_bad_homburg-maingau.html |title=Geschichte |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Frankfurt Red Cross Clinics |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, to [[Edith Frank|Edith]] ({{n\u00e9e|Holl\u00e4nder}}) and [[Otto Frank|Otto Heinrich Frank]].

In 1931 the family moved to Ganghoferstrasse 24 in a fashionable liberal area of Dornbusch called the Dichterviertel (Poets' Quarter).

Otto Frank remained in Frankfurt, but after receiving an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, he moved there to organize the business and to arrange accommodations for his family.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=20\u201323}} He began working at the [[Opekta|Opekta Works]], a company that sold the fruit extract [[pectin]]. Edith travelled back and forth between Aachen and Amsterdam and found an apartment on the Merwedeplein (Merwede Square) in the [[Rivierenbuurt (Amsterdam)|Rivierenbuurt]] neighbourhood of Amsterdam, where more Jewish-German refugees settled.{{sfn|Verhoeven|2019|pp=7\u201312}}  In late December 1933, Edith followed her husband together with Margot.

Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, Margot became a star pupil in Amsterdam. Anne soon felt at home at the Montessori school and met children of her own age, like Hannah Goslar, who would later become one of her best friends.{{sfn|Verhoeven|2019|pp=28,31-33}}\n\nIn 1938, Otto Frank started a second company, Pectacon, which was a wholesaler of herbs, [[pickling salt]]s, and [[mixed spices]], used in the production of sausages.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=92}}{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=40}} [[Hermann van Pels]] was employed by Pectacon as an advisor about spices.

Frank decided she would use it as a diary,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=96}} and she began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jewish]] population.{{sfn|Frank|1995|pp=1\u201320}}\n\nOtto and Edith Frank planned to go into hiding with the children on 16 July 1942, but when Margot received a call-up notice from the [[Zentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung]] (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) on 5 July, ordering her to report for relocation to a [[Durchgangslager|work camp]], they were forced to move the plan ten days forward.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=153}} Shortly before going into hiding, Anne gave her friend and neighbour Toosje Kupers a book, a tea set, a tin of marbles. On July 6 the Frank family left a note for the Kupers, asking them to take care of their cat Moortje. As the Associated Press reports: \"'I'm worried about my marbles, because I'm scared they might fall into the wrong hands,' Kupers said Anne told her. 'Could you keep them for me for a little while?'\"<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|journal=MSN.com|title=Marbles that belonged to Anne Frank rediscovered|url=http://news.msn.com/world/marbles-that-belonged-to-anne-frank-rediscovered|date=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Life in the ''Achterhuis'' ===\n[[File:AnneFrankHouse Bookcase.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A three shelf timber bookcase, filled with books, stands at an angle in front of a doorway to the Secret Annexe|Reconstruction of the bookcase that covered the entrance to the Secret Annex, in the [[Anne Frank House]] in Amsterdam]]\n\nOn the morning of Monday, 6 July 1942,{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=163}} the Frank family moved into their hiding place, a three-story space entered from a landing above the Opekta offices on the [[Prinsengracht]], where some of his most trusted employees would be their helpers. This hiding place became known as the ''Achterhuis'' (translated into \"Secret Annex\" in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland. The need for secrecy forced them to leave behind Anne's cat, Moortje. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, they walked several kilometres from their home.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=105\u2013106}} The door to the ''Achterhuis'' was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|pp=45, 107\u2013187}}\n\n[[Victor Kugler]], [[Johannes Kleiman]], [[Miep Gies]], and [[Bep Voskuijl]] were the only employees who knew of the people in hiding. Along with Gies' husband [[Jan Gies]] and Voskuijl's father Johannes Hendrik Voskuijl, they were the \"helpers\" for the duration of their confinement. The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, they kept the occupants informed of war news and political developments. They catered to all of their needs, ensured their safety, and supplied them with food, a task that grew more difficult with the passage of time. Frank wrote of their dedication and of their efforts to boost morale within the household during the most dangerous of times. All were aware that, if caught, they could face the death penalty for sheltering Jews.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\n[[File:AnneFrankHouseAmsterdamtheNetherlands.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A photograph taken from the opposite side of the canal shows two four-story buildings which housed the Opekta offices and behind them, the Secret Annexe|The house (left) at the Prinsengracht in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Anne Frank House Model.JPG|thumb|A model of the building where Anne Frank stayed, including the Secret Annex.]]\n\nOn 13 July 1942, the Franks were joined by the Van Pels, made up of Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by [[Fritz Pfeffer]], a dentist and friend of the family. Frank wrote of her pleasure at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, she found him to be insufferable and resented his intrusion,{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=120\u201321}} and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom she regarded as foolish. She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food they consumed.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=117}} Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine, or resulted from their shared confinement.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=191}} Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, \"the young typist&nbsp;... the two of them often stood whispering in the corner.\"{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=119}}\n\n=== The young diarist ===\nIn her writing, Frank examined her relationships with the members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, \"I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999||p=203}} The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, \"Margot's much nicer&nbsp;... She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count.\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=167}}\n\n[[File:Amsterdam Panaroma.jpg|thumb|alt=Taken from the top of the Westerkerk church, this image shows the Prinsengracht canal and the rooftops of the buildings in the neighborhood|The [[Anne Frank House|Secret Annex]] with its light-coloured walls and orange roof (bottom) and the [[Anne Frank tree]] in the garden behind the house (bottom right), seen from the [[Westerkerk]] in 2004]]\n\nFrank frequently wrote of her difficult relationship with her mother, and of her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942 she described her \"contempt\" for her mother and her inability to \"confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness,\" before concluding, \"She's not a mother to me.\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=63}} Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: \"Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=157}} She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=204}}\n\nThe Frank sisters each hoped to return to school as soon as they were able, and continued with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a [[shorthand]] [[correspondence course|course by correspondence]] in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited (after March 1944) her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, dreams and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=194}}\n\nFrank aspired to become a journalist, writing in her diary on Wednesday, 5 April 1944:\n{{quote\n| I finally realized that I must do my schoolwork to keep from being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, because that's what I want! I know I can write&nbsp;..., but it remains to be seen whether I really have talent&nbsp;...\n\nAnd if I don't have the talent to write books or newspaper articles, I can always write for myself.

On 5 August they were transferred to the Huis van Bewaring (House of Detention), an overcrowded prison on the Weteringschans. Two days later they were transported to the [[Westerbork transit camp]], through which by that time more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, they were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for [[hard labor|hard labour]].{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=233}}\n\nVictor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman were arrested and jailed at the penal camp for enemies of the regime at [[Amersfoort]].

They returned to the ''Achterhuis'' the following day, and found Anne's papers strewn on the floor. They collected them, as well as several family photograph albums, and Gies resolved to return them to Anne after the war. On 7 August 1944, Gies attempted to facilitate the release of the prisoners by confronting Silberbauer and offering him money to intervene, but he refused.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=279}}\n\nAlthough there have been persistent claims of betrayal by an informant, the source of the information that led the authorities to raid the ''Achterhuis'' has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by [[Carol Ann Lee]], biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer [[Melissa M\u00fcller]]. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miepgies.nl/en/The%20betrayal/|title=The betrayal|publisher=Miep Gies|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Flemish journalist Jeroen de Bruyn and Joop van Wijk, Bep Voskuijl's youngest son, wrote a biography, ''Bep Voskuijl, het zwijgen voorbij: een biografie van de jongste helper van het Achterhuis'' (''Bep Voskuijl, the Silence is Over: A Biography of the Youngest Helper of the Secret Annex''), in which they alleged that Bep's younger sister Nelly (1923\u20132001) could have betrayed the Frank family.

Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549\u2014including all children younger than 15\u2014were sent directly to the [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]]. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the ''Achterhuis'' had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|pp=246\u2013247}}\n\nWith the other women and girls not selected for immediate death, Frank was forced to strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed with an identifying number]] on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread [[Rationing|rations]] for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by [[scabies]]. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which was in a state of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|pp=248\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Anne frank memorial bergen belsen.jpg|thumb|alt=A Memorial for Margot and Anne Frank shows a Star of David and the full names, birthdates, and year of death of each of the sisters, in white lettering on a large black stone.

Bloeme Evers-Emden was scheduled to be on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going because she had developed scabies, and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them.{{sfn|Laeredt|1995}}\n\nOn 28 October, selections began for women to be relocated to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. More than 8,000 women, including Anne and Margot Frank, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. Edith Frank was left behind and died of starvation.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=252}} Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly. Frank was briefly reunited with two friends, [[Hanneli Goslar]] and [[Nanette Blitz]], who were confined in another section of the camp. Goslar and Blitz survived the war, and discussed the brief conversations they had conducted with Frank through a fence. Blitz described Anne as bald, emaciated, and shivering. Goslar noted Auguste van Pels was with Anne and Margot Frank, and was caring for Margot, who was severely ill. Neither of them saw Margot, as she was too weak to leave her bunk. Anne told Blitz and Goslar she believed her parents were dead, and for that reason she did not wish to live any longer. Goslar later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=255}}\n\nIn early 1945, a [[typhus]] epidemic spread through the camp, killing 17,000 prisoners.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=261}} Other diseases, including [[typhoid fever]], were rampant.{{sfn|Gedenkst\u00e4tten Bergen-Belsen}} Due to these chaotic conditions, it is not possible to determine the specific cause of Anne's death; however, there is evidence that she died from the epidemic.

An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the Netherlands, with many people aided by the [[Dutch underground]]. Approximately two-thirds of this group survived the war.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}\n\nOtto Frank survived his internment in Auschwitz. After the war ended, he returned to Amsterdam in June 1945 where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family. He learned of the death of his wife, Edith, in Auschwitz, but remained hopeful that his daughters had survived. After several weeks, he discovered Margot and Anne had also died. He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters' friends and learned many had been murdered. [[Sanne Ledermann]], often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara, a close friend of Margot's, had survived.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=211\u2013212}} Several of the Frank sisters' school friends had survived, as had the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank, as they had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2013|pp=39, 48\u201349}}\n\n== ''The Diary of a Young Girl'' ==\n{{main|The Diary of a Young Girl}}\n\n=== Publication ===\n[[File:Het Achterhuis (Diary of Anne Frank) - front cover, first edition.jpg|thumb|upright|{{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}}, the first Dutch edition of Anne Frank's diary, published in 1947, later translated into English as ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]''.]]\n\nIn July 1945, after the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] confirmed the deaths of the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw for the first time the more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, \"For me it was a revelation&nbsp;... I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings&nbsp;... She had kept all these feelings to herself\".{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=216}} Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=74}}\n\nFrank's diary began as a private expression of her thoughts; she wrote several times that she would never allow anyone to read it. She candidly described her life, her family and companions, and their situation, while beginning to recognize her ambition to write fiction for publication. In March 1944, she heard a radio broadcast by [[Gerrit Bolkestein]]\u2014a member of the Dutch [[government in exile]], based in [[London]]\u2014who said that when the war ended, he would create a public record of the Dutch people's oppression under German occupation.{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=242}} He mentioned the publication of letters and diaries, and Frank decided to submit her work when the time came. She began editing her writing, removing some sections and rewriting others, with a view to publication. Her original notebook was supplemented by additional notebooks and loose-leaf sheets of paper. She created pseudonyms for the members of the household and the helpers. The van Pels family became Hermann, Petronella, and Peter van Daan, and Fritz Pfeffer became Albert D\u00fcssell. In this edited version, she addressed each entry to \"Kitty,\" a fictional character in [[Cissy van Marxveldt]]'s {{lang|nl|[[Joop ter Heul]]}} novels that Anne enjoyed reading. Otto Frank used her original diary, known as \"version A\", and her edited version, known as \"version B\", to produce the first version for publication. Although he restored the true identities of his own family, he retained all of the other pseudonyms.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=75}}\n\nOtto Frank gave the diary to the historian [[Annie Romein-Verschoor]], who tried unsuccessfully to have it published. She then gave it to her husband [[Jan Romein]], who wrote an article about it, titled {{lang|nl|\"Kinderstem\"}} (\"A Child's Voice\"), which was published in the newspaper {{lang|nl|[[Het Parool]]}} on 3 April 1946. He wrote that the diary \"stammered out in a child's voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] put together.\"{{sfn|Romein}} His article attracted attention from publishers, and the diary was published in the Netherlands as {{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}} (''The Annex'') in 1947,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=223}} followed by five more printings by 1950.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=80}}\n\nIt was first published in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, was first published in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, Anne Frank quickly was identified as an important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=225}}\n\nA play by [[Albert Hackett|Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett]] based upon the diary premiered in New York City on 5 October 1955, and later won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. It was followed by the film ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959), which was a critical and commercial success. Biographer [[Melissa M\u00fcller]] later wrote that the dramatization had \"contributed greatly to the romanticizing, sentimentalizing and universalizing of Anne's story.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=276}} Over the years the popularity of the diary grew, and in many schools, particularly in the United States, it was included as part of the curriculum, introducing Anne Frank to new generations of readers.{{sfn|Prose|2009|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nIn 1986 the [[Dutch Institute for War Documentation]] published the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary. It includes comparisons from all known versions, both edited and unedited. It includes discussion asserting the diary's authentication, as well as additional historical information relating to the family and the diary itself.{{sfn|Frank|1989|p=102}}\n\nCornelis Suijk\u2014a former director of the [[Anne Frank Foundation]] and president of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation]]\u2014announced in 1999 that he was in the possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother.{{sfn|Blumenthal|1998}} Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2013|pp=342\u2013344}}\n\n=== Reception ===\n[[File:Diary of Anne Frank 28 sep 1942.jpg|thumb|A page from Anne Frank's first diary]]\nThe diary has been praised for its literary merits. Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist [[Meyer Levin]] commended Frank for \"sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel\",{{sfn|Levin|1952}} and was so impressed by the quality of her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication.{{sfn|Michaelsen|1997}} Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote about in his autobiography ''The Obsession''. The poet [[John Berryman]] called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the \"conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty\".{{sfn|Berryman|2000|p=78}}\n\nIn her introduction to the diary's first American edition, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] described it as \"one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings that I have ever read.\"{{sfn|Rosow|1996|p=156}} [[John F. Kennedy]] discussed Anne Frank in a 1961 speech, and said, \"Of all the multitudes who throughout history have spoken for human dignity in times of great suffering and loss, no voice is more compelling than that of Anne Frank.\"{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennedy Says Anne Frank's Gift to World Will Survive Her Enemies|url=http://www.jta.org/1961/09/22/archive/kennedy-says-anne-franks-gift-to-world-will-survive-her-enemies|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=21 September 1961}}</ref> In the same year, the Soviet writer [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] wrote of her: \"one voice speaks for six million\u2014the voice not of a sage or a poet but of an ordinary little girl.\"{{sfn|Graver}}\n\nAs Anne Frank's stature as both a writer and humanist has grown, she has been discussed specifically as a symbol of [[the Holocaust]] and more broadly as a representative of persecution.{{sfn|Feldman|2005}} [[Hillary Clinton]], in her acceptance speech for an [[Elie Wiesel|Elie Wiesel Humanitarian Award]] in 1994, read from Anne Frank's diary and spoke of her \"awakening us to the folly of indifference and the terrible toll it takes on our young,\" which Clinton related to contemporary events in Sarajevo, Somalia and Rwanda.{{sfn|Clinton|1994}} After receiving a humanitarian award from the Anne Frank Foundation in 1994, [[Nelson Mandela]] addressed a crowd in [[Johannesburg]], saying he had read Anne Frank's diary while in prison and \"derived much encouragement from it.\" He likened her struggle against Nazism to his struggle against [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]], drawing a parallel between the two philosophies: \"Because these beliefs are patently false, and because they were, and will always be, challenged by the likes of Anne Frank, they are bound to fail.\"{{sfn|Mandela|1994}} Also in 1994, [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] said \"Anne Frank's legacy is very much alive and it can address us fully\" in relation to the political and social changes occurring at the time in former Eastern Bloc countries.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}}\n\n[[Primo Levi]] suggested Anne Frank is frequently identified as a single representative of the millions of people who suffered and died as she did because \"One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we would not be able to live.\"{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}} In her closing message in M\u00fcller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that \"Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust\", writing: \"Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives&nbsp;... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=305}}\n\nOtto Frank spent the remainder of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, \"It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed.\" He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, \"he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally\".{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=222\u201333}} Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the [[Nuremberg Trials]], because \"people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this.\"{{sfn|Stichting, \"Simon Wiesenthal\"}}\n\nIn June 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a special edition titled \"[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]\". Anne Frank was selected as one of the \"Heroes & Icons\", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, \"The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world\u2014the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and hope for the future of human beings.\" He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, \"The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition.\"{{sfn|Rosenblatt|1999}}\n\n=== Denials of authenticity and legal action ===\nAfter the diary became widely known in the late 1950s, various allegations against the veracity of the diary and/or its contents appeared, with the earliest published criticisms occurring in Sweden and Norway.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=241}}\n\nIn 1957, ''{{lang|sv|Fria ord}}'' (\"Free Words\"), the magazine of the Swedish [[neofascist]] organization [[National League of Sweden]], published an article by Danish author and critic Harald Nielsen, who had previously written antisemitic articles about the Danish-Jewish author [[Georg Brandes]].{{sfn|Frank|Holmer|2005|p=340}} Among other things, the article claimed that the diary had been written by Meyer Levin.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nIn 1958, at a performance of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' in Vienna, [[Simon Wiesenthal]] was challenged by a group of protesters who asserted that Anne Frank had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence by finding the man who had arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for [[Karl Silberbauer]] and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=241\u2013246}}\n\nIn 1959, Otto Frank took legal action in [[L\u00fcbeck]] against Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former [[Hitler Youth]] member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\". The complaint was extended to include Heinrich Buddegerg, who wrote a letter in support of Stielau, which was published in a L\u00fcbeck newspaper. The court examined the diary in 1960 and authenticated the handwriting as matching that in letters known to have been written by Anne Frank. They declared the diary to be genuine. Stielau recanted his earlier statement, and Otto Frank did not pursue the case any further.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nIn 1976, Otto Frank took action against Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\". The judge ruled that if Roth  was to publish any further statements he would be subjected to a fine of 500,000 German marks and a six-month jail sentence. Roth appealed against the court's decision. He died in 1978, and after a year his appeal was rejected.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nOtto Frank mounted a lawsuit in 1976 against Ernst R\u00f6mer, who distributed a pamphlet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie\". When a man named Edgar Geiss distributed the same pamphlet in the courtroom, he too was prosecuted. R\u00f6mer was fined 1,500 Deutschmarks,{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}} and Geiss was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The sentence of Geiss was reduced on appeal, and the case was eventually dropped following a subsequent appeal because the time limit for filing a libel case had expired.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Legal rulings\"}}\n\nWith Otto Frank's death in 1980, the original diary, including letters and loose sheets, was willed to the Dutch Institute for War Documentation,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=233}} which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986. They examined the handwriting against known examples and found that they matched. They determined that the paper, glue, and ink were readily available during the time the diary was said to have been written. They concluded that the diary is authentic, and their findings were published in what has become known as the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary.{{sfn|Prose|2009|pp=247\u2013248}} In 1990, the Hamburg Regional Court confirmed the diary's authenticity.{{sfn|Frank|1989|p=102}}\n\nIn 1991, [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] [[Robert Faurisson]] and [[Siegfried Verbeke]] produced a booklet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank: A Critical Approach\", in which they revived the allegation that Otto Frank wrote the diary. Purported evidence, as before, included several contradictions in the diary, that the prose style and handwriting were not those of a teenager, and that hiding in the ''Achterhuis'' would have been impossible.{{sfn|Faurisson|2000}}{{sfn|Barnouw|Van Der Stroom|2003|pp=93\u201396}} In 1993, the [[Anne Frank House]] in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel filed a civil lawsuit to prohibit further distribution of Faurisson and Verbeke's booklet in the Netherlands. In 1998, the Amsterdam District Court ruled in favour of the claimants, forbade any further denial of the authenticity of the diary and unsolicited distribution of publications to that effect, and imposed a penalty of 25,000 guilders per infringement.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Ten Questions\"}}\n\n=== Unabridged version ===\n<!-- DO NOT INSERT MATERIAL THAT IS NOT IN THE O'TOOLE SOURCE WITHOUT ADDING A RELIABLE THIRD PARTY SOURCE THAT *DOES* SUPPORT IT! --> \nAn unabridged edition of Anne Frank's work was published in 1995.{{sfn|Boretz|1995}} This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage that had previously been edited out by Otto Frank.{{sfn|O'Toole|2013}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:AnneFrankMuseumLine.jpg|thumb|People waiting in line in front of the Anne Frank House entrance in Amsterdam]]\n\nOn 3 May 1957, a group of citizens, including Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting in an effort to rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The [[Anne Frank House]] opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the ''{{lang|nl|Achterhuis}}'', all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], all now protected behind [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic glass]]. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.{{sfn|Anne Frank House Annual Report|2005}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank M01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=A bronze statue of a smiling Anne Frank, wearing a short dress and standing with her arms behind her back, sits upon a stone [[plinth]] with a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] reading \"Anne Frank 1929\u20131945\". The statue is in a small square, and behind it is a brick building with two large windows, and a bicycle. The statue stands between the two windows.|Statue of Anne Frank, by [[Mari Andriessen]], outside the [[Westerkerk]] in Amsterdam]]\n\nIn 1963, Otto Frank and his second wife, [[Elfriede Geiringer-Markovits]], set up the Anne Frank Fonds as a [[Charitable organization|charitable foundation]], based in [[Basel]], Switzerland. Upon his death, Otto willed the diary's copyright to the Fonds, on the provision that the first 80,000 [[Swiss franc]]s in income each year was to be distributed to his heirs. The Anne Frank Fonds represents the Frank family. It administers the rights, \u00abinter alia\u00bb, to the writings of Anne and Otto Frank and to the letters of the Frank family. It is the owner of the rights to translations, editions, compilations, and authorised books about Anne Frank and her family. The Fonds aims to educate young people against racism, and loaned some of Anne Frank's papers to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington for an exhibition in 2003. Its annual report that year outlined its efforts to contribute on a global level, with support for projects in Germany, Israel, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.{{sfn|Anne Frank-Fonds Annual Report|2003}}\n\nIn 1997, the [[Anne Frank Educational Centre (Frankfurt)|Anne Frank Educational Centre]] (''{{lang|de|Jugendbegegnungsst\u00e4tte Anne Frank}}'') was opened in the [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] neighbourhood of Frankfurt, where Frank lived with her family until 1934. The Centre is \"a place where both young people and adults can learn about the history of National Socialism and discuss its relevance to today.\"{{sfn|Anne Frank Educational Centre website|2012}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank Schule Rivierenbuurt.jpg|thumb|upright|The {{ill|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank|lt=Anne Frank School|nl|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank}} in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Annefranktree edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A large tree, devoid of foliage|The Anne Frank tree in the garden behind the Anne Frank House]]\n\nThe Merwedeplein apartment, where the Frank family lived from 1933 until 1942, remained privately owned until the 2000s. After becoming the focus of a television documentary, the building\u2014in a serious state of disrepair\u2014was purchased by a Dutch housing corporation. Aided by photographs taken by the Frank family and descriptions in letters written by Anne Frank, it was restored to its 1930s appearance. Teresien da Silva of the Anne Frank House and Frank's cousin, Bernhard \"Buddy\" Elias, contributed to the restoration project. It opened in 2005. Each year, a writer who is unable to write freely in his or her own country is selected for a year-long tenancy, during which they reside and write in the apartment. The first writer selected was the Algerian novelist and poet El-Mahdi Acherchour.{{sfn|Anne Frank House Annual Report|2005}}\n\nAnne Frank is included as one of the topics in the [[Canon of Dutch History]], which was prepared by a committee headed by [[Frits van Oostrom]] and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, [[Maria van der Hoeven]], in 2006; the Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her as one of the topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007.\n\nIn June 2007, \"Buddy\" Elias donated some 25,000 family documents to the Anne Frank House. Among the artefacts are Frank family photographs taken in Germany and the Netherlands and the letter Otto Frank sent his mother in 1945, informing her that his wife and daughters had perished in Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|Max|2007}}\n\nIn November 2007, the [[Anne Frank tree]]\u2014by then infected with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk\u2014was scheduled to be cut down to prevent it from falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist [[Arnold Heertje]] said about the tree: \"This is not just any tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews.\"{{sfn|Thomasson|Balmforth|2008}} The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the [[Aesculus|horse chestnut]], which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution.{{sfn|Kreijger|2007}} The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years.{{sfn|Thomasson|Balmforth|2008}} However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree.{{sfn|''Radio Netherlands''|2010}} Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]. Saplings were also sent to a school in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], the scene of a desegregation battle; [[Liberty Park (Manhattan)]], which honours victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]; and other sites in the United States.{{sfn|Engel|2013}} Another horse chestnut tree honoring Frank was planted in 2010 at [[Kelly Ingram Park]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article130975789.html|title=Man wants Anne Frank story shared through national monument|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|work=[[News & Observer]]|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, several [[List of films about Anne Frank|films about Anne Frank]] appeared. Her life and writings have inspired a diverse group of artists and social commentators to make [[Cultural depictions of Anne Frank|reference to her]] in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include ''The Anne Frank Ballet'' by [[Adam Darius]],{{sfn|Stevens|1989}} first performed in 1959, and the choral work ''[[Annelies (Whitbourn)|Annelies]]'', first performed in 2005.{{sfn|Chester and Novello}} The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom.

Since the industrial revolution there has been a consistent theme of rivalry between the two cities based around economic and industrial competition. Manchester through to the 18th century was the far more populous city, and held a position of significance and notability as representative of the north. By the late 18th century, Liverpool had grown as a major sea port \u2013 critical to the growth and success of the northern cotton mills. Over the next century, Liverpool grew to supersede Manchester and throughout the late 19th and early 20th century was often described as the British Empire's [[Second city of the United Kingdom|second city]].<ref name=BBCScousevsManc/> The links between the two cities were strengthened with the construction of the [[Bridgewater Canal]], the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]], and the world\u2019s first inter-city railway, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], for the transport of raw materials inland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester to Liverpool: the first inter-city railway |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8165000/8165208.stm |accessdate=1 July 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arms of the City of Manchester.svg|thumb|The Manchester coat of arms formed the foundation of the original Manchester United badge]]\nThe construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], funded by Manchester merchants, was opposed by Liverpool politicians and bred resentment between the two cities. Tension between working class Liverpool dockers and labourers in Manchester was heightened after its completion in 1894, just three months prior to the first meeting between Liverpool and Newton Heath in a play-off match that would see Newton Heath relegated to the Second Division.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitten |first1=Andy |title=Mad for It |year=2008 |publisher=HarperSport |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-728080-3 |pages=6\u20137 }}</ref>\n\nToday, the crests of both the city of Manchester and Manchester United include stylised ships representing the Manchester Ship Canal and Manchester's trade roots. The ship is also included on the crest of many other Mancunian institutions such as [[Manchester City Council]] and rivals [[Manchester City F.C.]]\n\nPost-war shifts in economic ties, reliance on regional coal, and shifts in transatlantic trade patterns caused by the growth of Asian labour markets caused the gradual decline of British manufacturing. While the city of Liverpool suffered the loss of its primary source of income to southern port cities, Manchester maintained some of its manufacturing heritage.

The boot room connection was finally broken in 1991, 32 years after Shankly's arrival, with the appointment of [[Graeme Souness]], who actually demolished the boot room itself to make way for a press room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lessons-manchester-united-learn-liverpools-6480610|title=The lessons for Manchester United to learn from Liverpool's demise \u2013 Manchester Evening News|first=Mike|last=Keegan|date=8 January 2014|work=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> It did still manage to produce a final Liverpool manager in [[Roy Evans]], who won the League Cup, but upon his resignation in 1998, the era was over.\n\nIn contrast, Manchester United have succeeded thanks to the services of three extraordinary men, all decades apart, without the need for continuity and sustained success beyond each man's departure.

Since the industrial revolution there has been a consistent theme of rivalry between the two cities based around economic and industrial competition. Manchester through to the 18th century was the far more populous city, and held a position of significance and notability as representative of the north. By the late 18th century, Liverpool had grown as a major sea port \u2013 critical to the growth and success of the northern cotton mills. Over the next century, Liverpool grew to supersede Manchester and throughout the late 19th and early 20th century was often described as the British Empire's [[Second city of the United Kingdom|second city]].<ref name=BBCScousevsManc/> The links between the two cities were strengthened with the construction of the [[Bridgewater Canal]], the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]], and the world\u2019s first inter-city railway, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], for the transport of raw materials inland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester to Liverpool: the first inter-city railway |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8165000/8165208.stm |accessdate=1 July 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arms of the City of Manchester.svg|thumb|The Manchester coat of arms formed the foundation of the original Manchester United badge]]\nThe construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], funded by Manchester merchants, was opposed by Liverpool politicians and bred resentment between the two cities. Tension between working class Liverpool dockers and labourers in Manchester was heightened after its completion in 1894, just three months prior to the first meeting between Liverpool and Newton Heath in a play-off match that would see Newton Heath relegated to the Second Division.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitten |first1=Andy |title=Mad for It |year=2008 |publisher=HarperSport |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-728080-3 |pages=6\u20137 }}</ref>\n\nToday, the crests of both the city of Manchester and Manchester United include stylised ships representing the Manchester Ship Canal and Manchester's trade roots. The ship is also included on the crest of many other Mancunian institutions such as [[Manchester City Council]] and rivals [[Manchester City F.C.]]\n\nPost-war shifts in economic ties, reliance on regional coal, and shifts in transatlantic trade patterns caused by the growth of Asian labour markets caused the gradual decline of British manufacturing. While the city of Liverpool suffered the loss of its primary source of income to southern port cities, Manchester maintained some of its manufacturing heritage. This reversal of fortunes happened against the backdrop of shifting political backgrounds and significant events in British culture and society in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nBoth cities were part of the county of [[Lancashire]] until March 1974, upon the enactment of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Since then, Liverpool and Manchester each respectively anchor the neighbouring [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] of [[Merseyside]] and [[Greater Manchester]].\n\nThe two cities continue to be strong regional rivals, vying for influence of surrounding areas. Their continued importance to the UK economy has been reflected with the awarding of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] to Manchester, while Liverpool was awarded the title of 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]] as part of its ongoing regeneration.\n\nMore recent projects by [[Peel Ports]] have sought to re-establish the economic links between the Port of Liverpool and Port of Manchester, including re-developing trade links via the Manchester Ship Canal.\n\n==Football rivals==\n{{see also|List of Liverpool F.C. seasons|List of Manchester United F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Formation to 1945===\n[[File:ManUnited1905-1906.jpg|thumb|The Manchester United team at the start of the 1905\u201306 season.|alt=A black-and-white photo of a football team.

During this time, future Liverpool manager [[Bill Shankly]] was approached by then Liverpool chairman Tom Williams and asked, \"How would you like to manage the best club in the country?\". Shankly replied, \"Why?

It was during this period, in the late 70s and early 80s, that the modern day rivalry between the two clubs truly began to get heated. According to football sociologist John Williams, United had developed a \"glamour and media profile\" but didn't have the success to match it and Liverpool fans felt the Red Devils were \"media darlings who got far too much publicity\". There was a perception in Liverpool that their hugely successful but \"professional\" and \"workmanlike\" teams were always somehow in the shadow of the stars at Old Trafford. This led to a derisory United nickname in Liverpool: \"The Glams\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30419684|title=Man Utd v Liverpool: A strange kind of sporting love affair?|website=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\n===1992\u2013present===\nManchester United's 26-year spell without a league title has been replicated by Liverpool since 1990, when they clinched their last league title.

Liverpool built their dominance on a dynasty known as the [[The Boot Room|Anfield Boot Room]]. The boot room itself was where strategy for future matches was planned, however, it became a breeding ground for future Liverpool managers following the arrival of [[Bill Shankly]] in 1959. The original members were Shankly himself, [[Bob Paisley]], [[Joe Fagan]] and [[Reuben Bennett]], although the likes of [[Kenny Dalglish]] joined later on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1418093.stm|title=The legacy of the boot room|website=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Shankly's retirement in 1974, having secured eight trophies in 15 years, Bob Paisley stepped into the vacant manager's position and amassed 20 trophies in 9 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-managers/bob-paisley|title=Bob Paisley|website=liverpoolfc.com|publisher=Liverpool FC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041303/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-managers/bob-paisley|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Following his retirement, Joe Fagan took over and in the first of two seasons at the club, won a treble of trophies. Kenny Dalglish, while not an original member, was accepted into the group as the next in line for the role of manager, and he combined it with his playing duties to win Liverpool 10 trophies.

Robson then pulled a goal back for United, and with 12 minutes remaining fellow midfielder [[Gordon Strachan]] equalised to force a 3\u20133 draw.<ref name=\"insda\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/classic-liverpool-v-manchester-united-encounters-1807274.html?action=Gallery |title=Classic Liverpool v Manchester United encounters |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Simon |last=Rice |date=4 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Other notable games===\nOn 4 January 1994, in the second season of the new [[FA Premier League]], United took a 3\u20130 lead at Anfield in the opening 25 minutes with goals from [[Steve Bruce]], [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[Denis Irwin]]. Liverpool managed to claw back to draw 3\u20133 with two goals from [[Nigel Clough]] and another from [[Neil Ruddock]]. It was one of the last games in charge of Liverpool for manager [[Graeme Souness]], who had resigned by the end of the month.<ref name=\"insda\"/>\n\nOn 1 October 1995, United's [[Eric Cantona]] made his comeback to the side after serving an eight-month suspension for attacking a spectator in a game against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. His comeback game was against Liverpool in the Premier League at Old Trafford. United took an early lead through [[Nicky Butt]], only for Liverpool's [[Robbie Fowler]] to score twice and give the visitors a 2\u20131 lead. However, United were awarded a penalty in the 71st minute and Cantona converted it successfully, forcing a 2\u20132 draw.<ref name=\"insda\"/> At the end of the season, the two sides met again at Wembley for the [[1996 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]]. The game stayed goalless until the 85th minute, when Liverpool conceded a corner, which [[David Beckham]] swung into the box to be cleared by [[David James (footballer)|David James]], only for Eric Cantona to fire home United's winner.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4694012.stm |website=BBC Sport |first=Ian |last=Wilkerson |title=FA Cup flashback |date=16 February 2006}}</ref> In March 2003, the two clubs once again met in a cup final, this time in the [[2003 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], with Liverpool lifting the trophy after goals from [[Steven Gerrard]] and [[Michael Owen]] gave them a 2\u20130 win.<ref>{{cite news |title=Liverpool lift Worthington Cup |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/2811805.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=2 March 2003 |accessdate=22 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:2009-3-14 ManUtd vs LFC Red Card Vidic.JPG|thumb|[[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]] of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] was sent off in the game against Liverpool on 14 March 2009.]]\nOn 14 March 2009, the two sides met at Old Trafford in the Premier League. United were ahead at the top of the league and Liverpool were looking to make a late run to the title which had eluded them since 1990. United went ahead in the 23rd minute with a [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] penalty, but [[Fernando Torres]] equalised five minutes later for Liverpool, and a [[Steven Gerrard]] penalty just before half-time put Liverpool in the lead. United had [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]] sent off in the 76th minute, and their misery was swiftly compounded by late goals from [[F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio]] and finally [[Andrea Dossena]], condemning them to a 4\u20131 defeat, their heaviest at Old Trafford in any competition for 17 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7922069.stm |website=BBC Sport |title=Man Utd

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decided that they were worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos: He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to help tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965, in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to help tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "GinaleeJimenez", "label": "safe", "comment": "added colon", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}
