B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Balham ward of Wandsworth Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.]]\nThe settlement appears in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' as ''Belgeham''. Bal refers to 'rounded enclosure' and ham to a homestead, village or river enclosure. It was held by Geoffrey Orlateile. Its ''Domesday'' Assets were: 1\u00bd [[plough]]s, {{convert|8|acre|m2}} of [[meadow]].

Balham Hill and Balham High Road follow the line of the [[Roman road]] [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]] to [[Chichester]] \u2013 (now the [[A24 road (Great Britain)|A24 road]]). Balham is recorded in several maps in the 1600s as Ballam or Balham Hill or Balham Manor. The village was within the parish of [[Streatham]]. Large country retreats for the affluent classes were built there in the 18th century; however, most development occurred after the opening of [[Balham railway station]] on the [[West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway|line to Crystal Palace]] in 1856.\n\n===Second World War air raid===\n[[File:Air Raid Damage in Britain during the Second World War HU36188.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Air raid damage in Balham]]\nOn 14 October 1940 [[Balham station|Balham Underground station]] was badly damaged by air raids on London during [[World War II]].

The Balham [[London SW12|SW12]] postcode includes the southern part of [[Clapham Park]] otherwise known as [[Clapham South]] and the [[Hyde farm estate|Hyde Farm]] area, both east of Cavendish Road and within [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] (historically [[Clapham]], except for Weir Road) as well as a small detached part of Clapham south of Nightingale Lane, and part of [[Battersea]] (the roads north of Nightingale Lane). The southern part of Balham, towards Tooting Bec, near the 1930s block of [[Art Deco]] flats called [[Du Cane Court]] and the area to the south of [[Wandsworth Common]], comes under the SW17 postcode. The Heaver Estate lies to the south of Balham in Tooting. The Estate mainly comprises substantial houses, was built in the grounds of the old Bedford Hill House and was the work of local Victorian builder, [[Alfred Heaver]].\n\nBalham is situated between four south London commons: [[Clapham Common]] to the north, [[Wandsworth Common]] to the west, Tooting Graveney Common to the south, and the adjoining Tooting Bec Common to the east \u2013 the latter two historically distinct areas are referred to by both [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth Council]] and some local people as [[Tooting Commons|Tooting Common]].\n\nOther nearby areas include [[Tooting]], [[Streatham]], [[Brixton]], [[Battersea]], [[Wandsworth Common]], [[Clapham South]] or the southern part of [[Clapham Park]].\n\n==Economy==\nBalham's town centre has a variety of bars, restaurants and shops including major chains.

Bal refers to 'rounded enclosure' and ham to a homestead, village or river enclosure. It was held by Geoffrey Orlateile.

Balham Hill and Balham High Road follow the line of the [[Roman road]] [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]] to [[Chichester]] \u2013 (now the [[A24 road (Great Britain)|A24 road]]). Balham is recorded in several maps in the 1600s as Ballam or Balham Hill or Balham Manor. The village was within the parish of [[Streatham]]. Large country retreats for the affluent classes were built there in the 18th century; however, most development occurred after the opening of [[Balham railway station]] on the [[West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway|line to Crystal Palace]] in 1856.\n\n===Second World War air raid===\n[[File:Air Raid Damage in Britain during the Second World War HU36188.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Air raid damage in Balham]]\nOn 14 October 1940 [[Balham station|Balham Underground station]] was badly damaged by air raids on London during [[World War II]].

The Balham [[London SW12|SW12]] postcode includes the southern part of [[Clapham Park]] otherwise known as [[Clapham South]] and the [[Hyde farm estate|Hyde Farm]] area, both east of Cavendish Road and within [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] (historically [[Clapham]], except for Weir Road) as well as a small detached part of Clapham south of Nightingale Lane, and part of [[Battersea]] (the roads north of Nightingale Lane). The southern part of Balham, towards Tooting Bec, near the 1930s block of [[Art Deco]] flats called [[Du Cane Court]] and the area to the south of [[Wandsworth Common]], comes under the SW17 postcode. The Heaver Estate lies to the south of Balham in Tooting. The Estate mainly comprises substantial houses, was built in the grounds of the old Bedford Hill House and was the work of local Victorian builder, [[Alfred Heaver]].\n\nBalham is situated between four south London commons: [[Clapham Common]] to the north, [[Wandsworth Common]] to the west, Tooting Graveney Common to the south, and the adjoining Tooting Bec Common to the east \u2013 the latter two historically distinct areas are referred to by both [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth Council]] and some local people as [[Tooting Commons|Tooting Common]].\n\nOther nearby areas include [[Tooting]], [[Streatham]], [[Brixton]], [[Battersea]], [[Wandsworth Common]], [[Clapham South]] or the southern part of [[Clapham Park]].\n\n==Economy==\nBalham's town centre has a variety of bars, restaurants and shops including major chains.
