PLZ-89 was first unveiled to the public during 1999 National Day military parade.\n\nSince the late 1970s a number of 122&nbsp;mm self-propelled howitzers were developed in China to meet Chinese Army requirements. The PLA required mobile artillery system to provide medium- to long-range indirect fire support for motorized infantry and armored troops and capable of keeping pace with them. However none of them could meet these requirements. The Type 89, also known as the PLZ89, self-propelled howitzer was developed in late 1980s. It was Chinese attempt to develop indigenous SPH with similar capabilities to the Soviet 2S1 Gvosdika. The Type 89 is currently in service with Chinese Army and Marines. Several hundred of these artillery systems were built.\n\nThe Type 89 SPH is armed with a 122&nbsp;mm / L32 howitzer. It is a variant of the towed Type 86 (W-86), which in turn is a copy of the Soviet D-30 towed howitzer. The Type 89 is fitted with a semi-automatic loader. This artillery system is compatible with Chinese and Russian 122&nbsp;mm ammunition. Maximum range of fire is 18&nbsp;km using standard HE projectile and 21&nbsp;km with extended-range projectiles. Vehicle is fitted with a computerized fire control system.\n\nSecondary armament consists of a roof-mounted 12.7-mm machine gun. Armor of the Type 89 provides protection against small arms fire and artillery shell splinters. Vehicle is fitted with an NBC protection and automatic fire suppression systems. The Type 89 uses a tracked chassis, developed from the Type 77 amphibious armored personnel carrier. Vehicle is powered by the 12V150L12 diesel engine, developing 450&nbsp;hp. The Type 89 can be fitted with flotation kit for amphibious operation.\n\n==Design==\nGun for PLZ-89 is mounted on a tracked chassis which developed from [[Type 77 (armoured personnel carrier)|Type 77]] amphibious armoured personnel carrier and the main armament is derived from the Type 86 (W-86) 122&nbsp;mm / 32 calibre towed howitzer, which itself is a Chinese copy of the Russian [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|D-30]] 122&nbsp;mm howitzer. PLZ-89 carries 40 rounds inside the turret and it can fire all types of Chinese and Russian 122&nbsp;mm rounds.

PLZ-89 was first unveiled to the public during 1999 National Day military parade.\n\nSince the late 1970s a number of 122&nbsp;mm self-propelled howitzers were developed in China to meet Chinese Army requirements. The PLA required mobile artillery system to provide medium- to long-range indirect fire support for motorized infantry and armored troops and capable of keeping pace with them. However none of them could meet these requirements. The Type 89, also known as the PLZ89, self-propelled howitzer was developed in late 1980s. It was Chinese attempt to develop indigenous SPH with similar capabilities to the Soviet 2S1 Gvosdika. The Type 89 is currently in service with Chinese Army and Marines. Several hundred of these artillery systems were built.\n\nThe Type 89 SPH is armed with a 122&nbsp;mm / L32 howitzer. It is a variant of the towed Type 86 (W-86), which in turn is a copy of the Soviet D-30 towed howitzer. The Type 89 is fitted with a semi-automatic loader. This artillery system is compatible with Chinese and Russian 122&nbsp;mm ammunition. Maximum range of fire is 18&nbsp;km using standard HE projectile and 21&nbsp;km with extended-range projectiles. Vehicle is fitted with a computerized fire control system.\n\nSecondary armament consists of a roof-mounted 12.7-mm machine gun. Armor of the Type 89 provides protection against small arms fire and artillery shell splinters. Vehicle is fitted with an NBC protection and automatic fire suppression systems. The Type 89 uses a tracked chassis, developed from the Type 77 amphibious armored personnel carrier. Vehicle is powered by the 12V150L12 diesel engine, developing 450&nbsp;hp. The Type 89 can be fitted with flotation kit for amphibious operation.\n\n==Design==\nGun for PLZ-89 is mounted on a tracked chassis which developed from [[Type 77 (armoured personnel carrier)|Type 77]] amphibious armoured personnel carrier and the main armament is derived from the Type 86 (W-86) 122&nbsp;mm / 32 calibre towed howitzer, which itself is a Chinese copy of the Russian [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|D-30]] 122&nbsp;mm howitzer. PLZ-89 carries 40 rounds inside the turret and it can fire all types of Chinese and Russian 122&nbsp;mm rounds. The gun is equipped with semi-automatic loader with maximum rate of fire of 6~8 rounds/min and fire accuracy is achieved by a digital fire-control system and a roof-mounted electro-optical sighting for day/night operations. The five crew members are protected by collective anti-NBC systems and [[automatic fire suppression]]. The howitzer can swim with the assistance of certain floating devices.\n\n==Operators==\n;{{PRC}}\n*[[People's Liberation Army Ground Force]] - 500 PLZ-89<ref name=\"CLAWS\">{{cite web |title=Appraisal of PLA Artillery Modernisation |url=https://www.claws.in/publication/appraisal-of-pla-artillery-modernisation/ |website=Centre for Land Warfare Study |ref=https://www.claws.in/publication/appraisal-of-pla-artillery-modernisation/}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of equipment of the People's Liberation Army Ground Force]]\n;Related development\n* [[Type_63_(armoured_personnel_carrier)#Variants|Type 70 SPH]] - 122 mm self-propelled howitzer developed by China in 1960s.\n* [[Type_85_AFV#Variants|Type 85 SPH]] - 122 mm self-propelled howitzer developed by China in 1980s.\n* [[PLZ-07]] - successor of PLZ-89.\n;Comparable ground systems\n* [[2S1 Gvozdika]]\n\n{{PRCAFVs}}\n\n[[Category:Tracked self-propelled howitzers]]\n[[Category:Self-propelled artillery of the People's Republic of China]]\n[[Category:122 mm artillery]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLZ-89"}

Derivatives of phenothiazine are highly bioactive and have widespread use and rich history. The derivatives [[chlorpromazine]] and [[promethazine]] revolutionized the field of [[psychiatry]] and [[allergy]] treatment, respectively. An earlier derivative, [[methylene blue]], was one of the first [[antimalarial drugs]], and derivatives are under investigation as possible anti-infective drugs.  Phenothiazine is a prototypical pharmaceutical [[Pharmacophore|lead structure]] in [[medicinal chemistry]].\n\n==Uses==\nPhenothiazine itself is only of theoretical interest, but its derivatives revolutionized psychiatry, other fields of medicine, and pest management.  Other derivatives have been studied for possible use in advanced batteries and fuel cells.<ref name=DDD>{{cite journal|authors=M. J. Ohlow, B.

The structure was deduced in 1885 by Heinrich August Bernthsen.  Bernthsen synthesized phenothiazine in 1883.<ref name=DDD/> In the mid 1880s, [[Paul Ehrlich]] began to use methylene blue in his [[Paul Ehrlich#Hematological staining|cell staining]] experiments that led to pioneering discoveries about different cell types.  He was awarded a Nobel Prize based in part on that work.  He became particularly interested in [[Paul Ehrlich#Methylene blue|its use to stain bacteria and parasites]] such as ''[[Plasmodiidae]]'' \u2013 the genus that includes the [[malaria]] pathogen \u2013 and found that it could be stained with methylene blue.  He thought methylene blue could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria, tested it clinically, and by the 1890s methylene blue  was being used for that purpose.<ref name=DDD/>\n\nFor the next several decades, research on derivatives lapsed until phenothiazine itself came to market as an insecticide and deworming drug.  In the 1940s, chemists working with Paul Charpentier at Rhone-Poulenc Laboratories in Paris (a precursor company to [[Sanofi]]), began making derivatives.  This work led to [[promethazine]] which had no activity against infective organisms, but did have good [[antihistamine]] activity, with a strong sedative effect. It went to market as a drug for allergies and for [[anesthesia]]. As of 2012 it was still on the market.<ref name=DDD/>  At the end of the 1940s the same lab produced [[chlorpromazine]] which had an even stronger sedative and soothing effect, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] attempted to use it on their psychiatric patients, publishing their results in the early 1950s.  The strong effects they found opened the door of the modern field of psychiatry and led to a proliferation of work on phenothiazine derivatives.<ref name=DDD/>  The systematic research conducted by chemists to explore phenothiazine derivatives and their activity was a pioneering example of [[medicinal chemistry]]; phenothiazine is often discussed as a prototypical example of a pharmaceutical [[Pharmacophore|lead structure]].<ref name=DDD/><ref name=Jaszczyszyn/>\n\nThe term \"phenothiazines\" describes the largest of the five main classes of [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drugs]]. These drugs have antipsychotic and, often, [[antiemetic]] properties, although they may also cause severe [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] such as [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] (including [[akathisia]] and [[tardive dyskinesia]]), [[hyperprolactinaemia]], and the rare but potentially fatal [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], as well as substantial weight gain.<ref name=DDD/>   Use of phenothiazines has been associated with [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], but no causal relationship has been established.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Antiphospholipid Syndrome - Doctor's Information {{!}} Patient|url = http://patient.info/doctor/antiphospholipid-syndrome-pro|website = Patient|accessdate = 2015-07-25}}</ref>\n\nPhenothiazine antipsychotics are classified into three groups that differ with respect to the substituent on nitrogen: the [[aliphatic compound]]s (bearing [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] groups), the \"piperidines\" (bearing [[piperidine]]-derived groups), and the piperazine (bearing [[piperazine]]-derived substituents).<ref name=Jaszczyszyn>{{cite journal | last1 = Jaszczyszyn | first1 = A | display-authors = etal | year = 2012 | title = Chemical structure of phenothiazines and their biological activity | url = http://www.if-pan.krakow.pl/pjp/pdf/2012/1_16.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pharmacol Rep. | volume = 64 | issue = 1| pages = 16\u201323 | pmid = 22580516 | doi = 10.1016/s1734-1140(12)70726-0 }}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"60%\"\n|-\n|'''Group'''\n|'''[[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic]]'''\n|'''Example'''\n|'''Sedative'''\n|'''[[Extrapyramidal side effect]]s'''\n|-\n| rowspan=5 | [[Aliphatic compound]]s\n|-\n| rowspan=4 | moderate\n|[[Chlorpromazine]] (marketed as Thorazine, Aminazine, Chlor-PZ, Klorazine, Promachlor, Promapar, Sonazine, Chlorprom, Chlor-Promanyl, Largactil)\n|strong\n|moderate\n|-\n|[[Promazine]] (trade name Sparine, Propazine)\n|moderate\n|moderate\n|-\n|[[Triflupromazine]] (trade names Clinazine, Novaflurazine, Pentazine, Terfluzine, Triflurin, Vesprin)\n|strong\n|moderate/strong\n|-\n|[[Levomepromazine]] in Germany, Russia, most American countries (e.g., Brazil) and [[methotrimeprazine]] in USA (trade names Nozinan, Levoprome, Tisercin)\n|extremely strong\n|low\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | [[Piperidines]]\n| rowspan=2 | strong\n|[[Mesoridazine]] (trade name Serentil)\n|strong\n|weak\n|-\n|[[Thioridazine]] (trade names Mellaril, Novoridazine, Thioril, Sonapax)\n|strong\n|weak\n|-\n| rowspan=5 | [[Piperazines]]\n| rowspan=5 | weak\n|[[Fluphenazine]]  (trade names Prolixin, Permitil, Modecate, Moditen)\n|weak/moderate\n|strong\n|-\n|[[Perphenazine]] (sold as Trilafon, Etrafon, Triavil, Phenazine, Etaperazin)\n|weak/moderate\n|strong\n|-\n|[[Prochlorperazine]] (trade names Compazine, Stemetil)\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Trifluoperazine]] (trade name Stelazine, Triphtazine)\n|moderate\n|strong\n|}\n\n=== Nondrug applications ===\nThe synthetic dye [[methylene blue]], containing the structure, was described in 1876.

Derivatives of phenothiazine are highly bioactive and have widespread use and rich history. The derivatives [[chlorpromazine]] and [[promethazine]] revolutionized the field of [[psychiatry]] and [[allergy]] treatment, respectively. An earlier derivative, [[methylene blue]], was one of the first [[antimalarial drugs]], and derivatives are under investigation as possible anti-infective drugs.  Phenothiazine is a prototypical pharmaceutical [[Pharmacophore|lead structure]] in [[medicinal chemistry]].\n\n==Uses==\nPhenothiazine itself is only of theoretical interest, but its derivatives revolutionized psychiatry, other fields of medicine, and pest management.  Other derivatives have been studied for possible use in advanced batteries and fuel cells.<ref name=DDD>{{cite journal|authors=M. J. Ohlow, B. Moosmann|title= Phenothiazine: the seven lives of pharmacology's first lead structure|journal=Drug Discov.

The structure was deduced in 1885 by Heinrich August Bernthsen.  Bernthsen synthesized phenothiazine in 1883.<ref name=DDD/> In the mid 1880s, [[Paul Ehrlich]] began to use methylene blue in his [[Paul Ehrlich#Hematological staining|cell staining]] experiments that led to pioneering discoveries about different cell types.  He was awarded a Nobel Prize based in part on that work.  He became particularly interested in [[Paul Ehrlich#Methylene blue|its use to stain bacteria and parasites]] such as ''[[Plasmodiidae]]'' \u2013 the genus that includes the [[malaria]] pathogen \u2013 and found that it could be stained with methylene blue.  He thought methylene blue could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria, tested it clinically, and by the 1890s methylene blue  was being used for that purpose.<ref name=DDD/>\n\nFor the next several decades, research on derivatives lapsed until phenothiazine itself came to market as an insecticide and deworming drug.  In the 1940s, chemists working with Paul Charpentier at Rhone-Poulenc Laboratories in Paris (a precursor company to [[Sanofi]]), began making derivatives.  This work led to [[promethazine]] which had no activity against infective organisms, but did have good [[antihistamine]] activity, with a strong sedative effect. It went to market as a drug for allergies and for [[anesthesia]]. As of 2012 it was still on the market.<ref name=DDD/>  At the end of the 1940s the same lab produced [[chlorpromazine]] which had an even stronger sedative and soothing effect, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] attempted to use it on their psychiatric patients, publishing their results in the early 1950s.  The strong effects they found opened the door of the modern field of psychiatry and led to a proliferation of work on phenothiazine derivatives.<ref name=DDD/>  The systematic research conducted by chemists to explore phenothiazine derivatives and their activity was a pioneering example of [[medicinal chemistry]]; phenothiazine is often discussed as a prototypical example of a pharmaceutical [[Pharmacophore|lead structure]].<ref name=DDD/><ref name=Jaszczyszyn/>\n\nThe term \"phenothiazines\" describes the largest of the five main classes of [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drugs]]. These drugs have antipsychotic and, often, [[antiemetic]] properties, although they may also cause severe [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] such as [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] (including [[akathisia]] and [[tardive dyskinesia]]), [[hyperprolactinaemia]], and the rare but potentially fatal [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], as well as substantial weight gain.<ref name=DDD/>   Use of phenothiazines has been associated with [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], but no causal relationship has been established.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Antiphospholipid Syndrome - Doctor's Information {{!}} Patient|url = http://patient.info/doctor/antiphospholipid-syndrome-pro|website = Patient|accessdate = 2015-07-25}}</ref>\n\nPhenothiazine antipsychotics are classified into three groups that differ with respect to the substituent on nitrogen: the [[aliphatic compound]]s (bearing [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] groups), the \"piperidines\" (bearing [[piperidine]]-derived groups), and the piperazine (bearing [[piperazine]]-derived substituents).<ref name=Jaszczyszyn>{{cite journal | last1 = Jaszczyszyn | first1 = A | display-authors = etal | year = 2012 | title = Chemical structure of phenothiazines and their biological activity | url = http://www.if-pan.krakow.pl/pjp/pdf/2012/1_16.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pharmacol Rep. | volume = 64 | issue = 1| pages = 16\u201323 | pmid = 22580516 | doi = 10.1016/s1734-1140(12)70726-0 }}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"60%\"\n|-\n|'''Group'''\n|'''[[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic]]'''\n|'''Example'''\n|'''Sedative'''\n|'''[[Extrapyramidal side effect]]s'''\n|-\n| rowspan=5 | [[Aliphatic compound]]s\n|-\n| rowspan=4 | moderate\n|[[Chlorpromazine]] (marketed as Thorazine, Aminazine, Chlor-PZ, Klorazine, Promachlor, Promapar, Sonazine, Chlorprom, Chlor-Promanyl, Largactil)\n|strong\n|moderate\n|-\n|[[Promazine]] (trade name Sparine, Propazine)\n|moderate\n|moderate\n|-\n|[[Triflupromazine]] (trade names Clinazine, Novaflurazine, Pentazine, Terfluzine, Triflurin, Vesprin)\n|strong\n|moderate/strong\n|-\n|[[Levomepromazine]] in Germany, Russia, most American countries (e.g., Brazil) and [[methotrimeprazine]] in USA (trade names Nozinan, Levoprome, Tisercin)\n|extremely strong\n|low\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | [[Piperidines]]\n| rowspan=2 | strong\n|[[Mesoridazine]] (trade name Serentil)\n|strong\n|weak\n|-\n|[[Thioridazine]] (trade names Mellaril, Novoridazine, Thioril, Sonapax)\n|strong\n|weak\n|-\n| rowspan=5 | [[Piperazines]]\n| rowspan=5 | weak\n|[[Fluphenazine]]  (trade names Prolixin, Permitil, Modecate, Moditen)\n|weak/moderate\n|strong\n|-\n|[[Perphenazine]] (sold as Trilafon, Etrafon, Triavil, Phenazine, Etaperazin)\n|weak/moderate\n|strong\n|-\n|[[Prochlorperazine]] (trade names Compazine, Stemetil)\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Trifluoperazine]] (trade name Stelazine, Triphtazine)\n|moderate\n|strong\n|}\n\n=== Nondrug applications ===\nThe synthetic dye [[methylene blue]], containing the structure, was described in 1876.
