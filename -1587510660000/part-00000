It had two pairs of barbels and a mesh-like scale pattern. Although this fish was initially kept as an exploited captive, it was later maintained in large, specially built ponds by the Romans in south-central Europe (verified by the discovery of common carp remains in excavated settlements in the Danube delta area). As aquaculture became a profitable branch of agriculture, efforts were made to farm the animals, and the culture systems soon included spawning and growing ponds.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carpfishingscience.com/ |title=Balon, E.

In Europe, common carp contributed 1.8% (0.17 Mt) of the total inland fisheries production (9.42 Mt) during 2015\u20132016. It is a major farmed species in European freshwater aquaculture with production localized in central and eastern European countries. The Russian Federation (0.06 Mt) followed by Poland (0.02 Mt), Czech Republic (0.02 Mt), Hungary (0.01 Mt) and Ukraine (0.01 Mt) represents about 70% of carp production in Europe during 2016. In fact, the land\u2010locked central European countries rely heavily on common carp aquaculture in fishponds. The average productivity of carp culture systems in central European countries ranges between 0.3 and 1 ton ha\u22121. The European common carp production, in terms of volume, reached its peak (0.18 Mt) during 2009\u20132010 and has been declining since.

Hungarian [[fisherman's soup]], a specially prepared fish soup of carp alone or mixed with other freshwater fish, is part of the traditional meal for Christmas Eve in Hungary along with stuffed cabbage and poppy seed roll and walnut roll. A traditional Czech Christmas Eve dinner is a thick [[Fish soup|soup]] of carp's head and offal, [[Fried fish|fried carp meat]] with [[potato salad]] or boiled carp in black sauce. In some Czech families, the carp is not killed, but after Christmas returned to a river or pond. A Slovak Christmas Eve dinner is quite similar, with soup varying according to the region and fried carp as the main dish. Also in [[Austria]], parts of [[Germany]] and [[Poland]], a fried carp is one of the traditional dishes on the Christmas Eve.\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], the carp is cultivated more commonly as a sport fish, although there is a small market for it as a food fish.<ref>[http://www.carp-uk.net/carpfacts.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035631/http://www.carp-uk.net/carpfacts.htm|date=July 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fatanglingtours.com/carpinfo.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102081418/http://www.fatanglingtours.com/carpinfo.htm|date=January 2, 2015}}</ref> Carp are mixed with other common fish to make [[gefilte fish]], popular in [[Jewish cuisine]]. Common carp are extremely popular with [[Fisherman|angler]]s in many parts of Europe, and their popularity as quarry is slowly increasing among anglers in the United States (though they are still generally considered pests and destroyed in most areas of the U.S.), and southern Canada. Carp are also popular with spear, bow, and fly fishermen.\n\nIn the [[U.S.]], carp is mostly ignored as a food fish. Almost all U.S. shoppers bypass carp, due to their great need for filleted fish as opposed to cooking whole. Carp have smaller intramuscular bones called y-bones, which makes them a whole fish species for cooking.\n\nThe Romans farmed carp and this pond culture continued through the monasteries of Europe and to this day.

Although this fish was initially kept as an exploited captive, it was later maintained in large, specially built ponds by the Romans in south-central Europe (verified by the discovery of common carp remains in excavated settlements in the Danube delta area).

In fact, the land\u2010locked central European countries rely heavily on common carp aquaculture in fishponds. The average productivity of carp culture systems in central European countries ranges between 0.3 and 1 ton ha\u22121. The European common carp production, in terms of volume, reached its peak (0.18 Mt) during 2009\u20132010 and has been declining since. Carp farming is often criticized as an anthropogenic driver of eutrophication of inland freshwater bodies - especially in the Central Eastern European Region (CEER). There has been some debate between environmentalists and carp farmers concerning eutrophication of water bodies, manifested into lobbying at ministry levels surrounding fishpond legislations. <ref>Roy, K., Vrba, J., Kaushik, S.J. and Mraz, J.

Roughly three million tonnes are produced annually, accounting for 14% of all farmed freshwater fish in 2002. China is by far the largest commercial producer, accounting for about 70% of carp production.<ref name=fao/> Carp is eaten in many parts of the world both when caught from the wild and raised in [[aquaculture]].\n\nIn [[Central Europe]], it is a traditional part of a [[Christmas Eve]] dinner. Hungarian [[fisherman's soup]], a specially prepared fish soup of carp alone or mixed with other freshwater fish, is part of the traditional meal for Christmas Eve in Hungary along with stuffed cabbage and poppy seed roll and walnut roll. A traditional Czech Christmas Eve dinner is a thick [[Fish soup|soup]] of carp's head and offal, [[Fried fish|fried carp meat]] with [[potato salad]] or boiled carp in black sauce. In some Czech families, the carp is not killed, but after Christmas returned to a river or pond. A Slovak Christmas Eve dinner is quite similar, with soup varying according to the region and fried carp as the main dish. Also in [[Austria]], parts of [[Germany]] and [[Poland]], a fried carp is one of the traditional dishes on the Christmas Eve.\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], the carp is cultivated more commonly as a sport fish, although there is a small market for it as a food fish.<ref>[http://www.carp-uk.net/carpfacts.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035631/http://www.carp-uk.net/carpfacts.htm|date=July 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fatanglingtours.com/carpinfo.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102081418/http://www.fatanglingtours.com/carpinfo.htm|date=January 2, 2015}}</ref> Carp are mixed with other common fish to make [[gefilte fish]], popular in [[Jewish cuisine]]. Common carp are extremely popular with [[Fisherman|angler]]s in many parts of Europe, and their popularity as quarry is slowly increasing among anglers in the United States (though they are still generally considered pests and destroyed in most areas of the U.S.), and southern Canada. Carp are also popular with spear, bow, and fly fishermen.\n\nIn the [[U.S.]], carp is mostly ignored as a food fish. Almost all U.S. shoppers bypass carp, due to their great need for filleted fish as opposed to cooking whole. Carp have smaller intramuscular bones called y-bones, which makes them a whole fish species for cooking.\n\nThe Romans farmed carp and this pond culture continued through the monasteries of Europe and to this day. In China, Korea and Japan, carp farming took place as early as the [[Yayoi Period]] (c. 300 BC \u2013 AD 300).<ref>Daily Yomiuri newspaper, September 19, 2008</ref>\n\nCarp eggs, used for [[caviar]], are increasingly popular in the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of freshwater aquarium fish species]]\n*[[Rough fish]]\n*[[Benson (fish)|Benson]], a notable common carp\n*[[Mud carp]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Cyprinus carpio}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126203610/http://www.arkive.org/species/ARK/fish/Cyprinus_carpio/ Cyprinus carpio] Arkive\n* {{sealifephotos|154582}}\n\n{{carp|state=expanded}}\n{{commercial fish topics}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q81110}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Common Carp}}\n[[Category:Cyprinus]]\n[[Category:Carp]]\n[[Category:Commercial fish]]\n[[Category:Cyprinid fish of Asia]]\n[[Category:Cyprinid fish of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fish of the Great Lakes]]\n[[Category:Fish described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Fish of Korea]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish of North America]]\n", "name_user": "Harrumphings", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed double space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carp"}
