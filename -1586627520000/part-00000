They belong to [[Dinoflagellate|Dinoflagellata]] but differ from typical dinoflagellates. Most dinoflagellates are free-living{{Needs clarification|reason=Please look at [[Free-living]] and link to the appropriate entry.|date=April 2020}} and possess two [[Flagellum|flagella]]. Instead, ''Haplozoon'' belong to a 5% minority of parasitic dinoflagellates that are not free-living. Additionally, the ''Haplozoon'' trophont stage is particularly unique due to an apparent lack of flagella. The presence of flagella or remnant structures is the subject of ongoing research.\n\nAt first glance, ''Haplozoon'' also do not appear [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] \u2013 in fact they were originally classified as a possible transitional stage between [[Protist|protists]] and [[Multicellular organism|multicellular organisms]].<ref name=\":0\">Shumway, W. (1924). The genus ''Haplozoon'', Dogiel. Observations on the life history and systematic position. ''The Journal of Parasitology, 11''(2), 59-74.</ref> They have more recently been classified as compartmentalized [[Syncytium|syncytia]] \u2013 single cells with multiple nuclei that have been subdivided by internal membranes.<ref name=\":1\">Leander, B., Saldarriaga, J., & Keeling, P. (2002). Surface morphology of the marine parasite ''Haplozoon axiothellae'' Siebert (Dinoflagellata). ''European Journal of Protistology, 38''(3), 287\u2013297. doi: 10.1078/0932-4739-00882</ref> Their life cycle is also largely unknown; while there is a well-observed adult trophont stage, understanding of other life stages is speculative at best.\n\nThere is a single published case of ''Haplozoon'' infecting an [[Appendicularia|appendicularian]].<ref name=\":2\">Cachon J. (1964). Contribution a l\u2019\u00e9tude des P\u00e9ridiniens parasites. Cytologie. Cycles \u00e9volutifs. ''Ann. Sci. Nat. Zool. 12'': 1-158.</ref> Otherwise, they are almost exclusively documented as infecting maldanids, and the extent to which they are an appendicularian parasite has not been investigated.\n\n== Etymology ==\nHaplozoon derives from two Greek words ''haploos'' meaning \u201csingle, or simple\u201d and ''zoion'' meaning \u201canimal\u201d. When they were first discovered, they were initially placed within Mesozoa, a group of highly reduced worm-like parasitic invertebrates. Therefore, the genus name ''Haplozoon'' means \u201csimple animal\u201d.\n\n== History of Knowledge ==\nThe type species ''Haplozoon armatum'' was discovered by Russian zoologist [[Valentin Dogiel]] in 1906. Dogiel initially described ''Haplozoon'' as belonging to the [[Mesozoa]], and established a new mesozoan class, the Catenata.<ref>Dogiel, V. (1906). Haplozoon armatum n. gen. nova sp., der Vertreter einer neuen Mesozoa-Gruppe. ''Zool. Anz''., (30), 895-899.</ref>\n\nA series of early protistologists continued to fine-tune the taxonomical position of ''Haplozoon'' for a number of years.<ref name=\":0\" /> The following year, the French biologist [[\u00c9douard Chatton]] indicated similarities between ''Haplozoon'' and ''[[Blastodinium]]'' in 1907. Later, in 1911, the German naturalist Franz Poche created a new protozoan class \u2013 the Haplozooidea. And again in 1920, Chatton created a new family (Haplozoonidae) for the genus, of the order Gymnodinida (modern syn. [[Gymnodiniales]]). By the 1970s ''Haplozoon'' had been moved from the Gymnodiniales to the order of Blastodiniales.<ref name=\":3\">Siebert, A. (1973). A description of ''Haplozoon axiothellae'' n. sp., an endosymbiont of the polychaete ''Axiothellae rubrocincta''. ''Journal of Phycology, 9''(2), 185-190. doi: 10.1111/j.1529-8817.1973.tb04077.x </ref>\n\nOur modern understanding of ''Haplozoon'' is limited. There were a series of purported species discoveries in the early 1900s, however these publications lack the modern techniques that would be mandatory today (e.g. [[transmission electron microscopy]], [[scanning electron microscope]], [[Sequencing|molecular sequencing]], etc). In some cases, basic information such as the host species, or location of discovery, have not been recorded. The unfortunate result is that many purported species of ''Haplozoon'' are phantom species. Phantom species are those that have not been seen since their initial discovery, often due to an inadequate original description.\n\nOnly 3 species of ''Haplozoon'' have been sufficiently described by modern standards: ''Haplozoon axiothellae,''<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">Siebert, A., & West, J. (1974). The fine structure of the parasitic dinoflagellate ''Haplozoon axiothellae''.

''Protist'', 169(3), 333-350. doi: 10.1016/j.protis.2018.04.008</ref>\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\n''Haplozoon'' are [[Obligate parasite|obligate parasites]]. They are almost exclusively found in the gut of maldanid marine worms, with one study documenting a ''Haplozoon'' parasite infecting an appendicularian.<ref name=\":2\" /> Each trophont has a stylet, which it uses to pierce the [[Intestinal epithelium|gut lining]] of the host worm. It is unclear if the stylet is used only for anchoring the parasite, or if it is involved in feeding as well. If ''Haplozoon'' do use their stylet to feed, this would be referred to as [[myzocytosis]], and commonly referred to as \u201ccellular vampirism\u201d. This is an established feeding method among other alveolate parasites.<ref>G\u00f3mez, F., Moreira, D., & L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda, P. (2009). Life cycle and molecular phylogeny of the dinoflagellates ''Chytriodinium'' and ''Dissodinium'', ectoparasites of copepod eggs.

''European Journal of Protistology, 40''(3), 185-212. doi: 10.1016/j.ejop.2004.01.002</ref>\n\nAnother possible feeding strategy is that the parasite absorbs nutrients that are released as the host worm digests food. This feeding strategy is referred to as [[pinocytosis]], a form of endocytosis where nutrients suspended in the fluid if the host\u2019s gut are absorbed through the [[cell membrane]] of the parasite. The exterior of ''Haplozoon'' cells are covered by barbs that present as fine hair-like structures that might function in surface mediated nutrition similar to the [[microtriches]] of [[cestoda]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith little exception, most descriptions of ''Haplozoon'' are from European coastlines. ''Haplozoon clymenellae'' is from the Atlantic coast of North America,<ref name=\":0\" /> while ''H. axiothellae'', and ''H. praxillellae'' have been found on the Pacific coast of Washington, US and British Columbia, Canada.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> ''H. ezoense'' was discovered on the coast of Japan.<ref name=\":6\" /> There are currently no recorded observations from the tropics or the southern hemisphere, and consequently little is known about its biogeographical distribution.\n\n== Description of the organism ==\n\n=== Morphology ===\nWhat makes ''Haplozoon'' unique among dinoflagellates is their functional multicellularity. ''H. axiothellae'' cells are composed of a series of compartments, which give them the appearance of multicellularity. At minimum all ''Haplozoon'' species are comprised of a single row of compartments, with mature cells of some species containing two or more rows of compartments at the posterior of their cell. These compartments are specialized for different functions, such as host attachment, feeding and reproduction. The degree of compartmentalization varies by species.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe ''Haplozoon'' trophont (i.e. the stage that feeds on the host) has 3 types of compartments: (1) a trophocyte used to attach to the host, (2) repeating gonocytes that compose the majority of the cell length, and (3) sporocytes which develop from mature gonocytes. The anterior-most compartment of the cell is the trophocyte, larger than the gonocytes that are aligned immediately posterior to it. The rear most compartments are referred to as sporocytes, and depending on the species of ''Haplozoon'', sporocytes may remain in single file (e.g. ''H. lineare''), form double rows (e.g. ''H. axiothellae'') or even multiple rows (e.g. ''H. clymenellae''). All three compartment types appear granular under [[Optical microscope|light microscopy]], due to starch granules in their [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nOriginally, ''Haplozoon'' were described as having 2-26 \u201ccells\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" /> They vary in size by species, but the most well-studied species (''H. axiothellae'') is described as being 40-175 \u03bcm in length, and 15-40 \u03bcm wide.\n\n''Haplozoon'' lack visible flagella, where traditional dinoflagellates have two \u2013 one transverse and one longitudinal. ''H. axiothellae'' possesses a longitudinal row of ventral pores along the cell surface, a possible [[Vestigiality|vestigial feature]] from lost flagella.<ref name=\":1\" /> The exterior of ''Haplozoon'' cells are covered in amphiesmal projections (syn. thecal barbs).\n\nThe trophocyte attaches to the gut lining of the host by means of its stylet and a suction cup apparatus. Some species of ''Haplozoon'' are known to possess a single stylet (''H. ezoense''), where others are known to have multiple (reserve) stylets within the trophocyte (''H. axiothellae, H. praxillellae''). Some species also appear to have \u201carms\u201d that extend from the trophocyte.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nEarly transmission electron microscopy (TEM) briefly describes 3 layers of the cellular membrane. They describe a single continuous outer layer equivalent to a cell membrane, with two subsequent layers below of compressed \u201cthecal vesicles\u201d.<ref name=\":4\" /> Today these \u201cthecal vesicles\u201d are known as [[Alveolate|alveoli]], or amphiesmal vesicles.<ref>Cavalier-Smith, T. (1991). Cell diversification in heterotrophic flagellates. ''The Biology of Free-living Heterotrophic Flagellates''. 113-131.</ref> The divisions between gonocytes are described as consisting of outer continuous membranes and flattened vesicles but pressed so closely together they are impossible to distinguish.<ref name=\":4\" /> The divisions between compartments are now understood to be created by interlocking amphiesmal vesicles rather than cellular membranes.<ref name=\":6\" /> This solidified the description of ''Haplozoon'' as compartmentalized syncytia, rather than a multicellular organism.\n\nAll compartments contain their own [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], with some gonocytes being binucleate and some sporocytes being quadrinucleate.<ref name=\":0\" /> The nuclei of ''Haplozoon'' have thick [[Chromosome|chromosomes]],<ref name=\":6\" /> typical of [[Dinokaryota]]. [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are mainly located below the amphiesmal vesicles towards the outside of the cell and possess tubular cristae.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nTEM sections have revealed multiple triple membrane-bound organelles within the gonocytes.<ref name=\":6\" /> They are roughly spherical and range in size from 200 nm \u2013 750 nm. They appear like relic non-photosynthetic [[Plastid|plastids]], which have been found among other members of [[Myzozoa]] ([[Apicomplexa|apicomplexans]] as well as dinoflagellates). This is consistent with our understanding that some lineages of dinoflagellates have experienced plastid loss as they evolved.<ref name=\":7\">Saldarriaga, J., Taylor, F., Keeling, P., & Cavalier-Smith, T. (2001). Dinoflagellate nuclear SSU rRNA phylogeny suggests multiple plastid losses and replacements. ''Journal of Molecular Evolution'', 53(3), 204\u2013213. doi: 10.1007/s002390010210</ref> This discovery in ''Haplozoon'' only provides ultrastructure evidence for these remnant plastids; no research has been published to assess plastid genes and any associated metabolic pathways.\n\n=== Life cycle ===\nVery little is confirmed about the ''Haplozoon'' life cycle; the only life-stage that is known is the trophont. Given similarities with other dinoflagellate parasites, it is hypothesized that the known trophont stage is the \u201cadult\u201d.\n\nIt is presumed that the sporocytes are what allow the organism to reproduce, but this has not been shown definitively. It is believed that the sporocytes produced at the posterior end of the trophont become motile dinospores, which are then released through the anus of the host. Once in the marine environment, the dinospores can be ingested by a new host, and subsequently develop into an adult trophont and attach themselves to the gut of their new host.\n\nDinospores were described in ''Haplozoon dogieli''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sporocytes were observed detaching from adult trophonts and developing into small flagellated dinospores.<ref name=\":0\" /> They were 12 \u03bcm in length and similar to the dinospores of ''[[Oodinium]]'', [[Apodinium floodi|''Apodinium'']], and ''Blastodinium''. These dinospores were also observed quickly encysting if disturbed. Subsequent studies have been unable to reproduce the dinospore or cyst life stages.<ref name=\":3\" /> Thus, no image data capturing these stages currently exists. While the existence of dinospores is likely, they have not been observed since 1924.\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nModern dinoflagellate phylogenies recognize 8 orders: [[Syndiniales]], Gymnodiniales, [[Noctilucales]], [[Suessiales]], [[Peridiniales]], [[Gonyaulacales]], [[Prorocentrales]], and Dinophysiales.<ref>Janou\u0161kovec, J., Gavelis, G.

Subsequent phylogenetic analyses have confirmed that Blastodiniales is a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group, whose existence is not supported by modern molecular data.<ref>Saldarriaga, J., Cavalier-Smith, T., Menden-Deuer, S., & Keeling, P.

Zool. 12'': 1-158.</ref> Otherwise, they are almost exclusively documented as infecting maldanids, and the extent to which they are an appendicularian parasite has not been investigated.\n\n== Etymology ==\nHaplozoon derives from two Greek words ''haploos'' meaning \u201csingle, or simple\u201d and ''zoion'' meaning \u201canimal\u201d. When they were first discovered, they were initially placed within Mesozoa, a group of highly reduced worm-like parasitic invertebrates. Therefore, the genus name ''Haplozoon'' means \u201csimple animal\u201d.\n\n== History of Knowledge ==\nThe type species ''Haplozoon armatum'' was discovered by Russian zoologist [[Valentin Dogiel]] in 1906. Dogiel initially described ''Haplozoon'' as belonging to the [[Mesozoa]], and established a new mesozoan class, the Catenata.<ref>Dogiel, V. (1906). Haplozoon armatum n. gen. nova sp., der Vertreter einer neuen Mesozoa-Gruppe. ''Zool. Anz''., (30), 895-899.</ref>\n\nA series of early protistologists continued to fine-tune the taxonomical position of ''Haplozoon'' for a number of years.<ref name=\":0\" /> The following year, the French biologist [[\u00c9douard Chatton]] indicated similarities between ''Haplozoon'' and ''[[Blastodinium]]'' in 1907. Later, in 1911, the German naturalist Franz Poche created a new protozoan class \u2013 the Haplozooidea. And again in 1920, Chatton created a new family (Haplozoonidae) for the genus, of the order Gymnodinida (modern syn. [[Gymnodiniales]]). By the 1970s ''Haplozoon'' had been moved from the Gymnodiniales to the order of Blastodiniales.<ref name=\":3\">Siebert, A. (1973).

There were a series of purported species discoveries in the early 1900s, however these publications lack the modern techniques that would be mandatory today (e.g. [[transmission electron microscopy]], [[scanning electron microscope]], [[Sequencing|molecular sequencing]], etc). In some cases, basic information such as the host species, or location of discovery, have not been recorded. The unfortunate result is that many purported species of ''Haplozoon'' are phantom species. Phantom species are those that have not been seen since their initial discovery, often due to an inadequate original description.\n\nOnly 3 species of ''Haplozoon'' have been sufficiently described by modern standards: ''Haplozoon axiothellae,''<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">Siebert, A., & West, J.

They are almost exclusively found in the gut of maldanid marine worms, with one study documenting a ''Haplozoon'' parasite infecting an appendicularian.<ref name=\":2\" /> Each trophont has a stylet, which it uses to pierce the [[Intestinal epithelium|gut lining]] of the host worm. It is unclear if the stylet is used only for anchoring the parasite, or if it is involved in feeding as well. If ''Haplozoon'' do use their stylet to feed, this would be referred to as [[myzocytosis]], and commonly referred to as \u201ccellular vampirism\u201d. This is an established feeding method among other alveolate parasites.<ref>G\u00f3mez, F., Moreira, D., & L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda, P. (2009).

''European Journal of Protistology, 40''(3), 185-212. doi: 10.1016/j.ejop.2004.01.002</ref>\n\nAnother possible feeding strategy is that the parasite absorbs nutrients that are released as the host worm digests food. This feeding strategy is referred to as [[pinocytosis]], a form of endocytosis where nutrients suspended in the fluid if the host\u2019s gut are absorbed through the [[cell membrane]] of the parasite. The exterior of ''Haplozoon'' cells are covered by barbs that present as fine hair-like structures that might function in surface mediated nutrition similar to the [[microtriches]] of [[cestoda]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith little exception, most descriptions of ''Haplozoon'' are from European coastlines. ''Haplozoon clymenellae'' is from the Atlantic coast of North America,<ref name=\":0\" /> while ''H. axiothellae'', and ''H. praxillellae'' have been found on the Pacific coast of Washington, US and British Columbia, Canada.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> ''H. ezoense'' was discovered on the coast of Japan.<ref name=\":6\" /> There are currently no recorded observations from the tropics or the southern hemisphere, and consequently little is known about its biogeographical distribution.\n\n== Description of the organism ==\n\n=== Morphology ===\nWhat makes ''Haplozoon'' unique among dinoflagellates is their functional multicellularity. ''H. axiothellae'' cells are composed of a series of compartments, which give them the appearance of multicellularity. At minimum all ''Haplozoon'' species are comprised of a single row of compartments, with mature cells of some species containing two or more rows of compartments at the posterior of their cell. These compartments are specialized for different functions, such as host attachment, feeding and reproduction. The degree of compartmentalization varies by species.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe ''Haplozoon'' trophont (i.e. the stage that feeds on the host) has 3 types of compartments: (1) a trophocyte used to attach to the host, (2) repeating gonocytes that compose the majority of the cell length, and (3) sporocytes which develop from mature gonocytes. The anterior-most compartment of the cell is the trophocyte, larger than the gonocytes that are aligned immediately posterior to it. The rear most compartments are referred to as sporocytes, and depending on the species of ''Haplozoon'', sporocytes may remain in single file (e.g. ''H. lineare''), form double rows (e.g. ''H. axiothellae'') or even multiple rows (e.g. ''H. clymenellae''). All three compartment types appear granular under [[Optical microscope|light microscopy]], due to starch granules in their [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nOriginally, ''Haplozoon'' were described as having 2-26 \u201ccells\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" /> They vary in size by species, but the most well-studied species (''H. axiothellae'') is described as being 40-175 \u03bcm in length, and 15-40 \u03bcm wide.\n\n''Haplozoon'' lack visible flagella, where traditional dinoflagellates have two \u2013 one transverse and one longitudinal. ''H. axiothellae'' possesses a longitudinal row of ventral pores along the cell surface, a possible [[Vestigiality|vestigial feature]] from lost flagella.<ref name=\":1\" /> The exterior of ''Haplozoon'' cells are covered in amphiesmal projections (syn. thecal barbs).\n\nThe trophocyte attaches to the gut lining of the host by means of its stylet and a suction cup apparatus. Some species of ''Haplozoon'' are known to possess a single stylet (''H. ezoense''), where others are known to have multiple (reserve) stylets within the trophocyte (''H. axiothellae, H. praxillellae''). Some species also appear to have \u201carms\u201d that extend from the trophocyte.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nEarly transmission electron microscopy (TEM) briefly describes 3 layers of the cellular membrane. They describe a single continuous outer layer equivalent to a cell membrane, with two subsequent layers below of compressed \u201cthecal vesicles\u201d.<ref name=\":4\" /> Today these \u201cthecal vesicles\u201d are known as [[Alveolate|alveoli]], or amphiesmal vesicles.<ref>Cavalier-Smith, T. (1991). Cell diversification in heterotrophic flagellates. ''The Biology of Free-living Heterotrophic Flagellates''. 113-131.</ref> The divisions between gonocytes are described as consisting of outer continuous membranes and flattened vesicles but pressed so closely together they are impossible to distinguish.<ref name=\":4\" /> The divisions between compartments are now understood to be created by interlocking amphiesmal vesicles rather than cellular membranes.<ref name=\":6\" /> This solidified the description of ''Haplozoon'' as compartmentalized syncytia, rather than a multicellular organism.\n\nAll compartments contain their own [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], with some gonocytes being binucleate and some sporocytes being quadrinucleate.<ref name=\":0\" /> The nuclei of ''Haplozoon'' have thick [[Chromosome|chromosomes]],<ref name=\":6\" /> typical of [[Dinokaryota]]. [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are mainly located below the amphiesmal vesicles towards the outside of the cell and possess tubular cristae.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nTEM sections have revealed multiple triple membrane-bound organelles within the gonocytes.<ref name=\":6\" /> They are roughly spherical and range in size from 200 nm \u2013 750 nm. They appear like relic non-photosynthetic [[Plastid|plastids]], which have been found among other members of [[Myzozoa]] ([[Apicomplexa|apicomplexans]] as well as dinoflagellates). This is consistent with our understanding that some lineages of dinoflagellates have experienced plastid loss as they evolved.<ref name=\":7\">Saldarriaga, J., Taylor, F., Keeling, P., & Cavalier-Smith, T. (2001). Dinoflagellate nuclear SSU rRNA phylogeny suggests multiple plastid losses and replacements. ''Journal of Molecular Evolution'', 53(3), 204\u2013213. doi: 10.1007/s002390010210</ref> This discovery in ''Haplozoon'' only provides ultrastructure evidence for these remnant plastids; no research has been published to assess plastid genes and any associated metabolic pathways.\n\n=== Life cycle ===\nVery little is confirmed about the ''Haplozoon'' life cycle; the only life-stage that is known is the trophont. Given similarities with other dinoflagellate parasites, it is hypothesized that the known trophont stage is the \u201cadult\u201d.\n\nIt is presumed that the sporocytes are what allow the organism to reproduce, but this has not been shown definitively. It is believed that the sporocytes produced at the posterior end of the trophont become motile dinospores, which are then released through the anus of the host. Once in the marine environment, the dinospores can be ingested by a new host, and subsequently develop into an adult trophont and attach themselves to the gut of their new host.\n\nDinospores were described in ''Haplozoon dogieli''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sporocytes were observed detaching from adult trophonts and developing into small flagellated dinospores.<ref name=\":0\" /> They were 12 \u03bcm in length and similar to the dinospores of ''[[Oodinium]]'', [[Apodinium floodi|''Apodinium'']], and ''Blastodinium''. These dinospores were also observed quickly encysting if disturbed. Subsequent studies have been unable to reproduce the dinospore or cyst life stages.<ref name=\":3\" /> Thus, no image data capturing these stages currently exists. While the existence of dinospores is likely, they have not been observed since 1924.\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nModern dinoflagellate phylogenies recognize 8 orders: [[Syndiniales]], Gymnodiniales, [[Noctilucales]], [[Suessiales]], [[Peridiniales]], [[Gonyaulacales]], [[Prorocentrales]], and Dinophysiales.<ref>Janou\u0161kovec, J., Gavelis, G.

He assisted a number of directors such as [[Joaqu\u00edn Luis Romero Marchent]], [[Le\u00f3n Klimovsky]] and [[Juan Antonio Bardem]]. After working on more than 20 films, he decided to get into directing films in 1959, making a few musicals and a crime drama called ''Red Lips''.\n\nIn 1960, Franco took Marius Lesoeur and Sergio Newman, two producer friends, to a cinema to see the newly released [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] horror film ''[[The Brides of Dracula]]'' and the three men decided to get into the horror film business. His career took off in 1961 with ''[[The Awful Dr. Orloff]]'' (a.k.a. ''Gritos en la noche''), which received wide distribution in the United States and the UK. Franco wrote and directed ''Orloff'', and even supplied some of the music for the film. In the mid-1960s, he went on to direct two other horror films, then proceeded to turn out a number of [[James Bond]]-like spy thrillers and softcore sex films based on the works of the [[Marquis de Sade]] (which remained one of his major influences throughout his career).\n\nAlthough he had some American box office success with ''Necronomicon'' (1967), ''99 Women'' (1968) and two 1969 [[Christopher Lee]] films \u2013 ''The Bloody Judge'' and ''[[Count Dracula (1969 film)|Count Dracula]]'' \u2013 he never achieved wide commercial success. Many of his films were only distributed in Europe, and most of them were never dubbed into English. After discovering [[Soledad Miranda]] (he first used her in his ''Count Dracula''), Franco moved from Spain to France in 1969 so that he could make more violent and erotic films free of the strict censorship in Spain, and it was at this point that his career began to go downhill commercially as he turned to low-budget filmmaking with an accent on adult material. Soledad Miranda starred in a series of six erotic thrillers for Franco, all made within a one-year period (including ''[[Vampyros Lesbos]]''), after which she was killed in a tragic automobile accident in Portugal in 1970, just as her career was taking off.\n\nA year or two after Soledad Miranda died, a grieving Franco discovered a new leading lady in actress [[Lina Romay]]. At the time, the teenage Romay was married to a young actor/photographer named Ramon Ardid, but as she and Franco became more involved in their film projects together over the years, her marriage to Ramon ended in divorce around 1975.\n\nFranco was married at the time to Nicole Guettard (their marriage running approximately from 1962 through 1980), Ms. Guettard being gradually replaced in Franco's life by Lina Romay (Nicole worked as a script consultant on many of Franco's films while they were married, and even acted in a few of them. Her daughter from an earlier marriage, Caroline Riviere, also appeared in a few Franco films in the early 1970s (including the risque ''Exorcisme'' and ''The Perverse Countess'')).\n\nFranco and Lina Romay worked together for 40 years, and lived together from 1980 onward, although they were only ''officially'' married on 25 April 2008. Until her death in 2012 (from cancer at age 57), Romay was his most regular actress, as well as his life companion and muse. Although Romay was listed in the credits of several films as a co-director, actor Antonio Mayans stated in a recent interview that Franco used to credit her in that manner for business reasons, although she never actually co-directed any of their films together.\n\nAlthough he produced a number of relatively successful horror films in the early 1970s (''Dracula vs. Frankenstein'', ''[[The Bare-Breasted Countess]]'', ''[[A Virgin Among the Living Dead]]''), many people in the industry considered him a porn director due to the huge number of X-rated adult films he began turning out (even his 1970s horror films featured abundant nudity). Franco returned to low-budget horror in a brief comeback period from 1980\u20131983 (''Mondo Cannibale'', ''Bloody Moon'', ''Oasis of the Zombies'', ''Revenge in the House of Usher''), but after 1983, his career took a second downturn as he returned to making mostly pornographic films, most of which left nothing to the imagination.\n\nIn his later years, he did, however, get the opportunity to turn out two rather big-budget horror films \u2013 ''[[Faceless (film)|Faceless]]'' (1988) and ''Killer Barbys'' (1996) \u2013 both of which showed what great work he could still do when his projects were adequately funded. The entirety of his work after 1996 was direct-to-video films of very low quality, none of which were distributed theatrically. Romay died of cancer in 2012 at age 57, after which Franco died in April, 2013 from natural causes, at age 82.<ref name=\"sensacine\" />\n\nFranco sometimes worked under various [[pseudonym]]s, including '''David Khune''' and '''Frank Hollmann'''. A fan of [[Jazz|jazz music]] (and a musician himself), many of his pseudonyms were taken from jazz musicians such as [[Clifford Brown]] and [[James P. Johnson]].\n\nFranco's themes often revolved around [[lesbian vampire]]s, [[women in prison films|women in prison]], surgical horror, sadomasochism, zombies and sexploitation (including several films based on the writings of the [[Marquis de Sade]]). He worked in other [[exploitation film]] genres, such as [[cannibal film]]s, spy films, [[giallo]], crime films, science fiction, jungle adventure, Oriental menace, exorcist films, war movies, historical dramas and [[nunsploitation]]. His sex movies often contained long, uninterrupted shots of nude women writhing around on beds. Most of his hardcore films starred his lifelong companion [[Lina Romay]], who admitted in interviews to being an exhibitionist.\n\nFranco was known for his use of a [[hand-held camera]] and [[zoom lens|zoom]] shots, which he felt lent realism to his films. He also was not averse to filming several movies at the same time, knocking together a second feature on the unsuspecting producer's dime. Many of his actors only found out years after the fact that Franco had actually starred them in films for which they had never even been paid.\n\nHis main claim to fame, however, is that he managed to write and direct around 160 motion pictures in his lifetime, encompassing a wide swath of different genres, with practically no financial backing available to him. (Note* - Some sources which list as many as 200 titles in Franco's filmography are relisting the same films several times under different variant titles).\n\nFranco attracted a circle of bizarre but loyal actors and technicians who moved with him over the years from project to project (while receiving very little, if any, money for their efforts). Many of his actors were over-the-hill performers in the twilight of their careers, many of his actresses shameless exhibitionists. He frequently worked with genre actors [[Howard Vernon]], [[Paul M\u00fcller (actor)|Paul M\u00fcller]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Jack Taylor (actor)|Jack Taylor]], [[Ewa Str\u00f6mberg]], [[Soledad Miranda]], [[Maria Rohm]], [[Monica Swinn]], [[William Berger (actor)|William Berger]], [[Dennis Price]], [[Alice Arno]], Montserrat Prous, Alberto Dalbes, Antonio Mayans, Britt Nichols, Pamela Stanford, Kali Hansa and [[Klaus Kinski]], all of whom are well known to cult film collectors.\n\n===''Zombie Lake'' vs. ''Oasis of the Zombies''===\nFranco was supposed to write and direct a film for Eurocine Productions in 1980 called ''Lake of the Living Dead'' (a horror film about revived Nazi zombies) but after submitting the basic plot summary, he had a falling out with the producers, Marius and Daniel Lesoeur, over the ridiculously low budget he was allotted, and the producers immediately hired French horror film director [[Jean Rollin]] to direct it (later re-titling it ''[[Zombie Lake]]''). Many fans regard this as a Franco film, although Franco only contributed the basic plot points. Rollin later said in interviews he only did the film as a favor for the Lesoeurs, and that if he had known \"how bad\" the script was, he would not have done it. He later deleted it from his filmography (the film did very well financially, however).\n\nThe Lesoeurs later had Rollin shoot new zombie footage in 1981 to be added to Franco's ''[[A Virgin Among the Living Dead]]'' (1973) for its 1981 re-release. Recently, Franco purists insisted that ''Virgin'' be released in its former unadulterated form on DVD, as the added Jean Rollin footage greatly slowed down the pace of the film and was really only filler material.\n\nFranco later directed another film for the Lesouers called ''[[Oasis of the Zombies]]'' (a.k.a. ''Bloodsucking Nazi Zombies'' on VHS) in 1981, which had a plot very similar to ''[[Zombie Lake]]'' (also involving revived Nazi zombies). Franco simultaneously shot a variant version of ''Oasis of the Zombies'' (on the producers' dime) starring Lina Romay and his \"regulars\" which was apparently released only in Spain, under the title ''La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes'' (which now appears to be lost).\n\n===Death===\nFranco suffered a severe stroke on 27 March 2013, and was taken to a hospital in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, where he died six days later, on the morning of 2 April. He was 82 years old.<ref name=\"obit\" />\n\n== Filmography (in order of production) ==\n(all films directed by Franco, unless noted otherwise)\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:LightSteelBlue\"| Films\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!

He assisted a number of directors such as [[Joaqu\u00edn Luis Romero Marchent]], [[Le\u00f3n Klimovsky]] and [[Juan Antonio Bardem]]. After working on more than 20 films, he decided to get into directing films in 1959, making a few musicals and a crime drama called ''Red Lips''.\n\nIn 1960, Franco took Marius Lesoeur and Sergio Newman, two producer friends, to a cinema to see the newly released [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] horror film ''[[The Brides of Dracula]]'' and the three men decided to get into the horror film business. His career took off in 1961 with ''[[The Awful Dr. Orloff]]'' (a.k.a. ''Gritos en la noche''), which received wide distribution in the United States and the UK. Franco wrote and directed ''Orloff'', and even supplied some of the music for the film. In the mid-1960s, he went on to direct two other horror films, then proceeded to turn out a number of [[James Bond]]-like spy thrillers and softcore sex films based on the works of the [[Marquis de Sade]] (which remained one of his major influences throughout his career).\n\nAlthough he had some American box office success with ''Necronomicon'' (1967), ''99 Women'' (1968) and two 1969 [[Christopher Lee]] films \u2013 ''The Bloody Judge'' and ''[[Count Dracula (1969 film)|Count Dracula]]'' \u2013 he never achieved wide commercial success. Many of his films were only distributed in Europe, and most of them were never dubbed into English. After discovering [[Soledad Miranda]] (he first used her in his ''Count Dracula''), Franco moved from Spain to France in 1969 so that he could make more violent and erotic films free of the strict censorship in Spain, and it was at this point that his career began to go downhill commercially as he turned to low-budget filmmaking with an accent on adult material. Soledad Miranda starred in a series of six erotic thrillers for Franco, all made within a one-year period (including ''[[Vampyros Lesbos]]''), after which she was killed in a tragic automobile accident in Portugal in 1970, just as her career was taking off.\n\nA year or two after Soledad Miranda died, a grieving Franco discovered a new leading lady in actress [[Lina Romay]]. At the time, the teenage Romay was married to a young actor/photographer named Ramon Ardid, but as she and Franco became more involved in their film projects together over the years, her marriage to Ramon ended in divorce around 1975.\n\nFranco was married at the time to Nicole Guettard (their marriage running approximately from 1962 through 1980), Ms. Guettard being gradually replaced in Franco's life by Lina Romay (Nicole worked as a script consultant on many of Franco's films while they were married, and even acted in a few of them. Her daughter from an earlier marriage, Caroline Riviere, also appeared in a few Franco films in the early 1970s (including the risque ''Exorcisme'' and ''The Perverse Countess'')).\n\nFranco and Lina Romay worked together for 40 years, and lived together from 1980 onward, although they were only ''officially'' married on 25 April 2008. Until her death in 2012 (from cancer at age 57), Romay was his most regular actress, as well as his life companion and muse. Although Romay was listed in the credits of several films as a co-director, actor Antonio Mayans stated in a recent interview that Franco used to credit her in that manner for business reasons, although she never actually co-directed any of their films together.\n\nAlthough he produced a number of relatively successful horror films in the early 1970s (''Dracula vs. Frankenstein'', ''[[The Bare-Breasted Countess]]'', ''[[A Virgin Among the Living Dead]]''), many people in the industry considered him a porn director due to the huge number of X-rated adult films he began turning out (even his 1970s horror films featured abundant nudity). Franco returned to low-budget horror in a brief comeback period from 1980\u20131983 (''Mondo Cannibale'', ''Bloody Moon'', ''Oasis of the Zombies'', ''Revenge in the House of Usher''), but after 1983, his career took a second downturn as he returned to making mostly pornographic films, most of which left nothing to the imagination.\n\nIn his later years, he did, however, get the opportunity to turn out two rather big-budget horror films \u2013 ''[[Faceless (film)|Faceless]]'' (1988) and ''Killer Barbys'' (1996) \u2013 both of which showed what great work he could still do when his projects were adequately funded. The entirety of his work after 1996 was direct-to-video films of very low quality, none of which were distributed theatrically. Romay died of cancer in 2012 at age 57, after which Franco died in April, 2013 from natural causes, at age 82.<ref name=\"sensacine\" />\n\nFranco sometimes worked under various [[pseudonym]]s, including '''David Khune''' and '''Frank Hollmann'''. A fan of [[Jazz|jazz music]] (and a musician himself), many of his pseudonyms were taken from jazz musicians such as [[Clifford Brown]] and [[James P. Johnson]].\n\nFranco's themes often revolved around [[lesbian vampire]]s, [[women in prison films|women in prison]], surgical horror, sadomasochism, zombies and sexploitation (including several films based on the writings of the [[Marquis de Sade]]). He worked in other [[exploitation film]] genres, such as [[cannibal film]]s, spy films, [[giallo]], crime films, science fiction, jungle adventure, Oriental menace, exorcist films, war movies, historical dramas and [[nunsploitation]]. His sex movies often contained long, uninterrupted shots of nude women writhing around on beds. Most of his hardcore films starred his lifelong companion [[Lina Romay]], who admitted in interviews to being an exhibitionist.\n\nFranco was known for his use of a [[hand-held camera]] and [[zoom lens|zoom]] shots, which he felt lent realism to his films. He also was not averse to filming several movies at the same time, knocking together a second feature on the unsuspecting producer's dime. Many of his actors only found out years after the fact that Franco had actually starred them in films for which they had never even been paid.\n\nHis main claim to fame, however, is that he managed to write and direct around 160 motion pictures in his lifetime, encompassing a wide swath of different genres, with practically no financial backing available to him. (Note* - Some sources which list as many as 200 titles in Franco's filmography are relisting the same films several times under different variant titles).\n\nFranco attracted a circle of bizarre but loyal actors and technicians who moved with him over the years from project to project (while receiving very little, if any, money for their efforts). Many of his actors were over-the-hill performers in the twilight of their careers, many of his actresses shameless exhibitionists. He frequently worked with genre actors [[Howard Vernon]], [[Paul M\u00fcller (actor)|Paul M\u00fcller]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Jack Taylor (actor)|Jack Taylor]], [[Ewa Str\u00f6mberg]], [[Soledad Miranda]], [[Maria Rohm]], [[Monica Swinn]], [[William Berger (actor)|William Berger]], [[Dennis Price]], [[Alice Arno]], Montserrat Prous, Alberto Dalbes, Antonio Mayans, Britt Nichols, Pamela Stanford, Kali Hansa and [[Klaus Kinski]], all of whom are well known to cult film collectors.\n\n===''Zombie Lake'' vs. ''Oasis of the Zombies''===\nFranco was supposed to write and direct a film for Eurocine Productions in 1980 called ''Lake of the Living Dead'' (a horror film about revived Nazi zombies) but after submitting the basic plot summary, he had a falling out with the producers, Marius and Daniel Lesoeur, over the ridiculously low budget he was allotted, and the producers immediately hired French horror film director [[Jean Rollin]] to direct it (later re-titling it ''[[Zombie Lake]]''). Many fans regard this as a Franco film, although Franco only contributed the basic plot points. Rollin later said in interviews he only did the film as a favor for the Lesoeurs, and that if he had known \"how bad\" the script was, he would not have done it. He later deleted it from his filmography (the film did very well financially, however).\n\nThe Lesoeurs later had Rollin shoot new zombie footage in 1981 to be added to Franco's ''[[A Virgin Among the Living Dead]]'' (1973) for its 1981 re-release. Recently, Franco purists insisted that ''Virgin'' be released in its former unadulterated form on DVD, as the added Jean Rollin footage greatly slowed down the pace of the film and was really only filler material.\n\nFranco later directed another film for the Lesouers called ''[[Oasis of the Zombies]]'' (a.k.a. ''Bloodsucking Nazi Zombies'' on VHS) in 1981, which had a plot very similar to ''[[Zombie Lake]]'' (also involving revived Nazi zombies). Franco simultaneously shot a variant version of ''Oasis of the Zombies'' (on the producers' dime) starring Lina Romay and his \"regulars\" which was apparently released only in Spain, under the title ''La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes'' (which now appears to be lost).\n\n===Death===\nFranco suffered a severe stroke on 27 March 2013, and was taken to a hospital in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, where he died six days later, on the morning of 2 April. He was 82 years old.<ref name=\"obit\" />\n\n== Filmography (in order of production) ==\n(all films directed by Franco, unless noted otherwise)\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:LightSteelBlue\"| Films\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!

In the novel, a group of five disaffected citizens, each representing a different ideological persuasion and personality type, conspire to overthrow the Russian imperial regime through a campaign of sustained revolutionary violence. The film, set in contemporary Paris and largely taking place in a small apartment, is structured as a series of personal and ideological dialogues dramatizing the interactions of five French university students \u2014 three young men and two young women \u2014 belonging to a radical [[Maoist]] group called the \"Aden Arabie Cell\" (named for the novel, ''Aden, Arabie'', by [[Paul Nizan]]).\n\nThe five members are V\u00e9ronique ([[Anne Wiazemsky]]), Guillaume ([[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]]), Yvonne ([[Juliet Berto]]), Henri (Michel Semeniako) and Kirilov (Lex de Bruijin). A black student named Omar (Omar Diop), \"Comrade X\", also makes a brief appearance. The two main characters, V\u00e9ronique and Guillaume Meister (the latter named after the titular hero of [[Goethe]]'s famous 1795 [[bildungsroman]] ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''), discuss the issue of revolutionary violence and the necessity of political assassination to achieve revolutionary goals. As an advocate of terrorism as a means of bringing about the revolution, Veronique roughly corresponds to the character of Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky in ''The Possessed''. V\u00e9ronique and Guillaume are engaged in a personal relationship, with V\u00e9ronique as the more committed, dominant partner.\n\nYvonne is a girl from the country who occasionally works as a prostitute for extra money to purchase consumer goods (much like Juliette Janson, the principal character in Godard's previous film, ''[[Two or Three Things I Know About Her]]'').  Yvonne does most of the housecleaning in the apartment and, together with Guillaume, she acts out satirical political skits protesting [[American imperialism]] in general, and U.S. President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Vietnam War|Vietnam policy]] in particular.\n\nHenri is eventually expelled from the group for his apparent backsliding Soviet revisionism, comically suggested by his defense of the 1954 [[Nicholas Ray]] movie ''[[Johnny Guitar]]''. In this sense he loosely corresponds to the character of Ivan Shatov in ''The Possessed'', a student who is marked for assassination because he has abandoned the tenets of leftist radicalism.\n\nKirilov is the only character in the film who actually takes his name from a character in Dostoyevsky's novel; in ''The Possessed'', Kirillov is a suicidal Russian engineer who has been driven to nihilism and insanity by the failure of his philosophical quest. True to his literary namesake, Godard's Kirilov also descends into madness and ultimately commits suicide.\n\nEventually, V\u00e9ronique's once tender feelings toward Guillaume sour, and she uses a declaration of \"unlove\" to teach him (and the audience) the Maoist lesson of \"struggle on two fronts\". V\u00e9ronique then leaves the apartment alone and sets off for what will prove to be a botched attempt to kill the [[Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union]] during his official diplomatic visit to France.\n\nOn the train ride ''en route'' to the planned assassination, V\u00e9ronique is engaged in a discussion with the political philosopher, [[Francis Jeanson]] (Jeanson was actually Anne Wiazemsky's philosophy professor at the [[Paris X University Nanterre]] during 1966\u201367; a few years earlier, he had once been a communist and the head of a [[Jeanson network|network]] which supported the Algerian national liberation movement. This led to his highly publicized arrest and trial by the French government in September 1960.)<ref name=\"godard70\">{{cite book\n | last1 = MacCabe | first1 = Colin\n | first2 =\n | first3 =\n | title = Godard: A Portrait of the Artist at Seventy\n | location =\n | publisher = [[Faber & Faber]]\n |date=February 2005\n | pages = 198\n \n | isbn = 0571211054 }}\n</ref>\n\nIn the scene on the train, Jeanson argues against the use of violence as a means to shut down the French universities.  However this does not dissuade V\u00e9ronique (for her dialogue in this scene, Godard fed Anne Wiazemsky her lines through an earpiece).<ref name=\"godard70\"/> The appearance of Francis Jeanson in the film seems to correspond with the character of Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky (Pyotr's father and Stavrogin's surrogate father) in ''The Possessed''.

In the novel, a group of five disaffected citizens, each representing a different ideological persuasion and personality type, conspire to overthrow the Russian imperial regime through a campaign of sustained revolutionary violence. The film, set in contemporary Paris and largely taking place in a small apartment, is structured as a series of personal and ideological dialogues dramatizing the interactions of five French university students \u2014 three young men and two young women \u2014 belonging to a radical [[Maoist]] group called the \"Aden Arabie Cell\" (named for the novel, ''Aden, Arabie'', by [[Paul Nizan]]).\n\nThe five members are V\u00e9ronique ([[Anne Wiazemsky]]), Guillaume ([[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]]), Yvonne ([[Juliet Berto]]), Henri (Michel Semeniako) and Kirilov (Lex de Bruijin). A black student named Omar (Omar Diop), \"Comrade X\", also makes a brief appearance. The two main characters, V\u00e9ronique and Guillaume Meister (the latter named after the titular hero of [[Goethe]]'s famous 1795 [[bildungsroman]] ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''), discuss the issue of revolutionary violence and the necessity of political assassination to achieve revolutionary goals. As an advocate of terrorism as a means of bringing about the revolution, Veronique roughly corresponds to the character of Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky in ''The Possessed''. V\u00e9ronique and Guillaume are engaged in a personal relationship, with V\u00e9ronique as the more committed, dominant partner.\n\nYvonne is a girl from the country who occasionally works as a prostitute for extra money to purchase consumer goods (much like Juliette Janson, the principal character in Godard's previous film, ''[[Two or Three Things I Know About Her]]'').  Yvonne does most of the housecleaning in the apartment and, together with Guillaume, she acts out satirical political skits protesting [[American imperialism]] in general, and U.S. President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Vietnam War|Vietnam policy]] in particular.\n\nHenri is eventually expelled from the group for his apparent backsliding Soviet revisionism, comically suggested by his defense of the 1954 [[Nicholas Ray]] movie ''[[Johnny Guitar]]''. In this sense he loosely corresponds to the character of Ivan Shatov in ''The Possessed'', a student who is marked for assassination because he has abandoned the tenets of leftist radicalism.\n\nKirilov is the only character in the film who actually takes his name from a character in Dostoyevsky's novel; in ''The Possessed'', Kirillov is a suicidal Russian engineer who has been driven to nihilism and insanity by the failure of his philosophical quest. True to his literary namesake, Godard's Kirilov also descends into madness and ultimately commits suicide.\n\nEventually, V\u00e9ronique's once tender feelings toward Guillaume sour, and she uses a declaration of \"unlove\" to teach him (and the audience) the Maoist lesson of \"struggle on two fronts\". V\u00e9ronique then leaves the apartment alone and sets off for what will prove to be a botched attempt to kill the [[Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union]] during his official diplomatic visit to France.\n\nOn the train ride ''en route'' to the planned assassination, V\u00e9ronique is engaged in a discussion with the political philosopher, [[Francis Jeanson]] (Jeanson was actually Anne Wiazemsky's philosophy professor at the [[Paris X University Nanterre]] during 1966\u201367; a few years earlier, he had once been a communist and the head of a [[Jeanson network|network]] which supported the Algerian national liberation movement. This led to his highly publicized arrest and trial by the French government in September 1960.)<ref name=\"godard70\">{{cite book\n | last1 = MacCabe | first1 = Colin\n | first2 =\n | first3 =\n | title = Godard: A Portrait of the Artist at Seventy\n | location =\n | publisher = [[Faber & Faber]]\n |date=February 2005\n | pages = 198\n \n | isbn = 0571211054 }}\n</ref>\n\nIn the scene on the train, Jeanson argues against the use of violence as a means to shut down the French universities.  However this does not dissuade V\u00e9ronique (for her dialogue in this scene, Godard fed Anne Wiazemsky her lines through an earpiece).<ref name=\"godard70\"/> The appearance of Francis Jeanson in the film seems to correspond with the character of Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky (Pyotr's father and Stavrogin's surrogate father) in ''The Possessed''. Indeed, much like Stepan Trofimovich, Jeanson is an intellectual and philosopher who serves as a kind of father-figure/mentor to V\u00e9ronique \u2014 and his early example as a supporter of terrorism makes him responsible for influencing much of the destruction which is to follow.\n\nEventually the train arrives at its destination, and V\u00e9ronique sets off to the hotel where the Soviet Minister of Culture is staying. She mistakenly reverses the digits of the room number and ends up killing the wrong man.
