While ''Rock am Ring'' takes place at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] race track, ''Rock im Park'' takes place at the [[Zeppelinfeld]] in [[N\u00fcrnberg]].\n\nBoth festivals are usually regarded as one event with a mostly identical lineup for both festivals. All artists perform one day at [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and another day in N\u00fcrnberg during the three-day event. There have been minor exceptions in the past years where an artist would be announced for one of the festivals only. Combined, Rock im Park and Rock am Ring are the largest music festivals held in Germany and one of the largest in the world with a combined attendance of over 150,000 people in 2007, selling out both events in advance for the first time.<ref>Robertson, Joel (17 November 2014).

However, after a dip in attendance for the 1988 event, the festival was put on hiatus for two years. In 1991, the festival returned with a new concept: as well as featuring well-known artists, event organizers present lesser known up-and-coming bands to the public. In 1993, Rock im Park took place for the first time in [[Vienna]]. For the 1994 event, Rock im Park moved to the disused [[Munich-Riem airport]], and the following year to Munich's [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]], where it found a home for the 1995 and 1996 event. 1997 Rock im Park moved to Nuremberg's [[Frankenstadion]] where it was held until the venue was unavailable in 2004 because the stadium was being renovated for the [[2006 Football World Cup]]. Since 2004 the venue moved again to the current Zeppellinfeld, where Rock im Park was since held with the exception of the 2006 festival, which was moved to the Luitpoldhain.\n\nThe 2007 festival was used in a science experiment to test the effects of large bodies of people simultaneously jumping. The experiment data was used to calculate the result if the entire Chinese population were to jump in unison. The experiment concluded no significant results would come from the theoretical event.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rock Festival as Human Experiment (dead link as of 2011-11-25) | work=blog.sciam.com | url=http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&ref=rss | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713222937/http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&ref=rss | archivedate=2007-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nAfter 29 editions of Rock am Ring, the new owner of the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] decided that the contract would not be extended. The festival continued at another location in 2015 and 2016 ([[Mendig Air Base|Mendig Air Base/Vulkaneifel]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlk.com/news/2990 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 13,

However, on the morning of 3 June, after a search of the grounds and a raid of the suspect's homes, the police announced that the suspicion of a threatening attack had not been substantiated, so that the festival could continue on Saturday noon.

While ''Rock am Ring'' takes place at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] race track, ''Rock im Park'' takes place at the [[Zeppelinfeld]] in [[N\u00fcrnberg]].\n\nBoth festivals are usually regarded as one event with a mostly identical lineup for both festivals. All artists perform one day at [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and another day in N\u00fcrnberg during the three-day event. There have been minor exceptions in the past years where an artist would be announced for one of the festivals only. Combined, Rock im Park and Rock am Ring are the largest music festivals held in Germany and one of the largest in the world with a combined attendance of over 150,000 people in 2007, selling out both events in advance for the first time.<ref>Robertson, Joel (17 November 2014).

However, after a dip in attendance for the 1988 event, the festival was put on hiatus for two years. In 1991, the festival returned with a new concept: as well as featuring well-known artists, event organizers present lesser known up-and-coming bands to the public. In 1993, Rock im Park took place for the first time in [[Vienna]]. For the 1994 event, Rock im Park moved to the disused [[Munich-Riem airport]], and the following year to Munich's [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]], where it found a home for the 1995 and 1996 event. 1997 Rock im Park moved to Nuremberg's [[Frankenstadion]] where it was held until the venue was unavailable in 2004 because the stadium was being renovated for the [[2006 Football World Cup]]. Since 2004 the venue moved again to the current Zeppellinfeld, where Rock im Park was since held with the exception of the 2006 festival, which was moved to the Luitpoldhain.\n\nThe 2007 festival was used in a science experiment to test the effects of large bodies of people simultaneously jumping. The experiment data was used to calculate the result if the entire Chinese population were to jump in unison. The experiment concluded no significant results would come from the theoretical event.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rock Festival as Human Experiment (dead link as of 2011-11-25) | work=blog.sciam.com | url=http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&ref=rss | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713222937/http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&ref=rss | archivedate=2007-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nAfter 29 editions of Rock am Ring, the new owner of the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] decided that the contract would not be extended.

Rockefeller]]'s partners in the formation of the [[Standard Oil Company]] (now Exxon), as well as founder of [[Charles Pratt and Company]] in New York and [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. \n\nRegister graduated from the [[Lawrenceville School]] in New Jersey. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with B.A. in Literature in 1961, he met his wife Catherine Richards in a photography class at  [[ArtCenter College of Design|Pasadena Art Center]] where he studied commercial art. Register also studied painting for a semester at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in Paris,<ref name=\"swart\"/> and later studied at the [[California School of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco.  \n\nIn 1964 the two moved to New York, where Register studied design and television at the [[Pratt Institute]] (founded by his great-grandfather).<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> They married on February 6, 1964 and together had three children. During this period Register pursued a successful career as an advertising art director at Young & Rubicam and later McCaffrey and McCall &mdash; and lived in a Fifth Avenue apartment.<ref name=\"swart\"/>  In 1972, just after his 33rd birthday and unhappy with his work,<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> Register excused himself from an important client meeting saying he had a dental appointment, wrote a note to his boss and never returned.

It is native to parts of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. First formally [[species description|described]] by [[Albert G\u00fcnther]] in 1864, it is the second-longest venomous snake after the [[king cobra]]; mature specimens generally exceed {{convert|2|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} and commonly grow to {{convert|3|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}. Specimens of {{convert|4.3|to|4.5|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} have been reported. Its skin colour varies from grey to dark brown. Juvenile black mambas tend to be paler than adults and darken with age.\n\nThe species is both [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] (ground-living) and [[arboreal]] (tree-living); it inhabits [[savannah]], [[woodland]], rocky slopes and in some regions, dense forest. It is [[Diurnality|diurnal]] and is known to prey on birds and small mammals. Over suitable surfaces, it can move at speeds up to {{convert|16|km/h|abbr =on|0}} for short distances. Adult black mambas have few natural predators.\n\nIn a [[threat display]], the black mamba usually opens its inky-black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and sometimes hisses. It is capable of striking at considerable range and may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of  [[neurotoxin]]s that often induce symptoms within ten minutes, and is frequently fatal unless [[antivenom]] is administered. Despite its reputation as a formidable and highly aggressive species, the black mamba attacks humans only if it is threatened or cornered. It is rated as [[least concern]] on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]].\n\n\n\n\n\n  In 2018,Ryan Soobrayan ,a herpetologist died because of a black mamba\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe first [[Species description|formal description]] of the black mamba was made in 1864 by German-born British zoologist [[Albert G\u00fcnther]].<ref name=\"ITIS\" /><ref name=Database/> A single specimen was one of many species of  snake collected by [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]], a naturalist who accompanied [[David Livingstone]] on the 1858\u20131864 [[Second Zambesi expedition]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=G\u00fcnther | first=Albert | year= 1864 | title= Report on a collection of reptiles and fishes made by Dr. Kirk in the Zambesi and Nyassa Regions | journal= Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London | volume=1864 | pages=303\u2013314 [310] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/28500629}}</ref> This specimen is the [[holotype]] and is housed in the [[Natural History Museum, London]].<ref name=\"Database\"/> The generic name of the species is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''dendron'' (''\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd''), \"tree\", and ''aspis'' (''\u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03c2'') \"[[Asp (reptile)|asp]]\", and the [[Binomial nomenclature|specific epithet]] ''polylepis'' is derived from the Ancient Greek ''poly'' (''\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd'') meaning \"many\" and ''lepis'' (''\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2'') meaning \"scale\".<ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book |author= Liddell, Henry George |author2= Scott, Robert |pages= [https://archive.org/details/lexicon00lidd/page/109 109, 154, 410, 575] |year= 1980 |title= A Greek-English Lexicon |edition= Abridged |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-910207-5 |title-link= A Greek-English Lexicon |author2-link= Robert Scott (philologist) |author-link= Henry George Liddell }}</ref> The term \"mamba\" is derived from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word \"''imamba''\" (meaning scales).<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of mamba in English|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mamba|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=OED|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref> In Tanzania, a local [[Ngindo language|Ngindo]] name is ''ndemalunyayo'' (\"grass-cutter\") because it supposedly clips grass.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/28882142 | title=On reptiles and amphibians for Tanganyika Territory collected by C.J.

On the ground, it moves with its head and neck raised, and typically uses termite mounds, abandoned burrows, rock crevices and tree cracks as shelter. Black mambas are [[Diurnality|diurnal]]; in South Africa, they are recorded to [[Sunning (behaviour)|bask]] between 7 and 10 am and again from 2 to 4 pm.

Bleeding profusely, he did not seek medical attention, and except for intense pain and local swelling overnight, he was not affected. This led him to believe that either the snake gave him a \"[[dry bite]]\" (a bite without injecting venom) or the heavy bleeding pushed the venom out. Some commenters on the story suggested that it was a [[venomoid]] snake (in which the venom glands are surgically removed), but Laita responded that it was not.

It is native to parts of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. First formally [[species description|described]] by [[Albert G\u00fcnther]] in 1864, it is the second-longest venomous snake after the [[king cobra]]; mature specimens generally exceed {{convert|2|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} and commonly grow to {{convert|3|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}. Specimens of {{convert|4.3|to|4.5|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} have been reported. Its skin colour varies from grey to dark brown. Juvenile black mambas tend to be paler than adults and darken with age.\n\nThe species is both [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] (ground-living) and [[arboreal]] (tree-living); it inhabits [[savannah]], [[woodland]], rocky slopes and in some regions, dense forest. It is [[Diurnality|diurnal]] and is known to prey on birds and small mammals. Over suitable surfaces, it can move at speeds up to {{convert|16|km/h|abbr =on|0}} for short distances. Adult black mambas have few natural predators.\n\nIn a [[threat display]], the black mamba usually opens its inky-black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and sometimes hisses. It is capable of striking at considerable range and may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of  [[neurotoxin]]s that often induce symptoms within ten minutes, and is frequently fatal unless [[antivenom]] is administered. Despite its reputation as a formidable and highly aggressive species, the black mamba attacks humans only if it is threatened or cornered. It is rated as [[least concern]] on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe first [[Species description|formal description]] of the black mamba was made in 1864 by German-born British zoologist [[Albert G\u00fcnther]].<ref name=\"ITIS\" /><ref name=Database/> A single specimen was one of many species of  snake collected by [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]], a naturalist who accompanied [[David Livingstone]] on the 1858\u20131864 [[Second Zambesi expedition]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=G\u00fcnther | first=Albert | year= 1864 | title= Report on a collection of reptiles and fishes made by Dr. Kirk in the Zambesi and Nyassa Regions | journal= Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London | volume=1864 | pages=303\u2013314 [310] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/28500629}}</ref> This specimen is the [[holotype]] and is housed in the [[Natural History Museum, London]].<ref name=\"Database\"/> The generic name of the species is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''dendron'' (''\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd''), \"tree\", and ''aspis'' (''\u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03c2'') \"[[Asp (reptile)|asp]]\", and the [[Binomial nomenclature|specific epithet]] ''polylepis'' is derived from the Ancient Greek ''poly'' (''\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd'') meaning \"many\" and ''lepis'' (''\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2'') meaning \"scale\".<ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book |author= Liddell, Henry George |author2= Scott, Robert |pages= [https://archive.org/details/lexicon00lidd/page/109 109, 154, 410, 575] |year= 1980 |title= A Greek-English Lexicon |edition= Abridged |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-910207-5 |title-link= A Greek-English Lexicon |author2-link= Robert Scott (philologist) |author-link= Henry George Liddell }}</ref> The term \"mamba\" is derived from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word \"''imamba''\" (meaning scales).<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of mamba in English|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mamba|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=OED|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref> In Tanzania, a local [[Ngindo language|Ngindo]] name is ''ndemalunyayo'' (\"grass-cutter\") because it supposedly clips grass.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/28882142 | title=On reptiles and amphibians for Tanganyika Territory collected by C.J.

Knopf, New York, 1995, p.11, {{ISBN|0-394-54664-4}}</ref> Although not so successful as his forebears, Garrett provided well for his two children with considerable help from his wife's inheritance. He retired at age forty-nine.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 9</ref> Edward and his only sister Marion attended both private and public schools. They were raised in a strict [[Baptist]] home.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 12</ref> His father had a mild nature, and the household was dominated by women: Hopper's mother, grandmother, sister, and maid.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 23</ref>\n\nHis [[Edward Hopper Birthplace and Boyhood Home|birthplace and boyhood home]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.

He readily absorbed his father's [[intellect]]ual tendencies and love of [[Culture of France|French]] and [[Russian culture|Russian]] cultures. He also demonstrated his mother's artistic heritage.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 12, 16</ref> Hopper's parents encouraged his art and kept him amply supplied with materials, instructional magazines, and illustrated books. Hopper first began signing and dating his drawings at the age of ten. The earliest of these drawings include charcoal sketches of geometric shapes, including a vase, bowl, cup and boxes.<ref name=\":0\">Levin 1995, p. 16-18</ref> The detailed examination of light and shadow which carried on throughout the rest of his career can already be found in these early works.<ref name=\":0\" /> By his teens, he was working in pen-and-ink, charcoal, watercolor, and oil\u2014drawing from nature as well as making political cartoons.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 20</ref> In 1895, he created his first signed oil painting, ''Rowboat in Rocky Cove''. It shows his early interest in nautical subjects.<ref>Levin, Gail, ''The Complete Oil Paintings of Edward Hopper'', W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 2001, p. 1, {{ISBN|0-393-04996-5}}</ref>\n\nIn his early self-portraits, Hopper tended to represent himself as skinny, ungraceful, and homely. Though a tall and quiet teenager, his prankish sense of humor found outlet in his art, sometimes in depictions of immigrants or of women dominating men in comic situations. Later in life, he mostly depicted women as the figures in his paintings.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 23, 25</ref> In high school, he dreamed of being a [[naval architect]], but after graduation he declared his intention to follow an art career. Hopper's parents insisted that he study commercial art to have a reliable means of income.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 8\">Maker 1990, p. 8</ref> In developing his self-image and individualistic philosophy of life, Hopper was influenced by the writings of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He later said, \"I admire him greatly...I read him over and over again.\"<ref>Wagstaff, Sheena Ed., ''Edward Hopper'', Tate Publishing, London, 2004, p. 16, {{ISBN|1-85437-533-4}}</ref>\n\nHopper began art studies with a correspondence course in 1899. Soon he transferred to the New York School of Art and Design, the forerunner of [[Parsons The New School for Design]]. There he studied for six years, with teachers including [[William Merritt Chase]], who instructed him in oil painting.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 8\" /> Early on, Hopper modeled his style after Chase and French Impressionist masters [[\u00c9douard Manet]] and [[Edgar Degas]].<ref>Levin 1995, p. 40</ref> Sketching from live models proved a challenge and a shock for the conservatively raised Hopper.\n\nAnother of his teachers, artist [[Robert Henri]], taught life class. Henri encouraged his students to use their art to \"make a stir in the world\". He also advised his students, \"It isn't the subject that counts but what you feel about it\" and \"Forget about art and paint pictures of what interests you in life.\"<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 8\" /> In this manner, Henri influenced Hopper, as well as future artists [[George Bellows]] and [[Rockwell Kent]]. He encouraged them to imbue a modern spirit in their work. Some artists in Henri's circle, including [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], became members of \"The Eight\", also known as the [[Ashcan School]] of [[American Art]].<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 9\">Maker 1990, p. 9</ref> Hopper's first existing oil painting to hint at his use of interiors as a theme was ''Solitary Figure in a Theater'' (c.1904).<ref>Levin 2001, p. 19</ref> During his student years, he also painted dozens of nudes, still life studies, landscapes, and portraits, including his self-portraits.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Hopper landed a part-time job with an advertising agency, where he created cover designs for trade magazines.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 48</ref> Hopper came to detest illustration. He was bound to it by economic necessity until the mid-1920s.<ref>Maker 1990, p. 11</ref> He temporarily escaped by making three trips to Europe, each centered in Paris, ostensibly to study the art scene there. In fact, however, he studied alone and seemed mostly unaffected by the new currents in art. Later he said that he \"didn't remember having heard of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] at all.\"<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 9\" /> He was highly impressed by [[Rembrandt]], particularly his ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'', which he said was \"the most wonderful thing of his I have seen; it's past belief in its reality.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 17</ref>\n\nHopper began painting urban and architectural scenes in a dark palette. Then he shifted to the lighter palette of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] before returning to the darker palette with which he was comfortable. Hopper later said, \"I got over that and later things done in Paris were more the kind of things I do now.\"<ref>Levin 1995, p. 66</ref> Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and caf\u00e9 scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract [[cubism|cubist]] experiments, Hopper was attracted to [[Realism (arts)|realist art]]. Later, he admitted to no European influences other than French engraver [[Charles M\u00e9ryon]], whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.<ref>Maker 1990, p. 10</ref>\n\n=== Years of struggle ===\n\nAfter returning from his last European trip, Hopper rented a studio in New York City, where he struggled to define his own style. Reluctantly, he returned to illustration to support himself. Being a freelancer, Hopper was forced to solicit for projects, and had to knock on the doors of magazine and agency offices to find business.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 85</ref> His painting languished: \"it's hard for me to decide what I want to paint. I go for months without finding it sometimes.

Each form influenced his compositional methods.<ref>Levin 2001, pp. 74\u201377</ref>\n\nAt an impasse over his oil paintings, in 1915 Hopper turned to [[etching]]. By 1923 he had produced most of his approximately 70 works in this medium, many of urban scenes of both [[Paris]] and New York.<ref>Maker 1990, p. 12</ref><ref>Kranzfelder, Ivo, and Edward Hopper, ''Edward Hopper, 1882\u20131967: Vision of Reality'', New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 2003, p. 13, {{ISBN|0760748772}}</ref> He also produced some posters for the war effort, as well as continuing with occasional commercial projects.<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 120\">Levin 1995, p. 120</ref> When he could, Hopper did some outdoor watercolors on visits to New England, especially at the art colonies at [[Ogunquit]], and [[Monhegan Island]].\n\nDuring the early 1920s his etchings began to receive public recognition. They expressed some of his later themes, as in ''Night on the El Train'' (couples in silence), ''Evening Wind'' (solitary female), and ''The Catboat'' (simple nautical scene).<ref>Maker 1990, p. 13-15</ref> Two notable oil paintings of this time were ''New York Interior'' (1921) and ''New York Restaurant'' (1922).<ref>Levin 2001, p. 151, 153</ref> He also painted two of his many \"window\" paintings to come: ''[[Girl at Sewing Machine]]'' and ''Moonlight Interior'', both of which show a figure (clothed or nude) near a window of an apartment viewed as gazing out or from the point of view from the outside looking in.<ref>Levin 2001, pp. 152, 155</ref>\n\nAlthough these were frustrating years, Hopper gained some recognition. In 1918, Hopper was awarded the U.S. Shipping Board Prize for his war poster, \"Smash the Hun.\" He participated in three exhibitions: in 1917 with the Society of Independent Artists, in January 1920 (a one-man exhibition at the Whitney Studio Club, which was the precursor to the Whitney Museum), and in 1922 (again with the Whitney Studio Club). In 1923, Hopper received two awards for his [[etching]]s: the [[Logan Medal of the Arts|Logan Prize]] from the [[Chicago Society of Etchers]], and the W.&nbsp;A. Bryan Prize.<ref>Levin, Gail, \"Edward Hopper: Chronology\" in ''Edward Hopper at Kennedy Galleries'' New York: Kennedy Galleries, 1977.</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and breakthrough ===\nBy 1923, Hopper's slow climb finally produced a breakthrough. He re-encountered [[Josephine Hopper|Josephine Nivison]], an artist and former student of [[Robert Henri]], during a summer painting trip in Gloucester, Massachusetts. They were opposites: she was short, open, gregarious, sociable, and liberal, while he was tall, secretive, shy, quiet, introspective, and conservative.<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 120\" /> They married a year later. She remarked: \"Sometimes talking to Eddie is just like dropping a stone in a well, except that it doesn't thump when it hits bottom.\"<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 16\">Maker 1990, p. 16</ref> She subordinated her career to his and shared his reclusive life style. The rest of their lives revolved around their spare walk-up apartment in the city and their summers in [[Truro, Massachusetts|South Truro]] on [[Cape Cod]]. She managed his career and his interviews, was his primary model, and was his life companion.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 16\" />\n\nWith Nivison's help, six of Hopper's Gloucester watercolors were admitted to an exhibit at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1923. One of them, ''The Mansard Roof'', was purchased by the museum for its permanent collection for the sum of $100.<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 171\">Levin 1995, p. 171</ref> The critics generally raved about his work; one stated, \"What vitality, force and directness! Observe what can be done with the homeliest subject.\"<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 171\" /> Hopper sold all his watercolors at a one-man show the following year and finally decided to put illustration behind him.\n\nThe artist had demonstrated his ability to transfer his attraction to Parisian architecture to American urban and rural architecture. According to [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] [[curator]] Carol Troyen, \"Hopper really liked the way these houses, with their [[turret]]s and [[tower]]s and [[porch]]es and [[mansard roof]]s and ornament cast wonderful shadows. He always said that his favorite thing was painting sunlight on the side of a house.\"<ref name=\"shea\">''[http://www.wbur.org/2007/07/06/hoppers-gloucester/9309 Hopper's Gloucester]'', Andrea Shea, [[WBUR]], July 6, 2007.</ref>\n\nAt forty-one, Hopper received further recognition for his work. He continued to harbor bitterness about his career, later turning down appearances and awards.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 16\" /> With his financial stability secured by steady sales, Hopper would live a simple, stable life and continue creating art in his personal style for four more decades.\n\nHis ''Two on the Aisle'' (1927) sold for a personal record $1,500, enabling Hopper to purchase an automobile, which he used to make field trips to remote areas of New England.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 230\">Wagstaff 2004, p. 230</ref> In 1929, he produced ''Chop Suey'' and ''Railroad Sunset''. The following year, art patron Stephen Clark donated ''House by the Railroad'' (1925) to the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the first oil painting that it acquired for its collection.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 161</ref> Hopper painted his last self-portrait in oil around 1930. Although Josephine posed for many of his paintings, she sat for only one formal oil portrait by her husband, ''Jo Painting'' (1936).<ref>Levin 2001, p. 246</ref>\n\nHopper fared better than many other artists during the [[Great Depression]]. His stature took a sharp rise in 1931 when major museums, including the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], paid thousands of dollars for his works. He sold 30 paintings that year, including 13 watercolors.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 230\" /> The following year he participated in the first [[Whitney Biennial|Whitney Annual]], and he continued to exhibit in every annual at the museum for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 230\" /> In 1933, the Museum of Modern Art gave Hopper his first large-scale retrospective.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 17\">Maker 1990, p. 17</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the Hoppers rented a cottage in South Truro, on Cape Cod. They returned every summer for the rest of their lives, building a summer house there in 1934.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Allman|first1=William G.|title=New additions to the Oval Office|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/02/10/new-additions-oval-office|publisher=The White House|accessdate=11 February 2016|date=10 February 2014}}</ref> From there, they would take driving trips into other areas when Hopper needed to search for fresh material to paint. In the summers of 1937 and 1938, the couple spent extended sojourns on Wagon Wheels Farm in [[South Royalton, Vermont]], where Hopper painted a series of watercolors along the White River. These scenes are atypical among Hopper's mature works, as most are \"pure\" landscapes, devoid of architecture or human figures. ''First Branch of the White River'' (1938), now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is the most well-known of Hopper's Vermont landscapes.<ref name=\"Clause 2012\">Clause 2012</ref>\n\nHopper was very productive through the 1930s and early 1940s, producing among many important works ''[[New York Movie]]'' (1939), ''Girlie Show'' (1941), ''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'' (1942), ''[[Hotel Lobby]]'' (1943), and ''Morning in a City'' (1944). During the late 1940s, however, he suffered a period of relative inactivity. He admitted: \"I wish I could paint more. I get sick of reading and going to the movies.\"<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 232\">Wagstaff 2004, p. 232</ref> During the next two decades, his health faltered, and he had several prostate surgeries and other medical problems.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 232\" /> But, in the 1950s and early 1960s, he created several more major works, including ''First Row Orchestra'' (1951); as well as ''Morning Sun'' and ''[[Hotel by a Railroad]]'', both in 1952; and ''Intermission'' in 1963.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 233</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:3 Washington Square North, NYC.JPG|thumb|Where Hopper lived in New York City, 3 Washington Square North]]\n[[File:Grabstein Edward Hopper.JPG|thumb|Gravestone Edward and Josephine H., Oak Hill Cemetery Nyack]]\n\nHopper died in his studio near [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] in New York City on May 15, 1967.

Hopper was someone drawn to an emblematic, anti-narrative [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]],<ref>Anfam, David, \"Review of 'A Catalogue of Raisonne by -[[Gail Levin (art historian)|Gail Levin]]',\" ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', 1999.</ref> who \"painted short isolated moments of configuration, saturated with suggestion\".<ref>Strand, Mark, ''Hopper'', Knopf Publishing, 1994 {{ISBN|9780307701244}}</ref> His silent spaces and uneasy encounters \"touch us where we are most vulnerable\",<ref>Berman, Avis, \"Hopper the Supreme American Realist of the 20th Century\", ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' June 2007</ref> and have \"a suggestion of melancholy, that melancholy being enacted\".<ref>Strand, Mark, \"Review of 'Hopper Drawing' Whitney Museum 2013\", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', June 2015</ref> His sense of color revealed him as a pure painter<ref>''Art Digest'' April 1937 'Carnegie Traces Hopper's Rise to Fame'</ref> as he \"turned the [[Puritan]] into the purist, in his quiet canvasses where blemishes and blessings balance\".<ref>\"The Silent Witness\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', December 24, 1956</ref> According to critic [[Lloyd Goodrich]], he was \"an eminently native painter, who more than any other was getting more of the quality of America into his canvases\".<ref>Maker, Sherry, ''Edward Hopper'', Brompton Books, New York, 1990, p. 6, {{ISBN|0-517-01518-8}}</ref><ref>Goodrich, Lloyd, \"The Paintings of Edward Hopper\", ''[[The Arts]]'', March 1927</ref>\n\nConservative in politics and social matters (Hopper asserted for example that \"artists' lives should be written by people very close to them\"),<ref>Interview in 1960 with Katherine Kuhn, quoted in her ''The Artist's Voice'', Harper and Row, New York, 1960</ref> he accepted things as they were and displayed a lack of idealism. Cultured and sophisticated, he was well-read, and many of his paintings show figures reading.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 88</ref> He was generally good company and unperturbed by silences, though sometimes taciturn, grumpy, or detached. He was always serious about his art and the art of others, and when asked would return frank opinions.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nHopper's most systematic declaration of his philosophy as an artist was given in a handwritten note, entitled \"Statement\", submitted in 1953 to the journal, ''Reality'':\n\n<blockquote>Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world. No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination. One of the weaknesses of much abstract painting is the attempt to substitute the inventions of the human intellect for a private imaginative conception.\n\nThe inner life of a human being is a vast and varied realm and does not concern itself alone with stimulating arrangements of color, form and design.\n\nThe term life used in art is something not to be held in contempt, for it implies all of existence and the province of art is to react to it and not to shun it.\n\nPainting will have to deal more fully and less obliquely with life and nature's phenomena before it can again become great.<ref>Edward Hopper, \"Statement.\" Published as a part of \"Statements by Four Artists\" in ''Reality'', vol. 1, no. 1 (spring 1953). Hopper's handwritten draft is reproduced in Levin, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography'', p. 461.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThough Hopper claimed that he didn't consciously embed psychological meaning in his paintings, he was deeply interested in [[Freud]] and the power of the subconscious mind. He wrote in 1939, \"So much of every art is an expression of the subconscious that it seems to me most of all the important qualities are put there unconsciously, and little of importance by the conscious intellect.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 71</ref>\n\n=== Methods ===\n\nAlthough he is best known for his [[oil painting]]s, Hopper initially achieved recognition for his watercolors and he also produced some commercially successful etchings. Additionally, his notebooks contain high-quality pen and pencil sketches, which were never meant for public viewing.\n\nHopper paid particular attention to geometrical design and the careful placement of human figures in proper balance with their environment. He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, \"It takes a long time for an idea to strike. Then I have to think about it for a long time. I don't start painting until I have it all worked out in my mind. I'm all right when I get to the easel\".<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 98</ref> He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as \"sad face of woman unlit\", \"electric light from ceiling\", and \"thighs cooler\".<ref>Levin 2001, p. 254</ref>\n\nFor ''New York Movie'' (1939), Hopper demonstrates his thorough preparation with more than 53 sketches of the theater interior and the figure of the pensive usherette.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 261</ref>\n\nThe effective use of light and shadow to create mood also is central to Hopper's methods. Bright sunlight (as an emblem of insight or revelation), and the shadows it casts, also play symbolically powerful roles in Hopper paintings such as ''[[Early Sunday Morning]]'' (1930), ''Summertime'' (1943), ''Seven A.M.'' (1948), and ''Sun in an Empty Room'' (1963). His use of light and shadow effects have been compared to the cinematography of ''[[film noir]]''.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 92</ref>\n\nAlthough a realist painter, Hopper's \"soft\" realism simplified shapes and details. He used saturated color to heighten contrast and create mood.\n\n=== Subjects and themes ===\nHopper derived his subject matter from two primary sources: one, the common features of American life (gas stations, motels, restaurants, theaters, railroads, and street scenes) and its inhabitants; and two, seascapes and rural landscapes. Regarding his style, Hopper defined himself as \"an amalgam of many races\" and not a member of any school, particularly the \"[[Ashcan School]]\".<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 13\">Wagstaff 2004, p. 13</ref> Once Hopper achieved his mature style, his art remained consistent and self-contained, in spite of the numerous art trends that came and went during his long career.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 13\" />\n\nHopper's seascapes fall into three main groups: pure landscapes of rocks, sea, and beach grass; lighthouses and farmhouses; and sailboats. Sometimes he combined these elements. Most of these paintings depict strong light and fair weather; he showed little interest in snow or rain scenes, or in seasonal color changes. He painted the majority of the pure seascapes in the period between 1916 and 1919 on [[Monhegan Island]].<ref>Levin 2001, pp. 130\u2013145</ref> Hopper's ''The Long Leg'' (1935) is a nearly all-blue sailing picture with the simplest of elements, while his ''Ground Swell'' (1939) is more complex and depicts a group of youngsters out for a sail, a theme reminiscent of [[Winslow Homer]]'s iconic [[Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)|''Breezing Up'']] (1876).<ref>Levin 2001, p. 266</ref>\n\nUrban architecture and cityscapes also were major subjects for Hopper. He was fascinated with the American urban scene, \"our native architecture with its hideous beauty, its fantastic roofs, pseudo-gothic, French [[Mansard]], Colonial, mongrel or what not, with eye-searing color or delicate harmonies of faded paint, shouldering one another along interminable streets that taper off into swamps or dump heaps.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 67</ref>\n\nIn 1925, he produced ''House by the Railroad''. This classic work depicts an isolated [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] wood mansion, partly obscured by the raised embankment of a railroad. It marked Hopper's artistic maturity. Lloyd Goodrich praised the work as \"one of the most poignant and desolating pieces of realism.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 229</ref> The work is the first of a series of stark rural and urban scenes that uses sharp lines and large shapes, played upon by unusual lighting to capture the lonely mood of his subjects. Although critics and viewers interpret meaning and mood in these cityscapes, Hopper insisted \"I was more interested in the sunlight on the buildings and on the figures than any symbolism.\"<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 12\">Wagstaff 2004, p. 12</ref> As if to prove the point, his late painting ''Sun in an Empty Room'' (1963) is a pure study of sunlight.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 28</ref>\n\nMost of Hopper's figure paintings focus on the subtle interaction of human beings with their environment\u2014carried out with solo figures, couples, or groups. His primary emotional themes are solitude, loneliness, regret, boredom, and resignation. He expresses the emotions in various environments, including the office, in public places, in apartments, on the road, or on vacation.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, pp. 70\u201371</ref> As if he were creating stills for a movie or tableaux in a play, Hopper positioned his characters as if they were captured just before or just after the climax of a scene.<ref>[[Lloyd Goodrich|Goodrich, Lloyd]], ''Edward Hopper'', [[New York City|New York]]: H. N. Abrams, 1971</ref>\n\nHopper's solitary figures are mostly women\u2014dressed, semi-clad, and nude\u2014often reading or looking out a window, or in the workplace. In the early 1920s, Hopper painted his first such images ''Girl at Sewing Machine'' (1921), ''New York Interior'' (another woman sewing) (1921), and ''Moonlight Interior'' (a nude getting into bed) (1923). ''Automat'' (1927) and ''Hotel Room'' (1931), however, are more representative of his mature style, emphasizing the solitude more overtly.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 169, 213</ref>\n\nAs Hopper scholar, Gail Levin, wrote of ''Hotel Room'':\n<blockquote>The spare vertical and diagonal bands of color and sharp electric shadows create a concise and intense drama in the night...Combining poignant subject matter with such a powerful formal arrangement, Hopper's composition is pure enough to approach an almost abstract sensibility, yet layered with a poetic meaning for the observer.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 212</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHopper's ''Room in New York'' (1932) and ''Cape Cod Evening'' (1939) are prime examples of his \"couple\" paintings. In the first, a young couple appear alienated and uncommunicative\u2014he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes on the role of a [[voyeur]], as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters.<ref name=\"Levin 2001, p. 220, 264\">Levin 2001, p. 220, 264</ref> Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with ''Excursion into Philosophy '' (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly on the edge of a bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, \"[T]he open book is [[Plato]], reread too late\".\n\nLevin interprets the painting:\n<blockquote>Plato's philosopher, in search of the real and the true, must turn away from this transitory realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper's painting is positioned between the lure of the earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of thinking about this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]].<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 55</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Office at Night]]'' (1940), another \"couple\" painting, Hopper creates a psychological puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing on his work papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the [[eroticism]] and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman's appeal or that he is working hard to ignore her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources,<ref name=\"Levin 2001, p. 220, 264\" /> from a desk lamp, through a window and indirect light from above. Hopper went on to make several \"office\" pictures, but no others with a sensual undercurrent.\n\n[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'' (1942)]]\n[[File:\"Night Hawks\" in the Art Institute of Chicago.jpg|thumb|300px|\"Nighthawks\" in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\nThe best-known of Hopper's paintings, ''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'' (1942), is one of his paintings of groups. It shows customers sitting at the counter of an all-night [[diner]]. The shapes and diagonals are carefully constructed. The viewpoint is cinematic\u2014from the sidewalk, as if the viewer were approaching the restaurant. The diner's harsh electric light sets it apart from the dark night outside, enhancing the mood and subtle emotion.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 288</ref> As in many Hopper paintings, the interaction is minimal. The restaurant depicted was inspired by one in Greenwich Village. Both Hopper and his wife posed for the figures, and Jo Hopper gave the painting its title. The inspiration for the picture may have come from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s short story \"[[The Killers (Hemingway short story)|The Killers]]\", which Hopper greatly admired,<ref>Hopper wrote: \"I want to compliment you for printing Ernest Hemingway's \"The Killers\" in the March ''Scribner's''. It is refreshing to come upon such a honest piece of work in an American magazine, after wading through the vast sea of sugar coated mush that makes up the most of our fiction. Of the concessions to popular prejudices, the side stepping of truth, and the ingenious mechanism of the trick ending there is no taint in this story.\", Edward Hopper to the editor, ''Scribner's Magazine'', 82  (June 1927), p. 706d, quoted in {{harvtxt|Levin|1979|p=[https://archive.org/details/edwardho00levi/page/6/mode/2up 7]}}, {{harvtxt|Levin|1979|loc=[https://archive.org/details/edwardho00levi/page/n73/mode/2up note 25]}}</ref> or from the more philosophical \"[[A Clean, Well-Lighted Place]]\".<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 44</ref> In keeping with the title of his painting, Hopper later said, ''Nighthawks'' has more to do with the possibility of predators in the night than with loneliness.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 350</ref>\n\nHis second most recognizable painting after ''Nighthawks'' is another urban painting, ''[[Early Sunday Morning]]'' (originally called ''Seventh Avenue Shops''), which shows an empty street scene in sharp side light, with a fire hydrant and a [[barber pole]] as stand-ins for human figures. Originally Hopper intended to put figures in the upstairs windows but left them empty to heighten the feeling of desolation.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 198</ref>\n\nHopper's rural [[New England]] scenes, such as ''[[Gas (painting)|Gas]]'' (1940), are no less meaningful. ''Gas'' represents \"a different, equally clean, well-lighted refuge ... ke[pt] open for those in need as they navigate the night, traveling their own miles to go before they sleep.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=Walter |title=Silent Theater: The Art of Edward Hopper |location=London/New York |publisher=[[Phaidon Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0714845418}}</ref> The work presents a fusion of several Hopper themes: the solitary figure, the melancholy of dusk, and the lonely road.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 278</ref>\n\nHopper approaches [[Surrealism]] with ''Rooms by the Sea'' (1951), where an open door gives a view of the ocean, without an apparent ladder or steps and no indication of a beach.<ref>Maker 1990, p. 37</ref>\n\nAfter his student years, Hopper's nudes were all women. Unlike past artists who painted the female nude to glorify the female form and to highlight female eroticism, Hopper's nudes are solitary women who are psychologically exposed.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 20</ref> One audacious exception is ''Girlie Show'' (1941), where a red-headed strip-tease queen strides confidently across a stage to the accompaniment of the musicians in the pit. ''Girlie Show'' was inspired by Hopper's visit to a [[American burlesque|burlesque]] show a few days earlier. Hopper's wife, as usual, posed for him for the painting, and noted in her diary, \"Ed beginning a new canvas\u2014a burlesque queen doing a strip tease\u2014and I posing without a stitch on in front of the stove\u2014nothing but high heels in a lottery dance pose.\"<ref>Levin 2001, p. 282</ref>\n\nHopper's portraits and self-portraits were relatively few after his student years.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 162</ref> Hopper did produce a commissioned \"portrait\" of a house, ''The MacArthurs' Home'' (1939), where he faithfully details the Victorian architecture of the home of actress [[Helen Hayes]]. She reported later, \"I guess I never met a more misanthropic, grumpy individual in my life.\" Hopper grumbled throughout the project and never again accepted a commission.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 268</ref> Hopper also painted ''Portrait of Orleans'' (1950), a \"portrait\" of the Cape Cod town from its main street.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 332</ref>\n\nThough very interested in the [[American Civil War]] and [[Mathew Brady]]'s battlefield photographs, Hopper made only two historical paintings. Both depicted soldiers on their way to [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]].<ref>Levin 2001, p. 274</ref> Also rare among his themes are paintings showing action. The best example of an action painting is ''Bridle Path'' (1939), but Hopper's struggle with the proper anatomy of the horses may have discouraged him from similar attempts.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 262</ref>\n\nHopper's final oil painting, ''Two Comedians'' (1966), painted one year before his death, focuses on his love of the theater. Two French [[pantomime]] actors, one male and one female, both dressed in bright white costumes, take their bow in front of a darkened stage. Jo Hopper confirmed that her husband intended the figures to suggest their taking their life's last bows together as husband and wife.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 380</ref>\n\nHopper's paintings have often been seen by others as having a narrative or thematic content that the artist may not have intended. Much meaning can be added to a painting by its title, but the titles of Hopper's paintings were sometimes chosen by others, or were selected by Hopper and his wife in a way that makes it unclear whether they have any real connection with the artist's meaning. For example, Hopper once told an interviewer that he was \"fond of ''[[Early Sunday Morning]]''... but it wasn't necessarily Sunday. That word was tacked on later by someone else.\"<ref>Interview with Hopper in Katharine Kuh, ''The Artist's Voice: Talks with Seventeen Modern Artists''. Originally published 1962. New York: Da Capo, 2000, p. 134.</ref>\n\nThe tendency to read thematic or narrative content into Hopper's paintings, that Hopper had not intended, extended even to his wife. When Jo Hopper commented on the figure in ''Cape Cod Morning'' \"It's a woman looking out to see if the weather's good enough to hang out her wash,\" Hopper retorted, \"Did I say that? You're making it Norman Rockwell. From my point of view she's just looking out the window.\"<ref>Levin 2001, p. 334</ref> Another example of the same phenomenon is recorded in a 1948 article in ''Time'':\n\n<blockquote>Hopper's ''Summer Evening'', a young couple talking in the harsh light of a cottage porch, is inescapably romantic, but Hopper was hurt by one critic's suggestion that it would do for an illustration in \"any woman's magazine.\" Hopper had the painting in the back of his head \"for 20 years and I never thought of putting the figures in until I actually started last summer. Why any art director would tear the picture apart. The figures were not what interested me; it was the light streaming down, and the night all around.\"<ref>\"Travelling Man\", ''Time'', January 19, 1948, pp. 59\u201360.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Place in American art ===\n[[File:New york restaurant by edward hopper.jpg|thumb|''New York Restaurant'' (1922)]]\nIn focusing primarily on quiet moments, very rarely showing action, Hopper employed a form of realism adopted by another leading American realist, [[Andrew Wyeth]], but Hopper's technique was completely different from Wyeth's hyper-detailed style.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 17\" /> In league with some of his contemporaries, Hopper shared his urban sensibility with [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and [[George Bellows]], but avoided their overt action and violence. Where [[Joseph Stella]] and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] glamorized the monumental structures of the city, Hopper reduced them to everyday geometrics and he depicted the pulse of the city as desolate and dangerous rather than \"elegant or seductive\".<ref>Maker 1990, p. 43</ref>\n\n[[Charles Burchfield]], whom Hopper admired and to whom he was compared, said of Hopper, \"he achieves such a complete verity that you can read into his interpretations of houses and conceptions of New York life any human implications you wish.\"<ref>Maker 1990, p. 65</ref> He also attributed Hopper's success to his \"bold individualism. ... In him we have regained that sturdy American independence which [[Thomas Eakins]] gave us, but which for a time was lost.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 15</ref> Hopper considered this a high compliment since he considered Eakins the greatest American painter.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 23</ref>\n\nHopper scholar Deborah Lyons writes, \"Our own moments of revelation are often mirrored, transcendent, in his work. Once seen, Hopper's interpretations exist in our consciousness in tandem with our own experience. We forever see a certain type of house as a Hopper house, invested perhaps with a mystery that Hopper implanted in our own vision.\" Hopper's paintings highlight the seemingly mundane and typical scenes in our everyday life and give them cause for epiphany. In this way Hopper's art takes the gritty American landscape and lonely gas stations and creates within them a sense of beautiful anticipation.<ref>Deborah Lyons, ''Edward Hopper and The American Imagination'', New York, 1995, p. XII, {{ISBN|0-393-31329-8}}</ref>\n\nAlthough compared to his contemporary [[Norman Rockwell]] in terms of subject matter, Hopper did not like the comparison. Hopper considered himself more subtle, less illustrative, and certainly not sentimental. Hopper also rejected comparisons with [[Grant Wood]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] stating \"I think the American Scene painters caricatured America. I always wanted to do myself.\"<ref>Maker 1990, p. 19</ref>\n\n=== Influence ===\nHopper's influence on the art world and pop culture is undeniable; see {{slink||In popular culture}} for numerous examples. Though he had no formal students, many artists have cited him as an influence, including [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Mark Rothko]].<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 13\" /> An illustration of Hopper's influence is Rothko's early work ''Composition I'' (c. 1931), which is a direct paraphrase of Hopper's ''Chop Suey''.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 36</ref>\n\nHopper's cinematic compositions and dramatic use of light and dark has made him a favorite among filmmakers. For example, ''House by the Railroad'' is reported to have heavily influenced the iconic house in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 234</ref> The same painting has also been cited as being an influence on the home in the [[Terrence Malick]] film ''[[Days of Heaven]]''. The 1981 film ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'' includes a [[tableau vivant]] of ''Nighthawks'', with the lead actors in the places of the diners. German director [[Wim Wenders]] also cites Hopper influence.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 13\"/> His 1997 film ''[[The End of Violence]]'' also incorporates a tableau vivant of ''Nighthawks'', recreated by actors. Noted surrealist horror film director [[Dario Argento]] went so far as to recreate the diner and the patrons in ''Nighthawks'' as part of a set for his 1976 film ''[[Deep Red]]'' (aka ''Profondo Rosso''). [[Ridley Scott]] has cited the same painting as a visual inspiration for ''[[Blade Runner]]''. To establish the lighting of scenes in the 2002 film ''[[Road to Perdition]]'', director [[Sam Mendes]] drew from the paintings of Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly ''New York Movie''.<ref>{{cite news | author=Ray Zone | url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug02/perdition/sidebar1.html | title=A Master of Mood | publisher=[[American Cinematographer]] | date= | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>\n\nHomages to ''Nighthawks'' featuring cartoon characters or famous pop culture icons such as [[James Dean]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] are often found in poster stores and gift shops. The cable television channel [[Turner Classic Movies]] sometimes runs animated clips based on Hopper paintings prior to airing its films. Hopper's painting ''New York Movie'' was featured in the television show ''[[Dead Like Me]]''; the girl standing in the corner resembles [[Daisy Adair]]. In a 1998 episode of ''[[That '70s Show]]'' titled \"Drive In,\" Red and Kitty settle in at a diner and create a reproduction of ''Nighthawks''.\n\nMusical influences include singer/songwriter [[Tom Waits]]'s 1975 live-in-the-studio album titled ''[[Nighthawks at the Diner]]'', after the painting. In 1993, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was inspired sufficiently by Hopper's 1941 painting ''Girlie Show'' that she named her [[The Girlie Show Tour|world tour]] after it and incorporated many of the theatrical elements and mood of the painting into the show. In 2004, [[United Kingdom|British]] guitarist [[John Squire]] (formerly of [[The Stone Roses]]) released a [[concept album]] based on Hopper's work entitled ''[[Marshall's House]]''. Each song on the album is inspired by, and shares its title with, a painting by Hopper. [[Canadians|Canadian]] rock group [[The Weakerthans]] released their album [[Reunion Tour]] in 2007 featuring two songs inspired by and named after Hopper paintings, \"Sun in an Empty Room\", and \"Night Windows\", and have also referenced him in songs such as \"Hospital Vespers\". Hopper's ''Compartment C, Car 293'' inspired [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Pawe\u0142 Szyma\u0144ski]]'s ''Compartment 2, Car 7'' for [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[vibraphone]] (2003), as well as [[Hubert-F\u00e9lix Thi\u00e9faine]]'s song ''Compartiment C Voiture 293 Edward Hopper 1938'' (2011). Hopper's work has influenced multiple recordings by British band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]. ''Early Sunday Morning'' was the inspiration for the sleeve of ''[[Crush (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album)|Crush]]'' (1985). The same band's 2013 single \"[[English Electric (album)|Night Caf\u00e9]]\" was influenced by ''Nighthawks'' and mentions Hopper by name. Seven of his paintings are referenced in the lyrics.<ref name=\"slicingupeyeballs.com\">{{cite web |url= http://www.slicingupeyeballs.com/2013/08/05/stream-omd-night-cafe-vile-electrodes-remix/|title= Premiere: OMD, 'Night Caf\u00e9' (Vile Electrodes 'B-Side the C-Side' Remix)|date= 5 August 2013|website= Slicing Up Eyeballs|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn poetry, numerous poems have been inspired by Hopper's paintings, typically as vivid descriptions and dramatizations; this genre is known as [[ekphrasis]]. In addition to numerous individual poems inspired by Hopper, several poets have written collections based on Hopper's paintings. The French poet [[Claude Esteban]] wrote a collection of [[prose poem]]s, ''[[:fr:Soleil dans une pi\u00e8ce vide|Soleil dans une pi\u00e8ce vide]]'' (''Sun in an Empty room'', 1991), based on forty-seven Hopper paintings from between 1921 and 1963, ending with ''Sun in an Empty room'' (1963), hence the title.<ref>Sample poem: ''[https://bergerault-univ-tours.fr/doc/doc14.pdf Trois fen\u00eatres, la nuit]'' (''Night windows''), [https://bergerault-univ-tours.fr/2003-2004/Esteban%20doc14.htm notes]</ref> The poems each dramatized a Hopper painting, imagining a story behind the scene; the book won the [[Prix France Culture]] prize in 1991. Eight of the poems \u2013 ''Ground Swell'', ''Girl at Sewing Machine'', ''Compartment C, Car 293'', ''Nighthawks'', ''South Carolina Morning'', ''House by the Railroad'', ''People in the Sun'', and ''Roofs of Washington Square'' \u2013 were subsequently set to music by composer [[Graciane Finzi]], and recorded with reading by the singer [[Natalie Dessay]] on her album ''Portraits of America'' (2016), where they were supplemented by selecting ten additional Hopper paintings, and songs from the [[American songbook]] to go with them.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.nataliedessay.fr/2016/11/24/pictures-of-america/ |title=Pictures of America |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202162834/https://www.nataliedessay.fr/2016/11/24/pictures-of-america/ |archive-date=2016-11-24}}</ref> Similarly, the Spanish poet [[Ernest Farr\u00e9s]] wrote a collection of fifty-one poems in Catalan, under the name ''Edward Hopper'' (2006, English translation 2010 by Lawrence Venuti), and James Hoggard wrote ''Triangles of Light: The Edward Hopper Poems'' (Wings Press, 2009). A collection by various poets was organized in ''The Poetry of Solitude: A Tribute to Edward Hopper'' 1995 (editor [[Gail Levin (art historian)|Gail Levin]]). Individual poems include Byron Vazakas (1957) and John Stone (1985) inspired by ''[[Early Sunday Morning]]'', and [[Mary Leader]] inspired by ''[[Girl at Sewing Machine]]''.\n\nEach of the twelve chapters in New Zealander [[Chris Bell (author)|Chris Bell]]'s 2004 novel ''Liquidambar'' ([[UKA Press]]/PABD) interprets one of Hopper's paintings to create a surreal detective story.\n\nHopper's influence reached the Japanese animation world in the dark cyberpunk thriller ''[[Texhnolyze]]''. His artwork was used as the basis for the surface world in ''Texhnolyze'' {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} as well as for much of the 2008 animated film ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]''.\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nIn 1980, the show ''Edward Hopper: The Art and the Artist'' opened at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and visited London, D\u00fcsseldorf, and Amsterdam, as well as San Francisco and Chicago. For the first time ever, this show presented Hopper's oil paintings together with preparatory studies for those works. This was the beginning of Hopper's popularity in Europe and his large worldwide reputation.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn 2004, a large selection of Hopper's paintings toured Europe, visiting [[Museum Ludwig]] in [[Cologne, Germany]], and the [[Tate Modern]] in [[London]]. The Tate exhibition became the second most popular in the gallery's history, with 420,000 visitors in the three months it was open.\n\nIn 2007, an exhibition focused on the period of Hopper's greatest achievements\u2014from about 1925 to mid-century\u2014and was presented at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. The exhibit comprised fifty oil paintings, thirty watercolors, and twelve prints, including the favorites ''Nighthawks'', ''Chop Suey'', and ''Lighthouse and Buildings''. The exhibition was organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and sponsored by the global management consulting firm [[Booz Allen Hamilton]].\n\nIn 2010, the Fondation de l'Hermitage museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, held an exhibition that covered Hopper's entire career, with works drawn largely from the Whitney Museum in New York City. It included paintings, watercolors, etchings, cartoons, posters, as well as some of the preparatory studies for selected paintings. The exhibition had previously been seen in Milan and Rome. In 2011, The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] held an exhibition called ''Edward Hopper and His Times''.\n\nIn 2012, an exhibition opened at the [[Grand Palais]] in [[Paris]] that sought to shed light on the complexity of his masterpieces, which is an indication of the richness of Hopper's oeuvre. It was divided chronologically into two main parts: the first section covered Hopper's formative years (1900\u20131924), comparing his work with that of his contemporaries and art he saw in Paris, which may have influenced him. The second section looked at the art of his mature years, from the first paintings emblematic of his personal style, such as ''House by the Railroad'' (1924), to his last works.\n\n=== Art market ===\nWorks by Hopper rarely appear on the market. The artist was not prolific, painting just 366 canvases; during the 1950s, when he was in his 70s, he produced approximately five paintings a year. Hopper's longtime dealer, Frank Rehn, who gave the artist his first solo show in 1924, sold ''Hotel Window'' (1956) to collector Olga Knoepke for $7,000 ({{Inflation|US|7000|1957|fmt=eq}}) in 1957. In 1999, the [[Malcolm Forbes|Forbes Collection]] sold it to actor [[Steve Martin]] privately for around $10 million.<ref>Vogel, Carol. (October 6, 2006).

While he is best known for his [[oil painting]]s, he was equally proficient as a [[watercolor painting|watercolorist]] and printmaker in [[etching]]. Both in his urban and rural scenes, his spare and finely calculated renderings reflected his personal vision of modern American life.  \n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Edward Hopper House.JPG|thumb|Childhood home of Edward Hopper in Nyack, New York]]\nHopper was born in 1882 in [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]], [[New York (state)|New York]], a [[yacht]]-building center on the [[Hudson River]] north of [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite ANB |title=Hopper, Edward |first=Gail |last=Levin |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1700423}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/hopp/hd_hopp.htm|title=Edward Hopper (1882\u20131967)|work=metmuseum.org}}</ref> He was one of two children of a comfortably well-off family. His parents, of mostly [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry, were Elizabeth Griffiths Smith and Garret Henry Hopper, a dry-goods merchant.<ref>Levin, Gail, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1995, p.11, {{ISBN|0-394-54664-4}}</ref> Although not so successful as his forebears, Garrett provided well for his two children with considerable help from his wife's inheritance. He retired at age forty-nine.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 9</ref> Edward and his only sister Marion attended both private and public schools. They were raised in a strict [[Baptist]] home.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 12</ref> His father had a mild nature, and the household was dominated by women: Hopper's mother, grandmother, sister, and maid.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 23</ref>\n\nHis [[Edward Hopper Birthplace and Boyhood Home|birthplace and boyhood home]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.

He readily absorbed his father's [[intellect]]ual tendencies and love of [[Culture of France|French]] and [[Russian culture|Russian]] cultures. He also demonstrated his mother's artistic heritage.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 12, 16</ref> Hopper's parents encouraged his art and kept him amply supplied with materials, instructional magazines, and illustrated books. Hopper first began signing and dating his drawings at the age of ten. The earliest of these drawings include charcoal sketches of geometric shapes, including a vase, bowl, cup and boxes.<ref name=\":0\">Levin 1995, p. 16-18</ref> The detailed examination of light and shadow which carried on throughout the rest of his career can already be found in these early works.<ref name=\":0\" /> By his teens, he was working in pen-and-ink, charcoal, watercolor, and oil\u2014drawing from nature as well as making political cartoons.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 20</ref> In 1895, he created his first signed oil painting, ''Rowboat in Rocky Cove''. It shows his early interest in nautical subjects.<ref>Levin, Gail, ''The Complete Oil Paintings of Edward Hopper'', W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 2001, p. 1, {{ISBN|0-393-04996-5}}</ref>\n\nIn his early self-portraits, Hopper tended to represent himself as skinny, ungraceful, and homely. Though a tall and quiet teenager, his prankish sense of humor found outlet in his art, sometimes in depictions of immigrants or of women dominating men in comic situations. Later in life, he mostly depicted women as the figures in his paintings.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 23, 25</ref> In high school, he dreamed of being a [[naval architect]], but after graduation he declared his intention to follow an art career. Hopper's parents insisted that he study commercial art to have a reliable means of income.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 8\">Maker 1990, p. 8</ref> In developing his self-image and individualistic philosophy of life, Hopper was influenced by the writings of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He later said, \"I admire him greatly...I read him over and over again.\"<ref>Wagstaff, Sheena Ed., ''Edward Hopper'', Tate Publishing, London, 2004, p. 16, {{ISBN|1-85437-533-4}}</ref>\n\nHopper began art studies with a correspondence course in 1899. Soon he transferred to the New York School of Art and Design, the forerunner of [[Parsons The New School for Design]]. There he studied for six years, with teachers including [[William Merritt Chase]], who instructed him in oil painting.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 8\" /> Early on, Hopper modeled his style after Chase and French Impressionist masters [[\u00c9douard Manet]] and [[Edgar Degas]].<ref>Levin 1995, p. 40</ref> Sketching from live models proved a challenge and a shock for the conservatively raised Hopper.\n\nAnother of his teachers, artist [[Robert Henri]], taught life class. Henri encouraged his students to use their art to \"make a stir in the world\". He also advised his students, \"It isn't the subject that counts but what you feel about it\" and \"Forget about art and paint pictures of what interests you in life.\"<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 8\" /> In this manner, Henri influenced Hopper, as well as future artists [[George Bellows]] and [[Rockwell Kent]]. He encouraged them to imbue a modern spirit in their work. Some artists in Henri's circle, including [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], became members of \"The Eight\", also known as the [[Ashcan School]] of [[American Art]].<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 9\">Maker 1990, p. 9</ref> Hopper's first existing oil painting to hint at his use of interiors as a theme was ''Solitary Figure in a Theater'' (c.1904).<ref>Levin 2001, p. 19</ref> During his student years, he also painted dozens of nudes, still life studies, landscapes, and portraits, including his self-portraits.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Hopper landed a part-time job with an advertising agency, where he created cover designs for trade magazines.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 48</ref> Hopper came to detest illustration. He was bound to it by economic necessity until the mid-1920s.<ref>Maker 1990, p. 11</ref> He temporarily escaped by making three trips to Europe, each centered in Paris, ostensibly to study the art scene there. In fact, however, he studied alone and seemed mostly unaffected by the new currents in art. Later he said that he \"didn't remember having heard of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] at all.\"<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 9\" /> He was highly impressed by [[Rembrandt]], particularly his ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'', which he said was \"the most wonderful thing of his I have seen; it's past belief in its reality.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 17</ref>\n\nHopper began painting urban and architectural scenes in a dark palette. Then he shifted to the lighter palette of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] before returning to the darker palette with which he was comfortable. Hopper later said, \"I got over that and later things done in Paris were more the kind of things I do now.\"<ref>Levin 1995, p. 66</ref> Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and caf\u00e9 scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract [[cubism|cubist]] experiments, Hopper was attracted to [[Realism (arts)|realist art]]. Later, he admitted to no European influences other than French engraver [[Charles M\u00e9ryon]], whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.<ref>Maker 1990, p. 10</ref>\n\n=== Years of struggle ===\n\nAfter returning from his last European trip, Hopper rented a studio in New York City, where he struggled to define his own style. Reluctantly, he returned to illustration to support himself. Being a freelancer, Hopper was forced to solicit for projects, and had to knock on the doors of magazine and agency offices to find business.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 85</ref> His painting languished: \"it's hard for me to decide what I want to paint. I go for months without finding it sometimes. It comes slowly.\"<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 88\">Levin 1995, p. 88</ref> His fellow illustrator Walter Tittle described Hopper's depressed emotional state in sharper terms, seeing his friend \"suffering...from long periods of unconquerable inertia, sitting for days at a time before his easel in helpless unhappiness, unable to raise a hand to break the spell.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 53</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Hopper traveled to [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]], to seek some inspiration and made his first outdoor paintings in America.<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 88\" /> He painted ''Squam Light'', the first of many lighthouse paintings to come.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 88</ref>\n[[File:Smash The Hun - Dry Dock Dial cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Hopper's prizewinning poster, ''Smash the Hun'' (1919), reproduced on the front cover of the ''[[Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company#The Dry Dock Dial|Morse Dry Dock Dial]]'']] \nIn 1913, at the [[Armory Show]], Hopper earned $250 when he sold his first painting, ''Sailing'' (1911), which he had painted over an earlier self-portrait.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 107</ref> Hopper was thirty-one, and although he hoped his first sale would lead to others in short order, his career would not catch on for many more years.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 90</ref> He continued to participate in group exhibitions at smaller venues, such as the [[MacDowell Club|MacDowell Club of New York]].<ref>Gail Levin. [http://www.anb.org/articles/17/17-00423.html Hopper, Edward], ''American National Biography Online'', February 2000. Retrieved December 20, 2015.</ref> Shortly after his father's death that same year, Hopper moved to the 3 [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] North apartment in the [[Greenwich Village]] section of [[Manhattan]], where he would live for the rest of his life.\n[[File:Night on the El Train, 1918.jpg|thumb|left|''Night on the El Train'' (1918) by Edward Hopper]]\nThe following year he received a commission to create some movie posters and handle publicity for a movie company.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 227</ref> Although he did not like the illustration work, Hopper was a lifelong devotee of the cinema and the theatre, both of which he treated as subjects for his paintings. Each form influenced his compositional methods.<ref>Levin 2001, pp. 74\u201377</ref>\n\nAt an impasse over his oil paintings, in 1915 Hopper turned to [[etching]]. By 1923 he had produced most of his approximately 70 works in this medium, many of urban scenes of both [[Paris]] and New York.<ref>Maker 1990, p. 12</ref><ref>Kranzfelder, Ivo, and Edward Hopper, ''Edward Hopper, 1882\u20131967: Vision of Reality'', New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 2003, p. 13, {{ISBN|0760748772}}</ref> He also produced some posters for the war effort, as well as continuing with occasional commercial projects.<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 120\">Levin 1995, p. 120</ref> When he could, Hopper did some outdoor watercolors on visits to New England, especially at the art colonies at [[Ogunquit]], and [[Monhegan Island]].\n\nDuring the early 1920s his etchings began to receive public recognition. They expressed some of his later themes, as in ''Night on the El Train'' (couples in silence), ''Evening Wind'' (solitary female), and ''The Catboat'' (simple nautical scene).<ref>Maker 1990, p. 13-15</ref> Two notable oil paintings of this time were ''New York Interior'' (1921) and ''New York Restaurant'' (1922).<ref>Levin 2001, p. 151, 153</ref> He also painted two of his many \"window\" paintings to come: ''[[Girl at Sewing Machine]]'' and ''Moonlight Interior'', both of which show a figure (clothed or nude) near a window of an apartment viewed as gazing out or from the point of view from the outside looking in.<ref>Levin 2001, pp. 152, 155</ref>\n\nAlthough these were frustrating years, Hopper gained some recognition. In 1918, Hopper was awarded the U.S. Shipping Board Prize for his war poster, \"Smash the Hun.\" He participated in three exhibitions: in 1917 with the Society of Independent Artists, in January 1920 (a one-man exhibition at the Whitney Studio Club, which was the precursor to the Whitney Museum), and in 1922 (again with the Whitney Studio Club). In 1923, Hopper received two awards for his [[etching]]s: the [[Logan Medal of the Arts|Logan Prize]] from the [[Chicago Society of Etchers]], and the W.&nbsp;A. Bryan Prize.<ref>Levin, Gail, \"Edward Hopper: Chronology\" in ''Edward Hopper at Kennedy Galleries'' New York: Kennedy Galleries, 1977.</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and breakthrough ===\nBy 1923, Hopper's slow climb finally produced a breakthrough. He re-encountered [[Josephine Hopper|Josephine Nivison]], an artist and former student of [[Robert Henri]], during a summer painting trip in Gloucester, Massachusetts. They were opposites: she was short, open, gregarious, sociable, and liberal, while he was tall, secretive, shy, quiet, introspective, and conservative.<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 120\" /> They married a year later. She remarked: \"Sometimes talking to Eddie is just like dropping a stone in a well, except that it doesn't thump when it hits bottom.\"<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 16\">Maker 1990, p. 16</ref> She subordinated her career to his and shared his reclusive life style. The rest of their lives revolved around their spare walk-up apartment in the city and their summers in [[Truro, Massachusetts|South Truro]] on [[Cape Cod]]. She managed his career and his interviews, was his primary model, and was his life companion.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 16\" />\n\nWith Nivison's help, six of Hopper's Gloucester watercolors were admitted to an exhibit at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1923. One of them, ''The Mansard Roof'', was purchased by the museum for its permanent collection for the sum of $100.<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 171\">Levin 1995, p. 171</ref> The critics generally raved about his work; one stated, \"What vitality, force and directness! Observe what can be done with the homeliest subject.\"<ref name=\"Levin 1995, p. 171\" /> Hopper sold all his watercolors at a one-man show the following year and finally decided to put illustration behind him.\n\nThe artist had demonstrated his ability to transfer his attraction to Parisian architecture to American urban and rural architecture. According to [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] [[curator]] Carol Troyen, \"Hopper really liked the way these houses, with their [[turret]]s and [[tower]]s and [[porch]]es and [[mansard roof]]s and ornament cast wonderful shadows. He always said that his favorite thing was painting sunlight on the side of a house.\"<ref name=\"shea\">''[http://www.wbur.org/2007/07/06/hoppers-gloucester/9309 Hopper's Gloucester]'', Andrea Shea, [[WBUR]], July 6, 2007.</ref>\n\nAt forty-one, Hopper received further recognition for his work. He continued to harbor bitterness about his career, later turning down appearances and awards.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 16\" /> With his financial stability secured by steady sales, Hopper would live a simple, stable life and continue creating art in his personal style for four more decades.\n\nHis ''Two on the Aisle'' (1927) sold for a personal record $1,500, enabling Hopper to purchase an automobile, which he used to make field trips to remote areas of New England.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 230\">Wagstaff 2004, p. 230</ref> In 1929, he produced ''Chop Suey'' and ''Railroad Sunset''. The following year, art patron Stephen Clark donated ''House by the Railroad'' (1925) to the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the first oil painting that it acquired for its collection.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 161</ref> Hopper painted his last self-portrait in oil around 1930. Although Josephine posed for many of his paintings, she sat for only one formal oil portrait by her husband, ''Jo Painting'' (1936).<ref>Levin 2001, p. 246</ref>\n\nHopper fared better than many other artists during the [[Great Depression]]. His stature took a sharp rise in 1931 when major museums, including the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], paid thousands of dollars for his works. He sold 30 paintings that year, including 13 watercolors.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 230\" /> The following year he participated in the first [[Whitney Biennial|Whitney Annual]], and he continued to exhibit in every annual at the museum for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 230\" /> In 1933, the Museum of Modern Art gave Hopper his first large-scale retrospective.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 17\">Maker 1990, p. 17</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the Hoppers rented a cottage in South Truro, on Cape Cod. They returned every summer for the rest of their lives, building a summer house there in 1934.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Allman|first1=William G.|title=New additions to the Oval Office|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/02/10/new-additions-oval-office|publisher=The White House|accessdate=11 February 2016|date=10 February 2014}}</ref> From there, they would take driving trips into other areas when Hopper needed to search for fresh material to paint. In the summers of 1937 and 1938, the couple spent extended sojourns on Wagon Wheels Farm in [[South Royalton, Vermont]], where Hopper painted a series of watercolors along the White River. These scenes are atypical among Hopper's mature works, as most are \"pure\" landscapes, devoid of architecture or human figures. ''First Branch of the White River'' (1938), now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is the most well-known of Hopper's Vermont landscapes.<ref name=\"Clause 2012\">Clause 2012</ref>\n\nHopper was very productive through the 1930s and early 1940s, producing among many important works ''[[New York Movie]]'' (1939), ''Girlie Show'' (1941), ''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'' (1942), ''[[Hotel Lobby]]'' (1943), and ''Morning in a City'' (1944). During the late 1940s, however, he suffered a period of relative inactivity. He admitted: \"I wish I could paint more. I get sick of reading and going to the movies.\"<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 232\">Wagstaff 2004, p. 232</ref> During the next two decades, his health faltered, and he had several prostate surgeries and other medical problems.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 232\" /> But, in the 1950s and early 1960s, he created several more major works, including ''First Row Orchestra'' (1951); as well as ''Morning Sun'' and ''[[Hotel by a Railroad]]'', both in 1952; and ''Intermission'' in 1963.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 233</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:3 Washington Square North, NYC.JPG|thumb|Where Hopper lived in New York City, 3 Washington Square North]]\n[[File:Grabstein Edward Hopper.JPG|thumb|Gravestone Edward and Josephine H., Oak Hill Cemetery Nyack]]\n\nHopper died in his studio near [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] in New York City on May 15, 1967.

Hopper was someone drawn to an emblematic, anti-narrative [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]],<ref>Anfam, David, \"Review of 'A Catalogue of Raisonne by -[[Gail Levin (art historian)|Gail Levin]]',\" ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', 1999.</ref> who \"painted short isolated moments of configuration, saturated with suggestion\".<ref>Strand, Mark, ''Hopper'', Knopf Publishing, 1994 {{ISBN|9780307701244}}</ref> His silent spaces and uneasy encounters \"touch us where we are most vulnerable\",<ref>Berman, Avis, \"Hopper the Supreme American Realist of the 20th Century\", ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' June 2007</ref> and have \"a suggestion of melancholy, that melancholy being enacted\".<ref>Strand, Mark, \"Review of 'Hopper Drawing' Whitney Museum 2013\", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', June 2015</ref> His sense of color revealed him as a pure painter<ref>''Art Digest'' April 1937 'Carnegie Traces Hopper's Rise to Fame'</ref> as he \"turned the [[Puritan]] into the purist, in his quiet canvasses where blemishes and blessings balance\".<ref>\"The Silent Witness\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', December 24, 1956</ref> According to critic [[Lloyd Goodrich]], he was \"an eminently native painter, who more than any other was getting more of the quality of America into his canvases\".<ref>Maker, Sherry, ''Edward Hopper'', Brompton Books, New York, 1990, p. 6, {{ISBN|0-517-01518-8}}</ref><ref>Goodrich, Lloyd, \"The Paintings of Edward Hopper\", ''[[The Arts]]'', March 1927</ref>\n\nConservative in politics and social matters (Hopper asserted for example that \"artists' lives should be written by people very close to them\"),<ref>Interview in 1960 with Katherine Kuhn, quoted in her ''The Artist's Voice'', Harper and Row, New York, 1960</ref> he accepted things as they were and displayed a lack of idealism. Cultured and sophisticated, he was well-read, and many of his paintings show figures reading.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 88</ref> He was generally good company and unperturbed by silences, though sometimes taciturn, grumpy, or detached. He was always serious about his art and the art of others, and when asked would return frank opinions.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nHopper's most systematic declaration of his philosophy as an artist was given in a handwritten note, entitled \"Statement\", submitted in 1953 to the journal, ''Reality'':\n\n<blockquote>Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world. No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination. One of the weaknesses of much abstract painting is the attempt to substitute the inventions of the human intellect for a private imaginative conception.\n\nThe inner life of a human being is a vast and varied realm and does not concern itself alone with stimulating arrangements of color, form and design.\n\nThe term life used in art is something not to be held in contempt, for it implies all of existence and the province of art is to react to it and not to shun it.\n\nPainting will have to deal more fully and less obliquely with life and nature's phenomena before it can again become great.<ref>Edward Hopper, \"Statement.\" Published as a part of \"Statements by Four Artists\" in ''Reality'', vol. 1, no. 1 (spring 1953). Hopper's handwritten draft is reproduced in Levin, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography'', p. 461.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThough Hopper claimed that he didn't consciously embed psychological meaning in his paintings, he was deeply interested in [[Freud]] and the power of the subconscious mind. He wrote in 1939, \"So much of every art is an expression of the subconscious that it seems to me most of all the important qualities are put there unconsciously, and little of importance by the conscious intellect.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 71</ref>\n\n=== Methods ===\n\nAlthough he is best known for his [[oil painting]]s, Hopper initially achieved recognition for his watercolors and he also produced some commercially successful etchings. Additionally, his notebooks contain high-quality pen and pencil sketches, which were never meant for public viewing.\n\nHopper paid particular attention to geometrical design and the careful placement of human figures in proper balance with their environment. He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, \"It takes a long time for an idea to strike. Then I have to think about it for a long time. I don't start painting until I have it all worked out in my mind. I'm all right when I get to the easel\".<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 98</ref> He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as \"sad face of woman unlit\", \"electric light from ceiling\", and \"thighs cooler\".<ref>Levin 2001, p. 254</ref>\n\nFor ''New York Movie'' (1939), Hopper demonstrates his thorough preparation with more than 53 sketches of the theater interior and the figure of the pensive usherette.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 261</ref>\n\nThe effective use of light and shadow to create mood also is central to Hopper's methods. Bright sunlight (as an emblem of insight or revelation), and the shadows it casts, also play symbolically powerful roles in Hopper paintings such as ''[[Early Sunday Morning]]'' (1930), ''Summertime'' (1943), ''Seven A.M.'' (1948), and ''Sun in an Empty Room'' (1963). His use of light and shadow effects have been compared to the cinematography of ''[[film noir]]''.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 92</ref>\n\nAlthough a realist painter, Hopper's \"soft\" realism simplified shapes and details. He used saturated color to heighten contrast and create mood.\n\n=== Subjects and themes ===\nHopper derived his subject matter from two primary sources: one, the common features of American life (gas stations, motels, restaurants, theaters, railroads, and street scenes) and its inhabitants; and two, seascapes and rural landscapes. Regarding his style, Hopper defined himself as \"an amalgam of many races\" and not a member of any school, particularly the \"[[Ashcan School]]\".<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 13\">Wagstaff 2004, p. 13</ref> Once Hopper achieved his mature style, his art remained consistent and self-contained, in spite of the numerous art trends that came and went during his long career.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 13\" />\n\nHopper's seascapes fall into three main groups: pure landscapes of rocks, sea, and beach grass; lighthouses and farmhouses; and sailboats. Sometimes he combined these elements. Most of these paintings depict strong light and fair weather; he showed little interest in snow or rain scenes, or in seasonal color changes. He painted the majority of the pure seascapes in the period between 1916 and 1919 on [[Monhegan Island]].<ref>Levin 2001, pp. 130\u2013145</ref> Hopper's ''The Long Leg'' (1935) is a nearly all-blue sailing picture with the simplest of elements, while his ''Ground Swell'' (1939) is more complex and depicts a group of youngsters out for a sail, a theme reminiscent of [[Winslow Homer]]'s iconic [[Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)|''Breezing Up'']] (1876).<ref>Levin 2001, p. 266</ref>\n\nUrban architecture and cityscapes also were major subjects for Hopper. He was fascinated with the American urban scene, \"our native architecture with its hideous beauty, its fantastic roofs, pseudo-gothic, French [[Mansard]], Colonial, mongrel or what not, with eye-searing color or delicate harmonies of faded paint, shouldering one another along interminable streets that taper off into swamps or dump heaps.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 67</ref>\n\nIn 1925, he produced ''House by the Railroad''. This classic work depicts an isolated [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] wood mansion, partly obscured by the raised embankment of a railroad. It marked Hopper's artistic maturity. Lloyd Goodrich praised the work as \"one of the most poignant and desolating pieces of realism.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 229</ref> The work is the first of a series of stark rural and urban scenes that uses sharp lines and large shapes, played upon by unusual lighting to capture the lonely mood of his subjects. Although critics and viewers interpret meaning and mood in these cityscapes, Hopper insisted \"I was more interested in the sunlight on the buildings and on the figures than any symbolism.\"<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 12\">Wagstaff 2004, p. 12</ref> As if to prove the point, his late painting ''Sun in an Empty Room'' (1963) is a pure study of sunlight.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 28</ref>\n\nMost of Hopper's figure paintings focus on the subtle interaction of human beings with their environment\u2014carried out with solo figures, couples, or groups. His primary emotional themes are solitude, loneliness, regret, boredom, and resignation. He expresses the emotions in various environments, including the office, in public places, in apartments, on the road, or on vacation.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, pp. 70\u201371</ref> As if he were creating stills for a movie or tableaux in a play, Hopper positioned his characters as if they were captured just before or just after the climax of a scene.<ref>[[Lloyd Goodrich|Goodrich, Lloyd]], ''Edward Hopper'', [[New York City|New York]]: H. N. Abrams, 1971</ref>\n\nHopper's solitary figures are mostly women\u2014dressed, semi-clad, and nude\u2014often reading or looking out a window, or in the workplace. In the early 1920s, Hopper painted his first such images ''Girl at Sewing Machine'' (1921), ''New York Interior'' (another woman sewing) (1921), and ''Moonlight Interior'' (a nude getting into bed) (1923). ''Automat'' (1927) and ''Hotel Room'' (1931), however, are more representative of his mature style, emphasizing the solitude more overtly.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 169, 213</ref>\n\nAs Hopper scholar, Gail Levin, wrote of ''Hotel Room'':\n<blockquote>The spare vertical and diagonal bands of color and sharp electric shadows create a concise and intense drama in the night...Combining poignant subject matter with such a powerful formal arrangement, Hopper's composition is pure enough to approach an almost abstract sensibility, yet layered with a poetic meaning for the observer.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 212</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHopper's ''Room in New York'' (1932) and ''Cape Cod Evening'' (1939) are prime examples of his \"couple\" paintings. In the first, a young couple appear alienated and uncommunicative\u2014he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes on the role of a [[voyeur]], as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters.<ref name=\"Levin 2001, p. 220, 264\">Levin 2001, p. 220, 264</ref> Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with ''Excursion into Philosophy '' (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly on the edge of a bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, \"[T]he open book is [[Plato]], reread too late\".\n\nLevin interprets the painting:\n<blockquote>Plato's philosopher, in search of the real and the true, must turn away from this transitory realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper's painting is positioned between the lure of the earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of thinking about this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]].<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 55</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Office at Night]]'' (1940), another \"couple\" painting, Hopper creates a psychological puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing on his work papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the [[eroticism]] and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman's appeal or that he is working hard to ignore her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources,<ref name=\"Levin 2001, p. 220, 264\" /> from a desk lamp, through a window and indirect light from above. Hopper went on to make several \"office\" pictures, but no others with a sensual undercurrent.\n\n[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'' (1942)]]\n[[File:\"Night Hawks\" in the Art Institute of Chicago.jpg|thumb|300px|\"Nighthawks\" in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\nThe best-known of Hopper's paintings, ''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'' (1942), is one of his paintings of groups. It shows customers sitting at the counter of an all-night [[diner]]. The shapes and diagonals are carefully constructed. The viewpoint is cinematic\u2014from the sidewalk, as if the viewer were approaching the restaurant. The diner's harsh electric light sets it apart from the dark night outside, enhancing the mood and subtle emotion.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 288</ref> As in many Hopper paintings, the interaction is minimal. The restaurant depicted was inspired by one in Greenwich Village. Both Hopper and his wife posed for the figures, and Jo Hopper gave the painting its title. The inspiration for the picture may have come from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s short story \"[[The Killers (Hemingway short story)|The Killers]]\", which Hopper greatly admired,<ref>Hopper wrote: \"I want to compliment you for printing Ernest Hemingway's \"The Killers\" in the March ''Scribner's''. It is refreshing to come upon such a honest piece of work in an American magazine, after wading through the vast sea of sugar coated mush that makes up the most of our fiction. Of the concessions to popular prejudices, the side stepping of truth, and the ingenious mechanism of the trick ending there is no taint in this story.\", Edward Hopper to the editor, ''Scribner's Magazine'', 82  (June 1927), p. 706d, quoted in {{harvtxt|Levin|1979|p=[https://archive.org/details/edwardho00levi/page/6/mode/2up 7]}}, {{harvtxt|Levin|1979|loc=[https://archive.org/details/edwardho00levi/page/n73/mode/2up note 25]}}</ref> or from the more philosophical \"[[A Clean, Well-Lighted Place]]\".<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 44</ref> In keeping with the title of his painting, Hopper later said, ''Nighthawks'' has more to do with the possibility of predators in the night than with loneliness.<ref>Levin 1995, p. 350</ref>\n\nHis second most recognizable painting after ''Nighthawks'' is another urban painting, ''[[Early Sunday Morning]]'' (originally called ''Seventh Avenue Shops''), which shows an empty street scene in sharp side light, with a fire hydrant and a [[barber pole]] as stand-ins for human figures. Originally Hopper intended to put figures in the upstairs windows but left them empty to heighten the feeling of desolation.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 198</ref>\n\nHopper's rural [[New England]] scenes, such as ''[[Gas (painting)|Gas]]'' (1940), are no less meaningful. ''Gas'' represents \"a different, equally clean, well-lighted refuge ... ke[pt] open for those in need as they navigate the night, traveling their own miles to go before they sleep.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=Walter |title=Silent Theater: The Art of Edward Hopper |location=London/New York |publisher=[[Phaidon Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0714845418}}</ref> The work presents a fusion of several Hopper themes: the solitary figure, the melancholy of dusk, and the lonely road.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 278</ref>\n\nHopper approaches [[Surrealism]] with ''Rooms by the Sea'' (1951), where an open door gives a view of the ocean, without an apparent ladder or steps and no indication of a beach.<ref>Maker 1990, p. 37</ref>\n\nAfter his student years, Hopper's nudes were all women. Unlike past artists who painted the female nude to glorify the female form and to highlight female eroticism, Hopper's nudes are solitary women who are psychologically exposed.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 20</ref> One audacious exception is ''Girlie Show'' (1941), where a red-headed strip-tease queen strides confidently across a stage to the accompaniment of the musicians in the pit. ''Girlie Show'' was inspired by Hopper's visit to a [[American burlesque|burlesque]] show a few days earlier. Hopper's wife, as usual, posed for him for the painting, and noted in her diary, \"Ed beginning a new canvas\u2014a burlesque queen doing a strip tease\u2014and I posing without a stitch on in front of the stove\u2014nothing but high heels in a lottery dance pose.\"<ref>Levin 2001, p. 282</ref>\n\nHopper's portraits and self-portraits were relatively few after his student years.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 162</ref> Hopper did produce a commissioned \"portrait\" of a house, ''The MacArthurs' Home'' (1939), where he faithfully details the Victorian architecture of the home of actress [[Helen Hayes]]. She reported later, \"I guess I never met a more misanthropic, grumpy individual in my life.\" Hopper grumbled throughout the project and never again accepted a commission.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 268</ref> Hopper also painted ''Portrait of Orleans'' (1950), a \"portrait\" of the Cape Cod town from its main street.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 332</ref>\n\nThough very interested in the [[American Civil War]] and [[Mathew Brady]]'s battlefield photographs, Hopper made only two historical paintings. Both depicted soldiers on their way to [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]].<ref>Levin 2001, p. 274</ref> Also rare among his themes are paintings showing action. The best example of an action painting is ''Bridle Path'' (1939), but Hopper's struggle with the proper anatomy of the horses may have discouraged him from similar attempts.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 262</ref>\n\nHopper's final oil painting, ''Two Comedians'' (1966), painted one year before his death, focuses on his love of the theater. Two French [[pantomime]] actors, one male and one female, both dressed in bright white costumes, take their bow in front of a darkened stage. Jo Hopper confirmed that her husband intended the figures to suggest their taking their life's last bows together as husband and wife.<ref>Levin 2001, p. 380</ref>\n\nHopper's paintings have often been seen by others as having a narrative or thematic content that the artist may not have intended. Much meaning can be added to a painting by its title, but the titles of Hopper's paintings were sometimes chosen by others, or were selected by Hopper and his wife in a way that makes it unclear whether they have any real connection with the artist's meaning. For example, Hopper once told an interviewer that he was \"fond of ''[[Early Sunday Morning]]''... but it wasn't necessarily Sunday. That word was tacked on later by someone else.\"<ref>Interview with Hopper in Katharine Kuh, ''The Artist's Voice: Talks with Seventeen Modern Artists''. Originally published 1962. New York: Da Capo, 2000, p. 134.</ref>\n\nThe tendency to read thematic or narrative content into Hopper's paintings, that Hopper had not intended, extended even to his wife. When Jo Hopper commented on the figure in ''Cape Cod Morning'' \"It's a woman looking out to see if the weather's good enough to hang out her wash,\" Hopper retorted, \"Did I say that? You're making it Norman Rockwell. From my point of view she's just looking out the window.\"<ref>Levin 2001, p. 334</ref> Another example of the same phenomenon is recorded in a 1948 article in ''Time'':\n\n<blockquote>Hopper's ''Summer Evening'', a young couple talking in the harsh light of a cottage porch, is inescapably romantic, but Hopper was hurt by one critic's suggestion that it would do for an illustration in \"any woman's magazine.\" Hopper had the painting in the back of his head \"for 20 years and I never thought of putting the figures in until I actually started last summer. Why any art director would tear the picture apart. The figures were not what interested me; it was the light streaming down, and the night all around.\"<ref>\"Travelling Man\", ''Time'', January 19, 1948, pp. 59\u201360.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Place in American art ===\n[[File:New york restaurant by edward hopper.jpg|thumb|''New York Restaurant'' (1922)]]\nIn focusing primarily on quiet moments, very rarely showing action, Hopper employed a form of realism adopted by another leading American realist, [[Andrew Wyeth]], but Hopper's technique was completely different from Wyeth's hyper-detailed style.<ref name=\"Maker 1990, p. 17\" /> In league with some of his contemporaries, Hopper shared his urban sensibility with [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and [[George Bellows]], but avoided their overt action and violence. Where [[Joseph Stella]] and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] glamorized the monumental structures of the city, Hopper reduced them to everyday geometrics and he depicted the pulse of the city as desolate and dangerous rather than \"elegant or seductive\".<ref>Maker 1990, p. 43</ref>\n\n[[Charles Burchfield]], whom Hopper admired and to whom he was compared, said of Hopper, \"he achieves such a complete verity that you can read into his interpretations of houses and conceptions of New York life any human implications you wish.\"<ref>Maker 1990, p. 65</ref> He also attributed Hopper's success to his \"bold individualism. ... In him we have regained that sturdy American independence which [[Thomas Eakins]] gave us, but which for a time was lost.\"<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 15</ref> Hopper considered this a high compliment since he considered Eakins the greatest American painter.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 23</ref>\n\nHopper scholar Deborah Lyons writes, \"Our own moments of revelation are often mirrored, transcendent, in his work. Once seen, Hopper's interpretations exist in our consciousness in tandem with our own experience. We forever see a certain type of house as a Hopper house, invested perhaps with a mystery that Hopper implanted in our own vision.\" Hopper's paintings highlight the seemingly mundane and typical scenes in our everyday life and give them cause for epiphany. In this way Hopper's art takes the gritty American landscape and lonely gas stations and creates within them a sense of beautiful anticipation.<ref>Deborah Lyons, ''Edward Hopper and The American Imagination'', New York, 1995, p. XII, {{ISBN|0-393-31329-8}}</ref>\n\nAlthough compared to his contemporary [[Norman Rockwell]] in terms of subject matter, Hopper did not like the comparison. Hopper considered himself more subtle, less illustrative, and certainly not sentimental. Hopper also rejected comparisons with [[Grant Wood]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] stating \"I think the American Scene painters caricatured America. I always wanted to do myself.\"<ref>Maker 1990, p. 19</ref>\n\n=== Influence ===\nHopper's influence on the art world and pop culture is undeniable; see {{slink||In popular culture}} for numerous examples. Though he had no formal students, many artists have cited him as an influence, including [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Mark Rothko]].<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 13\" /> An illustration of Hopper's influence is Rothko's early work ''Composition I'' (c. 1931), which is a direct paraphrase of Hopper's ''Chop Suey''.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 36</ref>\n\nHopper's cinematic compositions and dramatic use of light and dark has made him a favorite among filmmakers. For example, ''House by the Railroad'' is reported to have heavily influenced the iconic house in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.<ref>Wagstaff 2004, p. 234</ref> The same painting has also been cited as being an influence on the home in the [[Terrence Malick]] film ''[[Days of Heaven]]''. The 1981 film ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'' includes a [[tableau vivant]] of ''Nighthawks'', with the lead actors in the places of the diners. German director [[Wim Wenders]] also cites Hopper influence.<ref name=\"Wagstaff 2004, p. 13\"/> His 1997 film ''[[The End of Violence]]'' also incorporates a tableau vivant of ''Nighthawks'', recreated by actors. Noted surrealist horror film director [[Dario Argento]] went so far as to recreate the diner and the patrons in ''Nighthawks'' as part of a set for his 1976 film ''[[Deep Red]]'' (aka ''Profondo Rosso''). [[Ridley Scott]] has cited the same painting as a visual inspiration for ''[[Blade Runner]]''. To establish the lighting of scenes in the 2002 film ''[[Road to Perdition]]'', director [[Sam Mendes]] drew from the paintings of Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly ''New York Movie''.<ref>{{cite news | author=Ray Zone | url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug02/perdition/sidebar1.html | title=A Master of Mood | publisher=[[American Cinematographer]] | date= | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>\n\nHomages to ''Nighthawks'' featuring cartoon characters or famous pop culture icons such as [[James Dean]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] are often found in poster stores and gift shops. The cable television channel [[Turner Classic Movies]] sometimes runs animated clips based on Hopper paintings prior to airing its films. Hopper's painting ''New York Movie'' was featured in the television show ''[[Dead Like Me]]''; the girl standing in the corner resembles [[Daisy Adair]]. In a 1998 episode of ''[[That '70s Show]]'' titled \"Drive In,\" Red and Kitty settle in at a diner and create a reproduction of ''Nighthawks''.\n\nMusical influences include singer/songwriter [[Tom Waits]]'s 1975 live-in-the-studio album titled ''[[Nighthawks at the Diner]]'', after the painting. In 1993, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was inspired sufficiently by Hopper's 1941 painting ''Girlie Show'' that she named her [[The Girlie Show Tour|world tour]] after it and incorporated many of the theatrical elements and mood of the painting into the show. In 2004, [[United Kingdom|British]] guitarist [[John Squire]] (formerly of [[The Stone Roses]]) released a [[concept album]] based on Hopper's work entitled ''[[Marshall's House]]''. Each song on the album is inspired by, and shares its title with, a painting by Hopper. [[Canadians|Canadian]] rock group [[The Weakerthans]] released their album [[Reunion Tour]] in 2007 featuring two songs inspired by and named after Hopper paintings, \"Sun in an Empty Room\", and \"Night Windows\", and have also referenced him in songs such as \"Hospital Vespers\". Hopper's ''Compartment C, Car 293'' inspired [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Pawe\u0142 Szyma\u0144ski]]'s ''Compartment 2, Car 7'' for [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[vibraphone]] (2003), as well as [[Hubert-F\u00e9lix Thi\u00e9faine]]'s song ''Compartiment C Voiture 293 Edward Hopper 1938'' (2011). Hopper's work has influenced multiple recordings by British band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]. ''Early Sunday Morning'' was the inspiration for the sleeve of ''[[Crush (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album)|Crush]]'' (1985). The same band's 2013 single \"[[English Electric (album)|Night Caf\u00e9]]\" was influenced by ''Nighthawks'' and mentions Hopper by name. Seven of his paintings are referenced in the lyrics.<ref name=\"slicingupeyeballs.com\">{{cite web |url= http://www.slicingupeyeballs.com/2013/08/05/stream-omd-night-cafe-vile-electrodes-remix/|title= Premiere: OMD, 'Night Caf\u00e9' (Vile Electrodes 'B-Side the C-Side' Remix)|date= 5 August 2013|website= Slicing Up Eyeballs|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn poetry, numerous poems have been inspired by Hopper's paintings, typically as vivid descriptions and dramatizations; this genre is known as [[ekphrasis]]. In addition to numerous individual poems inspired by Hopper, several poets have written collections based on Hopper's paintings. The French poet [[Claude Esteban]] wrote a collection of [[prose poem]]s, ''[[:fr:Soleil dans une pi\u00e8ce vide|Soleil dans une pi\u00e8ce vide]]'' (''Sun in an Empty room'', 1991), based on forty-seven Hopper paintings from between 1921 and 1963, ending with ''Sun in an Empty room'' (1963), hence the title.<ref>Sample poem: ''[https://bergerault-univ-tours.fr/doc/doc14.pdf Trois fen\u00eatres, la nuit]'' (''Night windows''), [https://bergerault-univ-tours.fr/2003-2004/Esteban%20doc14.htm notes]</ref> The poems each dramatized a Hopper painting, imagining a story behind the scene; the book won the [[Prix France Culture]] prize in 1991. Eight of the poems \u2013 ''Ground Swell'', ''Girl at Sewing Machine'', ''Compartment C, Car 293'', ''Nighthawks'', ''South Carolina Morning'', ''House by the Railroad'', ''People in the Sun'', and ''Roofs of Washington Square'' \u2013 were subsequently set to music by composer [[Graciane Finzi]], and recorded with reading by the singer [[Natalie Dessay]] on her album ''Portraits of America'' (2016), where they were supplemented by selecting ten additional Hopper paintings, and songs from the [[American songbook]] to go with them.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.nataliedessay.fr/2016/11/24/pictures-of-america/ |title=Pictures of America |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202162834/https://www.nataliedessay.fr/2016/11/24/pictures-of-america/ |archive-date=2016-11-24}}</ref> Similarly, the Spanish poet [[Ernest Farr\u00e9s]] wrote a collection of fifty-one poems in Catalan, under the name ''Edward Hopper'' (2006, English translation 2010 by Lawrence Venuti), and James Hoggard wrote ''Triangles of Light: The Edward Hopper Poems'' (Wings Press, 2009). A collection by various poets was organized in ''The Poetry of Solitude: A Tribute to Edward Hopper'' 1995 (editor [[Gail Levin (art historian)|Gail Levin]]). Individual poems include Byron Vazakas (1957) and John Stone (1985) inspired by ''[[Early Sunday Morning]]'', and [[Mary Leader]] inspired by ''[[Girl at Sewing Machine]]''.\n\nEach of the twelve chapters in New Zealander [[Chris Bell (author)|Chris Bell]]'s 2004 novel ''Liquidambar'' ([[UKA Press]]/PABD) interprets one of Hopper's paintings to create a surreal detective story.\n\nHopper's influence reached the Japanese animation world in the dark cyberpunk thriller ''[[Texhnolyze]]''. His artwork was used as the basis for the surface world in ''Texhnolyze'' {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} as well as for much of the 2008 animated film ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]''.\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nIn 1980, the show ''Edward Hopper: The Art and the Artist'' opened at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and visited London, D\u00fcsseldorf, and Amsterdam, as well as San Francisco and Chicago. For the first time ever, this show presented Hopper's oil paintings together with preparatory studies for those works. This was the beginning of Hopper's popularity in Europe and his large worldwide reputation.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn 2004, a large selection of Hopper's paintings toured Europe, visiting [[Museum Ludwig]] in [[Cologne, Germany]], and the [[Tate Modern]] in [[London]]. The Tate exhibition became the second most popular in the gallery's history, with 420,000 visitors in the three months it was open.\n\nIn 2007, an exhibition focused on the period of Hopper's greatest achievements\u2014from about 1925 to mid-century\u2014and was presented at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. The exhibit comprised fifty oil paintings, thirty watercolors, and twelve prints, including the favorites ''Nighthawks'', ''Chop Suey'', and ''Lighthouse and Buildings''. The exhibition was organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and sponsored by the global management consulting firm [[Booz Allen Hamilton]].\n\nIn 2010, the Fondation de l'Hermitage museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, held an exhibition that covered Hopper's entire career, with works drawn largely from the Whitney Museum in New York City. It included paintings, watercolors, etchings, cartoons, posters, as well as some of the preparatory studies for selected paintings. The exhibition had previously been seen in Milan and Rome. In 2011, The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] held an exhibition called ''Edward Hopper and His Times''.\n\nIn 2012, an exhibition opened at the [[Grand Palais]] in [[Paris]] that sought to shed light on the complexity of his masterpieces, which is an indication of the richness of Hopper's oeuvre. It was divided chronologically into two main parts: the first section covered Hopper's formative years (1900\u20131924), comparing his work with that of his contemporaries and art he saw in Paris, which may have influenced him. The second section looked at the art of his mature years, from the first paintings emblematic of his personal style, such as ''House by the Railroad'' (1924), to his last works.\n\n=== Art market ===\nWorks by Hopper rarely appear on the market. The artist was not prolific, painting just 366 canvases; during the 1950s, when he was in his 70s, he produced approximately five paintings a year. Hopper's longtime dealer, Frank Rehn, who gave the artist his first solo show in 1924, sold ''Hotel Window'' (1956) to collector Olga Knoepke for $7,000 ({{Inflation|US|7000|1957|fmt=eq}}) in 1957. In 1999, the [[Malcolm Forbes|Forbes Collection]] sold it to actor [[Steve Martin]] privately for around $10 million.<ref>Vogel, Carol. (October 6, 2006).

The team was the first to win the [[Stanley Cup]], in 1893, and subsequently refused the cup over a dispute with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association. The club is variously known as 'Montreals', 'Montreal AAA' and 'Winged wheel'<ref>The Metropolitan. \u2013 Apr 13, 1895</ref> in literature.\n\nThe team played in several early ice hockey leagues, including the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] from 1886 until 1898, winning its championship seven times. The team competed in purely amateur leagues until 1906. After two seasons of playing with professionals, the club left its league, the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] to continue playing in amateur competition. It would go on to win the [[Allan Cup]] in 1930, the successor of the Stanley Cup as the trophy given to Canadian amateur hockey champions. In 1932, the club would leave the MAAA association and become the [[Royal Montreal Hockey Club|Montreal Royals]], eventually becoming a 'semi-professional' team in the [[Quebec Senior Hockey League]].\n\n==History==\nPrior to the Club's formal organization, a group of hockey enthusiasts from the 'Montreal Football Club' would play as the 'Montreal Hockey Club', as far back as 1877. The group was captained by [[James George Aylwin Creighton|James Creighton]] before he moved to [[Ottawa]], and would play at the [[Victoria Skating Rink]].<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Montreal Daily Witness\n |date=February 2, 1877\n |title=Hockey Match\n |page=3\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Club was organized formally as an affiliate of the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association on November 28, 1884.<ref name=\"gz-1935-article\">{{cite news\n |work=Montreal Gazette\n |date=January 22, 1935 |page=12 |title=Turning Back Hockey's Pages\n |author=MacDonald, D.

The team played its first game on January 20, 1885 against [[McGill University]],<ref name=\"gz-1935-article\"/> winning 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Montreal Gazette\n |date=January 21, 1885\n |title=HOCKEY: M. A. A. A vs. McGill\n |page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe club would be a founding member of the Montreal-based [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] (AHAC) in 1886. The team held the Amateur Hockey Association title from 1888 until 1894. After the AHAC disbanded in 1898, the club continued in the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]], winning the league title in 1902.\n\nThe [[Stanley Cup]], as it would later be known, was to be presented to the Montreal Hockey Club on May 15, 1893, as its initial champions. At the time, the Montreal Hockey Club was in a dispute with its parent organization, the [[Montreal AAA|Montreal Amateur Athletic Association]] (MAAA). The MAAA was split on whether to accept the trophy. The hockey club was adamant about refusing the trophy, while other arms of the MAAA accepted. Thus, the trophy was accepted by the MAAA, but with none of the hockey officials of the hockey club present.\n\n[[Image:MHC team photo 1888.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Montreal Hockey Club, 1888<br/>Front Row: G.S. Lowe, A.A. Hodgson, J. Virtue, A. Cameron, [[Tom Paton (ice hockey)|T.L. Paton]]<br/>Back Row: W.C. Hodgson, J. Stewart]]\nAfter accepting the trophy, the hockey club remained adamant about returning the trophy that was presented to them. In the end, the MAAA investigated into why its hockey club wanted to refuse and return the trophy, even though such an action would damage the reputation of the MAAA. It was believed that the people who were in charge of running their team were, in fact, not representative of the team itself, and when the hockey club asked for a loan of $175 in start-up expenses for the 1894 season, it was flatly refused (the first time the MAAA refused anything to the hockey club).  Inexplicably, the hockey club reversed its position, and the next few months saw a gradual schism between the MAAA and the club. The inscription on the Cup when it was successfully defended in 1894 only stated \"Montreal\". The MAAA, at one point, considered the hockey club to have seceded from the organization that bore them. The issue was resolved in later years, after various attempts at reconciliation.\n\n[[Image:First Stanley Cup.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Montreal Hockey Club in 1893 as the first Stanley Cup champions]]\nThe Club won Stanley Cup challenges in March 1894, March 1902 and February 1903. The 1902 team was known as the \"Little Men of Iron\"<ref>[http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1901-02Mar Legends of Hockey web site description.]</ref> and its players became the core of the very successful [[Montreal Wanderers]] which was a ''professional'' club.\n\nThe team played two seasons with  professional players, in 1907 and 1907\u201308, in the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]], and after that no longer competed for the Stanley Cup, which was for professional teams. The club then joined the \n[[Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union]], competing for the [[Allan Cup]], the championship for senior amateur teams in Canada, and winning it in 1930.\n\nOn October 11, 1932, the directors of the MAAA  announced the turning over of the hockey club in its entirety to E.S. Hamilton and Ogilvie at a meeting of the Province of Quebec Hockey Association. The club was to be renamed the Royal Hockey Club or [[Royal Montreal Hockey Club|Montreal Royals]], independent of the association.

The team was the first to win the [[Stanley Cup]], in 1893, and subsequently refused the cup over a dispute with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association. The club is variously known as 'Montreals', 'Montreal AAA' and 'Winged wheel'<ref>The Metropolitan. \u2013 Apr 13, 1895</ref> in literature.\n\nThe team played in several early ice hockey leagues, including the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] from 1886 until 1898, winning its championship seven times. The team competed in purely amateur leagues until 1906. After two seasons of playing with professionals, the club left its league, the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] to continue playing in amateur competition. It would go on to win the [[Allan Cup]] in 1930, the successor of the Stanley Cup as the trophy given to Canadian amateur hockey champions. In 1932, the club would leave the MAAA association and become the [[Royal Montreal Hockey Club|Montreal Royals]], eventually becoming a 'semi-professional' team in the [[Quebec Senior Hockey League]].\n\n==History==\nPrior to the Club's formal organization, a group of hockey enthusiasts from the 'Montreal Football Club' would play as the 'Montreal Hockey Club', as far back as 1877. The group was captained by [[James George Aylwin Creighton|James Creighton]] before he moved to [[Ottawa]], and would play at the [[Victoria Skating Rink]].<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Montreal Daily Witness\n |date=February 2, 1877\n |title=Hockey Match\n |page=3\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Club was organized formally as an affiliate of the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association on November 28, 1884.<ref name=\"gz-1935-article\">{{cite news\n |work=Montreal Gazette\n |date=January 22, 1935 |page=12 |title=Turning Back Hockey's Pages\n |author=MacDonald, D.

The team held the Amateur Hockey Association title from 1888 until 1894. After the AHAC disbanded in 1898, the club continued in the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]], winning the league title in 1902.\n\nThe [[Stanley Cup]], as it would later be known, was to be presented to the Montreal Hockey Club on May 15, 1893, as its initial champions. At the time, the Montreal Hockey Club was in a dispute with its parent organization, the [[Montreal AAA|Montreal Amateur Athletic Association]] (MAAA). The MAAA was split on whether to accept the trophy. The hockey club was adamant about refusing the trophy, while other arms of the MAAA accepted. Thus, the trophy was accepted by the MAAA, but with none of the hockey officials of the hockey club present.\n\n[[Image:MHC team photo 1888.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Montreal Hockey Club, 1888<br/>Front Row: G.S. Lowe, A.A. Hodgson, J. Virtue, A. Cameron, [[Tom Paton (ice hockey)|T.L. Paton]]<br/>Back Row: W.C. Hodgson, J. Stewart]]\nAfter accepting the trophy, the hockey club remained adamant about returning the trophy that was presented to them. In the end, the MAAA investigated into why its hockey club wanted to refuse and return the trophy, even though such an action would damage the reputation of the MAAA. It was believed that the people who were in charge of running their team were, in fact, not representative of the team itself, and when the hockey club asked for a loan of $175 in start-up expenses for the 1894 season, it was flatly refused (the first time the MAAA refused anything to the hockey club).  Inexplicably, the hockey club reversed its position, and the next few months saw a gradual schism between the MAAA and the club. The inscription on the Cup when it was successfully defended in 1894 only stated \"Montreal\". The MAAA, at one point, considered the hockey club to have seceded from the organization that bore them. The issue was resolved in later years, after various attempts at reconciliation.\n\n[[Image:First Stanley Cup.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Montreal Hockey Club in 1893 as the first Stanley Cup champions]]\nThe Club won Stanley Cup challenges in March 1894, March 1902 and February 1903. The 1902 team was known as the \"Little Men of Iron\"<ref>[http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1901-02Mar Legends of Hockey web site description.]</ref> and its players became the core of the very successful [[Montreal Wanderers]] which was a ''professional'' club.\n\nThe team played two seasons with  professional players, in 1907 and 1907\u201308, in the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]], and after that no longer competed for the Stanley Cup, which was for professional teams. The club then joined the \n[[Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union]], competing for the [[Allan Cup]], the championship for senior amateur teams in Canada, and winning it in 1930.\n\nOn October 11, 1932, the directors of the MAAA  announced the turning over of the hockey club in its entirety to E.S. Hamilton and Ogilvie at a meeting of the Province of Quebec Hockey Association. The club was to be renamed the Royal Hockey Club or [[Royal Montreal Hockey Club|Montreal Royals]], independent of the association.
