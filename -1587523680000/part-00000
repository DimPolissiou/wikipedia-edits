She is one of the [[Mahavidya]]s or [[Parvati|Shivasakthi]] or [[Parvati]], ten goddesses from the esoteric tradition of [[Tantra]], and a ferocious aspect of [[Devi]], the Hindu Mother goddess. The [[semi nude]] goddess, usually wears tiger skin skirt and standing or seated on a divine, holds her own severed head in one hand, a [[scimitar]] in another. Three [[blood squirt|jets of blood spurt]] out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two attendants.\n\nChhinnamasta is a goddess of contradictions. She symbolises both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She represents death, temporality, and destruction as well as life, immortality, and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]&nbsp;\u2013 spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her [[self-sacrifice]]&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes coupled with a maternal element&nbsp;\u2013 sexual essence, and self-destructive fury.\n\nChhinnamasta is worshipped in the [[Shakta#Kalikula: family of Kali|Kalikula]] sect of [[Shaktism]], the Goddess-centric tradition of Hinduism. Though Chhinnamasta enjoys patronage as one of the Mahavidyas, temples devoted to her (found mostly in Nepal and eastern India) and her public worship are rare. However, she is a significant Tantric deity, well known and worshipped among esoteric Tantric practitioners. Chhinnamasta is closely related to [[Chinnamunda]]&nbsp;\u2013 the severed-headed form of the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] goddess [[Vajrayogini]].Those who worship Chinnamasta will be free from the effects of [[Rahu]] as per Shaktism.\n\n== Origins ==\n\n[[File:Chinnamunda.jpg|thumb|left|The Buddhist Chinnamunda is believed to be the antecedent of the Hindu Chhinnamasta, 14th-century painting, Nepal.|alt=A decapitated, nude, red-complexioned woman stands, raising her left arm, which holds her severed head. She is flanked by two smaller, nude women: a white-coloured one (left) and a blue-coloured one (right).]]\n\nThe Hindu Chhinnamasta appears as a significant deity in [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], where she is called [[Chinnamunda]] (\"she with the severed head\") or Trikaya-vajrayogini (\"triple-bodied [[Vajrayogini]]\"). Chinnamunda is the severed-head form of goddess Vajrayogini (or [[Vajravarahi]], a ferocious form of Vajrayogini), who is depicted similar to Chhinnamasta.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=172}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|p=94}}</ref>\n\nBuddhist texts recount the birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of [[Kanhapa|Krishnacharya]]'s disciples<!-- Mahasiddha Kanhapa -->, two ''[[Mahasiddha]]'' (\"great perfected ones\") sisters, [[Mekhala and Kanakhala]], who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also appeared in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the ''Mahasiddha'' princess [[Lakshminkara]]<!-- a Mahasiddha -->, cut off her head as a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=9\u201311}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|pp=101\u20132}}</ref>\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, [[Benoytosh Bhattacharyya|Benoytosh Bhattacharya]] \u2013 an expert on Tantra and the then director of the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda#Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute of Baroda]]<!-- http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/bot/pdf/bot_01_02_obituary.pdf--> \u2013 studied various texts such as the Buddhist ''Sadhanamala'' (1156{{nbsp}}CE), the Hindu ''Chhinnamastakalpa'' (uncertain date), and the ''Tantrasara'' by [[Krishnananda Agamavagisha]] (late 16th century). He determined that the Hindu Chhinnamasta and the Buddhist Chinnamunda were the same goddess, in spite of the fact that the former wears a serpent as a [[sacred thread]] and has an added copulating couple in the icon. In the ''Sadhanamala'', the goddess is called Sarvabuddha (\"all-awakened\"), and is attended by Vajravaironi and Vajravarnini; in the Hindu ''Tantrasara'', she is called ''Sarvasiddhi'' (\"all-accomplished\"), and is accompanied by attendants Dakini, Vaironi, and Varnini. In the ''Chhinnamastakalpa'', she is called Sarvabuddhi (\"all-enlightened\"); her attendants retain their Buddhist names. Bhattacharyya concluded that the Hindu Chhinnamasta originated from the Buddhist Chinnamunda, who was worshipped by at least the 7th century.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=12\u20135}}</ref> \n[[File:Bundi painting Chinnamasta.jpg|thumb|Chhinnamasta depicted enthroned appears in a benign form contrary to her traditional description, [[Rajput painting|Bundi painting]], c. 1775.|alt=Depicted enthroned, a decapitated, dark-complexioned woman wearing a red/orange sari holds a sword in her left hand and her own severed head  (with a lotus crown) on a platter in her right hand.

Shankaranarayanan \u2013 the author of ''The Ten Great Cosmic Powers'' \u2013 attribute Chhinnamasta to [[Vedic]] (ancient Hindu) antecedents. Sukumari Bhattacharji, the author of ''The Indian Theogony'', says that the Vedic goddess [[Nirrti]]'s functions were inherited by later Hindu goddesses [[Kali]], [[Chamunda]], Karali, and Chhinnamasta.

Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are depicted semi nude and wear tiger skin skirt and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless .<ref name = \"K175\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=175}}</ref><ref name = \"K176\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=176}}</ref>\n\nOther nude Hindu goddesses who might have inspired Chhinnamasta are the malevolent war goddess [[Kotavi]] and the South-Indian hunting goddess [[Korravai]]. Kotavi, sometimes described as a [[Matrika]] (\"mother goddess\"), is nude, dishevelled, wild, and awful in appearance. She is mentioned in the scriptures ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', often as a foe of the god [[Vishnu]]. The ferocious, wild Korravai is the goddess of war and victory. Both goddesses are linked to battlefields; Chhinnamasta is not.<ref name = \"K176\"/> Kinsley points out that while there are several bloodthirsty, nude, and wild goddesses and demonesses in Hindu mythology, Chhinnamasta is the only goddess who displays the shocking self-decapitation motif.<ref name = \"K177\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=144\u20137}}</ref>\n\nThe beheading and rejoining motif also appears in the tale of the goddess [[Renuka]]; however the self-decapitation is missing in the legend.<ref name=\"Mishra315\">{{harvtxt|Mishra|Mohanty|Mohanty|2002|p=315}}</ref><ref name=\"Storm296\">{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|p=296}}</ref> In the context of her legend, Renuka is given the epithet \"Chhinnamasta\" (\"She whose head is severed\").<ref name = \"Mahalakshmi204\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|pp=204}}</ref><ref name = \"B6ff\">{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=6\u20137}}</ref> The mahavidya Chhinnamasta is also associated with Renuka's son [[Parashurama]], who decapitated his mother in the legend.<ref name=\"shasthi\"/>{{efn\n| name = Renuka\n| Renuka is the wife of the sage [[Jamadagni]].

On the order of his father, Renuka's youngest son Parashurama beheads her after his four elder brothers refuse. Jamadagni burns his four elder sons by his fiery glance for their non-compliance.

Legends from the ''[[Singhasan Battisi|Simhasana Dvatrimsika]]'' and the ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' speak of how the hero offers blood from his throat as an offering to a goddess.

The story is as follows: [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], the daughter of [[Daksha]], is the first wife of the god [[Shiva]]. When she and Shiva are not invited to the [[Daksha yajna|fire sacrifice organized by her father]], she is insulted and insists on attending, despite Shiva's protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent for her to attend, the enraged Sati assumes a fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the ''Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana'', Chhinnamasta stands to the right of Shiva, interpreted as the east or the west; the ''Brihaddharma Purana'' describes her as appearing to the rear of Shiva in the west.<ref name=\"K162\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=162}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=1\u20133}}</ref><ref name=\"mahalakshmi201\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=201}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|2000|p=470}}</ref>{{efn| name = Daksha yajna}}\n\nSimilar legends exist. In these legends, the Mahavidyas arise from the wrath of other goddesses, specifically, [[Parvati]] (the second wife of Shiva and the [[reincarnation]] of Sati) and Kali (the principal Mahavidya). In one legend, Shiva and Parvati are living in the house of [[Himavat|\nParvati's father]]. Shiva wants to leave, but Parvati creates the ten fierce Mahavidyas who appear from ten directions and prevent him from leaving. In another legend, Shiva is living with Kali, identified as Shiva's consort in this context, but becomes tired of her and wants to leave. Kali creates the Mahavidyas who also obstruct his path from ten directions. Kali enlightens him and he ceases trying to leave.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Devi Bhagavata Purana'' also mentions the Mahavidyas as war-companions and forms of the goddess [[Shakambhari]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=31}}</ref> An oral tradition similarly replaces Shakambhari with the goddess [[Durga]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=30}}</ref>\n\n=== Chhinnamasta as an individual goddess ===\n\nThe ''Pranatoshini Tantra'' (18th century) narrates two tales of Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, attributed to the ''Narada-pancharatra'', tells how once, while bathing in [[Mandakini River|Mandakini]] river, Parvati becomes excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.<ref name=\"D412\">{{harvtxt|Donaldson|2001|p=412}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=147\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe other version, from the ''Pranatoshini Tantra'' and attributed to ''Svatantra Tantra'', is narrated by Shiva. He recounts that his consort [[Chandi]]ka (identified with Parvati) was engrossed in coitus with him in [[woman on top|reverse posture]], but became enraged at his seminal emission. Her attendants Dakini and Varnini rose from her body. The rest of the tale is similar to the earlier version, although the river is called Pushpabhadra, the day of Chhinnamasta's birth is called ''Viraratri'', and upon seeing the pale Parvati, Shiva becomes infuriated and assumes the form of Krodha [[Bhairava]].<ref name=\"K148\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=148}}</ref><ref name=\"mahalakshmi202\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=202}}</ref> This version is retold in the ''Shaktisamgama Tantra'' (c. 16th century),<ref name=\"K148\" /> in which Chhinnamasta forms a triad with Kali and Tara.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|2000|p=464}}</ref>\n\nAn oral legend tells how the goddess Prachanda Chandika appeared to aid the gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess [[Mahadevi|Mahashakti]]. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the ''Shakta Pramoda'' (19th century).<ref name=\"K148\"/> Another oral legend relates her to the [[Samudra manthan]] (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the [[Kshir Sagar|milk ocean]] to acquire the ''[[amrita]]'' (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself to prevent them from acquiring it.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe central themes of the mythology of Chhinnamasta are her [[Self sacrifice|self-sacrifice]]&nbsp;\u2013 with a maternal aspect (in the ''Pranatoshini'' ''Tantra'' versions) or for the welfare of the world (in the Samudra manthan oral version described above)&nbsp;\u2013 her sexual dominance and embrace (second ''Pranatoshini'' ''Tantra'' version), and her self-destructive fury (in the first oral legend).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=149\u201350}}</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Chhinnamasta.JPG|thumb|Chhinnamasta, at a [[Kali Puja]] Pandal, [[Kolkata]]|alt=A decapitated, nude, red-complexioned goddess stands on a copulating couple inside a lotus.

Chhinnamasta is the violent interaction between the Light and the Sound enabling Creation. Chhinnamasta severing her own head is interpreted symbolic of the disconnecting of the Source and the manifest Creation, similar to cutting the umbilical cord between the mother and the new-born. Further, Chhinnamasta is associated with thunder and lightning, interacting light and sound forces.

The image of Chhinnamasta standing on a copulating couple of Kamadeva (literally, \"sexual desire\") and Rati (\"sexual intercourse\") is interpreted by some scholars as a symbol of a person's ''control'' over sexual desire, while others interpret the goddess as being the ''embodiment'' of sexual energy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|pp=294\u20135}}</ref>\n\nHer names, such as ''[[Yogini]]'' and ''Madanatura'' (\"one who has affects [[Kama]]\"), convey her [[yogic]] control over sexual energy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=154}}</ref> Her triumphant stance trampling the love-deity couple denotes victory over desire and ''[[samsara]]'' (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth).<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=105\u20136}}</ref> Her subjugation of the amorous couple suggests that her worship will grant control over sexual urge and other impulses of the ''[[indriya]]''s (\"senses\"), whose governing god Indra - she is associated with.<ref>{{harvtxt|S Shankaranarayanan|2002|pp=71-2}}</ref> \n\nImages in which Chhinnamasta is depicted sitting on Kamadeva-Rati in a non-suppressive fashion suggest that sexual energy is a manifestation of the goddess herself, and therefore should be embraced, and not suppressed. Images where Shiva is depicted in coitus with Chhinnamasta are associated with this interpretation. Chhinnamasta's names like ''Kameshwari'' (\"goddess of desire\") and ''Ratiragavivriddhini'' (\"one who is engrossed in the realm of Rati&nbsp;\u2013 [copulation or sexual desire]\") and the appearance of ''klim''&nbsp;\u2013 the common seed syllable of Kamadeva and Krishna&nbsp;\u2013 in her mantra support this interpretation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=155\u20137}}</ref> Her lolling tongue also denotes sexual hunger.<ref name=\"mahalakshmi204\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=204}}</ref>\n\nThe inverted triangle, found in Chhinnamasta's iconography as well as in her yantra, signifies the ''[[yoni]]'' (womb) and the feminine. The goddess is often prescribed to be visualised in the centre of the inverted triangle in the navel. It also signifies the three ''[[Gu\u1e47a|guna]]''s (qualities) and three ''[[shakti]]''s (powers)&nbsp;\u2013''[[Iccha-shakti|iccha]]'' (\"will-power\"), ''[[Kriy\u0101|kriya]]'' (\"action\"), and ''jnana'' (\"wisdom\").<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=34, 90\u20131}}</ref> The goddess is called ''Yoni-mudra'' or ''Yoni-gamya'', accessible through the yoni.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bhattacharya Saxena|2011|p=69}}</ref>\n\n=== Other symbolism and associations ===\nChhinnamasta's nudity and headlessness symbolise her integrity and \"heedlessness\".

She is one of the [[Mahavidya]]s or [[Parvati|Shivasakthi]] or [[Parvati]], ten goddesses from the esoteric tradition of [[Tantra]], and a ferocious aspect of [[Devi]], the Hindu Mother goddess. The [[semi nude]] goddess, usually wears tiger skin skirt and standing or seated on a divine, holds her own severed head in one hand, a [[scimitar]] in another. Three [[blood squirt|jets of blood spurt]] out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two attendants.\n\nChhinnamasta is a goddess of contradictions. She symbolises both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She represents death, temporality, and destruction as well as life, immortality, and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]&nbsp;\u2013 spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her [[self-sacrifice]]&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes coupled with a maternal element&nbsp;\u2013 sexual essence, and self-destructive fury.\n\nChhinnamasta is worshipped in the [[Shakta#Kalikula: family of Kali|Kalikula]] sect of [[Shaktism]], the Goddess-centric tradition of Hinduism. Though Chhinnamasta enjoys patronage as one of the Mahavidyas, temples devoted to her (found mostly in Nepal and eastern India) and her public worship are rare. However, she is a significant Tantric deity, well known and worshipped among esoteric Tantric practitioners. Chhinnamasta is closely related to [[Chinnamunda]]&nbsp;\u2013 the severed-headed form of the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] goddess [[Vajrayogini]].Those who worship Chinnamasta will be free from the effects of [[Rahu]] as per Shaktism.\n\n== Origins ==\n\n[[File:Chinnamunda.jpg|thumb|left|The Buddhist Chinnamunda is believed to be the antecedent of the Hindu Chhinnamasta, 14th-century painting, Nepal.|alt=A decapitated, nude, red-complexioned woman stands, raising her left arm, which holds her severed head. She is flanked by two smaller, nude women: a white-coloured one (left) and a blue-coloured one (right).]]\n\nThe Hindu Chhinnamasta appears as a significant deity in [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], where she is called [[Chinnamunda]] (\"she with the severed head\") or Trikaya-vajrayogini (\"triple-bodied [[Vajrayogini]]\"). Chinnamunda is the severed-head form of goddess Vajrayogini (or [[Vajravarahi]], a ferocious form of Vajrayogini), who is depicted similar to Chhinnamasta.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=172}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|p=94}}</ref>\n\nBuddhist texts recount the birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of [[Kanhapa|Krishnacharya]]'s disciples<!-- Mahasiddha Kanhapa -->, two ''[[Mahasiddha]]'' (\"great perfected ones\") sisters, [[Mekhala and Kanakhala]], who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also appeared in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the ''Mahasiddha'' princess [[Lakshminkara]]<!-- a Mahasiddha -->, cut off her head as a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=9\u201311}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|pp=101\u20132}}</ref>\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, [[Benoytosh Bhattacharyya|Benoytosh Bhattacharya]] \u2013 an expert on Tantra and the then director of the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda#Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute of Baroda]]<!-- http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/bot/pdf/bot_01_02_obituary.pdf--> \u2013 studied various texts such as the Buddhist ''Sadhanamala'' (1156{{nbsp}}CE), the Hindu ''Chhinnamastakalpa'' (uncertain date), and the ''Tantrasara'' by [[Krishnananda Agamavagisha]] (late 16th century). He determined that the Hindu Chhinnamasta and the Buddhist Chinnamunda were the same goddess, in spite of the fact that the former wears a serpent as a [[sacred thread]] and has an added copulating couple in the icon. In the ''Sadhanamala'', the goddess is called Sarvabuddha (\"all-awakened\"), and is attended by Vajravaironi and Vajravarnini; in the Hindu ''Tantrasara'', she is called ''Sarvasiddhi'' (\"all-accomplished\"), and is accompanied by attendants Dakini, Vaironi, and Varnini. In the ''Chhinnamastakalpa'', she is called Sarvabuddhi (\"all-enlightened\"); her attendants retain their Buddhist names. Bhattacharyya concluded that the Hindu Chhinnamasta originated from the Buddhist Chinnamunda, who was worshipped by at least the 7th century.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=12\u20135}}</ref> \n[[File:Bundi painting Chinnamasta.jpg|thumb|Chhinnamasta depicted enthroned appears in a benign form contrary to her traditional description, [[Rajput painting|Bundi painting]], c. 1775.|alt=Depicted enthroned, a decapitated, dark-complexioned woman wearing a red/orange sari holds a sword in her left hand and her own severed head  (with a lotus crown) on a platter in her right hand.

Shankaranarayanan \u2013 the author of ''The Ten Great Cosmic Powers'' \u2013 attribute Chhinnamasta to [[Vedic]] (ancient Hindu) antecedents. Sukumari Bhattacharji, the author of ''The Indian Theogony'', says that the Vedic goddess [[Nirrti]]'s functions were inherited by later Hindu goddesses [[Kali]], [[Chamunda]], Karali, and Chhinnamasta. Hindu literature first mentions Chhinnamasta in the ''[[upapurana]]'' ''Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana'' (c.{{nbsp}}950{{nbsp}}CE) and the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'' (9th\u201312th century). Elisabeth{{nbsp}}A. Benard, the author of ''Chinnamast\u0101: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu Tantric Goddess'',{{efn\n| name = Benard\n| The book is referred to as \"the first monograph to examine the rituals, symbolisms, and iconographic conventions\" of Chhinnamasta.<ref>{{harvtxt|McDermott|1996|pp=357\u20138}}</ref>\n}} says that whatever her origins may be, it is clear that Chhinnamasta/Chinnamunda was known in the 9th century and worshipped by ''Mahasiddha''s.<ref name = \"B16\">{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=16\u20137}}</ref> Though essentially agreeing with Bhattacharyya's view, Karel R. van{{nbsp}}Kooij, former Professor of South Asian art history at [[Leiden University]], goes further and associates the iconography of Chhinnamasta with the Tantric goddesses [[Varahi]] and Chamunda.<ref>{{harvtxt|van Kooij|1999|p=266}}</ref>\n\nDavid Kinsley, an expert on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at [[McMaster University]], agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are depicted semi nude and wear tiger skin skirt and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless .<ref name = \"K175\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=175}}</ref><ref name = \"K176\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=176}}</ref>\n\nOther nude Hindu goddesses who might have inspired Chhinnamasta are the malevolent war goddess [[Kotavi]] and the South-Indian hunting goddess [[Korravai]]. Kotavi, sometimes described as a [[Matrika]] (\"mother goddess\"), is nude, dishevelled, wild, and awful in appearance. She is mentioned in the scriptures ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', often as a foe of the god [[Vishnu]]. The ferocious, wild Korravai is the goddess of war and victory. Both goddesses are linked to battlefields; Chhinnamasta is not.<ref name = \"K176\"/> Kinsley points out that while there are several bloodthirsty, nude, and wild goddesses and demonesses in Hindu mythology, Chhinnamasta is the only goddess who displays the shocking self-decapitation motif.<ref name = \"K177\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=144\u20137}}</ref>\n\nThe beheading and rejoining motif also appears in the tale of the goddess [[Renuka]]; however the self-decapitation is missing in the legend.<ref name=\"Mishra315\">{{harvtxt|Mishra|Mohanty|Mohanty|2002|p=315}}</ref><ref name=\"Storm296\">{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|p=296}}</ref> In the context of her legend, Renuka is given the epithet \"Chhinnamasta\" (\"She whose head is severed\").<ref name = \"Mahalakshmi204\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|pp=204}}</ref><ref name = \"B6ff\">{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=6\u20137}}</ref> The mahavidya Chhinnamasta is also associated with Renuka's son [[Parashurama]], who decapitated his mother in the legend.<ref name=\"shasthi\"/>{{efn\n| name = Renuka\n| Renuka is the wife of the sage [[Jamadagni]]. Once, seeing a celestial king engaged in sexual enjoyment with a nymph, Renuka developed lust to enjoy similar experience with her husband or lusted for a moment for the king. As a result, she lost her effulgence gained by the power of her non-attachment and chastity. On the order of his father, Renuka's youngest son Parashurama beheads her after his four elder brothers refuse. Jamadagni burns his four elder sons by his fiery glance for their non-compliance. Pleased with Parashurama's obedience, the sage grants him a boon; Parashurama asks that his mother and his brothers be brought back to life, which is materialized. Renuka is purified and venerated as a goddess henceforth.<ref name = \"Mahalakshmi204\"/><ref name = \"B6ff\"/>\n}}\n\nThe name \"Chhinnamasta\" is also used as a generic name for goddess icons which do not have heads, such as those at [[Chinnamasta Bhagawati]], Na-kati Bhavani shrine in [[Aurangabad district, Bihar]] and the goddess shrine in Uchchaith, [[Madhubani district]], [[Bihar]]; these goddesses are not identified with the mahavidya Chhinnamasta.{{efn|name=Chinnamasta Bhagawati}}{{efn|name=Kavyamata|The Na-Kati Bhavani icon is associated with [[Kavyamata]], whose head was severed and killed by the god Vishnu and later resurrected by her husband, the sage [[Bhrigu]].

Though she is also called Chhinnamasta by devotees, the naming is erroneous, according to the priest.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dainik Jagran|26 July 2016}}</ref>}}{{efn|name=Uchchaith}}\n\nThe theme of self-decapitation and the severed head is recurring in Indian mythology. Legends from the ''[[Singhasan Battisi|Simhasana Dvatrimsika]]'' and the ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' speak of how the hero offers blood from his throat as an offering to a goddess. [[Rajasthan]]i folk tales and songs tell about of warrior-heroes (''[[Headless Horseman#In Indian folklore|jhumjharji]]'' or ''bhomiya'') who cuts off his head before the war or is decapitated in action, but battles on \u2013 without his head \u2013 slaying foes until he avenges his beheading and dies.<ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|pp =101, 428\u20139}}</ref> The decapitated body and head motif is not unique to Hinduism and Buddhism and appears across the world, including the [[Cephalophore]] saints of Christianity and in [[Celts|Celtic culture]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Buturovic|2016|p=81}}</ref>\n\n==Legends and textual references==\nChhinnamasta is often named as the fifth<ref name = \"K165\"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Foulston|Abbott|2009|p=120}}</ref><ref name=\"Storm287\">{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|p=287}}</ref> or sixth<ref name=\"McDaniel270\">{{harvtxt|McDaniel|2004|p=259}}</ref><ref name=\"Frawley112\"/><ref name=\"shasthi\"/> [[Mahavidya]] (Mahavidyas are a group of ten fearsome goddesses from the Hindu esoteric tradition of [[Tantra]]), with hymns identifying her as a fierce aspect of [[Devi]], the Hindu Mother goddess. Kinsley says that three Mahavidyas&nbsp;\u2013 [[Kali]], [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]], and Chhinnamasta&nbsp;\u2013 are prominent among Mahavidya depictions and lists, but that Chhinnamasta barely has an independent existence outside the group.<ref name = \"K165\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=165}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=2, 5, 9}}</ref> The ''Guhyatiguhya-Tantra'' (c. 9th century) equates the god [[Vishnu]]'s [[Dashavatara|ten avatars]] with the ten Mahavidyas; the man-lion avatar [[Narasimha]] is described to have arisen from Chhinnamasta.<ref name = \"K161\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=161}}</ref> A similar list in ''Mundamala Tantra'' (pre-16th century) equates Chhinnamasta with the avatar Parshurama.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|p=5}}</ref><ref name=\"shasthi\">{{harvtxt|S Shankaranarayanan|2002|pp=77-8}}</ref>{{efn| name = Renuka}}\n\nChhinnamasta appears in two distinct set of legends: the origin myths of Mahavidyas as a group and those explaining the genesis of Chhinnamasta as an individual goddess.\n\n=== Mahavidyas as a group ===\n\nA story from the ''Shakta Maha-Bhagavata Purana'' and the ''[[Brihaddharma Purana]]'' (13th century) narrates the creation of all Mahavidyas, including Chhinnamasta. The story is as follows: [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], the daughter of [[Daksha]], is the first wife of the god [[Shiva]]. When she and Shiva are not invited to the [[Daksha yajna|fire sacrifice organized by her father]], she is insulted and insists on attending, despite Shiva's protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent for her to attend, the enraged Sati assumes a fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the ''Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana'', Chhinnamasta stands to the right of Shiva, interpreted as the east or the west; the ''Brihaddharma Purana'' describes her as appearing to the rear of Shiva in the west.<ref name=\"K162\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=162}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=1\u20133}}</ref><ref name=\"mahalakshmi201\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=201}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|2000|p=470}}</ref>{{efn| name = Daksha yajna}}\n\nSimilar legends exist. In these legends, the Mahavidyas arise from the wrath of other goddesses, specifically, [[Parvati]] (the second wife of Shiva and the [[reincarnation]] of Sati) and Kali (the principal Mahavidya). In one legend, Shiva and Parvati are living in the house of [[Himavat|\nParvati's father]]. Shiva wants to leave, but Parvati creates the ten fierce Mahavidyas who appear from ten directions and prevent him from leaving. In another legend, Shiva is living with Kali, identified as Shiva's consort in this context, but becomes tired of her and wants to leave. Kali creates the Mahavidyas who also obstruct his path from ten directions. Kali enlightens him and he ceases trying to leave.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Devi Bhagavata Purana'' also mentions the Mahavidyas as war-companions and forms of the goddess [[Shakambhari]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=31}}</ref> An oral tradition similarly replaces Shakambhari with the goddess [[Durga]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=30}}</ref>\n\n=== Chhinnamasta as an individual goddess ===\n\nThe ''Pranatoshini Tantra'' (18th century) narrates two tales of Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, attributed to the ''Narada-pancharatra'', tells how once, while bathing in [[Mandakini River|Mandakini]] river, Parvati becomes excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.<ref name=\"D412\">{{harvtxt|Donaldson|2001|p=412}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=147\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe other version, from the ''Pranatoshini Tantra'' and attributed to ''Svatantra Tantra'', is narrated by Shiva. He recounts that his consort [[Chandi]]ka (identified with Parvati) was engrossed in coitus with him in [[woman on top|reverse posture]], but became enraged at his seminal emission. Her attendants Dakini and Varnini rose from her body. The rest of the tale is similar to the earlier version, although the river is called Pushpabhadra, the day of Chhinnamasta's birth is called ''Viraratri'', and upon seeing the pale Parvati, Shiva becomes infuriated and assumes the form of Krodha [[Bhairava]].<ref name=\"K148\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=148}}</ref><ref name=\"mahalakshmi202\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=202}}</ref> This version is retold in the ''Shaktisamgama Tantra'' (c. 16th century),<ref name=\"K148\" /> in which Chhinnamasta forms a triad with Kali and Tara.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|2000|p=464}}</ref>\n\nAn oral legend tells how the goddess Prachanda Chandika appeared to aid the gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess [[Mahadevi|Mahashakti]].

The name Prachanda Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the ''Shakta Pramoda'' (19th century).<ref name=\"K148\"/> Another oral legend relates her to the [[Samudra manthan]] (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the [[Kshir Sagar|milk ocean]] to acquire the ''[[amrita]]'' (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself to prevent them from acquiring it.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe central themes of the mythology of Chhinnamasta are her [[Self sacrifice|self-sacrifice]]&nbsp;\u2013 with a maternal aspect (in the ''Pranatoshini'' ''Tantra'' versions) or for the welfare of the world (in the Samudra manthan oral version described above)&nbsp;\u2013 her sexual dominance and embrace (second ''Pranatoshini'' ''Tantra'' version), and her self-destructive fury (in the first oral legend).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=149\u201350}}</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Chhinnamasta.JPG|thumb|Chhinnamasta, at a [[Kali Puja]] Pandal, [[Kolkata]]|alt=A decapitated, nude, red-complexioned goddess stands on a copulating couple inside a lotus.

Chhinnamasta is the violent interaction between the Light and the Sound enabling Creation. Chhinnamasta severing her own head is interpreted symbolic of the disconnecting of the Source and the manifest Creation, similar to cutting the umbilical cord between the mother and the new-born. Further, Chhinnamasta is associated with thunder and lightning, interacting light and sound forces. Her epithet, Vajra Vairochani (\"radiant like the vajra\"), is linked to the ''[[vajra]]'' (thunderbolt) and its divine master - [[Indra]], the king of heaven and the god of rain, thunder and lightning.<ref>{{harvtxt|S Shankaranarayanan|2002|pp=69\u201372}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Frawley|1994|p=116}}</ref>\n\nThe head offering and subsequent restoration of the head signify immortality.

The image of Chhinnamasta standing on a copulating couple of Kamadeva (literally, \"sexual desire\") and Rati (\"sexual intercourse\") is interpreted by some scholars as a symbol of a person's ''control'' over sexual desire, while others interpret the goddess as being the ''embodiment'' of sexual energy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|pp=294\u20135}}</ref>\n\nHer names, such as ''[[Yogini]]'' and ''Madanatura'' (\"one who has affects [[Kama]]\"), convey her [[yogic]] control over sexual energy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=154}}</ref> Her triumphant stance trampling the love-deity couple denotes victory over desire and ''[[samsara]]'' (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth).<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=105\u20136}}</ref> Her subjugation of the amorous couple suggests that her worship will grant control over sexual urge and other impulses of the ''[[indriya]]''s (\"senses\"), whose governing god Indra - she is associated with.<ref>{{harvtxt|S Shankaranarayanan|2002|pp=71-2}}</ref> \n\nImages in which Chhinnamasta is depicted sitting on Kamadeva-Rati in a non-suppressive fashion suggest that sexual energy is a manifestation of the goddess herself, and therefore should be embraced, and not suppressed. Images where Shiva is depicted in coitus with Chhinnamasta are associated with this interpretation. Chhinnamasta's names like ''Kameshwari'' (\"goddess of desire\") and ''Ratiragavivriddhini'' (\"one who is engrossed in the realm of Rati&nbsp;\u2013 [copulation or sexual desire]\") and the appearance of ''klim''&nbsp;\u2013 the common seed syllable of Kamadeva and Krishna&nbsp;\u2013 in her mantra support this interpretation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=155\u20137}}</ref> Her lolling tongue also denotes sexual hunger.<ref name=\"mahalakshmi204\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=204}}</ref>\n\nThe inverted triangle, found in Chhinnamasta's iconography as well as in her yantra, signifies the ''[[yoni]]'' (womb) and the feminine.

Said]], in which the author developed the idea of \"[[Orientalism]]\" to define [[Western world|the West]]'s historically patronizing representations of \"[[Orient|The East]]\"\u2014the societies and peoples who inhabit the places of Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. Said argued that Orientalism, in the sense of the Western scholarship about the [[Eastern World]], is inextricably tied to the [[Imperialism|imperialist]] societies who produced it, which makes much Orientalist work inherently political and servile to [[power (social and political)|power]].<ref>''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition. (1999) p. 617.</ref>\n\nAccording to Said, in the Middle East, the social, economic, and cultural practices of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] Arab elites indicate they are imperial [[Satrapy|satraps]] who have [[internalization|internalized]] the romanticized \"[[Arabic culture|Arab Culture]]\" created by French, British and, later, American Orientalists; the examples include critical analyses of the [[colonialism|colonial]] literature of [[Joseph Conrad]], which conflates a people, a time, and a place into a narrative of incident and adventure in an exotic land.<ref>''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', Third Edition (1994), pp. 642.</ref>\n\nThe critical application of [[post-structuralism]] in the scholarship of ''Orientalism'' influenced the development of [[literary theory]], cultural [[criticism]], and the field of [[Middle Eastern studies]], especially regarding how academics practice their intellectual inquiry when examining, describing, and explaining the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"newhumanist\">Stephen Howe, [http://newhumanist.org.uk/1908 \"Dangerous mind?\"], ''New Humanist'', Vol. 123, November/December 2008</ref> The scope of Said's scholarship established ''Orientalism'' as a foundation text in the field of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial culture studies]], which examines the denotations and connotations of Orientalism, and the history of a country's post-colonial period.<ref>''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', Third Edition (1994), pp. 642\u201343, 581\u201383</ref>\n\nAs a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], Edward Said debated Orientalism with historians and scholars of [[area studies]], notably, the historian [[Bernard Lewis]], who described the thesis of ''Orientalism'' as \"[[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]]\".<ref>Oleg Grabar, Edward Said, Bernard Lewis, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/6517 \"Orientalism: An Exchange\"], ''New York Review of Books'', Vol. 29, No. 13. 12 August 1982.

Therefore, Orientalism was a method of practical and cultural discrimination that was applied to non-European societies and peoples in order to establish European imperial [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]].

''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 2-3.</ref> Western writings about the Orient, the perceptions of the East presented in Orientalism, cannot be taken at face value, because they are cultural representations based upon fictional, Western images of the Orient. The history of European colonial rule and political domination of Eastern civilizations, distorts the intellectual [[Neutrality (philosophy)|objectivity]] of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and culturally sympathetic Western Orientalist; thus did the term \"Orientalism\" become a pejorative word regarding non\u2013Western peoples and cultures:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/16/middleeast.islam|title=Orientalism today is just another form of insult|last=Buruma|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Buruma|date=16 June 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|I doubt if it is controversial, for example, to say that an Englishman in India, or Egypt, in the later nineteenth century, took an interest in those countries, which was never far from their status, in his mind, as British colonies.

Such a binary relation, in a hierarchy of weakness and strength, derives from the European psychological need to create a [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] of cultural inequality, between West and East, which inequality is attributable to \"immutable cultural [[Essentialism|essences]]\" inherent to Oriental peoples and things.<ref>Said, Edward.

The Western world had been surprised, by the pro-active and decisive actions of non-Western peoples, whom the ideology of Orientalism had defined as [[Essentialism|essentially]] weak societies and impotent countries.

He argued that \u201cOrientalism is not a mere political subject or field that is reflected passively by culture, scholarship, or institutions\u201d, but rather \u201ca distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic, scholarly, economic, sociological, historical, and philological texts\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" /> European literature for Said carried, actualised, and propelled Orientalist notions forward and constantly reinforced them.

In ''Dangerous Knowledge'', Irwin relates that the 19th-century English Arabist [[Edward William Lane]], compiler of the great '' [[Arabic-English Lexicon]]'' [1840], \"used to complain that he had become so used to the cursive calligraphy of his Arabic manuscripts that he found Western print a great strain on his eyes.\"\n\nOrientalism, in its heyday, was a branch of knowledge as demanding and rigorous as its near cousin, [[Egyptology]]. The first International Congress of Orientalists met in 1873; its name was not changed until a full century later. But there are no self-declared Orientalists today. The reason is that the late Edward Said turned the word into a pejorative. In his 1978 book ''Orientalism'', the Palestinian-born Said, a professor of [[comparative literature]] at Columbia University, claimed that an endemic Western prejudice against the East had congealed into a modern ideology of racist supremacy\u2014a kind of [[anti-Semitism]] directed against Arabs and Muslims. Throughout Europe's history, announced Said, \"every European, in that he could say about the Orient, was a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally ethnocentric.\"\n\nIn a [[Semantics|semantic]] sleight of hand, Said appropriated the term \"Orientalism\", as a label for the ideological prejudice he described, thereby, neatly implicating the scholars who called themselves Orientalists. At best, charged Said, the work of these scholars was biased, so as to confirm the inferiority of Islam. At worst, Orientalists had directly served European empires, showing [[proconsul]]s how best to conquer and control Muslims. To substantiate his indictment, Said cherry-picked evidence, ignored whatever contradicted his thesis, and filled the gaps with conspiracy theories.|\"Enough Said\", ''Commentary'' magazine (March 2007)}}\n\nNonetheless, the literary critic [[Paul De Man]] said that, as a literary critic, \"Said took a step further than any other modern scholar of his time, something I dare not do.

In ''Approaches to the History of the Middle East'' (1994), Keddie criticised Said's work on Orientalism, for the unfortunate consequences upon her profession as an historian:\n \n{{Quotation|I think that there has been a tendency in the Middle East field to adopt the word \"orientalism\" as a generalized swear-word, essentially referring to people who take the \"wrong\" position on the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Arab\u2013Israeli dispute]], or to people who are judged too \"conservative\". It has nothing to do with whether they are good or not good in their disciplines. So, \"orientalism\", for many people, is a word that substitutes for [[Intellectualism|thought]] and enables people to dismiss certain scholars and their works. I think that is too bad.

Said argued that Orientalism, in the sense of the Western scholarship about the [[Eastern World]], is inextricably tied to the [[Imperialism|imperialist]] societies who produced it, which makes much Orientalist work inherently political and servile to [[power (social and political)|power]].<ref>''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition.

In ''Dangerous Knowledge'', Irwin relates that the 19th-century English Arabist [[Edward William Lane]], compiler of the great '' [[Arabic-English Lexicon]]'' [1840], \"used to complain that he had become so used to the cursive calligraphy of his Arabic manuscripts that he found Western print a great strain on his eyes.\"\n\nOrientalism, in its heyday, was a branch of knowledge as demanding and rigorous as its near cousin, [[Egyptology]]. The first International Congress of Orientalists met in 1873; its name was not changed until a full century later. But there are no self-declared Orientalists today. The reason is that the late Edward Said turned the word into a pejorative. In his 1978 book ''Orientalism'', the Palestinian-born Said, a professor of [[comparative literature]] at Columbia University, claimed that an endemic Western prejudice against the East had congealed into a modern ideology of racist supremacy\u2014a kind of [[anti-Semitism]] directed against Arabs and Muslims. Throughout Europe's history, announced Said, \"every European, in that he could say about the Orient, was a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally ethnocentric.\"\n\nIn a [[Semantics|semantic]] sleight of hand, Said appropriated the term \"Orientalism\", as a label for the ideological prejudice he described, thereby, neatly implicating the scholars who called themselves Orientalists. At best, charged Said, the work of these scholars was biased, so as to confirm the inferiority of Islam. At worst, Orientalists had directly served European empires, showing [[proconsul]]s how best to conquer and control Muslims. To substantiate his indictment, Said cherry-picked evidence, ignored whatever contradicted his thesis, and filled the gaps with conspiracy theories.|\"Enough Said\", ''Commentary'' magazine (March 2007)}}\n\nNonetheless, the literary critic [[Paul De Man]] said that, as a literary critic, \"Said took a step further than any other modern scholar of his time, something I dare not do.

In ''Approaches to the History of the Middle East'' (1994), Keddie criticised Said's work on Orientalism, for the unfortunate consequences upon her profession as an historian:\n \n{{Quotation|I think that there has been a tendency in the Middle East field to adopt the word \"orientalism\" as a generalized swear-word, essentially referring to people who take the \"wrong\" position on the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Arab\u2013Israeli dispute]], or to people who are judged too \"conservative\".

Kejariwal, ''The Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Discovery of India's Past'', Delhi: Oxford UP, 1988: pp. ix\u2013xi, 221\u2013233.</ref>\n\nIn the essay ''The Debate About 'Orientalism''', [[Harry Oldmeadow]] said \"that Said\u2019s treatment of Orientalism, particularly the assertion of the necessary nexus with imperialism, is over-stated and unbalanced.\" He objected to Said's view that Western Orientalists were projecting upon the \"artificial screen called \u201cthe East\u201d or \u201cthe Orient\u201d, but that such projection was only a small part of the relationship. That Said failed to adequately distinguish between the genuine experiences of the Orient and the cultural projections of Westerners. He further criticized Said for using reductionist models of religion and spirituality, that are based on \"Marxist/Foucauldian/psychoanalytic thought\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions|last=Oldmeadow|first=Harry|publisher=World Wisdom, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0941532577|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGeorge Landlow argued that Said assumed that such projection and its harmful consequences are a purely Western phenomenon, when in reality all societies do this to each other. This was a particular issue given Said treated Western colonialism as unique, which Landlow regarded as unsatisfactory for a work of serious scholarship.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/landow/post/poldiscourse/said/orient14.html |title=Edward W.

''Social Scientist'', Vol. 27. No. 9/10 (Sept.\u2013Oct. 1999), pp. 79.</ref> Therefore, from the perspective of the Orientalist academic, Said's personal background might, arguably, exclude him from writing about the Oriental world, hindered by an upper-class birth, an Anglophone upbringing, a British-school education in Cairo, residency in the U.S., a university-professor job; and categorical statements, such as: \"any and all representations ... are embedded, first, in the language, and then, in the culture, institutions, and political ambience of the representer ... [the cultural representations are] interwoven with a great many other things, besides 'the Truth', which is, itself, a representation.\"<ref>''Orientalism'': p. 272</ref>\n\nHence, in the article \"Orients and Occidents: Colonial Discourse Theory and the Historiography of the British Empire\", D.A. Washbrook said that Said and his academic cohort indulge in excessive [[cultural relativism]], which intellectual excess traps them in a \"[[Solipsism|web of solipsism]]\", which limits conversation exclusively to \"cultural representations\" and to denying the existence of {{em|any}} [[objective truth]].<ref>D.A. Washbrook, \"Orients and Occidents: Colonial Discourse Theory and the Historiography of the British Empire\", in ''Historiography'', vol. 5 of ''The Oxford History of the British Empire'' p. 607.</ref> That Said and his followers fail to distinguish between the types and degrees of Orientalism represented by the news media and popular culture (e.g., the light Orientalism of the children's movie ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', 1984), and heavy academic Orientalism about the language and literature, history and culture of the peoples of the Eastern world.<ref>Said, Edward, \"Afterword\", ''Orientalism'' (1978) 1995 ed. p. 347.</ref><ref>Kaizaad Navroze Kotwal, [http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue12/templeofdoom.html \"Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as Virtual Reality: The Orientalist and Colonial Legacies of Gunga Din,\"] ''The Film Journal'' no. 12, April 2005.</ref>\n\nIn the article \"Orientalism Now\" (1995), the historian Gyan Prakash said that Edward Said had explored fields of Orientalism already surveyed by his predecessors and contemporaries, such as [[Victor Kiernan|V. G. Kiernan]], [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard S. Cohn]], and [[Anwar Abdel Malek]], who also had studied, reported, and interpreted the social relationship that makes the practice of imperialism intellectually, psychologically, and ethically feasible; that is, the relationship between European imperial rule and European representations of the non-European Other self, the colonised people.<ref name=Prakash>{{cite journal | last1 = Prakash | first1 = G. | year = 1995 | title = Orientalism Now | url = | journal = History and Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 3| page = 200 }}</ref> That, as an academic investigator, Said already had been preceded in the critical analysis of the production of Orientalist knowledge and about Western methods of Orientalist scholarship, because, in the 18th century, \"[[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]] [1753\u20131825], the Egyptian chronicler, and a witness to [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798]], for example, had no doubt that the expedition was as much an [[epistemological]] as military conquest\". Nonetheless, [[George Landow (professor)|George Landow]], of Brown University, who criticized Said's scholarship and contested his conclusions, acknowledged that ''Orientalism'' is a major work of cultural criticism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/landow/post/poldiscourse/said/orient14.html |title=Edward W.

In 1531, a royal decree required the clergy to take an [[English post-Reformation oaths|oath acknowledging the King]] as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]].

Retrieved 1 December 2015.</ref>\n\n=== ''Utopia'' ===\n{{Main|Utopia (book)}}\n\nMore's best known and most controversial work, ''Utopia'' is a [[frame narrative]] written in Latin.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} More completed and theologian [[Erasmus]] published the book in [[Leuven]] in 1516, but it was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place] and 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]]. Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical \"[[Utopian language#Writing system|Utopian alphabet]]\" omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of [[shorthand]].\n\nUtopia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised). More may have used [[Monasticism|monastic communalism]] as his model, although other concepts such as legalising [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.\n\n''Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Early works influenced by ''Utopia'' included ''[[New Atlantis]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], ''[[Erewhon]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]]. Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern science fiction.\n\n=== Religious polemics ===\nIn 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug.), ''Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church'' (Oct.), and ''On the Liberty of a Christian Man'' (Nov.).<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225\u20136}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther's criticisms with the ''Assertio,'' written with More's assistance. [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded the English king with the title 'Fidei defensor' (\"Defender of the Faith\") for his work combating Luther's heresies.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|226\u20137}}\n\nMartin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a \"pig, dolt, and liar\".<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|227}} At the king's request, More composed a rebuttal: the ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' was published at the end of 1523. In the ''Responsio,'' More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered \"a much steadier personality\",<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C |title=The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History |author=John Vidmar |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2005 |isbn=0809142341 |page=184|author-link=John Vidmar }}</ref> described Luther as an \"ape\", a \"drunkard\", and a \"lousy little friar\" amongst other epithets.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus,<ref name=rebhorn /> More tells Luther that:\n\n:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity's shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.<ref name=\"Dundes\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFvY2jWqBlQC |author1=Alan Dundes |author2=Carl R.

He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|279\u201381}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with ''The Supplication of Souls''.\n\nIn 1531, a year after More's father died, [[William Tyndale]] published ''An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue'' in response to More's ''Dialogue Concerning Heresies.'' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer''. The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale's criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}} More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}}\n\n=== Correspondence ===\nMost major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called \"prison-letters\" (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution.<ref name=\"Gerard\" /> More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.<ref name=\"MoynahanBrian\" />\n\nMore also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: ''A Treatise on the Passion'' (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), ''A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body'' (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and ''De Tristitia Christi'' (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last which reads in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, confessor of Emperor Charles V. More's friend [[Luis Vives]] received it in Valencia, where it remains in the collection of [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]] museum.\n\n== Canonization ==\n[[File:MEDAILLON.OF.SAINT.THOMAS.MORE.jpg|thumb|Medal of Saint Thomas More]]\n\n==={{anchor|Catholic Church}} Catholic Church ===\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] Thomas More, [[John Fisher]], and [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation#Beatified 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII|52 other English Martyrs]] on 29 December 1886.

The original translation reads \u201cAnd though the number of shepe increase neuer so fast, yet the pryce falleth not one myte, because there be so fewe sellers.\u201d In that sentence St. Thomas More describes on of the main pillar of oligopoly market, few sellers that are able to influence the market price.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chamberlin|first=Edward|date=Jun 1957|title=On the Origin of \"Oligopoly\"|url=|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=67|pages=212-213|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Literature and popular culture ==\n[[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]]'s biography of More was one of the first biographies in Modern English.\n\n''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'' is a play written circa 1592 in collaboration with [[Henry Chettle]], [[Anthony Munday]], [[William Shakespeare]], and others. In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors, as well as the censorious influence of Edmund Tylney, [[Master of the Revels]] in the government of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The script has since been published and has had several productions.<ref name=\"Long, William B. 1989 pages 49\">Long, William B. ''The Occasion of the Book of Sir Thomas More''.

Page 1</ref>\n\nThe 20th-century agnostic playwright [[Robert Bolt]] portrayed Thomas More as the [[tragic hero]] of his 1960 play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]''. The title is drawn from what [[Robert Whittington]] in 1520 wrote of More:\n\n<blockquote>More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref name=oconnell /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1966, the play ''A Man for All Seasons'' was adapted into a [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film]] with the same title. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]] and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars [[Paul Scofield]], a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was \"the most difficult part I played.\"<ref>Gary O'Connor (2002), ''Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons'', Applause Books. Page 150.</ref> The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Scofield won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]]. In 1988 [[Charlton Heston]] starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of \"the common man\" that had been cut from the 1966 film.\n\nCatholic science fiction writer [[R. A. Lafferty]] wrote his novel ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' as a modern equivalent to More's ''Utopia'', which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world \"Astrobe\", only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: \"He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one.\"\n\n[[Karl Zuchardt]]'s novel, ''[[Stirb du Narr!]]'' (\"Die you fool!\"), about More's struggle with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]], portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.\n\nThe novelist [[Hilary Mantel]] portrays More as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants, and an ally of the Habsburg empire, in her 2009 novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', told from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\nLiterary critic James Wood in his book ''The Broken Estate'', a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as \"cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics\".<ref name=\"Wood2010\">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiI8Kwd6j9AC&pg=PA15|year=2010|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42956-0|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Aaron Zelman]]'s non-fiction book ''The State Versus the People'' includes a comparison of ''Utopia'' with Plato's ''Republic''. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a [[police state]]. Zelman comments, \"More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By this Zelman implies that ''Utopia'' influenced [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], despite their brutal repression of religion.\n\nOther biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the [[Holy See]] over [[Christendom]].\n\nThe protagonist of [[Walker Percy]]'s novels, ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' and ''[[The Thanatos Syndrome]]'', is \"Dr Thomas More\", a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.\n\nMore is the focus of the [[Al Stewart]] song \"A Man For All Seasons\" from the 1978 album ''[[Time Passages]]'', and of the [[Far (band)|Far]] song \"Sir\", featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album ''[[Quick (album)|Quick]]''. In addition, the song \"[[So Says I]]\" by indie rock outfit [[The Shins]] alludes to the socialist interpretation of More's ''Utopia''.\n\n[[Jeremy Northam]] depicts More in the television series ''[[The Tudors]] ''as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch. He also shows More loathing Protestantism, burning both Martin Luther's books and English Protestants who have been convicted of heresy. The portrayal has unhistorical aspects, such as that More neither personally caused nor attended [[Simon Fish]]'s execution (since Fish actually died of [[bubonic plague]] in 1531 before he could stand trial), although More's ''The Supplycatyon of Soulys'', published in October 1529, addressed Fish's [[Simon Fish#Supplycatyon of Soulys: St. Thomas More's Response to Simon Fish|''Supplication for the Beggars'']].<ref name=FishOnline1>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/asupplicacyonfo01fishgoog|quote=simon fish.|title=A Supplicacyon for the Beggers|publisher=Early English Text Society|last1=Fish|first1=Simon|year=1871}}</ref><ref name=MoreVsFish1>see Fish, Simon. \"Supplycacion for the Beggar.\" 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B.

The series also neglected to show More's avowed insistence that Richard Rich's testimony about More disputing the King's title as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] was perjured.\n\nIn 2002, More was placed at number 37 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].<ref>Sue Parrill, William Baxter Robison (2013). \"The Tudors on Film and Television\", p. 92.

[[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby Hall]], which was part of More's London residence, was eventually relocated and reconstructed in Chelsea by conservation architect [[Walter Godfrey]] in 1910. Rebuilt in the 1990s, the white stone building stands amid modern brick structures that attempt to recapture the style of More's former manor on the site. Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public. The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim. Apartment buildings and a park cover the former gardens and orchard; Roper's Garden is the park atop one of More's gardens, sunken as his was believed to be. No other remnants exist of the More estate.\n\n=== Chelsea Old Church ===\n[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14.JPG|thumb|Thomas More statue, Chelsea Old Church]]\nAcross a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by L. Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as \"saint\", \"scholar\", and \"statesman\"; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer & St. Thomas More honours the martyr.\n\n=== Tower Hill ===\nA plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill, London, just outside the Tower of London, as well as all those executed there, many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. More's corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula]], within the walls of the [[Tower of London]], as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.\n\n=== St Katharine Docks ===\nThomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of \"Knighten Guild\", derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringeastlondon.co.uk/eel/Stkatharines/Stkatharines.htm#More|title=St Katharine's Dock|publisher=Exploring East London|accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== St Dunstan's Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===\n[[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]], an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More's head, rescued by his daughter [[Margaret Roper]], whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church's sanctuary or main altar. [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]] has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schulte Herbr\u00fcggen|first=Hubertus|title=Das Haupt des Thomas Morus in der St. Dunstan-Kirche zu Canterbury|series=Forschungsberichte des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen|year=1982|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften}}</ref> Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life.

Retrieved 1 December 2015.</ref>\n\n=== ''Utopia'' ===\n{{Main|Utopia (book)}}\n\nMore's best known and most controversial work, ''Utopia'' is a [[frame narrative]] written in Latin.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} More completed and theologian [[Erasmus]] published the book in [[Leuven]] in 1516, but it was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place] and 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]]. Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical \"[[Utopian language#Writing system|Utopian alphabet]]\" omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of [[shorthand]].\n\nUtopia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised). More may have used [[Monasticism|monastic communalism]] as his model, although other concepts such as legalising [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.\n\n''Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Early works influenced by ''Utopia'' included ''[[New Atlantis]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], ''[[Erewhon]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]]. Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern science fiction.\n\n=== Religious polemics ===\nIn 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug.), ''Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church'' (Oct.), and ''On the Liberty of a Christian Man'' (Nov.).<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225\u20136}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther's criticisms with the ''Assertio,'' written with More's assistance. [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded the English king with the title 'Fidei defensor' (\"Defender of the Faith\") for his work combating Luther's heresies.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|226\u20137}}\n\nMartin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a \"pig, dolt, and liar\".<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|227}} At the king's request, More composed a rebuttal: the ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' was published at the end of 1523. In the ''Responsio,'' More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered \"a much steadier personality\",<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C |title=The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History |author=John Vidmar |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2005 |isbn=0809142341 |page=184|author-link=John Vidmar }}</ref> described Luther as an \"ape\", a \"drunkard\", and a \"lousy little friar\" amongst other epithets.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus,<ref name=rebhorn /> More tells Luther that:\n\n:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity's shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.<ref name=\"Dundes\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFvY2jWqBlQC |author1=Alan Dundes |author2=Carl R.

He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|279\u201381}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with ''The Supplication of Souls''.\n\nIn 1531, a year after More's father died, [[William Tyndale]] published ''An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue'' in response to More's ''Dialogue Concerning Heresies.'' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer''. The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale's criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}} More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}}\n\n=== Correspondence ===\nMost major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called \"prison-letters\" (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution.<ref name=\"Gerard\" /> More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.<ref name=\"MoynahanBrian\" />\n\nMore also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: ''A Treatise on the Passion'' (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), ''A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body'' (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and ''De Tristitia Christi'' (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last which reads in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, confessor of Emperor Charles V. More's friend [[Luis Vives]] received it in Valencia, where it remains in the collection of [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]] museum.\n\n== Canonization ==\n[[File:MEDAILLON.OF.SAINT.THOMAS.MORE.jpg|thumb|Medal of Saint Thomas More]]\n\n==={{anchor|Catholic Church}} Catholic Church ===\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] Thomas More, [[John Fisher]], and [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation#Beatified 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII|52 other English Martyrs]] on 29 December 1886.

In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors, as well as the censorious influence of Edmund Tylney, [[Master of the Revels]] in the government of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

The title is drawn from what [[Robert Whittington]] in 1520 wrote of More:\n\n<blockquote>More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref name=oconnell /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1966, the play ''A Man for All Seasons'' was adapted into a [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film]] with the same title. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]] and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars [[Paul Scofield]], a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was \"the most difficult part I played.\"<ref>Gary O'Connor (2002), ''Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons'', Applause Books. Page 150.</ref> The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Scofield won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]]. In 1988 [[Charlton Heston]] starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of \"the common man\" that had been cut from the 1966 film.\n\nCatholic science fiction writer [[R. A. Lafferty]] wrote his novel ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' as a modern equivalent to More's ''Utopia'', which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world \"Astrobe\", only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: \"He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one.\"\n\n[[Karl Zuchardt]]'s novel, ''[[Stirb du Narr!]]'' (\"Die you fool!\"), about More's struggle with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]], portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.\n\nThe novelist [[Hilary Mantel]] portrays More as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants, and an ally of the Habsburg empire, in her 2009 novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', told from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\nLiterary critic James Wood in his book ''The Broken Estate'', a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as \"cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics\".<ref name=\"Wood2010\">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiI8Kwd6j9AC&pg=PA15|year=2010|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42956-0|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Aaron Zelman]]'s non-fiction book ''The State Versus the People'' includes a comparison of ''Utopia'' with Plato's ''Republic''. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a [[police state]]. Zelman comments, \"More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By this Zelman implies that ''Utopia'' influenced [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], despite their brutal repression of religion.\n\nOther biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the [[Holy See]] over [[Christendom]].\n\nThe protagonist of [[Walker Percy]]'s novels, ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' and ''[[The Thanatos Syndrome]]'', is \"Dr Thomas More\", a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.\n\nMore is the focus of the [[Al Stewart]] song \"A Man For All Seasons\" from the 1978 album ''[[Time Passages]]'', and of the [[Far (band)|Far]] song \"Sir\", featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album ''[[Quick (album)|Quick]]''. In addition, the song \"[[So Says I]]\" by indie rock outfit [[The Shins]] alludes to the socialist interpretation of More's ''Utopia''.\n\n[[Jeremy Northam]] depicts More in the television series ''[[The Tudors]] ''as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch. He also shows More loathing Protestantism, burning both Martin Luther's books and English Protestants who have been convicted of heresy. The portrayal has unhistorical aspects, such as that More neither personally caused nor attended [[Simon Fish]]'s execution (since Fish actually died of [[bubonic plague]] in 1531 before he could stand trial), although More's ''The Supplycatyon of Soulys'', published in October 1529, addressed Fish's [[Simon Fish#Supplycatyon of Soulys: St. Thomas More's Response to Simon Fish|''Supplication for the Beggars'']].<ref name=FishOnline1>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/asupplicacyonfo01fishgoog|quote=simon fish.|title=A Supplicacyon for the Beggers|publisher=Early English Text Society|last1=Fish|first1=Simon|year=1871}}</ref><ref name=MoreVsFish1>see Fish, Simon. \"Supplycacion for the Beggar.\" 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B.

The series also neglected to show More's avowed insistence that Richard Rich's testimony about More disputing the King's title as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] was perjured.\n\nIn 2002, More was placed at number 37 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].<ref>Sue Parrill, William Baxter Robison (2013). \"The Tudors on Film and Television\", p. 92.

Rebuilt in the 1990s, the white stone building stands amid modern brick structures that attempt to recapture the style of More's former manor on the site. Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public. The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim. Apartment buildings and a park cover the former gardens and orchard; Roper's Garden is the park atop one of More's gardens, sunken as his was believed to be. No other remnants exist of the More estate.\n\n=== Chelsea Old Church ===\n[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14.JPG|thumb|Thomas More statue, Chelsea Old Church]]\nAcross a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by L. Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as \"saint\", \"scholar\", and \"statesman\"; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer & St. Thomas More honours the martyr.\n\n=== Tower Hill ===\nA plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill, London, just outside the Tower of London, as well as all those executed there, many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. More's corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula]], within the walls of the [[Tower of London]], as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.\n\n=== St Katharine Docks ===\nThomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of \"Knighten Guild\", derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringeastlondon.co.uk/eel/Stkatharines/Stkatharines.htm#More|title=St Katharine's Dock|publisher=Exploring East London|accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== St Dunstan's Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===\n[[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]], an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More's head, rescued by his daughter [[Margaret Roper]], whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church's sanctuary or main altar. [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]] has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schulte Herbr\u00fcggen|first=Hubertus|title=Das Haupt des Thomas Morus in der St. Dunstan-Kirche zu Canterbury|series=Forschungsberichte des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen|year=1982|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften}}</ref> Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life. A small plaque marks the former home of William and Margaret Roper; another house nearby and entitled Roper House is now a home for the deaf.\n\n== Works ==\nNote: The reference \"CW\" is to the relevant volume of the ''[[Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More]]'' (New Haven and London 1963\u20131997)\n\n=== Published during More's life (with dates of publication) ===\n* ''A Merry Jest'' (c. 1516) (CW 1)\n* ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) (CW 4)\n* ''Latin Poems'' (1518, 1520) (CW 3, Pt.2)\n* ''Letter to Brixius'' (1520) (CW 3, Pt. 2, App C)\n* ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' (The Answer to Luther, 1523) (CW 5)\n* ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'' (1529, 1530) (CW 6)\n* ''Supplication of Souls'' (1529) (CW 7)\n* ''Letter Against Frith'' (1532) (CW 7) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/1557Workes/Letter_Frith.pdf pdf]\n* ''The Confutation of Tyndale's Answer'' (1532, 1533) (CW 8) Books 1\u20134, [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Confutation5-9_2014-etext.pdf Books 5\u20139]\n* ''Apology'' (1533) (CW 9)\n* ''Debellation of Salem and Bizance'' (1533) (CW 10) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Debellation2014-etext.pdf pdf]\n* ''The Answer to a Poisoned Book'' (1533) (CW 11) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/AnswerPoisonedBook2014-etext.pdf pdf]\n\n=== Published after More's death (with likely dates of composition) ===\n* ''The History of King Richard III'' (c. 1513\u20131518) (CW 2 & 15)\n* ''The Four Last Things'' (c. 1522) (CW 1)\n* ''[[A Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation]]'' (1534) (CW 12)\n* ''Treatise Upon the Passion'' (1534) (CW 13)\n* ''Treatise on the Blessed Body'' (1535) (CW 13)\n* ''Instructions and Prayers'' (1535) (CW 13)\n* ''De Tristitia Christi'' (1535) (CW 14) (preserved in the [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]], Valencia)\n\n== Translations ==\n* ''Translations of Lucian'' (many dates 1506\u20131534) (CW 3, Pt.1)\n* ''The Life of [[Pico della Mirandola]]'', by Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola (c. 1510) (CW 1)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Saints|Biography}}\n* [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)]]\n* [[English Reformation]]\n* [[Moreana]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Biographies ==\n* {{cite book | last = Ackroyd | first = Peter|title= The Life of Thomas More| url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofthomasmore00ackr | url-access = registration |year= 1999 | authorlink = Peter Ackroyd}}\n* {{cite book | last = Basset | first = Bernard, SJ | title = Born for Friendship: The Spirit of Sir Thomas More|year=1965|location=London|publisher=Burns & Oates}}\n* {{cite book | last = Berglar| first = Peter|authorlink= Peter Berglar|title= Thomas More: A Lonely Voice against the Power of the State | publisher = Scepter Publishers | location = New York | year = 2009 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=5eAN_FrS2o4C| isbn = 978-1-59417-073-7}} (Note: this is a 2009 translation (from the original German, by [[Hector de Cavilla]]) of Berglar's 1978 work ''Die Stunde des Thomas Morus \u2013 Einer gegen die Macht''.

On 30 November 2006, the National Anthem Selection Task Team (NASTT) selected poet [[Byakul Maila]]'s song as the new national anthem of Nepal. The new national anthem was selected from a total of 1272 submissions made from across the country. It was officially approved on 20 April 2007.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200704/20/eng20070420_368365.html People's Daily Online - Nepali cabinet approves new national anthem<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\n\nOn August 3, 2007, Sayaun Thunga Phool Ka was officially declared as Nepal's national anthem by the House of Representatives.\n\n== Criticism ==\nIn the screening process, Byakul Maila was required to prove he was not a royalist and encountered difficulties when it was discovered that he had once edited a book of poetry that contained a contribution from [[Gyanendra of Nepal|the king]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Alex|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19063605|title=Olympics 2012: The secrets behind national anthems|date=1 August 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome of Nepal's Maoist rulers prefer a stronger, more revolutionary anthem akin to the communist ''[[The Internationale|L'Internationale]],'' and even took their own CDs into the final selection meeting hoping to overturn Byakul Maila and Amber Gurung's effort.<ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Republic_or_Death.html?id=GeasCAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Republic or Death!
