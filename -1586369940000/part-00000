{"title_page": "Labor rights", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=September 2017}}\n{{More footnotes|date=September 2017}}\n{{Labor|expanded=rights|sp=us}}\n{{Rights}}\n'''Labor rights''' or '''workers' rights''' are both [[legal rights|legal]] rights and [[human rights]] relating to [[labor relations]] between [[workers]] and [[employers]]. These rights are codified in national and international [[labor and employment law]]. In general, these rights influence working conditions in relations of employment. One of the most prominent is the right to [[freedom of association]], otherwise known as the [[right to organize]]. Workers organized in [[trade union|trade unions]] exercise the [[right to collective bargaining]] to improve working conditions.\n\n== Labor Background ==\n\nThroughout history, workers claiming some sort of right have attempted to pursue their interests. During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England]] expressed demand for better wages and working conditions.  One of the leaders of the revolt, [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] famously argued that people were born equal saying, \"When [[Adam]] delved and [[Eve]] span, who was then the gentleman?\" Laborers often appealed to traditional rights. For instance, English peasants fought against the [[enclosure movement]], which took traditionally communal lands and made them private.\n\n[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain|The British Parliament]] passed the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Acts|Factory Act 1833]] which stated that children under the age of 9 could not work, children aged 9-13 could only work 8 hours a day, and children aged 14-18 could only work for 12 hours a day.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hutchins |first1=B. L. |last2=Harrison |first2=A. |title=A History of Factory Legislation |year=1911 |publisher=P. S. King & Son |url=https://archive.org/details/historyoffactory014402mbp |ref=harv}}</ref> \n\nLabor rights are a relatively new addition to the modern corpus of human rights. The modern concept of labor rights dates to the 19th century after the creation of [[labor unions]] following the [[industrialization]] processes. [[Karl Marx]] stands out as one of the earliest and most prominent advocates for workers rights.  His philosophy and economic theory focused on labor issues and advocates his economic system of [[socialism]], a society which would be ruled by the workers. Many of the [[social movement]]s for the rights of the workers were associated with groups influenced by Marx such as the [[socialists]] and [[communists]].  More moderate [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]] supported worker's interests as well. More recent workers rights advocacy has focused on the particular role, exploitation, and needs of women workers, and of increasingly mobile global flows of casual, service, or guest workers.\n\nThe [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) was formed in 1919 as part of the [[League of Nations]] to protect worker's rights.

Worker advocacy groups have also sought to limit work hours, making a working week of 40 hours or less standard in many countries.  A [[35-hour workweek]] was established in [[France]] in 2000, although this standard has been considerably weakened since then. Workers may agree with employers to work for longer, but the extra hours are payable [[overtime]]. In the [[European Union]] the working week is limited to a maximum of 48 hours ''including'' overtime (see also [[Working Time Directive]]).\n\n=== Child Labor ===\nLabor rights advocates have also worked to combat [[child labor]]. They see child labor as exploitative, and often economically damaging. Child labor opponents often argue that working children are deprived of an education.  In 1948 and then again in 1989, the United Nations declared that children have a right to social protection.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prior|first=Katherine|title=Workers' Rights|date=1997|publisher=Franklin Watts|location=New York}}</ref> \n\n==== Child Labor in the United States ====\nIn the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) restricts the employment of children.

During the [[Progressive Era]], the [[United States]] began workplace reforms, which received publicity boosts from [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' and events such as the 1911 [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]].  Labor advocates and other groups often criticize production facilities with poor working conditions as [[sweatshops]] and [[occupational health]] hazards, and campaign for better labor practices and recognition of workers rights throughout the world.\n\n=== Safety and Social Sustainability ===\nRecent initiatives in the field of [[sustainability]] have included a focus on [[social sustainability]], which includes promoting workers' rights and safe working conditions, prevention of [[human trafficking]], and elimination of illegal child labor from the sustainably sourced products and services.<ref name=\"sftool.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/545/social-sustainability|title=Social Sustainability   - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref> Organizations such as the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] and [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] have released studies on products that have been identified as using child labor and industries using or funded by human trafficking.

For instance, migrants have faced a number of alleged abuses [[Human rights in the United Arab Emirates|in the United Arab Emirates]] ([[Dubai#Human Rights and Labor|including Dubai]]). [[Human Rights Watch]] lists several problems including \"nonpayment of wages, extended working hours without overtime compensation, unsafe working environments resulting in death and injury, squalid living conditions in labor camps, and withholding of passports and travel documents by employers. <ref name=\"hrw.org\">{{cite web |title=Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in United Arab Emirites (UAE) (Human Rights Watch, 31-12-2005) |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/uae12233.htm |accessdate=21 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114115316/http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/uae12233.htm |archivedate=18 November 2008}}</ref> Despite laws against the practice, employers confiscate migrant workers' passports.

In general, these rights influence working conditions in relations of employment. One of the most central is the right to [[freedom of association]], otherwise known as the [[right to organize]]. Workers organized in [[trade union|trade unions]] exercise the [[right to collective bargaining]] to improve working conditions.\n\n== Labor Background ==\n\nThroughout history, workers claiming some sort of right have attempted to pursue their interests. During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England]] expressed demand for better wages and working conditions.  One of the leaders of the revolt, [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] famously argued that people were born equal saying, \"When [[Adam]] delved and [[Eve]] span, who was then the gentleman?\" Laborers often appealed to traditional rights. For instance, English peasants fought against the [[enclosure movement]], which took traditionally communal lands and made them private.\n\nThe British Parliament passed the Factory Act 1833 which stated that children under the age of 9 could not work, children aged 9-13 could only work 8 hours a day, and children aged 14-18 could only work for 12 hours a day.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hutchins |first1=B.

King & Son |url=https://archive.org/details/historyoffactory014402mbp |ref=harv}}</ref> \n\nLabor rights are a relatively new addition to the modern corpus of human rights. The modern concept of labor rights dates to the 19th century after the creation of [[labor unions]] following the [[industrialization]] processes. [[Karl Marx]] stands out as one of the earliest and most prominent advocates for workers rights.  His philosophy and economic theory focused on labor issues and advocates his economic system of [[socialism]], a society which would be ruled by the workers. Many of the [[social movement]]s for the rights of the workers were associated with groups influenced by Marx such as the [[socialists]] and [[communists]].  More moderate [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]] supported worker's interests as well. More recent workers rights advocacy has focused on the particular role, exploitation, and needs of women workers, and of increasingly mobile global flows of casual, service, or guest workers.\n\nThe [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) was formed in 1919 as part of the [[League of Nations]] to protect worker's rights.  The ILO later became incorporated into the [[United Nations]].  The UN itself backed workers rights by incorporating several into two articles of the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], which is the basis of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (article 6-8).

[[Human Rights Watch]] lists several problems including \"nonpayment of wages, extended working hours without overtime compensation, unsafe working environments resulting in death and injury, squalid living conditions in labor camps, and withholding of passports and travel documents by employers. <ref name=\"hrw.org\">{{cite web |title=Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in United Arab Emirites (UAE) (Human Rights Watch, 31-12-2005) |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/uae12233.htm |accessdate=21 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114115316/http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/uae12233.htm |archivedate=18 November 2008}}</ref> Despite laws against the practice, employers confiscate migrant workers' passports.  Without their passports, workers cannot switch jobs or return home.[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=16862]\nThese workers have little recourse for labor abuses, but conditions have been improving.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/UAE.pdf United Arab Emirates<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Labor and social welfare minister Ali bin Abdullah al-Kaabi has undertaken a number of reforms to help improve labor practices in his country.<ref name=\"hrw.org\" />\n\n=== Undocumented Workers ===\nThe right to equal treatment, regardless of [[gender]], [[ethnicity|origin]] and appearance, [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], is also seen by many as a worker's right. [[Discrimination]] in the work place is illegal in many countries, but some see the [[Income inequality metrics|wage gap]] between genders and other groups as a persistent problem.\n\n==== Undocumented Workers in the United States ====\nThe National Labor Relations Act recognizes undocumented laborers as employees. However, the supreme court case [[Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB|Hoffman Plastic Compounds Inc. Vs. NLRB]] established that backpay could not be awarded to unlawfully fired undocumented employees due to the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Labor Law - Undocumented Immigrants - Second Circuit Holds Undocumented Workers Are Categorically Barred from Backpay under the National Labor Relations Act - Palma v. NLRB 723 F.3d 176 (2d Cir. 2013)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Recent Cases 1236}}</ref> In this court decision, it was also stated that the U.S. would support [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|FLSA]] and [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act of 1983|MSPA]], without regard to whether or not someone is documented.<ref name=\":5\">Gleeson, Shannon Marie. ''The Intersection of Legal Status and Stratification: The Paradox of Immigration Law and Labor Protections in the United States''. Diss. U of California, Berkeley, 2008. N.p.: ProQuest Dissertations, 2008. Print.</ref> Undocumented workers also still have legal protection against discrimination based on national origin. The decision of the Hoffman supreme court case primarily has affected undocumented laborers by preventing them from getting backpay and/or reinstatement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWhile no undocumented individual is technically able to work in the United States legally, undocumented folks make up 5% of the workforce.<ref name=\":5\" /> In the U.S., people who were born outside of the country tend to work in riskier jobs and have a higher chance of encountering death on the job. The low wage sectors, which many undocumented folks work in, have the highest rates of wage and hour violation.<ref name=\":5\" /> Estimates claim that 31% of undocumented people work in service jobs. Restaurant work in particular has a 12% rate of undocumented workers.\n\nUndocumented people can and have joined labor unions, and are even credited by a 2008 dissertation for \"reinvigorating\" the labor movement.<ref name=\":5\" /> Because the NLRA protects undocumented workers, it protects their right to organize. However the NLRA excludes workers that are agricultural, domestic, independent contractors, governmental, or related to their employers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nilc.org/issues/immigration-reform-and-executive-actions/powerir/|title=POWER Act & Immigration Reform - National Immigration Law Center|work=National Immigration Law Center|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}</ref> The right to speak up against labor abuses was protected further by an immigration reform bill in 2013 with the POWER act, which intended to protect employees who spoke out against labor practices from facing detention or deportation.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehandthatfeedsfilm.com/how-can-undocumented-immigrants-legally-form-a-union/|title=How can undocumented immigrants legally form a union?|date=2014-10-16|work=The Hand That Feeds|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nHowever, labor unions are not necessarily welcoming of immigrant workers. Within unions, there have been internal struggles, such as when Los Angeles immigrant janitors reorganized service workers. Being a part of the union does not necessarily address all the needs of immigrant workers, and thus winning power within the union is the first step for immigrant workers to address their needs.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Bacon|first=David|date=2007|title=Rising from Below: Immigrant Workers Open New Organizing Fronts|url=|journal=Race, Poverty & the Environment|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21\u201327|jstor=41555130}}</ref>\n\nImmigrant workers often mobilize beyond unions, by campaigning in their communities on intersectional issues of immigration, discrimination, and police misconduct.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Organized labor}}\n* ''[[Journal of Individual Employment Rights]]''\n* [[Economic, social and cultural rights]]\n* [[Decent work]]\n* [[Industrial democracy]]\n* [[Labor and employment law]]\n* [[Occupational health]]\n* [[Union Organizer]]\n* [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]]\n* [[Workers' council]]\n* [[Worker cooperative]]\n* [[Workplace democracy]]\n* [[Strike action]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n* [[Social clause]]\n* [[Right to work]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Labour Day]]\n* [[Labor rights in American meatpacking industry]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cleanclothes.org/ Clean Clothes Campaign]\n* [http://www.amrc.org.hk/ Asia Monitor Resource Center]\n* [http://www.laborrights.org/  International Labor Rights Forum]\n* [http://www.sweatfree.org/  SweatFree Communities]\n* [https://www.hrw.org/labor/ Human Rights Watch]\n* [http://www.ilo.org/ International Labor Organization]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160323111100/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/issues/worker-rights/ Workers' rights page at the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor]\n* [http://www.escr-net.org International Network for Economic, Social & Cultural Rights]\n* [https://www.ituc-csi.org/ituc-global-rights-index-2018 ITUC Global Rights Index 2018]\n\n{{World topic|Labor rights in|title=Labor rights|noredlinks=yes}}\n{{Substantive human rights}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Labor rights| ]]<!--eponymous category first-->\n[[Category:Labour law]]\n", "name_user": "Hwilson9", "label": "safe", "comment": "added links and clarified sentences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_rights"}

She was noted for her performances in films including ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972) and ''[[Kora Kagaz]]'' (1974), among others. She appeared alongside her husband Amitabh Bachchan in films such as ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' (1973), ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975), ''[[Mili (1975 film)|Mili]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975).\n\nFollowing her marriage to actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and the birth of their children, Bachchan restricted her work in films. After her appearance in the ''[[Silsila (1981 film)|Silsila]]'' (1981), she took an indefinite sabbatical from films. She returned to acting with [[Govind Nihalani]]'s ''[[Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa]]'' in 1998. Since then, she has appeared in several critically and commercially successful films such as ''[[Fiza]]'' (2000), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) and ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]'' (2003), all which garnered her critical acclaim, as well as several awards and nominations.\n\n==Career==\nJaya Bachchan, an [[Alumnus|alumna]] of the [[Film and Television Institute of India]], started her career with a supporting role in [[Satyajit Ray]]'s Bengali film, [[Mahanagar]] (1963) at the age of 15, with [[Anil Chatterjee]] and [[Madhabi Mukherjee]]. After that, she had appeared in two Bengali films: a 13-minute short film, ''Suman'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hugedomains.com/domain_profile.cfm?d=rudraa&e=com|title=HugeDomains.com - RudRaa.com is for sale (Rud Raa)|website=www.hugedomains.com|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref> and a Bengali comedy [[Dhanyee Meye]] (1971), as [[Uttam Kumar]]'s sister-in-law.<ref name=da>[[#Da|Dawar, p. 56]]</ref>\n\nInspired by her experience with Ray, she decided to join the [[Film and Television Institute of India]] (FTII), [[Pune]] to learn acting and passed with the gold medal.<ref>[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 526]]</ref> She was also picked out to play the eponymous role of ''Guddi'' in the 1971 [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] film, [[Guddi (1971 film)|Guddi]] in which she played a school girl obsessed with film star [[Dharmendra]].<ref name=ba>[[#Ba|Banerjee, p. 93]]</ref> Guddi was a success,<ref name=da/> and she moved to Bombay and soon picked other roles, however her role of a 14-year-old schoolgirl, aided by her petite looks, created the [[Girl next door|girl-next-door]] image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. Though she tried to break out of the mould with glamorous roles as in ''[[Jawani Diwani]]'', (1972)<ref name=\"Gulzar, p. 457\"/> and a negative character of the heroine faking amnesia, in ''[[Anamika (1973 film)|Anamika]]'' (1973), she was mostly recognised for roles of the sort which were credited with epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of \"middle-cinema\" directors such as [[Gulzar]], [[Basu Chatterjee]] and indeed [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]].<ref>[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 91]]</ref> These films include ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Piya Ka Ghar]]'' (1972), ''[[Parichay (film)|Parichay]]'' (1972), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972)  and ''[[Bawarchi]]'' (1972), performed with marked sensitivity.<ref name=\"ba\" /><ref>[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 396]]</ref> By now, she was a popular star.<ref name=\"da\" />\n\nIn Gulzar's ''[[Koshish]]'' (1973), Bhaduri and [[Sanjeev Kumar]] played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as handicapped people.
