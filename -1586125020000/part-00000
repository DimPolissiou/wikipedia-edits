Earlier in the summer of 1493, the Ottomans undertook a raid through Croatia into [[Carniola]] and [[Styria]]. Around the same time, clashes had been raging in Croatia between the [[House of Frankopan]] and the Croatian ban, but news of the Ottoman incursion forced them to make peace. The Croatian nobles assembled a large army and intercepted the Ottoman forces that were returning to the Sanjak of Bosnia. Poor tactics, and the choice of an open battle with the more experienced [[Ottoman cavalry]], resulted in the total defeat of the Croatian army.\n\nThere were no immediate territorial gains for the Ottoman Empire, but in the following decades the Ottomans gradually expanded into southern Croatia.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the fall of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] into Ottoman hands in 1463, the Ottomans quickly expanded westward, threatening the southern and central parts of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102\u20131526)|Kingdom of Croatia]].<ref name=Mikaberidze>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: [https://books.google.hr/books?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia (2 volumes: A Historical Encyclopedia)], 2011, p. 491</ref> Since then, Ottoman raids were becoming more frequent. These raids were being carried out by the [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]], irregular light cavalry of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They would ride into Christian territory and plunder the countryside during spring and summer, avoiding the fortified border towns and direct military conflict. These continuous raids forced the local population to abandon their land, leaving the frontier castles without supplies.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|pp=30\u201331}} One such raid began in September 1491, with the Ottoman cavalry crossing the [[Kupa River]] and reaching [[Carniola]]. On their way back, the Ottomans were intercepted by the army of Croatian Ban Ladislav of Egerv\u00e1r and Count [[Bernardin Frankopan]] near [[Udbina]], and were defeated in the [[Battle of Vrpile]]. The defeat at Vrpile forced the Ottomans to stop their attacks during 1492. After [[Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha]] became the sanjak-bey of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], the Ottomans renewed their raids.{{sfn|Ma\u017euran|1998|p=38}}\n\n==Preparations==\nIn the summer of 1493, Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha raised an army of 8,000 light cavalry (''ak\u0131nc\u0131'') and attacked [[Jajce]], but failed to capture its [[Jajce Fortress|fortress]]. From there he turned northwest and entered Carniola and Styria, plundering the countryside.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1988|p=228}} The same year, a war broke out between the newly appointed [[Ban of Croatia]], [[Emerik Deren\u010din]] ({{lang-hu|Imre Derencs\u00e9nyi}}), and the [[Frankopans]], allied with Karlo Kurjakovi\u0107, for control over [[Senj]] and several other towns. By mid-July 1493, counts Bernardin Frankopan and Ivan VIII (An\u017e) Frankopan, had the upper hand in the war and were besieging Senj. The siege was lifted after an army led by Ban Deren\u010din was sent to help Senj, and the Frankopan army retreated to Sokolac. In the meantime, the Frankopans were accused of cooperating with the Ottomans, although their estates were also being ravaged. News of the incoming Ottoman army forced them to make peace.<ref name=Sisic>Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107: Povijest Hrvata; pregled povijesti hrvatskog naroda 600 \u2013 1918, Zagreb, p. 245</ref>\n\nOn their way back, the Ottomans sacked [[Modru\u0161]], in northern [[Lika]], then owned by the Frankopan noble family. The Frankopans and Ban Deren\u010din wanted to intercept the Ottomans, and gathered an army of around 3,000 cavalry and 8,000 infantry from all parts of Croatia, however a part of the army consisted of peasants from the surrounding areas of Krbava.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1988|p=231}}{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|p=99}} At Deren\u010din's initiative Croatian commanders decided to face the Ottoman army in an open battle at [[Krbava]] field (near today's Udbina), in central Croatia, although [[Ivan Frankopan Cetinski]] unsuccesfuly argued that an ambush in the canyons and ravines would be a better option.{{sfn|Ma\u017euran|1998|p=38}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Innsbruck 1 339.jpg|thumb|right|Cenotaph of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]], depicting the Battle of Krbava Field]]\n[[File:Battle of Krbava plan.png|thumb|right|Plan of the battle and troop disposition]]\nThe Ottomans entered the Krbava field through the lowest and narrowest local mountain pass of Gorica, unlike two years earlier through the Vrpile pass where they suffered a huge defeat.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|p=54}} Before the battle, Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha ordered the execution of Christian captives near Jel\u0161ani (present-day [[Jo\u0161an]]) so that they could not help the Croatians in the midst of battle. After a meeting with the commanders, he sent a part of his army, around 3,000 cavalrymen, to set up an ambush in the forest near the Krbava field.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=65\u201367}}\n\nAlthough the plan was to fight the Ottomans on the open plains, the Croatian army was initially deployed on the slopes of the eastern part of the Krbava field, near the village of Visu\u0107. The army was set up to face the enemy frontally, and divided into three groups. The first one was composed of soldiers from [[Slavonia]], commanded by Franjo Berislavi\u0107, the second section was under the command of Ivan Frankopan Cetinski, while the third was commanded by Nikola VI Frankopan and Bernardin Frankopan. Croatian infantry and cavalry were equally distributed among the three sections. The main commander of the army was Ban Emerik Deren\u010din.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=65\u201367}} The Ottoman army was also arranged in three groups.{{sfn|Ma\u017euran|1998|p=38}} The first one was commanded by Ismail Bey, sanjak-bey of the [[Sanjak of Kru\u0161evac]], the second one by Mehmed Bey of the [[Sanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcp]] (Skopje), while the middle group was under the command of Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|p=122}} [[Ishak Bey Kralo\u011flu]] (Sigismund of Bosnia), son of the King of Bosnia, [[Stephen Thomas of Bosnia|Stephen Thomas]] (died 1461), also took part in the battle on the Ottoman side.<ref>Ljubez, Bruno (2009), Jajce Grad: prilog povijesti posljednje bosanske prijestolnice, HKD Napredak, p. 149</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman plan was to draw the Croatian forces further west next to the woods where they had set up an ambush. Ismail's right wing made the first move, heading towards the Croatian left flank. The Croatian army left the slopes and rushed at the Ottomans, starting a battle in the open field. The battle was fought closely with swords, with no use of bows.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=65\u201367}}{{sfn|Kekez|2009|p=83}} The Ottoman forces were at first pushed back, and started a [[Feint|feint retreat]], which lured Croatian army into pursuit that led them into an ambush. \n\nThe 3,000 Ottoman cavalrymen located in the wooded area of the Krbava field crossed the Krbava River and attacked the Croatian rear. Then the main Ottoman forces of Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha, also waiting hidden in the forests, commenced a frontal attack. Thus, the Croatian army was attacked from the front, right, and the rear.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|p=70}} The Croatian left flank of Bernardin Frankopan could not withstand the attacks of the Turkish light cavalry and began retreating. However, most of the Croatian infantry was surrounded and could not retreat. The Croatian army suffered a total defeat and only a small number of men managed to reach safety in the nearby fortified town of Udbina.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=71\u201373}}\n\nThe battle started around 09:00 and ended in the afternoon hours. Ban Deren\u010din was captured in battle and later executed, while his brother, and his son Pavao, were killed in battle. Nikola VI Frankopan [[Tr\u017eac (Cazin)|Tr\u017ea\u010dki]] was also captured, but was ransomed and released from captivity. Among the killed Croatian nobles were Ivan Frankopan Cetinski, Petar II Zrinski, Juraj Vlatkovi\u0107 and ban of Jajce Mihajlo Pethkey. Count Bernardin Frankopan and Franjo Berislavi\u0107 managed to survive the battle.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=71\u201373}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Zapis popa Martinca.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the oldest records of the battle, written by [[priest Martinac]] in [[Glagolitic]] script on 27 September 1493]]\nAlthough the Croatian nobility suffered a heavy defeat, described by ancient historians and chroniclers as the \"first dissolution of the Croatian Kingdom\",<ref>Ivan Toma\u0161i\u0107: ''Chronicon breve Regni Croatiae''</ref> the Ottoman Empire had no territorial gains as a result of the victory at Krbava field.{{sfn|Pavli\u010devi\u0107|1997|p=23}}<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1997|pp=22\u201324}}, cited in {{harvnb|Kekez|2009|p=66}}</ref> Since the losses were heavy, in local tradition the Krbava field became known as the \"Field of Blood\" ({{lang-hr|Krvavo polje}}).{{sfn|Ma\u017euran|1998|p=39}} Peace between the kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was signed in April 1495.

Earlier in the summer of 1493, the Ottomans undertook a raid through Croatia into [[Carniola]] and [[Styria]]. Around the same time, clashes had been raging in Croatia between the [[House of Frankopan]] and the Croatian ban, but news of the Ottoman incursion forced them to make peace. The Croatian nobles assembled a large army and intercepted the Ottoman forces that were returning to the Sanjak of Bosnia. Poor tactics, and the choice of an open battle with the more experienced [[Ottoman cavalry]], resulted in the total defeat of the Croatian army.\n\nThere were no immediate territorial gains for the Ottoman Empire, but in the following decades the Ottomans gradually expanded into southern Croatia.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the fall of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] into Ottoman hands in 1463, the Ottomans quickly expanded westward, threatening the southern and central parts of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102\u20131526)|Kingdom of Croatia]].<ref name=Mikaberidze>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: [https://books.google.hr/books?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia (2 volumes: A Historical Encyclopedia)], 2011, p. 491</ref> Since then, Ottoman raids were becoming more frequent. These raids were being carried out by the [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]], irregular light cavalry of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They would ride into Christian territory and plunder the countryside during spring and summer, avoiding the fortified border towns and direct military conflict. These continuous raids forced the local population to abandon their land, leaving the frontier castles without supplies.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|pp=30\u201331}} One such raid began in September 1491, with the Ottoman cavalry crossing the [[Kupa River]] and reaching [[Carniola]]. On their way back, the Ottomans were intercepted by the army of Croatian Ban Ladislav of Egerv\u00e1r and Count [[Bernardin Frankopan]] near [[Udbina]], and were defeated in the [[Battle of Vrpile]]. The defeat at Vrpile forced the Ottomans to stop their attacks during 1492. After [[Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha]] became the sanjak-bey of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], the Ottomans renewed their raids.{{sfn|Ma\u017euran|1998|p=38}}\n\n==Preparations==\nIn the summer of 1493, Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha raised an army of 8,000 light cavalry (''ak\u0131nc\u0131'') and attacked [[Jajce]], but failed to capture its [[Jajce Fortress|fortress]]. From there he turned northwest and entered Carniola and Styria, plundering the countryside.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1988|p=228}} The same year, a war broke out between the newly appointed [[Ban of Croatia]], [[Emerik Deren\u010din]] ({{lang-hu|Imre Derencs\u00e9nyi}}), and the [[Frankopans]], allied with Karlo Kurjakovi\u0107, for control over [[Senj]] and several other towns. By mid-July 1493, counts Bernardin Frankopan and Ivan VIII (An\u017e) Frankopan, had the upper hand in the war and were besieging Senj. The siege was lifted after an army led by Ban Deren\u010din was sent to help Senj, and the Frankopan army retreated to Sokolac. In the meantime, the Frankopans were accused of cooperating with the Ottomans, although their estates were also being ravaged. News of the incoming Ottoman army forced them to make peace.<ref name=Sisic>Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107: Povijest Hrvata; pregled povijesti hrvatskog naroda 600 \u2013 1918, Zagreb, p. 245</ref>\n\nOn their way back, the Ottomans sacked [[Modru\u0161]], in northern [[Lika]], then owned by the Frankopan noble family. The Frankopans and Ban Deren\u010din wanted to intercept the Ottomans, and gathered an army of around 3,000 cavalry and 8,000 infantry from all parts of Croatia, however a part of the army consisted of peasants from the surrounding areas of Krbava.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1988|p=231}}{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|p=99}} At Deren\u010din's initiative Croatian commanders decided to face the Ottoman army in an open battle at [[Krbava]] field (near today's Udbina), in central Croatia, although [[Ivan Frankopan Cetinski]] unsuccesfuly argued that an ambush in the canyons and ravines to be a better option.{{sfn|Ma\u017euran|1998|p=38}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Innsbruck 1 339.jpg|thumb|right|Cenotaph of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]], depicting the Battle of Krbava Field]]\n[[File:Battle of Krbava plan.png|thumb|right|Plan of the battle and troop disposition]]\nThe Ottomans entered the Krbava field through the lowest and narrowest local mountain pass of Gorica, unlike two years earlier through the Vrpile pass where they suffered a huge defeat.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|p=54}} Before the battle, Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha ordered the execution of Christian captives near Jel\u0161ani (present-day [[Jo\u0161an]]) so that they could not help the Croatians in the midst of battle. After a meeting with the commanders, he sent a part of his army, around 3,000 cavalrymen, to set up an ambush in the forest near the Krbava field.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=65\u201367}}\n\nAlthough the plan was to fight the Ottomans on the open plains, the Croatian army was initially deployed on the slopes of the eastern part of the Krbava field, near the village of Visu\u0107. The army was set up to face the enemy frontally, and divided into three groups. The first one was composed of soldiers from [[Slavonia]], commanded by Franjo Berislavi\u0107, the second section was under the command of Ivan Frankopan Cetinski, while the third was commanded by Nikola VI Frankopan and Bernardin Frankopan. Croatian infantry and cavalry were equally distributed among the three sections. The main commander of the army was Ban Emerik Deren\u010din.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=65\u201367}} The Ottoman army was also arranged in three groups.{{sfn|Ma\u017euran|1998|p=38}} The first one was commanded by Ismail Bey, sanjak-bey of the [[Sanjak of Kru\u0161evac]], the second one by Mehmed Bey of the [[Sanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcp]] (Skopje), while the middle group was under the command of Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|p=122}} [[Ishak Bey Kralo\u011flu]] (Sigismund of Bosnia), son of the King of Bosnia, [[Stephen Thomas of Bosnia|Stephen Thomas]] (died 1461), also took part in the battle on the Ottoman side.<ref>Ljubez, Bruno (2009), Jajce Grad: prilog povijesti posljednje bosanske prijestolnice, HKD Napredak, p. 149</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman plan was to draw the Croatian forces further west next to the woods where they had set up an ambush. Ismail's right wing made the first move, heading towards the Croatian left flank. The Croatian army left the slopes and rushed at the Ottomans, starting a battle in the open field. The battle was fought closely with swords, with no use of bows.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=65\u201367}}{{sfn|Kekez|2009|p=83}} The Ottoman forces were at first pushed back, and started a [[Feint|feint retreat]], which lured Croatian army into pursuit that led them into an ambush. \n\nThe 3,000 Ottoman cavalrymen located in the wooded area of the Krbava field crossed the Krbava River and attacked the Croatian rear. Then the main Ottoman forces of Had\u0131m Yakup Pasha, also waiting hidden in the forests, commenced a frontal attack. Thus, the Croatian army was attacked from the front, right, and the rear.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|p=70}} The Croatian left flank of Bernardin Frankopan could not withstand the attacks of the Turkish light cavalry and began retreating. However, most of the Croatian infantry was surrounded and could not retreat. The Croatian army suffered a total defeat and only a small number of men managed to reach safety in the nearby fortified town of Udbina.{{sfn|Mijatovi\u0107|2005|pp=71\u201373}}\n\nThe battle started around 09:00 and ended in the afternoon hours. Ban Deren\u010din was captured in battle and later executed, while his brother, and his son Pavao, were killed in battle. Nikola VI Frankopan [[Tr\u017eac (Cazin)|Tr\u017ea\u010dki]] was also captured, but was ransomed and released from captivity. Among the killed Croatian nobles were Ivan Frankopan Cetinski, Petar II Zrinski, Juraj Vlatkovi\u0107 and ban of Jajce Mihajlo Pethkey.

This year, [[British people|British]] rapper Fahd has slowly risen in the ranks of artists in his age group. Early 2020, his controversial song \"Left on read\" \u2014 which was inspired by [[Dave (rapper)|Dave's]] 100ms \u2014 maintained frontage from the [[Manchester|Mancunian]] youth. \n\n<br />\n==Early Life==\nFahd was born King-Fahd Abiola Hameed, on 26 July 2006 in the [[Ibadan]] capital of [[Oyo State|Oyo state]], the second-born of three children born to [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] parents. He was raised in the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|borough of Greenwich]] (Thamesmead), where he began [[performing arts]] at an early age of 8, meanwhile writing songs in his spare time. Fahd eventually focused on music & acting from he's a long-existing list of talents such as dancing, singing, sprinting and basketball. Before engaging in music, his primary school appointed him to weekly trumpet lessons. After a prolonged trip to [[Liverpool]], Fahd's family relocated to the county of [[Greater Manchester]] in a town called [[Wythenshawe]].\n\nKing-Fahd attended St Mary's, a catholic [[Independent school|private school]] in Ibn, and, later, Linton Mead Primary School in [[Thamesmead]]. Following the move to [[Manchester]], he transferred from The Halley Academy ([[The Halley Academy|Corelli College)]] to [[Manchester Enterprise Academy]], where he studies sports, musical theatre and business, while also representing his school in all school plays and few basketball & football games.\n\n==Music Career==\nFahd made his debut appearance on an [[Instagram]] freestyle called 'Run the streets down'. After reaching a respectable point of his old channel, Fahd made a new brand channel focusing on all his musical content. Fahd was expected to release a debut [[freestyle]] throughout 2019 \u2018Original Ends (0EnDs)\u2019 as he explained but instead released 2 [[Single (music)|singles]] on he\u2019s YouTube channel. A Christmas special \u2018Wishlist\u2019 and own version of SJ\u2019s \u2018Youngest In Charge\u2019 which both did well in terms of views but in terms of positive feedback, not so well. Shortly the singles were unavailable, deleted. His rebranded himself, changing his professional name from FahdHilfiger to Fahd. Fahd's debut single 'Left on read' blew up around his local area back in [[Wythenshawe]], where he gained attention for the [[Manchester|Mancunian]] youths, talent pages and young stars. 'Left on read' was a very controversial single, some saying it was good for a debut single, some claiming it's too repetitive and annoyingly catchy. The \u2018Left On Read\u2019 meme cooled down mid-February, currently looking to release a debut [[Extended play|EP]] before August 2020.\n\nEarly April Fahd's classmate and peer in [[drill music]] Dxxgz aimed at a rapper in he's [[KSI (entertainer)|Ksi]] #poppinchallenge verse saying, 'You can't rap', 'You man are a couple of p***ks' and 'You chat on snap'. Fahd took it to offence and sensed that it was directed at him, so he followed grime tradition and [[Diss (music)|sent]] for Dxxgz with an Instagram & Snapchat freestyle called 'my response'.\n\nJanuary 2020, Fahd premiered the official audio to his and HJ's (Harrison Johnson) single \"Livin' It\" on [[YouTube]], produced Hudson beats.

The regiment served as [[mounted infantry]] from March 17, 1863, to November 1, 1864, notably as part of the [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]] during the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma]] and [[Chickamauga campaign|Chickamauga]] Campaigns.\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry was organized at [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]] and mustered in for a three-year enlistment at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on August 16, 1862, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Abram O. Miller.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiment received a new brigade commander, Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]. After frustrating chases on foot after mounted rebel cavalry raiders, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The 72nd voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles. Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 72nd chose [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], as their weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade,\" the 72nd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\nAfter intense training and development of new tactics, the \"Lightning Brigade\" was ready for service. The mounted infantry proof of concept for the Army of the Cumberland occurred in their first mounted infantry action at the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref><ref>http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade</ref> Despite torrential rains, the 72nd and its brigade gained the gap so quickly that they surprised and scattered surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J.

The 72nd drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit. The massive superiority of firepower the 17th and its brethren had with the Spencers allowed them to entrench and hold the southern entrance against numerous assaults by numerically superior rebel infantry and artillery through the rainy day until the sodden remainder of the XIV Corps slogged to join them at their position.\n\nWith the Lightning Brigade, the 72nd found itself detached from the XIV Corps to serve as a mobile reserve for all three of the Corps within the Cumberland. After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps.

The regiment served as [[mounted infantry]] from March 17, 1863, to November 1, 1864, notably as part of the [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]] during the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma]] and [[Chickamauga campaign|Chickamauga]] Campaigns.\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry was organized at [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]] and mustered in for a three-year enlistment at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on August 16, 1862, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Abram O. Miller.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiment received a new brigade commander, Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]. After frustrating chases on foot after mounted rebel cavalry raiders, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The 72nd voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles. Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 72nd chose [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], as their weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade,\" the 72nd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\nAfter intense training and development of new tactics, the \"Lightning Brigade\" was ready for service. The mounted infantry proof of concept for the Army of the Cumberland occurred in their first mounted infantry action at the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref><ref>http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade</ref> Despite torrential rains, the 72nd and its brigade gained the gap so quickly that they surprised and scattered surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J.

The 72nd drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit. The massive superiority of firepower the 17th and its brethren had with the Spencers allowed them to entrench and hold the southern entrance against numerous assaults by numerically superior rebel infantry and artillery through the rainy day until the sodden remainder of the XIV Corps slogged to join them at their position.\n\nWith the Lightning Brigade, the 72nd found itself detached from the XIV Corps to serve as a mobile reserve for all three of the Corps within the Cumberland. After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps. The 72nd and the [[123rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|123rd Illinois]] were assigned to 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Service History==\n\nIts assignments were as follows:\n* 40th Brigade, 12th Division, [[Army of the Ohio]], to November 1862. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, Center, [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], [[Army of the Cumberland]], to January 1863. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, XIV Corps, to June 1863. \n* 1st Brigade, 4th Division, XIV Corps, to October 1863.* \n* Wilder's Mounted Infantry Brigade, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to December 1863. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to January 1864. \n* 3rd Brigade, Grierson's Cavalry Division, [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], [[Army of the Tennessee]], to March 1864. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to October 1864. \n* 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Wilson's Cavalry Corps, Military Division Mississippi, to June 1865.\n\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry mustered out of service at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], on June 26, 1865.\n\nThe 72nd served at the following locations:\n* Left Indiana for [[Lebanon, KY]], August 17. \n* Duty at [[Lebanon Junction, KY]], September 6\u201322, 1862. \n* Moved to [[Louisville, KY]] September 22\n* To [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]] and [[West Point, Kentucky|West Point]], KY September 30-October 5. \n* Pursuit of [[Braxton Bragg|Bragg]] and operations against [[John Hunt Morgan|Morgan]] October 6\u201320\n* March to [[Bowling Green, KY]], October 26-November 3\n* To Scottsboro, TN November 10. \n* To [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin, TN]] November 26\n* To [[Castalian Springs, Tennessee|Castalian Springs, TN]] November 28. \n* To [[Bledsoe Creek State Park|Bledsoe Creek]] December 14. \n* Operations against Morgan (December 22, 1862-January 2, 1863). \n* Moved to [[Cave City, Kentucky|Cave City, KY]], then to [[Murfreesboro, TN]], January 2\u20138, and duty there until June during which it converted to mounted infantry. \n** Scout to [[Woodbury, Tennessee|Woodbury, TN]] March 3\u20138. \n** Regiment mounted March 17. \n** Expedition to [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage, TN]], [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon, TN]], and [[Liberty, Kentucky|Liberty, KY]] April 1\u20138. \n** Expedition to [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville, TN]] April 20\u201330.
