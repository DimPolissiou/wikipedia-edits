It is the largest and the first port area of Portugal and the main city [[industry|industrial]] [[port]] [[logistics]] in Portugal and the birthplace of fifteenth-century explorer [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nIt is the seat of a municipality with 203.30&nbsp;km \u00b2 of area and 18,598 inhabitants (2015 INE), divided into two parishes. The municipality is bordered to the north and east by the municipality of [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]], south and west by [[Odemira]] has coastline on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The coastline of the city, south of S\u00e3o Torpes, is one part of the natural parks of [[Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Sines03.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient centre of Sines: the castle was initiated as protection from pirates in 1362]]\nVestiges of a few settlements have today been discovered in [[archeology|archaeological sites]], such as Palmeirinha and Quit\u00e9ria, that attest to the age of human settlements in Sines.<ref>Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares, 1981</ref>  Arnaldo Soledade (1981) noted that these [[Visigoths]], identified as ''Cinetos'', may have been the original civilization that gave rise to the community, suggesting the local [[toponymy]] may have derived from this; ''Cinetos'', to Cines and, finally, Sines.<ref>Arnaldo Soledade, 1981</ref>  Although this tribes lineage is not clearly defined, Soledade goes on to refer to the construction of a [[Castro culture|castro]] where the current Castle stands.\n\nThe [[Punics]] are thought to have also had a presence in the area; a Punic artifact, the Tesouro do Gaio was unearthed in 1966, and is on display in the ''Museu de Sines'' ({{lang-en|Sines Museum}}). Discovered in May 1966, the 'treasure' was unearthed by a local farmer, Francisco da Silva Campos, who was tilling his land to plant corn, and discovered a [[schist]] tomb with women's jewellery in his plot of land in Herdade do Gaio (12.5&nbsp;km southeast of Sines, 7&nbsp;km from the coast and 275m from Ribeira de Morgavel).\n\nBetween 1966 and 1967, investigator Jos\u00e9 Miguel da Costa discovered several of these Punic graves, but all showing evidence of early tomb raiding. While the jewellery was determined to be Punic in origin, the symbolism on the artefacts were characterized as [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian]].<ref>Some earrings show the figure of [[Hathor]] and a [[signet ring|signet]] of [[marble]], [[amulet]], is engraved in relief with a [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] associated with [[Thutmose III]], with the eye of [[Horus]], the Son God.</ref> On the island of [[Pessegueiro Island|Pessegueiro]], there is also evidence of Ibero-Punic artefacts discovered under the Roman port, discovered by archeologists Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares (1981).<ref>Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares, 1993</ref> Roman occupation brought the destruction of many of these artefacts associated with the [[Iron Age]].\n\nThe Romans used Sines as a port and industrial centre; the bay of Sines was used as port by the [[civitas]] of [[Mir\u00f3briga]] and the canal on the island of [[Pessegueiro Island|Pessegueiro]] is linked to [[Ourique Municipality|Arandis]] (Garv\u00e3o). During [[Roman Empire|Rome]]'s occupation, Sines and the island of Pessegueiro, were poles within an industrialized fishing industry which included salting fish. The Roman centres were thought to have been at Pra\u00e7a T\u00f3mas Ribeiro, as well as the area around Monte Chaos in Feteira Cima (although little explored archaeologically). In the fields of Quit\u00e9ria, Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares (1981) investigated the remains of a 1st-century ''villa'', where the remnants of cobblestone streets and a [[hypocaust]] were discovered.\n\nIn 1961, Jos\u00e9 Miguel da Costa, during excavations around the Castle of Sines, discovered Roman \"fishing factories\", and a [[ceramics]] [[kiln]] to produce [[amphora]]e for salted fish, both dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries. Sine's [[toponymy]] is also Roman in origin, but may refer to two terms (both applicable): the term ''sinus'', which means ''bay''; or an alternate meaning for ''curve'', and may refer to the curvature of the Sines Cape, as seen from Monte Ch\u00e3os.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n[[File:Sines05.jpg|thumb|left|Battlements along the south wall of the Castle of Sines]]\n[[File:Forte Revelim.JPG|thumb|left|The Revelim Fort, the 17th Century fort used for the protection from pirates]]\n[[File:Sines houses.JPG|thumb|left|The old quarter of Sines, showing an example of the older architecture]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the area of Sines was occupied by the [[Visigoths]] and later sacked by [[Moors]]. There are many more examples of Visigoth-era carved stones (7th century) throughout Sines.<ref>Fernando Almeida, 1970</ref> Evidence from an archaeological excavation of the Sines castle discovered that many of the walls of the old building were constructed from the rocks used in the construction of Roman-era monuments, such as a portion of a pedestal of a statue of [[Mars (god)|Mars]] (which was assumed to have been part of a larger square in the Roman town before the construction of the basilica).<ref>Jos\u00e9 d\u00b4Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o, 2009</ref> The basilica itself likely existed on the site of the current Matriz Church, whose baptistery is of Visigothic origin. The [[Moors]] likely sacked the settlement in the 7th century; this marked a period of decline in the area, indicating a period when the ancient settlement was abandoned. Yet, although the few inhabitants lived in the zone, Moorish ships regularly patrolled the waters, until the 13th century, when [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] conquered the region.\n\nThe area regained much of its importance at the beginning of the 8th century, when fishermen returned to the waters around Sines. Re-settlement along the coast was initiated by the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago da Espada]], who administered the lands under the reign of Afonso III. Sines obtained administrative autonomy from [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]] on 24 November 1362, when [[Peter I of Portugal|Pedro I]] elevated Sines to the status of villa. He later preoccupied himself with the coastal defense of the region, establishing the conditions for the construction of Sine's Castle, already protected by elements of the Visigothic wall. The castle in Sines was constructed during the first half of the 15th century. Like [[Set\u00fabal]], but contrary to what happened in [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]] or [[Palmela]], the castle was constructed to defend the wealth of the local merchants, indicating a new economic and social order, with the ascension of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares, 1998, p.21-44</ref>\n\n==Monarchy==\n\nDuring the ''Portuguese [[Interregnum]]'' and [[1383\u20131385 Crisis]], the bourgeoisie and nobles of Sines were one of the municipalities that supported the Master of the [[Order of Aviz]], the later King [[John I of Portugal]] in his battle for the throne. In 1395, aggravated by the fact the castle was not completed, King John appropriated men to serve in the military campaigns along the frontier. But, much of the concern during this period was from attacks by pirates, and compulsory military service was seen as bulwark against the region's collapse. In 1511, Sines was attacked by a large band of pirates. The King, who was careful to indemnity the losses, established a small base of three ships in Sines and [[Sesimbra]] to combat these French privateers. By the end of the 16th century, as threats from the coast increased, so too were the fortifications along the coast. This included the establishment of a fort alongside the Chapel of Senhora das Salas (Fort of Revelim), and two forts on the island of Pessegueiro. In 1629, as the construction of the Revelim Fort proceeded, [[Turkey|Turkish]] pirates attacked and sank a [[Carrack|nau]] in the port of Sines. A [[Sesimbra|Sesimbrense]] captain, though, was successful in capturing a pirate ship in the bay by 1648.\n\nAt the end of the 16th century, commanded by [[Filippo Terzi]], in the service of Philip II of Portugal, it was thought that the construction of a new port on Pessegueiro would motivate growth. Problems during construction, and frequent raids by English privateers, caused the project to be abandoned: the remnants on Pessegueiro include great blocks of rock that were quarried to make way for the project. In the last decade of the 18th century, the natural anchorage seduced Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira, a merchant, to found [[Porto Covo]], with the hope that his initiative would convince others to establish complementary businesses and a grand port.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, [[pyrite]] from Pias and Moinho dos Paneiros (Sines) and [[ore]] from Cercal are transported from the small island. The ore arrived in carts pulled by bulls, transported over a large bridge, and by boats to larger ships on the island. Near the mouth of the ravine on Pessegueiro there still remain abandoned deposits of accumulated ore, that were never transported.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 19th century, the populous of Sines lived in fear during the French occupation of the country. In one incident, a company of troops from Napoleon's army pillaged the town and defaced the royal coat-of-arms over the doors to the castle.\n\nUnder the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Liberalist Constitution]], the municipality began to govern its own affairs, as the Order of Santiago, along with other religious orders were expelled from Portugal in 1855, and most of their assets appropriated. Sines became a parish of [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]], losing autonomy, yet flourished economically as several new businesses began operating from the town. The establishment of cork and canning industries, small factories producing distillates and artisan goods (bakeries and cobblers), turned the village more attractive to emigrants. The town attracted many English and Catalan businesses, as well as Alentejan and Algarvan entrepreneurs in search of work.\n\nEntrepreneurial growth and republican idealism helped to redevelop the area, as the construction of new roads, the arrival of a rail-line, access to schools and culture became cumulative. The new elites, not only built their wealth on land rental, but also industry and commerce, and showed renewed interest in restoring the municipality. These [[liberal elite]]s, such as Jo\u00e3o Daniel de Sines, fought for the constitutional monarchy during the Liberal Wars, and were magnanimous when former-King [[Miguel of Portugal]] stopped-over in their region on his way to exile.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a young [[Algarve|Algarvian]] medic would write the first monograph on Sines, '''''Breve Not\u00edcia de Sines''''' ({{lang-en|A Brief Notice on Sines}}). Francisco Lu\u00eds Lopes' work was an acidic critique of municipal affairs and living conditions that were both sincere and damning, but also flattering and praise-worthy, noting both the villa's problems and its openness and tolerance.<ref>Francisco Lu\u00eds Lopes, 1850</ref>\n\n==Republic==\n\nThe year 1914 marked a period of renewed interest and the restoration of the municipality. The cork industry, the fishery, some agriculture and tourism marked a period of economic activity that lasted until the end of the 1960s, when, apart from its proximity to the sea, Sines was indistinguishable from other communities in the Alentejo. Sines was the ''beach'' for many of the local residents of the Alentejo, visited by the rural families of Beja and Santiago do Cac\u00e9m.\n\nUntil the early 1970s, Sines was a sheltered fishing village with a long commercial history of relations with cities in the [[Mediterranean]]; its large marina, along a breakwater, is the only marina between [[Set\u00fabal]] and the [[Algarve]], while the deep-sea port, commercial fishery and industrial depot have driven the economy of this area. In 1970, the government of [[Marcello Caetano]] initiated the grand industrial-port complex that would, along with the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 Revolution]], energize the local economy. Consequently, the population exploded, while industry and commerce diversified, causing their own impacts. In the late 1970s, the arrival of immigrants and refugees from the Portuguese overseas provinces brought new social dynamics, which were later supplemented by foreign workers employed in the port and [[petrochemical industry]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Praia Grande (6875627667).jpg|thumb|left|The lower coast of the coastal plain that stretches from Sines to [[Set\u00fabal]]]]\n[[File:Porto Covo January 2008-6.jpg|thumb|left|The landscape in the eastern plain, near Porto Covo]]\nThe municipalities territory is distinguished by three morphological structures: a coastal plain, the residual relief of the Sines Massif, and the eastern escarpment. \n* The '''coastal plan''' (which occupies the major part of the municipality) slopes gradually from the interior and occupies an area of 3-12 kilometres cut by several water courses.\n* Little remains of the '''Sines Massif''', but from Monte Ch\u00e3os to the Cape, there are elements of its morphology still present: the Sines promontory is relatively elevated from the sea, and limited by an abrupt escarpment, which slopes to the south until the Ribeira da Junqueira., where beaches and dunes predominate. But after the beach of Burrinho, it continues to be rugged until the vicinity of the island Pessegueiro, where beaches are also evident, while sheltered coves and mini-beaches, such as Porto Covinho, are inter-cut along the coastline. From the north of the city the coast is low sandy beach that extends to Tr\u00f3ia. From this coast, extensive dunes, particularly north of the mouth of Ribeira dos Moinhos dominate the landforms.\n* The '''eastern escarpment''', which is limited by the coastal plain forms part of the Serra do Cercal Massif (which rises 100\u2013200 meters in altitude).\nThe coast, which is physically rugged (the Sines Cape) is separated into two differentiated areas: a sandy northern section, and a rocky southern area of cliffs.\n\n===Human geography===\n{{Historical populations|align=right\n|title = Population of the <br>Municipality of Sines<br><small>(1801 - 2011)<ref name=\"INE\">{{citation|url=http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_publicacoes&PUBLICACOESpub_boui=122114780&PUBLICACOESmodo=2|title=Censos 2011 - Resultadas Preliminares|trans-title=2011 Census - Preliminary Results|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica|location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese|accessdate=1 July 2011|year=2010|editor=INE|editor-link=Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica}}</ref></small>\n| 1801 | 1766\n| 1849 | 2632\n| 1930 | 7666\n| 1960 | 8866\n| 1981 | 12075\n| 1991 | 12347\n| 2001 | 13577\n| 2004 | 13613\n| 2011 | 14238\n}}\nSines is limited on its southern frontier by [[Odemira Municipality]], north and northeast by [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m Municipality]], while the southern part of the municipality (south of S\u00e3o Torpes) is part of the '''Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina''' ({{lang-en|St. Vincent and Southwest Alentejo Coast Natural Park}}). A small part of the north also belongs to the '''Reserva Natural da Lagoa de Santo Andr\u00e9 e da Sancha''' ({{lang-en|Natural Reserves of Lake Saint Andre and Sancha}}). Sines is 150 kilometers south of [[Lisbon]].\n\nSines Municipality was constituted, until 1485, from the parishes of Sines, Colos and the area that today corresponds to the parish of Vila Nova do Milfontes. In 1485, King [[John II of Portugal|D. John II]], with the objective of settling the area of coastal Alentejo, created the municipality of Vila Nova de Milfontes, and included the area of Cercal. Colos also became a municipality in 1499, restricting Sines to its present area.\n\nIn 1855, along with other municipalities, Sines ceased to exist and became integrated into [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]] as the parish of S\u00e3o Salvador. Although it lost its autonomy, the settlements flourished for a time; Sines regained its autonomy in 1914.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 2 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 115|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2014|author=Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica|language=Portuguese|author-link=Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica }}</ref>\n* [[Porto Covo]] - the tourist-centered parish, along the southern frontier of Sines, settled by Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira, to motivate settlement at the end of the 18th century, has grown to include 1400 annual inhabitants;\n* Sines - the main parish and town within the municipality, with a population of 15000. Not self-governing.\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Sines municipality depends on [[energy]], [[oil refining]], port activity, [[Fishing in Portugal|fishing]], tourism and trade. The municipality has an important investment park managed by AICEP Global Parques, and a science park, the [[Sines Tecnopolo]].\n\nSines is the location of one of the largest maritime-industrial complexes in Portugal, whose tenants include Sines Power Plant (Electricidade de Portugal), Petrogal Sines (National Petrochemic Refinery) and Repsol (Polymer Refinery). Although rapidly industrializing, the town still preserves many of the historical landmarks and tries to cater to tourism. The nearby village of [[Porto Covo]] attracts many tourists owing to its coastline and the well-preserved historical buildings.\n\nThere is a large shortwave broadcasting station at Sines. The most remarkable antenna towers are the rotatable towers looking like a big \"V\". [http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0014203] [http://www.dxradio-ffm.de/22.03.2003_dw_sines2.jpg]. It was used by [[Deutsche Welle]] and was switched off on November 1, 2011.\n\nRailways serve the cargo traffic and petroleum industry, but there is no more passenger train service; the city's station has been converted into a restaurant.\n\n===== Sines Port appointed as 'critical point' for the success of the 'Silk Road' =====\n\nThe Schiller Institute updated its 2014 study on the impact of the Chinese 'New Silk Road' project and considers that the Alentejo port of Sines is a fundamental link for the success of this global initiative. The port is considered by the world's leading experts in the sector as a key link in the global trade liaison project launched in 2013 by the current president of the [[People's Republic of China]], in particular for its special and privileged geostrategic position of connecting the continents of Africa and North and South America.\n\nThe latest version of the study 'The New Silk Road becomes the world's terrestrial bridge: a shared future for mankind', which updates a first version of 2014 by the Schiller Institute (Germany) considers that the port of Sines is one of the two \"critical points\" for the development of this project, due to its more Atlantic vocation, alongside the Spanish port of [[Algeciras]], which is more Mediterranean. \"Not only Spain, but also Portugal, have eagerly welcomed Xi's proposal and, over the last year, have been actively working on specific proposals and projects to make this a reality,\" said the Schiller Institute study. However, this situation may have changed in recent weeks, with advantage to Portugal, since Spanish policymakers have not hidden a certain opposition to the growth of Chinese investment in the neighboring country, unlike Portugal, which is to strengthen political, diplomatic and economic relations with the People's Republic of China, as was seen during the past week, with Xi Jinping's official visit to Portugal.\n\nDuring that time, the theme of the port of Sines was certainly at the table of talks at the highest level, as it is well known that several Chinese groups are interested in securing the concession of a new container terminal in Sines, supposedly named Vasco da Gama, and whose public tender is slow to proceed. \"The Iberian Peninsula is in fact the natural geographical interface of the economic belt of the 'Silk Road', which now stretches from the Pacific to the Atlantic through the land mass of Eurasia, with the 'Silk Sea Route' to the Iberian-American, Caribbean and United States, as well as south towards Africa,\" says the study of the institute led by Helga and Lindon La Rouche. During the official visit of the president of China this week, [[Xi Jinping]] has repeatedly mentioned the interest of the world's second largest economy in investing in and creating business partnerships with Portuguese companies and other entities in the field of port infrastructure and the economy of the sea, among other sectors of activity. Aware of this lively interest of the People's Republic of China in our assets in port infrastructure and the continental shelf, one of the largest in the world, the Minister of the Sea, Ana Paula Vitorino led, about a year ago, an official visit to the Middle Kingdom, with one of the largest business rewards ever - 126 companies.\n\nThe results of these contacts and talks could soon be known, knowing that China's interest is not limited to the new container terminal in Sines. The Alentejo port, due to its geographical location and natural conditions that allow the large vessels to dock - which continue to grow in size from year to year - has other advantages, including energy, logistics, and other branches of activity. The port of Sines is the largest national port in a busy cargo, with a share of more than 50% of the total Portuguese port sector of the continent. According to data released by the AMT - Mobility and Transport Authority - in the first nine months of this year, the port of Sines handled a total of 36.3 million tonnes of goods. Despite a 6% drop compared to the same period last year, the Alentejo port was responsible for a 51.4% share of the national port sector from January to September, excluding the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and Madeira.\n\nIn the containerized cargo segment, the predominance of the port of Sines is even more evident. Despite a slight fall of 0.1% in the period under review with respect to the number of TEUs (the standard measure equivalent to 20-foot-long containers) moved, the Alentejo port handled a total of nine of 16.5 million tons in this cargo segment, 11% more than in the same period of last year. Thus, the port of Sines accounted for 58.2% of the containerized cargo handled in mainland Portugal during the first three quarters, having been in the top 100 of the world's largest container ports for several years.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason section added Dec 27, 2018 without any references}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Igreja Matriz de Sines.jpg|thumb|The front fa\u00e7ade of the Matriz Church of Sines]]\n[[File:Porto Covo May 2009-9a.jpg|thumb|The simple fa\u00e7ade of the Church of Porto Covo]]\n\n===Civic===\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* A Primorosa ({{lang-pt|Loja A Primorosa}})\n* Arts Centre of Sines ({{lang-pt|Centro de Artes de Sines}})\n* Cinema/Theatre Vasco da Gama ({{lang-pt|Cine-Teatro Vasco da Gama}})\n* Customs Delegation of Sines ({{lang-pt|Delega\u00e7\u00e3o Aduaneira de Sines}})\n* Emm\u00e9rico Nunes Cultural Centre ({{lang-pt|Hospital da Miseric\u00f3rdia/Hospital do Esp\u00edrito Santo/Centro Cultural Emm\u00e9rico Nunes}})\n* Fountain of D.

Discovered in May 1966, the 'treasure' was unearthed by a local farmer, Francisco da Silva Campos, who was tilling his land to plant corn, and discovered a [[schist]] tomb with women's jewellery in his plot of land in Herdade do Gaio (12.5&nbsp;km southeast of Sines, 7&nbsp;km from the coast and 275m from Ribeira de Morgavel). \n\nBetween 1966 and 1967, investigator Jos\u00e9 Miguel da Costa discovered several of these Punic graves, but all showing evidence of early tomb raiding. While the jewellery was determined to be Punic in origin, the symbolism on the artefacts were characterized as [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian]].<ref>Some earrings show the figure of [[Hathor]] and a [[signet ring|signet]] of [[marble]], [[amulet]], is engraved in relief with a [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] associated with [[Thutmose III]], with the eye of [[Horus]], the Son God.</ref> On the island of [[Pessegueiro Island|Pessegueiro]], there is also evidence of Ibero-Punic artefacts discovered under the Roman port, discovered by archeologists Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares (1981).<ref>Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares, 1993</ref> Roman occupation brought the destruction of many of these artefacts associated with the [[Iron Age]].\n\nThe Romans used Sines as a port and industrial centre; the bay of Sines was used as port by the [[civitas]] of [[Mir\u00f3briga]] and the canal on the island of [[Pessegueiro Island|Pessegueiro]] is linked to [[Ourique Municipality|Arandis]] (Garv\u00e3o). During [[Roman Empire|Rome]]'s occupation, Sines and the island of Pessegueiro, were poles within an industrialized fishing industry which included salting fish. The Roman centres were thought to have been at Pra\u00e7a T\u00f3mas Ribeiro, as well as the area around Monte Chaos in Feteira Cima (although little explored archaeologically). In the fields of Quit\u00e9ria, Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares (1981) investigated the remains of a 1st-century ''villa'', where the remnants of cobblestone streets and a [[hypocaust]] were discovered. \n\nIn 1961, Jos\u00e9 Miguel da Costa, during excavations around the Castle of Sines, discovered Roman \"fishing factories\", and a [[ceramics]] [[kiln]] to produce [[amphora]]e for salted fish, both dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries. Sine's [[toponymy]] is also Roman in origin, but may refer to two terms (both applicable): the term ''sinus'', which means ''bay''; or an alternate meaning for ''curve'', and may refer to the curvature of the Sines Cape, as seen from Monte Ch\u00e3os.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n[[File:Sines05.jpg|thumb|left|Battlements along the south wall of the Castle of Sines]]\n[[File:Forte Revelim.JPG|thumb|left|The Revelim Fort, the 17th Century fort used for the protection from pirates]]\n[[File:Sines houses.JPG|thumb|left|The old quarter of Sines, showing an example of the older architecture]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the area of Sines was occupied by the [[Visigoths]] and later sacked by [[Moors]]. There are many more examples of Visigoth-era carved stones (7th century) throughout Sines.<ref>Fernando Almeida, 1970</ref> Evidence from an archaeological excavation of the Sines castle discovered that many of the walls of the old building were constructed from the rocks used in the construction of Roman-era monuments, such as a portion of a pedestal of a statue of [[Mars (god)|Mars]] (which was assumed to have been part of a larger square in the Roman town before the construction of the basilica).<ref>Jos\u00e9 d\u00b4Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o, 2009</ref> The basilica itself likely existed on the site of the current Matriz Church, whose baptistery is of Visigothic origin. The [[Moors]] likely sacked the settlement in the 7th century; this marked a period of decline in the area, indicating a period when the ancient settlement was abandoned. Yet, although the few inhabitants lived in the zone, Moorish ships regularly patrolled the waters, until the 13th century, when [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] conquered the region.\n\nThe area regained much of its importance at the beginning of the 8th century, when fishermen returned to the waters around Sines. Re-settlement along the coast was initiated by the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago da Espada]], who administered the lands under the reign of Afonso III. Sines obtained administrative autonomy from [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]] on 24 November 1362, when [[Peter I of Portugal|Pedro I]] elevated Sines to the status of villa. He later preoccupied himself with the coastal defense of the region, establishing the conditions for the construction of Sine's Castle, already protected by elements of the Visigothic wall. The castle in Sines was constructed during the first half of the 15th century. Like [[Set\u00fabal]], but contrary to what happened in [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]] or [[Palmela]], the castle was constructed to defend the wealth of the local merchants, indicating a new economic and social order, with the ascension of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares, 1998, p.21-44</ref>\n\n==Monarchy==\n\nDuring the ''Portuguese [[Interregnum]]'' and [[1383\u20131385 Crisis]], the bourgeoisie and nobles of Sines were one of the municipalities that supported the Master of the [[Order of Aviz]], the later King [[John I of Portugal]] in his battle for the throne. In 1395, aggravated by the fact the castle was not completed, King John appropriated men to serve in the military campaigns along the frontier. But, much of the concern during this period was from attacks by pirates, and compulsory military service was seen as bulwark against the region's collapse. In 1511, Sines was attacked by a large band of pirates. The King, who was careful to indemnity the losses, established a small base of three ships in Sines and [[Sesimbra]] to combat these French privateers. By the end of the 16th century, as threats from the coast increased, so too were the fortifications along the coast. This included the establishment of a fort alongside the Chapel of Senhora das Salas (Fort of Revelim), and two forts on the island of Pessegueiro. In 1629, as the construction of the Revelim Fort proceeded, [[Turkey|Turkish]] pirates attacked and sank a [[Carrack|nau]] in the port of Sines. A [[Sesimbra|Sesimbrense]] captain, though, was successful in capturing a pirate ship in the bay by 1648.\n\nAt the end of the 16th century, commanded by [[Filippo Terzi]], in the service of Philip II of Portugal, it was thought that the construction of a new port on Pessegueiro would motivate growth. Problems during construction, and frequent raids by English privateers, caused the project to be abandoned: the remnants on Pessegueiro include great blocks of rock that were quarried to make way for the project. In the last decade of the 18th century, the natural anchorage seduced Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira, a merchant, to found [[Porto Covo]], with the hope that his initiative would convince others to establish complementary businesses and a grand port.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, [[pyrite]] from Pias and Moinho dos Paneiros (Sines) and [[ore]] from Cercal are transported from the small island. The ore arrived in carts pulled by bulls, transported over a large bridge, and by boats to larger ships on the island. Near the mouth of the ravine on Pessegueiro there still remain abandoned deposits of accumulated ore, that were never transported.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 19th century, the populous of Sines lived in fear during the French occupation of the country. In one incident, a company of troops from Napoleon's army pillaged the town and defaced the royal coat-of-arms over the doors to the castle.\n\nUnder the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Liberalist Constitution]], the municipality began to govern its own affairs, as the Order of Santiago, along with other religious orders were expelled from Portugal in 1855, and most of their assets appropriated. Sines became a parish of [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]], losing autonomy, yet flourished economically as several new businesses began operating from the town. The establishment of cork and canning industries, small factories producing distillates and artisan goods (bakeries and cobblers), turned the village more attractive to emigrants. The town attracted many English and Catalan businesses, as well as Alentejan and Algarvan entrepreneurs in search of work.\n\nEntrepreneurial growth and republican idealism helped to redevelop the area, as the construction of new roads, the arrival of a rail-line, access to schools and culture became cumulative. The new elites, not only built their wealth on land rental, but also industry and commerce, and showed renewed interest in restoring the municipality. These [[liberal elite]]s, such as Jo\u00e3o Daniel de Sines, fought for the constitutional monarchy during the Liberal Wars, and were magnanimous when former-King [[Miguel of Portugal]] stopped-over in their region on his way to exile.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a young [[Algarve|Algarvian]] medic would write the first monograph on Sines, '''''Breve Not\u00edcia de Sines''''' ({{lang-en|A Brief Notice on Sines}}). Francisco Lu\u00eds Lopes' work was an acidic critique of municipal affairs and living conditions that were both sincere and damning, but also flattering and praise-worthy, noting both the villa's problems and its openness and tolerance.<ref>Francisco Lu\u00eds Lopes, 1850</ref>\n\n==Republic==\n\nThe year 1914 marked a period of renewed interest and the restoration of the municipality. The cork industry, the fishery, some agriculture and tourism marked a period of economic activity that lasted until the end of the 1960s, when, apart from its proximity to the sea, Sines was indistinguishable from other communities in the Alentejo. Sines was the ''beach'' for many of the local residents of the Alentejo, visited by the rural families of Beja and Santiago do Cac\u00e9m.\n\nUntil the early 1970s, Sines was a sheltered fishing village with a long commercial history of relations with cities in the [[Mediterranean]]; its large marina, along a breakwater, is the only marina between [[Set\u00fabal]] and the [[Algarve]], while the deep-sea port, commercial fishery and industrial depot have driven the economy of this area. In 1970, the government of [[Marcello Caetano]] initiated the grand industrial-port complex that would, along with the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 Revolution]], energize the local economy. Consequently, the population exploded, while industry and commerce diversified, causing their own impacts. In the late 1970s, the arrival of immigrants and refugees from the Portuguese overseas provinces brought new social dynamics, which were later supplemented by foreign workers employed in the port and [[petrochemical industry]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Praia Grande (6875627667).jpg|thumb|left|The lower coast of the coastal plain that stretches from Sines to [[Set\u00fabal]]]]\n[[File:Porto Covo January 2008-6.jpg|thumb|left|The landscape in the eastern plain, near Porto Covo]]\nThe municipalities territory is distinguished by three morphological structures: a coastal plain, the residual relief of the Sines Massif, and the eastern escarpment. \n* The '''coastal plan''' (which occupies the major part of the municipality) slopes gradually from the interior and occupies an area of 3-12 kilometres cut by several water courses.\n* Little remains of the '''Sines Massif''', but from Monte Ch\u00e3os to the Cape, there are elements of its morphology still present: the Sines promontory is relatively elevated from the sea, and limited by an abrupt escarpment, which slopes to the south until the Ribeira da Junqueira., where beaches and dunes predominate. But after the beach of Burrinho, it continues to be rugged until the vicinity of the island Pessegueiro, where beaches are also evident, while sheltered coves and mini-beaches, such as Porto Covinho, are inter-cut along the coastline. From the north of the city the coast is low sandy beach that extends to Tr\u00f3ia. From this coast, extensive dunes, particularly north of the mouth of Ribeira dos Moinhos dominate the landforms.\n* The '''eastern escarpment''', which is limited by the coastal plain forms part of the Serra do Cercal Massif (which rises 100\u2013200 meters in altitude).\nThe coast, which is physically rugged (the Sines Cape) is separated into two differentiated areas: a sandy northern section, and a rocky southern area of cliffs.\n\n===Human geography===\n{{Historical populations|align=right\n|title = Population of the <br>Municipality of Sines<br><small>(1801 - 2011)<ref name=\"INE\">{{citation|url=http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_publicacoes&PUBLICACOESpub_boui=122114780&PUBLICACOESmodo=2|title=Censos 2011 - Resultadas Preliminares|trans-title=2011 Census - Preliminary Results|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica|location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese|accessdate=1 July 2011|year=2010|editor=INE|editor-link=Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica}}</ref></small>\n| 1801 | 1766\n| 1849 | 2632\n| 1930 | 7666\n| 1960 | 8866\n| 1981 | 12075\n| 1991 | 12347\n| 2001 | 13577\n| 2004 | 13613\n| 2011 | 14238\n}}\nSines is limited on its southern frontier by [[Odemira Municipality]], north and northeast by [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m Municipality]], while the southern part of the municipality (south of S\u00e3o Torpes) is part of the '''Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina''' ({{lang-en|St. Vincent and Southwest Alentejo Coast Natural Park}}). A small part of the north also belongs to the '''Reserva Natural da Lagoa de Santo Andr\u00e9 e da Sancha''' ({{lang-en|Natural Reserves of Lake Saint Andre and Sancha}}). Sines is 150 kilometers south of [[Lisbon]].\n\nSines Municipality was constituted, until 1485, from the parishes of Sines, Colos and the area that today corresponds to the parish of Vila Nova do Milfontes. In 1485, King [[John II of Portugal|D. John II]], with the objective of settling the area of coastal Alentejo, created the municipality of Vila Nova de Milfontes, and included the area of Cercal. Colos also became a municipality in 1499, restricting Sines to its present area.\n\nIn 1855, along with other municipalities, Sines ceased to exist and became integrated into [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]] as the parish of S\u00e3o Salvador. Although it lost its autonomy, the settlements flourished for a time; Sines regained its autonomy in 1914.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 2 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 115|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2014|author=Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica|language=Portuguese|author-link=Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica }}</ref>\n* [[Porto Covo]] - the tourist-centered parish, along the southern frontier of Sines, settled by Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira, to motivate settlement at the end of the 18th century, has grown to include 1400 annual inhabitants;\n* Sines - the main parish and town within the municipality, with a population of 15000. Not self-governing.\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Sines municipality depends on [[energy]], [[oil refining]], port activity, [[Fishing in Portugal|fishing]], tourism and trade. The municipality has an important investment park managed by AICEP Global Parques, and a science park, the [[Sines Tecnopolo]].\n\nSines is the location of one of the largest maritime-industrial complexes in Portugal, whose tenants include Sines Power Plant (Electricidade de Portugal), Petrogal Sines (National Petrochemic Refinery) and Repsol (Polymer Refinery). Although rapidly industrializing, the town still preserves many of the historical landmarks and tries to cater to tourism. The nearby village of [[Porto Covo]] attracts many tourists owing to its coastline and the well-preserved historical buildings.\n\nThere is a large shortwave broadcasting station at Sines. The most remarkable antenna towers are the rotatable towers looking like a big \"V\". [http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0014203] [http://www.dxradio-ffm.de/22.03.2003_dw_sines2.jpg]. It was used by [[Deutsche Welle]] and was switched off on November 1, 2011.\n\nRailways serve the cargo traffic and petroleum industry, but there is no more passenger train service; the city's station has been converted into a restaurant.\n\n===== Sines Port appointed as 'critical point' for the success of the 'Silk Road' =====\n\nThe Schiller Institute updated its 2014 study on the impact of the Chinese 'New Silk Road' project and considers that the Alentejo port of Sines is a fundamental link for the success of this global initiative. The port is considered by the world's leading experts in the sector as a key link in the global trade liaison project launched in 2013 by the current president of the [[People's Republic of China]], in particular for its special and privileged geostrategic position of connecting the continents of Africa and North and South America. \n\nThe latest version of the study 'The New Silk Road becomes the world's terrestrial bridge: a shared future for mankind', which updates a first version of 2014 by the Schiller Institute (Germany) considers that the port of Sines is one of the two \"critical points\" for the development of this project, due to its more Atlantic vocation, alongside the Spanish port of [[Algeciras]], which is more Mediterranean. \"Not only Spain, but also Portugal, have eagerly welcomed Xi's proposal and, over the last year, have been actively working on specific proposals and projects to make this a reality,\" said the Schiller Institute study. However, this situation may have changed in recent weeks, with advantage to Portugal, since Spanish policymakers have not hidden a certain opposition to the growth of Chinese investment in the neighboring country, unlike Portugal, which is to strengthen political, diplomatic and economic relations with the People's Republic of China, as was seen during the past week, with Xi Jinping's official visit to Portugal. \n\nDuring that time, the theme of the port of Sines was certainly at the table of talks at the highest level, as it is well known that several Chinese groups are interested in securing the concession of a new container terminal in Sines, supposedly named Vasco da Gama, and whose public tender is slow to proceed. \"The Iberian Peninsula is in fact the natural geographical interface of the economic belt of the 'Silk Road', which now stretches from the Pacific to the Atlantic through the land mass of Eurasia, with the 'Silk Sea Route' to the Iberian-American, Caribbean and United States, as well as south towards Africa,\" says the study of the institute led by Helga and Lindon La Rouche. During the official visit of the president of China this week, [[Xi Jinping]] has repeatedly mentioned the interest of the world's second largest economy in investing in and creating business partnerships with Portuguese companies and other entities in the field of port infrastructure and the economy of the sea, among other sectors of activity. Aware of this lively interest of the People's Republic of China in our assets in port infrastructure and the continental shelf, one of the largest in the world, the Minister of the Sea, Ana Paula Vitorino led, about a year ago, an official visit to the Middle Kingdom, with one of the largest business rewards ever - 126 companies. \n\nThe results of these contacts and talks could soon be known, knowing that China's interest is not limited to the new container terminal in Sines. The Alentejo port, due to its geographical location and natural conditions that allow the large vessels to dock - which continue to grow in size from year to year - has other advantages, including energy, logistics, and other branches of activity. The port of Sines is the largest national port in a busy cargo, with a share of more than 50% of the total Portuguese port sector of the continent. According to data released by the AMT - Mobility and Transport Authority - in the first nine months of this year, the port of Sines handled a total of 36.3 million tonnes of goods. Despite a 6% drop compared to the same period last year, the Alentejo port was responsible for a 51.4% share of the national port sector from January to September, excluding the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and Madeira. \n\nIn the containerized cargo segment, the predominance of the port of Sines is even more evident. Despite a slight fall of 0.1% in the period under review with respect to the number of TEUs (the standard measure equivalent to 20-foot-long containers) moved, the Alentejo port handled a total of nine of 16.5 million tons in this cargo segment, 11% more than in the same period of last year. Thus, the port of Sines accounted for 58.2% of the containerized cargo handled in mainland Portugal during the first three quarters, having been in the top 100 of the world's largest container ports for several years.{{cn|date=March 2020|reason section added Dec 27, 2018 without any references}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Igreja Matriz de Sines.jpg|thumb|The front fa\u00e7ade of the Matriz Church of Sines]]\n[[File:Porto Covo May 2009-9a.jpg|thumb|The simple fa\u00e7ade of the Church of Porto Covo]]\n\n===Civic===\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* A Primorosa ({{lang-pt|Loja A Primorosa}})\n* Arts Centre of Sines ({{lang-pt|Centro de Artes de Sines}})\n* Cinema/Theatre Vasco da Gama ({{lang-pt|Cine-Teatro Vasco da Gama}})\n* Customs Delegation of Sines ({{lang-pt|Delega\u00e7\u00e3o Aduaneira de Sines}})\n* Emm\u00e9rico Nunes Cultural Centre ({{lang-pt|Hospital da Miseric\u00f3rdia/Hospital do Esp\u00edrito Santo/Centro Cultural Emm\u00e9rico Nunes}})\n* Fountain of D.

The river Arade, which was navigable in historical times, linked the hinterland to the open ocean and allowed the   transport of produce and commerce. The town of Silves (''Cilpes'') was possibly founded during the times of [[Hispania|Roman domination]], when  the region was part of the [[Lusitania]] province.  It was probably a Lusitanian Castro in pre-Roman times;<ref>http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=1288</ref> however the region was also settled by other Indo-European tribes, such as the [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]] (or Conii). Silves was also part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].\n\nAfter 713, when [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|the Moors invaded Iberia]], Silves became part of the Umayyad [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]] under the Arabic name of ''Shilb'' (\u0634\u0644\u0628). In the 10th century it was one of the most important towns in western [[Al-Andalus]]. Silves became an [[Taifa of Silves|independent taifa]] in 1027 under the rule of Ibn Mozaine and his son, who was dethroned in 1051 by al-Mu'tadid, the governor of [[Seville]]. [[al-Mu'tamid]] ibn 'Abbad, the son of al-Mu'tadid and a famous poet, ruled the taifa of Silves until 1091. After the [[Almoravid]] conquest the town became [[Almohad]] in 1156.\n\nIn 1189, King [[Sancho I of Portugal]] conquered (in the [[Reconquista]]) the town with the aid of Northern European crusaders.<ref>Charles Wendell David, ed. ''Narratio de Itinere Navali Peregrinorum Hierosolymam Tendentium et Silviam Capientium, A.D. 1189''. In ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 81 (Dec., 1939): 591-676.</ref> Sancho ordered the fortification of the city and built a castle, which is today an important monument of Portuguese heritage. At the time he also styled himself \"By the Grace of God, King of Portugal and Silves (''Dei Grati\u00e6, Rex Portugalli\u00e6 et Silbis''). \nHowever, he soon lost the town again to the Almohads. Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from [[Al-Andalus]] to ravage the Iberian Christian kingdoms, bringing back booty and slaves. The governor of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] attacked Silves in 1191, and took 3,000 Christian slaves.<ref>[http://libro.uca.edu/rc/rc1.htm Ransoming Captives in Crusader Spain: The Order of Merced on the Christian-Islamic Frontier]</ref> Again under Muslim rule, the city would then prosper to the point of being called ''the [[Baghdad]] of the West''.\n\nThe town was finally taken from the last Muslim king Ibn Afan by [[Paio Peres Correia]], Grand-Master of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]] in 1242, after the [[Alentejo]] and most of the coast had already fallen in 1238. The great [[mosque]] was changed into [[Silves Cathedral]] (''S\u00e9 Catedral''). Silves declined in importance thereafter and was eclipsed in the region by [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] during the colonial period. In 1491, the town of Silves was given to queen [[Eleanor of Viseu|Eleanora]] by her husband, king [[John II of Portugal]].\n\n==Sights==\n[[File:Vista_de_Silves_-_26-04-2018.jpg|thumb|left|235px|A view of the historical centre of Silves overlooking the [[Castle of Silves|Castle]] and Cathedral]]\nParts of the Almohad town wall, constructed from poured concrete, have been preserved, as well as the Almedina-gate (Porta de [[Loul\u00e9]]). Other sights include the Santa Miseric\u00f3rdia Church with a fine door in [[Manueline]] style (the main body of the church was built in 1727-28); a museum for [[Cork (material)|cork]] and the production of bottle corks in a defunct factory which is now also a centre for cultural events called \"[http://www.fabrica-do-ingles.pt F\u00e1brica do Ingl\u00eas] (The Englishman's Factory); and the municipal museum (Museu Municipal de Arqueologia) with findings from the [[palaeolithic]] onwards.\n\nThe town is situated on a hill above the [[Arade River]]. [[Silves Castle]] is located on the top of the hill. It occupies ca. 12,000 m\u00b2. Archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s have shown that the oldest buildings date back to the 8th century, the [[stratigraphy]] is almost 6 m deep and contains [[Iron Age]] remains as well. The walls are made of red [[sandstone]] (gr\u00e9s de Silves) with a [[pis\u00e9]]-core and were heavily restored in the 1940s. Protruding towers of the [[albarra]]-type protect the Northern slope. After the Christian conquest, the castle served as the seat of the alcaide-mor (provincial governor) until the middle of the 16th century; afterwards the towers were used as a prison.\n\n==Geography==\nThe municipality is crossed by the [[Arade River]], which was navigable in historical times and was key to the prosperity of the city of Silves.

The river Arade, which was navigable in historical times, linked the hinterland to the open ocean and allowed the   transport of produce and commerce. The town of Silves (''Cilpes'') was possibly founded during the times of [[Hispania|Roman domination]], when  the region was part of the [[Lusitania]] province.  It was probably a Lusitanian Castro in pre-Roman times;<ref>http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=1288</ref> however the region was also settled by other Indo-European tribes, such as the [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]] (or Conii). Silves was also part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].\n\nAfter 713, when [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|the Moors invaded Iberia]], Silves became part of the Umayyad [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]] under the Arabic name of ''Shilb'' (\u0634\u0644\u0628). In the 10th century it was one of the most important towns in western [[Al-Andalus]]. Silves became an [[Taifa of Silves|independent taifa]] in 1027 under the rule of Ibn Mozaine and his son, who was dethroned in 1051 by al-Mu'tadid, the governor of [[Seville]]. [[al-Mu'tamid]] ibn 'Abbad, the son of al-Mu'tadid and a famous poet, ruled the taifa of Silves until 1091. After the [[Almoravid]] conquest the town became [[Almohad]] in 1156.\n\nIn 1189, King [[Sancho I of Portugal]] conquered (in the [[Reconquista]]) the town with the aid of Northern European crusaders.<ref>Charles Wendell David, ed. ''Narratio de Itinere Navali Peregrinorum Hierosolymam Tendentium et Silviam Capientium, A.D. 1189''. In ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 81 (Dec., 1939): 591-676.</ref> Sancho ordered the fortification of the city and built a castle, which is today an important monument of Portuguese heritage. At the time he also styled himself \"By the Grace of God, King of Portugal and Silves (''Dei Grati\u00e6, Rex Portugalli\u00e6 et Silbis''). \nHowever, he soon lost the town again to the Almohads. Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from [[Al-Andalus]] to ravage the Iberian Christian kingdoms, bringing back booty and slaves. The governor of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] attacked Silves in 1191, and took 3,000 Christian slaves.<ref>[http://libro.uca.edu/rc/rc1.htm Ransoming Captives in Crusader Spain: The Order of Merced on the Christian-Islamic Frontier]</ref> Again under Muslim rule, the city would then prosper to the point of being called ''the [[Baghdad]] of the West''.\n\nThe town was finally taken from the last Muslim king Ibn Afan by [[Paio Peres Correia]], Grand-Master of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]] in 1242, after the [[Alentejo]] and most of the coast had already fallen in 1238. The great [[mosque]] was changed into [[Silves Cathedral]] (''S\u00e9 Catedral''). Silves declined in importance thereafter and was eclipsed in the region by [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] during the colonial period. In 1491, the town of Silves was given to queen [[Eleanor of Viseu|Eleanora]] by her husband, king [[John II of Portugal]].\n\n==Sights==\n[[File:Vista_de_Silves_-_26-04-2018.jpg|thumb|left|235px|A view of the historical centre of Silves overlooking the [[Castle of Silves|Castle]] and Cathedral]]\nParts of the Almohad town wall, constructed from poured concrete, have been preserved, as well as the Almedina-gate (Porta de [[Loul\u00e9]]). Other sights include the Santa Miseric\u00f3rdia Church with a fine door in [[Manueline]] style (the main body of the church was built in 1727-28); a museum for [[Cork (material)|cork]] and the production of bottle corks in a defunct factory which is now also a centre for cultural events called \"[http://www.fabrica-do-ingles.pt F\u00e1brica do Ingl\u00eas] (The Englishman's Factory); and the municipal museum (Museu Municipal de Arqueologia) with findings from the [[palaeolithic]] onwards.\n\nThe town is situated on a hill above the [[Arade River]]. [[Silves Castle]] is located on the top of the hill. It occupies ca. 12,000 m\u00b2. Archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s have shown that the oldest buildings date back to the 8th century, the [[stratigraphy]] is almost 6 m deep and contains [[Iron Age]] remains as well. The walls are made of red [[sandstone]] (gr\u00e9s de Silves) with a [[pis\u00e9]]-core and were heavily restored in the 1940s. Protruding towers of the [[albarra]]-type protect the Northern slope. After the Christian conquest, the castle served as the seat of the alcaide-mor (provincial governor) until the middle of the 16th century; afterwards the towers were used as a prison.\n\n==Geography==\nThe municipality is crossed by the [[Arade River]], which was navigable in historical times and was key to the prosperity of the city of Silves. The waters of the river form the [[dam]]s of Arade and Funcho. The landscape of the municipality is generally hilly. To the south the municipality borders the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\nSilves is built on top of one of the largest underground [[aquifer]]s in the south of Portugal, The Queren\u00e7a-Silves Aquifer [http://environ.chemeng.ntua.gr/wsm/Uploads/Deliverables/ThirdYear/Deliverable_21.6.pdf], and has many orange groves, a fruit introduced by the Moors.\n\n===Human geography===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|\n{{stack|\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Population of<br>Silves<br><small>(1801 - 2011)</small>\n| 1801 | 10509\n| 1849 | 15509\n| 1900 | 29598\n| 1930 | 34461\n| 1960 | 33368\n| 1981 | 31389\n| 1991 | 32924\n| 2001 | 33830\n| 2004 | 34909\n| 2011 | 37126\n}}\n}}\n|}\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 115|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2014|author=''[[Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica]]''|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n* [[Alcantarilha e P\u00eara]]\n* [[Algoz e Tunes]]\n* [[Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara]]\n* [[S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines]]\n* [[S\u00e3o Marcos da Serra]]\n* Silves\n\n==Education==\n{{expand section|date=February 2015}}\n''[[Deutsche Schule Algarve]]'', a German international school, is in the city.<ref>\"[http://www.ds-algarve.org/cms/index.php?Die_Schulstruktur Die Schulstruktur].\" ''[[Deutsche Schule Algarve]]''.
