The position of Ni\u0161 is strategically important, at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with Asia. Ni\u0161 is easily accessible, having an airport \u2013 [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport]] and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines. \n{{wide image|Ni\u0161, panorama n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.jpg|700px|Panorama picture of the Square of the [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].}}\nIt is in Ni\u0161 that the trunk road running from the north down the [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava River]] valley forks into two major lines:\n\n* the south one, leading to [[Thessalonica]] and [[Athens]], along the [[Vardar]] River valley,\n* and the east one, running along the [[Nisava]] and the [[Maritsa|Marica]], leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.\n\nThese roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as 'Via Militaris' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] periods, or 'Constantinople road' in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Ni\u0161 thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the [[Black Sea]] to the Mediterranean. Nis had been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2017, Ni\u0161 has one of 14 [[free economic zone]]s established in Serbia.<ref name=\"srbeconomiczone2017\">{{cite news |last1=Mikavica |first1=A. |title=Slobodne zone mamac za investitore |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388105/Slobodne-zone-mamac-za-investitore |accessdate=17 March 2019 |work=politika.rs |date=3 September 2017 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n;Economic preview\n[[File:Saborna_crkva_april_2012a.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral of [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].]]\n[[File:Ni\u0161ava_River,_Ni\u0161,_Serbia.jpg|thumb|[[Ni\u0161ava]] river.]]\n[[File:Kazandzijsko_Nis.JPG|thumb|[[Tinkers Alley]], old urban downtown built in the first half of the [[18th century]].]]\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2019):<ref name=\"stats19employees\">{{cite web |title=\u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, 2019. - \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u045a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a - |url=https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2020/Pdf/G20201018.pdf |website=stat.gov.rs |publisher=Statistical Office of Republic of Serbia |accessdate=15 March 2020 |language=Serbian |date=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

In the Ni\u0161 area, this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the [[Ni\u0161ava]] river valley, which runs Eastwards in the direction of [[Sofia]] and [[Istanbul]]. The city has been a passing station for the [[Orient Express]].\n\nThe first highways date back to the 1950s when Ni\u0161 was linked with capital Belgrade through the [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway]], the first in Central-Eastern Europe.\n\nHistorically, because of its location, the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the [[Roman Empire]] that built the important road [[Via Militaris]], linking the city with ''Singidunum'' (current Belgrade) to the North and ''Constantinople'' (current Istanbul) to the southeast. Nowadays, the city is connected by the highway [[E75 in Serbia|E75]] with Belgrade and Central Europe in north, and [[Skopje]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Athens]] in the south. The road [[European route E80|E80]] connects Ni\u0161 with Sofia, Istanbul towards the Middle East, and [[Pristina]], [[Montenegro]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the West. The road [[E771]] connects the city with [[Zaje\u010dar]], [[Kladovo]] and [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]] in [[Romania]].\n\nThe city is also a major regional railway junction linking Serbia to Sofia and Istanbul.\n\nThe [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport|Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great]] airport is the second most important airport in Serbia. The first airfield serving the city of Ni\u0161 was established in 1910, near the village of [[Donje Me\u0111urovo]]. In the 1930s then-national airline company [[Aeroput]] used the airport for civil service. In 1935 Aeroput included a stop in Ni\u0161 in its route linking Belgrade with Skoplje.<ref>[http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ Drustvo za Vazdusni Saobracaj A D \u2013 Aeroput (1927-1948)] at europeanairlines.no</ref>\n\nThe city public transportation consists nowadays of 13 bus lines.

The position of Ni\u0161 is strategically important, at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with Asia. Ni\u0161 is easily accessible, having an airport \u2013 [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport]] and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines. \n{{wide image|Ni\u0161, panorama n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.jpg|700px|Panorama picture of the Square of the [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].}}\nIt is in Ni\u0161 that the trunk road running from the north down the [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava River]] valley forks into two major lines:\n\n* the south one, leading to [[Thessalonica]] and [[Athens]], along the [[Vardar]] River valley,\n* and the east one, running along the [[Nisava]] and the [[Maritsa|Marica]], leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.\n\nThese roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as 'Via Militaris' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] periods, or 'Constantinople road' in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Ni\u0161 thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the [[Black Sea]] to the Mediterranean. Nis had been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2017, Ni\u0161 has one of 14 [[free economic zone]]s established in Serbia.<ref name=\"srbeconomiczone2017\">{{cite news |last1=Mikavica |first1=A. |title=Slobodne zone mamac za investitore |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388105/Slobodne-zone-mamac-za-investitore |accessdate=17 March 2019 |work=politika.rs |date=3 September 2017 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n;Economic preview\n[[File:Saborna_crkva_april_2012a.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral of [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].]]\n[[File:Ni\u0161ava_River,_Ni\u0161,_Serbia.jpg|thumb|[[Ni\u0161ava]] river.]]\n[[File:Kazandzijsko_Nis.JPG|thumb|[[Tinkers Alley]], old urban downtown built in the first half of the [[18th century]].]]\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2019):<ref name=\"stats19employees\">{{cite web |title=\u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, 2019. - \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u045a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a - |url=https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2020/Pdf/G20201018.pdf |website=stat.gov.rs |publisher=Statistical Office of Republic of Serbia |accessdate=15 March 2020 |language=Serbian |date=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

In the Ni\u0161 area, this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the [[Ni\u0161ava]] river valley, which runs Eastwards in the direction of [[Sofia]] and [[Istanbul]]. The city has been a passing station for the [[Orient Express]].\n\nThe first highways date back to the 1950s when Ni\u0161 was linked with capital Belgrade through the [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway]], the first in Central-Eastern Europe.\n\nHistorically, because of its location, the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the [[Roman Empire]] that built the important road [[Via Militaris]], linking the city with ''Singidunum'' (current Belgrade) to the North and ''Constantinople'' (current Istanbul) to the southeast.

Carnera became world champion by knocking out Sharkey in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=117}}\n\nHe retained the title against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] and [[Tommy Loughran]], both by decision in 15 rounds, but in his next fight on 14 June 1934 against [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], Carnera was knocked down multiple times in 11 rounds, before referee Arthur Donovon stopped the fight. There is disagreement regarding how many times Carnera was knocked down, with sources giving conflicting totals of 7, 10, 11 (per [[Associated Press]]) and 12 (per [[The Ring Magazine|''The Ring'' magazine]] founder [[Nat Fleischer]], ringside for the fight, who wrote that Carnera was knocked down 12 times and slipped once after a missed punch).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Primo_Carnera_vs._Max_Baer |title=Primo Carnera vs. Max Baer\u2013 Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter that, Carnera won his next four fights, three of them as part of a South American tour that took him to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, as well as two exhibitions fought on the South American continent. But then, on 25 June 1935, he was knocked out in six rounds by [[Joe Louis]].\n\nFor the next two and a half years, he won five and lost three of eight total fights. But in 1938, Carnera, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], had to have a kidney removed, which forced him into retirement by 1944.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=179}} Carnera's record was 89 wins and 14 losses. His 72 wins by knockout made him a member of the exclusive club of boxers that won 50 or more bouts by knockout.\n\nCarnera died in 1967 in his native town of a combination of [[liver]] disease and complications from diabetes.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=7, 214}}\n\n====Legacy in boxing====\nCarnera was the third European to hold the world heavyweight championship after [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] and [[Max Schmeling]]. He would be the last until [[Ingemar Johansson]] claimed the title against [[Floyd Patterson]] in 1959, over a quarter of a century later.\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Tommy Loughran]] held the record for the greatest weight differential between two combatants in a world title fight ({{convert|86|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or}})<ref>{{cite news |title=TOMMY LOUGHRAN DIES AT 79 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/10/obituaries/tommy-loughran-dies-at-79.html |work=The New York Times |date=10 July 1982 |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> for 73 years until the reign of [[Nikolai Valuev]], who owns the current record for the {{convert|105+1/2|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight advantage he held in his 2006 defense against [[Monte Barrett]].\n\nValuev also broke Carnera's record of {{convert|270|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to become the heaviest world champion in history, weighing as high as {{convert|328|lb|kg|abbr=on}} during his reign. Carnera still ranks as the second-heaviest, over eighty years after he held the title.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=209}}\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] in Italy was the first Heavyweight title fight to be held in Europe since [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s title defence against [[Frank Moran]] in Paris in 1913. It would be the last such occasion until [[Muhammad Ali]] defended the title against [[Henry Cooper]] in London in 1966. Carnera-Uzcudun was the first World Heavyweight championship fight to be contested between two Europeans. It was not until [[Lennox Lewis]] defended the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] heavyweight title against fellow-Englishman [[Frank Bruno]] in 1993, sixty years later, that this would occur again.\n\nTrailing only [[Ezzard Charles]] and his 95 wins, Carnera holds the second-most victories of all heavyweight champions with 88.

During his tenure as world champion he played a fictional version of himself in the 1933 film ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' starring Max Baer and [[Myrna Loy]]. Here he plays the heavyweight champion who barely holds onto his title with a draw decision after a furious fight with Baer. The film was made just the year before Carnera fought Baer for real, in a bout that was as wild as the film version, but ended with a knockout loss for Carnera.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}}\n\nCarnera had a silent bit part in the 1949 movie [[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|''Mighty Joe Young'']].{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}} He played himself in the tug-of-war scene with the giant gorilla. After being pulled by the ape into a pool of water, Carnera throws a couple of futile punches to Joe's chin.\n\nHe also played a bully boy wrestler in [[Carol Reed]]'s film [[A Kid for Two Farthings (film)|''A Kid for Two Farthings'']] (1955) based around London's [[Petticoat Lane Market]] where he has a match against a local bodybuilder who is marrying [[Diana Dors]].\n\nPrimo appeared in at least ten Italian films between 1939 and 1943,<ref name=\"IMDM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138712/|title=Primo Carnera|publisher=}}</ref> as well as several in the 1950s, like [[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047365/|title=Prince Valiant|date=5 April 1954|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref> in the role of Sligon.

But the next year, after three losses against [[Luigi Musina]] his talent for [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] was discovered. In 1946 he became a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and was immediately a huge success at the box office. For several years he was one of the top draws in wrestling. Carnera continued to be an attraction into the 1960s. Max Baer attended at least one of Carnera's wrestling matches.<ref>[http://www.mmbolding.com/Heavyweights/Boxer_vs._Wrestler_Primo_Carnera.htm The Strange Case of Carnera, By Jack Sher, ''Sport'', February 1948]</ref> Carnera won his debut on 22 August 1946, when he defeated Tommy O'Toole in California.

Carnera's greatest victory took place on 7 December 1947 when he defeated former world heavyweight champion [[Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis]].\n\nIn May 1948, Carnera took a 143-1-1 record against world heavyweight champion [[Lou Thesz]].

It was adapted into [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]]'s 1956 film, which starred [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Rod Steiger]]. A highlight was the appearance of [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], playing a fighter the mob could not fix who destroys the giant in his first fair fight. Critics drew parallels with the real-life Baer-Carnera fight two decades before. In response, Carnera unsuccessfully sued the film's company.\n\nCarnera played himself in the 1949 movie ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''.\n\nCarnera was played by Matthew G.

kar\u02c8n\u025b\u02d0ra}}; 26 October 1906 \u2013 29 June 1967),  nicknamed the '''Ambling Alp''', was an Italian professional [[Boxing|boxer]] and [[Professional Wrestling|wrestler]] who reigned as the boxing World Heavyweight Champion from 29 June 1933 to 14 June 1934. He has won more fights by knockout than any other heavyweight champion in boxing history.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Personal life===\nPrimo Carnera was born in [[Sequals]], then in the [[Province of Udine]], now in the [[Province of Pordenone]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] at the north-easternmost corner of Italy.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=5}}\n\nOn 13 March 1939, Carnera married Giuseppina Kova\u010di\u010d (1913\u20131980), a post office clerk from [[Gorizia]].{{sfn|Page|2010|p=179}} In 1953 they became American citizens. They settled in [[Los Angeles]], where Carnera opened a restaurant and a liquor store. They had two children, Umberto and Giovanna Maria. Umberto became a medical doctor.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=212}}\n\n===Professional boxing career===\n====Overview====\nCarnera was touted in America as being {{height|ft=6|in=7}} tall, and thus the tallest heavyweight in history (up until that time), but he was actually {{height|ft=6|in=6}} tall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Human:12086 |title=Primo Carnera \u2013 Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> He fought at as much as {{convert|275|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/carnera.htm|title=Cyber Boxing Zone -- Primo Carnera|publisher=}}</ref> [[Jess Willard]] who stood {{height|ft=6|in=7}} was the tallest world heavyweight champion in boxing history until [[Nikolai Valuev]], at {{height|ft=7|in=0}} and {{convert|328|lb|kg}}. Though {{convert|1|in|cm|spell=in}} shorter than Willard, Carnera was around {{convert|40|lb|kg|abbr=on}} heavier and was the heaviest champion in boxing history until Valuev.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=209}}\n\nAt a time when the average height in Italy was approximately {{height|ft=5|in=5}} and in the United States {{height|ft=5|in=7}},<ref>{{cite web|last=Steckel|first=Richard H.|title=A History of the Standard of Living in the United States|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/a-history-of-the-standard-of-living-in-the-united-states/ |accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> Carnera was considered a giant.\n\nHe enjoyed a sizable reach advantage over most rivals, and when seen on fight footage, he seems like a towering giant compared to many heavyweights of his era, who were usually at least {{convert|60|lb|kg}} lighter and {{convert|7|in|cm}} shorter. One publicity release about him read in part: \"For breakfast, Primo has a quart of orange juice, two quarts of milk, nineteen pieces of toast, fourteen eggs, a loaf of bread and half a pound of Virginia ham.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_LzhBcWcf8QC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6 |title=Cinderella Man: James J.

Carnera won by [[knockout]] in round two.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=11-12}} He won his first six bouts, then lost to Franz Diener by disqualification in round one at [[Leipzig]]. Then, he won seven more bouts in a row before meeting [[Young Stribling]]. He and Stribling exchanged disqualification wins, Carnera winning the first in four rounds, and Stribling winning the rematch in round seven. In Carnera's next bout he avenged his defeat to Diener with a knockout in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=22}}\n\nIn 1930, he moved to the United States, where he toured extensively, winning his first seventeen bouts there by knockout. [[George Godfrey (boxer born 1897)|George Godfrey]] broke the knockout streak in [[Philadelphia]] by losing to Carnera by disqualification in the fifth round.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=52}} In 1932, Carnera faced the tallest heavyweight in history up to that point, [[Santa Camar\u00e3o]], a {{height|ft=6|in=8}} [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fighter. Carnera won the fight in a sixth-round knockout.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=93-94}}\n\nOn 10 February 1933, he knocked out [[Ernie Schaaf]] in thirteen rounds in New York City. Schaaf died four days later.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=100}} Schaaf had suffered a severe beating and knockout in a bout with future heavyweight champion [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] six months earlier, on 31 August 1932. Furthermore, an autopsy revealed that Schaaf had [[meningitis]], a swelling of the brain, and was still recovering from a severe case of [[influenza]] when he entered the ring with Carnera.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxbaer.org/faqs.html |title=FAQs |first=Catherine |last=Johnson |website=www.maxbaer.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092641/http://www.maxbaer.org/faqs.html |date=2007 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2018-11-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ibroresearch.com/Articles/Max%20Baer%20and%20Death%20of%20Ernie%20Schaaf.htm |title=Max Baer and the Death of Ernie Schaaf |first=Michael |last=Hunnicutt |work=International Boxing Research Organization |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419025505/http://www.ibroresearch.com/Articles/Max%20Baer%20and%20Death%20of%20Ernie%20Schaaf.htm |date=2005-04-05 |archivedate=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2018-11-26 }}</ref>\n\nFor his next fight, Carnera faced the world heavyweight champion, [[Jack Sharkey]], on June 29, at the [[Madison Square Garden Bowl]] in [[Queens, New York]]. Carnera became world champion by knocking out Sharkey in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=117}}\n\nHe retained the title against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] and [[Tommy Loughran]], both by decision in 15 rounds, but in his next fight on 14 June 1934 against [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], Carnera was knocked down multiple times in 11 rounds, before referee Arthur Donovon stopped the fight. There is disagreement regarding how many times Carnera was knocked down, with sources giving conflicting totals of 7, 10, 11 (per [[Associated Press]]) and 12 (per [[The Ring Magazine|''The Ring'' magazine]] founder [[Nat Fleischer]], ringside for the fight, who wrote that Carnera was knocked down 12 times and slipped once after a missed punch).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Primo_Carnera_vs._Max_Baer |title=Primo Carnera vs. Max Baer\u2013 Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter that, Carnera won his next four fights, three of them as part of a South American tour that took him to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, as well as two exhibitions fought on the South American continent. But then, on 25 June 1935, he was knocked out in six rounds by [[Joe Louis]].\n\nFor the next two and a half years, he won five and lost three of eight total fights. But in 1938, Carnera, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], had to have a kidney removed, which forced him into retirement by 1944.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=179}} Carnera's record was 89 wins and 14 losses. His 72 wins by knockout made him a member of the exclusive club of boxers that won 50 or more bouts by knockout.\n\nCarnera died in 1967 in his native town of a combination of [[liver]] disease and complications from diabetes.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=7, 214}}\n\n====Legacy in boxing====\nCarnera was the third European to hold the world heavyweight championship after [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] and [[Max Schmeling]]. He would be the last until [[Ingemar Johansson]] claimed the title against [[Floyd Patterson]] in 1959, over a quarter of a century later.\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Tommy Loughran]] held the record for the greatest weight differential between two combatants in a world title fight ({{convert|86|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or}})<ref>{{cite news |title=TOMMY LOUGHRAN DIES AT 79 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/10/obituaries/tommy-loughran-dies-at-79.html |work=The New York Times |date=10 July 1982 |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> for 73 years until the reign of [[Nikolai Valuev]], who owns the current record for the {{convert|105+1/2|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight advantage he held in his 2006 defense against [[Monte Barrett]].\n\nValuev also broke Carnera's record of {{convert|270|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to become the heaviest world champion in history, weighing as high as {{convert|328|lb|kg|abbr=on}} during his reign. Carnera still ranks as the second-heaviest, over eighty years after he held the title.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=209}}\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] in Italy was the first Heavyweight title fight to be held in Europe since [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s title defence against [[Frank Moran]] in Paris in 1913. It would be the last such occasion until [[Muhammad Ali]] defended the title against [[Henry Cooper]] in London in 1966. Carnera-Uzcudun was the first World Heavyweight championship fight to be contested between two Europeans. It was not until [[Lennox Lewis]] defended the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] heavyweight title against fellow-Englishman [[Frank Bruno]] in 1993, sixty years later, that this would occur again.\n\nTrailing only [[Ezzard Charles]] and his 95 wins, Carnera holds the second-most victories of all heavyweight champions with 88. Carnera's 71 career knockouts is the most of any world heavyweight champion.<ref>{{cite news |title=All-Time List: Most Career KOs By a Heavyweight Champ |url=https://www.boxingscene.com/all-time-list-most-career-kos-by-heavyweight-champ--50229 |work=Boxing Scene |date=3 March 2012 |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Acting career===\nCarnera appeared in a short film in 1931. During his tenure as world champion he played a fictional version of himself in the 1933 film ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' starring Max Baer and [[Myrna Loy]]. Here he plays the heavyweight champion who barely holds onto his title with a draw decision after a furious fight with Baer. The film was made just the year before Carnera fought Baer for real, in a bout that was as wild as the film version, but ended with a knockout loss for Carnera.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}}\n\nCarnera had a silent bit part in the 1949 movie [[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|''Mighty Joe Young'']].{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}} He played himself in the tug-of-war scene with the giant gorilla. After being pulled by the ape into a pool of water, Carnera throws a couple of futile punches to Joe's chin.\n\nHe also played a bully boy wrestler in [[Carol Reed]]'s film [[A Kid for Two Farthings (film)|''A Kid for Two Farthings'']] (1955) based around London's [[Petticoat Lane Market]] where he has a match against a local bodybuilder who is marrying [[Diana Dors]].\n\nPrimo appeared in at least ten Italian films between 1939 and 1943,<ref name=\"IMDM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138712/|title=Primo Carnera|publisher=}}</ref> as well as several in the 1950s, like [[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047365/|title=Prince Valiant|date=5 April 1954|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref> in the role of Sligon. His last screen role was as the giant [[Antaeus]] alongside [[Steve Reeves]] in ''[[Hercules Unchained]]'' (USA title, filmed in Italy, 1959, original title ''Ercole e la regina di Lidia'').<ref name=\"IMDM2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052782/|title=Hercules Unchained|date=13 July 1960|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===Professional wrestling career===\nIn 1945 he temporarily returned to boxing and won two fights. But the next year, after three losses against [[Luigi Musina]] his talent for [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] was discovered. In 1946 he became a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and was immediately a huge success at the box office. For several years he was one of the top draws in wrestling. Carnera continued to be an attraction into the 1960s. Max Baer attended at least one of Carnera's wrestling matches.<ref>[http://www.mmbolding.com/Heavyweights/Boxer_vs._Wrestler_Primo_Carnera.htm The Strange Case of Carnera, By Jack Sher, ''Sport'', February 1948]</ref> Carnera won his debut on 22 August 1946, when he defeated Tommy O'Toole in California. On 23 October 1946, Carnera won his 41st consecutive wrestling match by defeating Jules Strongbow.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=187}} On 19 November 1946, Carnera beat Harry Kruskamp to remain undefeated at 65-0-0.\n\nPrimo Carnera went 120 straight wrestling matches undefeated (119-0-1) before suffering his first loss to Yvon Robert in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, on 20 August 1947. Carnera's greatest victory took place on 7 December 1947 when he defeated former world heavyweight champion [[Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis]].\n\nIn May 1948, Carnera took a 143-1-1 record against world heavyweight champion [[Lou Thesz]]. Thesz defeated Carnera in a world title defense.\n\n==Mob accusations==\nAccording to boxing historian Herbert Goldman, Carnera was \"very much mob controlled.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bodner|first=Alan|title=When Boxing Was a Jewish Sport|year=1997|publisher=Praeger Publishers|isbn=978-0275953539|page=[https://archive.org/details/trent_0116405589635/page/133 133]|url=https://archive.org/details/trent_0116405589635/page/133}}</ref> Carnera met his first serious heavyweight contender, [[Young Stribling]], in 1929, and won when Stribling fouled him. In a rematch, he fouled Stribling.

The travails of McClintock, who was played by [[Jack Palance]] ([[Sean Connery]] played the part on British television and [[Anthony Quinn]] essayed the role in the 1962 film), was thought by many boxing fans to resemble Carnera's life.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Donelson |first1=Tom |last2=Lotierzo |first2=Frank |date=2004 |title=More Tales From Ringside |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rho92_9lU38C |publisher=iUniverse |page=125 |isbn=0-595-30588-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947, fighting aficionado [[Budd Schulberg]] wrote ''[[The Harder They Fall]]'', a novel about a giant boxer whose fights are fixed. It was adapted into [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]]'s 1956 film, which starred [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Rod Steiger]]. A highlight was the appearance of [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], playing a fighter the mob could not fix who destroys the giant in his first fair fight. Critics drew parallels with the real-life Baer-Carnera fight two decades before. In response, Carnera unsuccessfully sued the film's company.\n\nCarnera played himself in the 1949 movie ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''.\n\nCarnera was played by Matthew G. Taylor in the 2005 film ''[[Cinderella Man]]'', a film about the life of fellow boxer [[James J. Braddock]].\n\nIn 2008, the actor Andrea Iaia played Carnera in the Italian biographical film ''[[Carnera: The Walking Mountain]]'', directed by Renzo Martinelli.\n\nIn 2013, Emporio Elaborazioni Meccaniche named a motorbike, the 1983 BMW R80RT Carnera, in honor of Carnera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gessato.com/2013/08/03/the-carnera-by-emporio-elaborazioni-meccaniche/|title=The Carnera by Emporio Elaborazioni Meccaniche|first=|last=Holly|date=3 August 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===In comics===\nIn 1947, ''[[Carnera (comics)|Carnera]]'', an Italian [[comic book]] series sporting a fictional version of Primo Carnera, was produced.<ref name=\"auto\">Maria Grazia Perini. \"Carnera\".

Based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the solar system's speed with respect to the center of the galaxy (which on short time scales can be considered constant), the [[Earth]] should be exposed to a higher flux of dark matter particles around June&nbsp;2,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} when its [[orbital speed]] is added to the one of the solar system with respect to the [[galaxy]] and to a smaller one around December&nbsp;2, when the two velocities are subtracted. The annual modulation signature is distinctive since the effect induced by dark matter particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements.\n\n==Description==\nThe experimental set-up was located deep underground in the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]] in [[Italy]].\n\nThe experimental set-up was made by nine 9.70&nbsp;kg low-radioactivity scintillating [[thallium]]-doped [[sodium iodide]]  [[crystal]]s [NaI(Tl)]. Each crystal was faced by two low-background [[photomultiplier]]s through 10&nbsp;cm light guides. The detectors were installed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen in order to insulate the detectors from air that contains trace amounts of radon, a radioactive gas. To reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is enclosed inside a multicomponent multi-ton passive shield made of copper, lead, polyethylene/paraffin, cadmium foil. A [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglas]] box encloses the whole shield and is also kept in a highly pure nitrogen atmosphere.

Based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the solar system's speed with respect to the center of the galaxy (which on short time scales can be considered constant), the [[Earth]] should be exposed to a higher flux of dark matter particles around June&nbsp;2,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} when its [[orbital speed]] is added to the one of the solar system with respect to the [[galaxy]] and to a smaller one around December&nbsp;2, when the two velocities are subtracted. The annual modulation signature is distinctive since the effect induced by dark matter particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements.\n\n==Description==\nThe experimental set-up was located deep underground in the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]] in [[Italy]].\n\nThe experimental set-up was made by nine 9.70&nbsp;kg low-radioactivity scintillating [[thallium]]-doped [[sodium iodide]]  [[crystal]]s [NaI(Tl)]. Each crystal was faced by two low-background [[photomultiplier]]s through 10&nbsp;cm light guides. The detectors were installed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen in order to insulate the detectors from air that contains trace amounts of radon, a radioactive gas. To reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is enclosed inside a multicomponent multi-ton passive shield made of copper, lead, polyethylene/paraffin, cadmium foil. A [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglas]] box encloses the whole shield and is also kept in a highly pure nitrogen atmosphere. A concrete [[neutron]] moderator 1&nbsp;m thick largely surrounds the set-up.\n\n==Results==\nThe DAMA/NaI set-up observed the annual modulation signature over 7&nbsp;annual cycles (1995\u20132002). The presence of a model independent positive evidence in the data of DAMA/NaI was first reported by the DAMA collaboration in fall&nbsp;1997 and published beginning of 1998.<ref name=\"mod1\">{{cite

Most recent authorities recognise 36 species, however, this is debated, and some authorities include additional genera. Birdwings are named for their exceptional size, angular wings, and birdlike flight. They are  found across tropical Asia, mainland and archipelagic [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Australasia]].\n\nIncluded among the birdwings are some of the largest butterflies in the world: the largest, [[Queen Alexandra's birdwing]]; the second largest, the [[Goliath birdwing]]; the largest butterfly endemic to [[Australia]], the [[Cairns birdwing]]; and the largest butterfly in India, the [[southern birdwing]]. Another well-known species is [[Rajah Brooke's birdwing]], a particularly attractive species named after Sir [[James Brooke]], the first [[White Rajahs|White Rajah]] of 19th-century [[Sarawak]].\n\nDue to their size and brightly coloured males, they are popular among collectors of butterflies, but all birdwings are now listed by [[CITES]],<ref name=CITES>CITES (2011).

The female lays her spherical [[egg (biology)|eggs]] under the tips of the vine's leaves, one egg per leaf.\n\n=== Larva ===\n\n[[File:Garudasalabhamlarva.jpg|thumb|right|Early instar larva of ''Troides minos'']]\nThe [[caterpillar]]s are voracious eaters but move very little; a small group will defoliate an entire vine. If starved due to overcrowding, the caterpillars may resort to [[cannibalism]]. Fleshy spine-like tubercles line the caterpillars' backs, and their bodies are dark red to brown and velvety black. Some species have tubercles of contrasting colours, often red, or pale \"saddle\" markings. Like other members of their family, birdwing caterpillars possess a retractable organ behind their heads called an ''[[osmeterium]]''. Shaped like the forked [[tongue]] of a [[snake]], the osmeterium excretes a fetid [[terpene]]-based compound and is deployed when the caterpillar is provoked. The caterpillars are also unappealing to most [[predator]]s due to their toxicity: the vines which the caterpillars feed upon contain [[aristolochic acid]], a [[poison]]ous compound known to be [[carcinogen]]ic in [[rat]]s. The feeding caterpillars incorporate and concentrate the aristolochic acid into their tissues, where the poison will persist through [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] and into adulthood.\n\n=== Pupa ===\n\n[[File:Troides.victoriae.pupa.jpg|thumb|right|Pupa of ''Ornithoptera victoriae'']]\nBirdwing [[Chrysalis|chrysalids]] are [[camouflage]]d to look like a dead leaf or twig. Before [[pupa]]ting, the caterpillars may wander considerable distances from their host plants. In ''O. alexandrae'', it takes about four months to get from egg to adult. Barring predation, this species can also survive up to three months as an adult.\n\n=== Imago ===\n\nBirdwings inhabit [[rainforest]]s and adults are usually glimpsed along the forest periphery. They feed upon&mdash;and are important long-range [[pollinator]]s of&mdash;nectar-bearing [[flower]]s of the forest canopy, as well as terrestrial flowers, such as [[lantana]]. They are strong flyers and seek sunlit spots in which to bask.\n\nBreeding behaviour varies little between species; the female's role is relatively passive, slowly fluttering from perch to perch while the male performs an elaborate, quivering yet stationary dance 20&ndash;50&nbsp;cm above her.\n\n[[File:Ornithoptera euphorion, Melbourne Zoo.JPG|left|thumb|Copulating pair of ''[[Ornithoptera euphorion]]'' (female above, male below). The sexes are quite dissimilar in appearance, as is typical of species in the genus ''Ornithoptera''.]]\nBirdwings are typified by large size (up to a maximum body length of 7.6&nbsp;cm or 3&nbsp;inches and a wingspan of 28&nbsp;cm or 11&nbsp;inches in ''O. alexandrae''), showy colouration (in contrasting shades of green, yellow, black, white, and sometimes blue or orange), and slender, lanceolate forewings. With few exceptions (i.e., the [[New Guinea]]n ''[[Ornithoptera meridionalis|O. meridionalis]]'' and ''[[Ornithoptera paradisea|O. paradisea]]''), the hindwings lack tails. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is strong in ''Ornithoptera'' species only, where males are black combined with bright iridescent green, blue, orange, or yellow while the larger and less colourful females are overall black or dark brownish with white, pale brown, or yellow markings.\n\nMales and females of most ''Troides'' birdwings are similar and have jet black to brown dorsal forewings, often with the [[vein]]s bordered in grey to creamy white. At least one of these darkly-coloured species (''[[Troides rhadamantus|T. rhadamantus]]'') possesses [[thermoreceptor]]s on the anal veins (A2 and A3) of the wings and on the [[antenna (biology)|antennal]] clubs. The antennal receptors of the clubs&mdash;which also possess [[hygroreceptor]]s that measure atmospheric [[humidity]]&mdash;are known as ''sensilla basiconica''. The thermoreceptors are sensitive to sudden increases in temperature; they are thought to help the butterfly [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] and avoid overheating while basking.\n\nThe colours of most species are [[pigment]]ary (via [[papiliochrome]]); but two species, ''[[Troides magellanus]]'' and the much rarer ''[[Troides prattorum|T. prattorum]]'', are noted for their use of limited-view [[iridescence]]: the yellow of the dorsal hindwings is modified by bright blue-green iridescence which is only seen when the butterfly is viewed at a narrow, oblique angle. This \"grazing iridescence\" is brought about through [[diffraction]] of [[light]] (after back-reflection) by the wings' extremely steeply-set, multilayered rib-like [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s (rather than the ridge-lamellae of most other iridescent butterflies, such as ''[[Morpho (butterfly)|Morpho]]'' species). Such limited-view iridescence was previously only known from one other species, the [[Riodinidae|riodinid]] ''[[Ancyluris meliboeus]]''. In ''A. meliboeus'', however, the iridescence is produced by ridge-lamellar scales and features a wider range of colours.\n\nThe close evolutionary relationship between ''Troides'' and ''Ornithoptera'' butterflies is well demonstrated by the fact that commercial breeders have produced numerous [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between the two.\n\nThe final and smallest genus is ''Trogonoptera'' with just two species. They resemble each other, being overall black with iridescent green markings and a red head. Females are duller than males.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nBirdwings are generally found from [[Southeast Asia]] to northern [[Australasia]]. ''Trogonoptera brookiana'' inhabits the [[Thai-Malay Peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Natuna Islands|Natuna]], [[Sumatra]], and various surrounding islands.<ref>The World of Birdwing Butterflies.

However, the very similar ''[[Aristolochia elegans]]'' (Dutchman's pipe) which can be found in many Australian backyards, kills the caterpillars.\n\n==Reproduction==\n\n''Ornithoptera'', or the genus of birdwing butterflies, usually reproduce sexually and are [[oviparous]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Straatman, R. Hybridisation of Birdwing Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) In Papua New Guinea. The Lepidopterological Society of Japan. ''Ty\u00f4 to Ga'' (''Transactions of the Lepidopterological Society of Japan'') Vol. 27, No, 4 1976 156-162.</ref> In butterflies sex is determined by a [[ZW sex-determination system|WW/WZ system]], with a [[heterogametic]] female, reverse of that found in mammals and many other insects, which have a hetergametic male.<ref>Nielsen, J. (2010). A Review of Synandromorphism in the Genus Ornithoptera Boisduval, (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). Australian Entomologist, 37(3): 105-112.</ref> During copulation males will transfer an ejaculate containing both sperm and accessory substances that can make up to fifteen percent of a males body mass.\n\n==Mating systems==\n\n[[Mating systems]], first explored in evolutionary terms by Darwin, includes all behaviours associated with [[sexual reproduction]].<ref>Emlen ST, Oring LW. (1977). Ecology, sexual selection, and the evolution of mating systems. Science 197:215-223.</ref> Mating systems include all costs and benefits, pre- and postcopulatory competitions, displays and mate choice. Butterfly mating systems have great variation, including strict monandry, one male and one female, to [[polyandry]], having many mates of the opposite sex. Typically ''Ornithoptera'' tend to be [[polygamous]], mating with more than one individual.\n\n===Female choice===\n\n[[Female choice]] can have a serious impact on mate selection and successful reproduction. Several species of ''Ornithoptera'' have been known to create hybrids if they have no access to their own species.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> ''Troides oblongamaculatus'' females have been known to choose to mate with other species such as ''Ornithoptera priamus poseidon'', which will attempt mating if their own species is not to be found near by. The females will typically resist mating attempts by covering their abdomen with their forewings or dropping to the ground, making mating near impossible. Although the females usually resist these mating attempts, they have been noted to be more susceptible if they have not had previous encounters with males of their own species.\n\n===Male courtship===\n\nSome male ''Ornithoptera'' species demonstrate [[courtship]] behaviour. ''Ornithoptera priamus posedion'' males will approach a female carefully, and examine the female for several minutes. After consideration, the male may choose to hover twenty to thirty centimeters above the female, displaying the bright yellow marking on its hindwings. Meanwhile, the forewings will move forward, exposing the abdomen and androconial hair tufts. Mating is only attempted when the female has ceased to flap her wings.<ref>Orr, A. (1999). Possible Postcopulatory Mate Guarding in Ornithopter Euphorion (Gray) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). Australian Entomologist, 26 (3): 71-76.</ref> After about thirty seconds of the display, the male will attempt copulation.\n\n===Cryptic choice: sperm competition and postcopulatory guarding===\n\nIn many animals, females often mate with more than one male.<ref>Satoh, Y. Yano, S. Takafuji, A. Mating strategy of spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) males: postcopulatory guarding to assure paternity. (2001). Applied Entomology, 36 (1): 41-45.</ref> Males who are able will adapt strategies such as postcopulatory guarding to ensure the paternity of the offspring. Following insemination, it is common for the male ''Ornithoptera'' to produce a [[mating plug]], which will seal the ostium bursae and prevent remating by the female, as new sperm is unable to enter the opening. The plug does not impede oviposition and may stay in place for the duration of the female's life.\n\n===Sexual dimorphism===\n\n[[Sexual dimorphism]] is very prominent in ''Ornithoptera'' species, the males being black with brightly colored markings of blue, green, orange or yellow and the females are overall black or dark brown.<ref>Wilts, B. D., Matsushita, A., Arikawa, K., & Stavenga, D. G. (2015). Spectrally tuned structural and pigmentary coloration of birdwing butterfly wing scales. Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 12(111), 20150717. http://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0717</ref> The sexual dichromatism functions in mate recognition by the use of photoreceptors. Due to the protected nature of ''Ornithoptera'' it has been difficult to study the spectral sensitivities of the sexes although this difference in coloration alludes to the idea of sensory exploitation of the female's photoreceptors. The sensory bias of females to select for males with brighter wings has yet to be studied in ''Ornithoptera''.\n\nGyanandromorphism is a very rare condition in which an organism simultaneously expresses both male and female phenotypes. It is only observed in species that express strong sexual dimorphism. Gynandromorphs are suspected to be due to genetic errors associated with cell division such as nondisjunction, as well as fertilization of binucleate ova and fertilisation of multiple sperm that may fuse and act as a second nucleus. ''Ornithoptera'' is known to commonly exhibit this phenomenon, but little to no research has been successful in determining why. Those who experience this phenomenon, usually females, show male-pigmented tissues on their wings.\n\n== Cited references ==\n\n<references/>\n\n== Other references ==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* d'Abrera, Bernard.

Most recent authorities recognise 36 species, however, this is debated, and some authorities include additional genera. Birdwings are named for their exceptional size, angular wings, and birdlike flight. They are  found across tropical Asia, mainland and archipelagic [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Australasia]].\n\nIncluded among the birdwings are some of the largest butterflies in the world: the largest, [[Queen Alexandra's birdwing]]; the second largest, the [[Goliath birdwing]]; the largest butterfly endemic to [[Australia]], the [[Cairns birdwing]]; and the largest butterfly in India, the [[southern birdwing]]. Another well-known species is [[Rajah Brooke's birdwing]], a particularly attractive species named after Sir [[James Brooke]], the first [[White Rajahs|White Rajah]] of 19th-century [[Sarawak]].\n\nDue to their size and brightly coloured males, they are popular among collectors of butterflies, but all birdwings are now listed by [[CITES]],<ref name=CITES>CITES (2011).

The female lays her spherical [[egg (biology)|eggs]] under the tips of the vine's leaves, one egg per leaf.\n\n=== Larva ===\n\n[[File:Garudasalabhamlarva.jpg|thumb|right|Early instar larva of ''Troides minos'']]\nThe [[caterpillar]]s are voracious eaters but move very little; a small group will defoliate an entire vine. If starved due to overcrowding, the caterpillars may resort to [[cannibalism]]. Fleshy spine-like tubercles line the caterpillars' backs, and their bodies are dark red to brown and velvety black. Some species have tubercles of contrasting colours, often red, or pale \"saddle\" markings. Like other members of their family, birdwing caterpillars possess a retractable organ behind their heads called an ''[[osmeterium]]''. Shaped like the forked [[tongue]] of a [[snake]], the osmeterium excretes a fetid [[terpene]]-based compound and is deployed when the caterpillar is provoked. The caterpillars are also unappealing to most [[predator]]s due to their toxicity: the vines which the caterpillars feed upon contain [[aristolochic acid]], a [[poison]]ous compound known to be [[carcinogen]]ic in [[rat]]s. The feeding caterpillars incorporate and concentrate the aristolochic acid into their tissues, where the poison will persist through [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] and into adulthood.\n\n=== Pupa ===\n\n[[File:Troides.victoriae.pupa.jpg|thumb|right|Pupa of ''Ornithoptera victoriae'']]\nBirdwing [[Chrysalis|chrysalids]] are [[camouflage]]d to look like a dead leaf or twig. Before [[pupa]]ting, the caterpillars may wander considerable distances from their host plants. In ''O. alexandrae'', it takes about four months to get from egg to adult. Barring predation, this species can also survive up to three months as an adult.\n\n=== Imago ===\n\nBirdwings inhabit [[rainforest]]s and adults are usually glimpsed along the forest periphery. They feed upon&mdash;and are important long-range [[pollinator]]s of&mdash;nectar-bearing [[flower]]s of the forest canopy, as well as terrestrial flowers, such as [[lantana]]. They are strong flyers and seek sunlit spots in which to bask.\n\nBreeding behaviour varies little between species; the female's role is relatively passive, slowly fluttering from perch to perch while the male performs an elaborate, quivering yet stationary dance 20&ndash;50&nbsp;cm above her.\n\n[[File:Ornithoptera euphorion, Melbourne Zoo.JPG|left|thumb|Copulating pair of ''[[Ornithoptera euphorion]]'' (female above, male below). The sexes are quite dissimilar in appearance, as is typical of species in the genus ''Ornithoptera''.]]\nBirdwings are typified by large size (up to a maximum body length of 7.6&nbsp;cm or 3&nbsp;inches and a wingspan of 28&nbsp;cm or 11&nbsp;inches in ''O. alexandrae''), showy colouration (in contrasting shades of green, yellow, black, white, and sometimes blue or orange), and slender, lanceolate forewings. With few exceptions (i.e., the [[New Guinea]]n ''[[Ornithoptera meridionalis|O. meridionalis]]'' and ''[[Ornithoptera paradisea|O. paradisea]]''), the hindwings lack tails. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is strong in ''Ornithoptera'' species only, where males are black combined with bright iridescent green, blue, orange, or yellow while the larger and less colourful females are overall black or dark brownish with white, pale brown, or yellow markings.\n\nMales and females of most ''Troides'' birdwings are similar and have jet black to brown dorsal forewings, often with the [[vein]]s bordered in grey to creamy white. At least one of these darkly-coloured species (''[[Troides rhadamantus|T. rhadamantus]]'') possesses [[thermoreceptor]]s on the anal veins (A2 and A3) of the wings and on the [[antenna (biology)|antennal]] clubs. The antennal receptors of the clubs&mdash;which also possess [[hygroreceptor]]s that measure atmospheric [[humidity]]&mdash;are known as ''sensilla basiconica''. The thermoreceptors are sensitive to sudden increases in temperature; they are thought to help the butterfly [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] and avoid overheating while basking.\n\nThe colours of most species are [[pigment]]ary (via [[papiliochrome]]); but two species, ''[[Troides magellanus]]'' and the much rarer ''[[Troides prattorum|T. prattorum]]'', are noted for their use of limited-view [[iridescence]]: the yellow of the dorsal hindwings is modified by bright blue-green iridescence which is only seen when the butterfly is viewed at a narrow, oblique angle. This \"grazing iridescence\" is brought about through [[diffraction]] of [[light]] (after back-reflection) by the wings' extremely steeply-set, multilayered rib-like [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s (rather than the ridge-lamellae of most other iridescent butterflies, such as ''[[Morpho (butterfly)|Morpho]]'' species). Such limited-view iridescence was previously only known from one other species, the [[Riodinidae|riodinid]] ''[[Ancyluris meliboeus]]''. In ''A. meliboeus'', however, the iridescence is produced by ridge-lamellar scales and features a wider range of colours.\n\nThe close evolutionary relationship between ''Troides'' and ''Ornithoptera'' butterflies is well demonstrated by the fact that commercial breeders have produced numerous [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between the two.\n\nThe final and smallest genus is ''Trogonoptera'' with just two species. They resemble each other, being overall black with iridescent green markings and a red head. Females are duller than males.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nBirdwings are generally found from [[Southeast Asia]] to northern [[Australasia]]. ''Trogonoptera brookiana'' inhabits the [[Thai-Malay Peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Natuna Islands|Natuna]], [[Sumatra]], and various surrounding islands.<ref>The World of Birdwing Butterflies.

However, the very similar ''[[Aristolochia elegans]]'' (Dutchman's pipe) which can be found in many Australian backyards, kills the caterpillars.\n\n==Reproduction==\n\n''Ornithoptera'', or the genus of birdwing butterflies, usually reproduce sexually and are [[oviparous]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Straatman, R. Hybridisation of Birdwing Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) In Papua New Guinea. The Lepidopterological Society of Japan. ''Ty\u00f4 to Ga'' (''Transactions of the Lepidopterological Society of Japan'') Vol. 27, No, 4 1976 156-162.</ref> In butterflies sex is determined by a [[ZW sex-determination system|WW/WZ system]], with a [[heterogametic]] female, reverse of that found in mammals and many other insects, which have a hetergametic male.<ref>Nielsen, J. (2010). A Review of Synandromorphism in the Genus Ornithoptera Boisduval, (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). Australian Entomologist, 37(3): 105-112.</ref> During copulation males will transfer an ejaculate containing both sperm and accessory substances that can make up to fifteen percent of a males body mass.\n\n==Mating systems==\n\n[[Mating systems]], first explored in evolutionary terms by Darwin, includes all behaviours associated with [[sexual reproduction]].<ref>Emlen ST, Oring LW. (1977). Ecology, sexual selection, and the evolution of mating systems. Science 197:215-223.</ref> Mating systems include all costs and benefits, pre- and postcopulatory competitions, displays and mate choice. Butterfly mating systems have great variation, including strict monandry, one male and one female, to [[polyandry]], having many mates of the opposite sex. Typically ''Ornithoptera'' tend to be [[polygamous]], mating with more than one individual.\n\n===Female choice===\n\n[[Female choice]] can have a serious impact on mate selection and successful reproduction. Several species of ''Ornithoptera'' have been known to create hybrids if they have no access to their own species.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> ''Troides oblongamaculatus'' females have been known to choose to mate with other species such as ''Ornithoptera priamus poseidon'', which will attempt mating if their own species is not to be found near by. The females will typically resist mating attempts by covering their abdomen with their forewings or dropping to the ground, making mating near impossible. Although the females usually resist these mating attempts, they have been noted to be more susceptible if they have not had previous encounters with males of their own species.\n\n===Male courtship===\n\nSome male ''Ornithoptera'' species demonstrate [[courtship]] behaviour. ''Ornithoptera priamus posedion'' males will approach a female carefully, and examine the female for several minutes. After consideration, the male may choose to hover twenty to thirty centimeters above the female, displaying the bright yellow marking on its hindwings. Meanwhile, the forewings will move forward, exposing the abdomen and androconial hair tufts. Mating is only attempted when the female has ceased to flap her wings.<ref>Orr, A. (1999). Possible Postcopulatory Mate Guarding in Ornithopter Euphorion (Gray) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). Australian Entomologist, 26 (3): 71-76.</ref> After about thirty seconds of the display, the male will attempt copulation.\n\n===Cryptic choice: sperm competition and postcopulatory guarding===\n\nIn many animals, females often mate with more than one male.<ref>Satoh, Y. Yano, S. Takafuji, A. Mating strategy of spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) males: postcopulatory guarding to assure paternity. (2001). Applied Entomology, 36 (1): 41-45.</ref> Males who are able will adapt strategies such as postcopulatory guarding to ensure the paternity of the offspring. Following insemination, it is common for the male ''Ornithoptera'' to produce a [[mating plug]], which will seal the ostium bursae and prevent remating by the female, as new sperm is unable to enter the opening. The plug does not impede oviposition and may stay in place for the duration of the female's life.\n\n===Sexual dimorphism===\n\n[[Sexual dimorphism]] is very prominent in ''Ornithoptera'' species, the males being black with brightly colored markings of blue, green, orange or yellow and the females are overall black or dark brown.<ref>Wilts, B. D., Matsushita, A., Arikawa, K., & Stavenga, D. G. (2015). Spectrally tuned structural and pigmentary coloration of birdwing butterfly wing scales. Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 12(111), 20150717. http://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0717</ref> The sexual dichromatism functions in mate recognition by the use of photoreceptors. Due to the protected nature of ''Ornithoptera'' it has been difficult to study the spectral sensitivities of the sexes although this difference in coloration alludes to the idea of sensory exploitation of the female's photoreceptors. The sensory bias of females to select for males with brighter wings has yet to be studied in ''Ornithoptera''.\n\nGyanandromorphism is a very rare condition in which an organism simultaneously expresses both male and female phenotypes. It is only observed in species that express strong sexual dimorphism. Gynandromorphs are suspected to be due to genetic errors associated with cell division such as nondisjunction, as well as fertilization of binucleate ova and fertilisation of multiple sperm that may fuse and act as a second nucleus. ''Ornithoptera'' is known to commonly exhibit this phenomenon, but little to no research has been successful in determining why.

He played 15 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He was a two-time NBA All-Star and won an NBA championship with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in 2007.\n\n==High school career==\nFinley attended [[Proviso East High School]] in [[Maywood, Illinois]], graduating in 1991. In Finley's senior season, Proviso East won the 1991 IHSA class AA boys basketball tournament,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marchmadness.org/records/yearly/1991baa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 18, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117085645/http://www.marchmadness.org/records/yearly/1991baa.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2007  }}</ref> and Finley was named to the all-tournament team. Finley's teammates, known collectively as the \"Three Amigos\", included future NBA draftees [[Sherrell Ford]] and [[Donnie Boyce]].\n\nIn 2007, Finley was voted one of the \"[[100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament]]\".<ref>[http://www.ihsa.org/initiatives/legends/index.htm IHSA \u2013 Legends of Boys Basketball<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==College career==\nThe 6' 7\" [[shooting guard]]/[[small forward]] was originally drafted out of [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] by the [[Phoenix Suns]] as the 21st overall pick of the [[1995 NBA draft]]. Finley held the all-time scoring record at [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] for eleven years before being passed by [[Alando Tucker]] on March 10, 2007.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=270690275 Illinois Fighting Illini vs. Wisconsin Badgers \u2013 Recap \u2013 March 10, 2007 \u2013 ESPN]</ref>\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Phoenix Suns (1995\u20131996)===\nFinley was named to the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] [[NBA All-Rookie First Team]] and finished third in [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]] voting after averaging fifteen points, 4.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game. He became only the third rookie in Suns history to score over 1,000&nbsp;points in a season. Despite playing all 82 games in his rookie season, Finley was injured on the final day of regular season and did not play in the playoffs. He was traded by the Suns on December 26, 1996<ref name=\"nbabio\" /> to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] along with [[Sam Cassell]], [[A. C. Green]] and a second-round draft pick for [[Jason Kidd]], [[Tony Dumas]] and [[Loren Meyer]].\n\n===Dallas Mavericks (1996\u20132005)===\nIn his first season with the Mavericks, Finley led the team in scoring, assists and steals. Along with point guard [[Steve Nash]] and forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]], he became an integral part of the Mavericks' late '90s \"run and gun\" offense.\n\nIn 2000, he was selected to represent the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] in the 2000 [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], in which he scored eleven points. On January 23, 2001, Finley tied an NBA record by recording eight steals in one half of a game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_steals.html |title=Regular Season Records: Steals |access-date=September 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420123304/http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_steals.html |archive-date=April 20, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2001, he was again selected to represent the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] on All-Star weekend.

In 2005, he was waived by Dallas to avoid luxury taxes (as part of the league's new labor agreement) on his 51.8&nbsp;million US$ salary over the next three years. Finley became an unrestricted free agent and after being pursued by [[Detroit Pistons|Detroit]], [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minnesota]], and [[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]], he elected to remain in [[Texas]] with the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\n===San Antonio Spurs (2005\u20132010; First NBA title)===\nIn [[San Antonio]] he adapted well to a secondary role as [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]]'s backup, developing and emphasizing his outside shooting. The Spurs were knocked out of the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]] by his former team one year after he made the switch. During the series, Finley was punched below the belt by former teammate [[Jason Terry]] during Game 5, which earned Terry a suspension for the next game of the series.\n\nIn the fifth and final game of San Antonio's first-round series against [[Denver Nuggets|Denver]] in 2007, Finley set the Spurs' record for three-point field goals in a playoff game, making eight of nine attempts. He eclipsed the previous record of seven set by teammate [[Bruce Bowen]] in 2003. Finley won his only NBA championship in 2007 with the San Antonio Spurs in his 12th NBA season.\n\nAt Finley's request, the Spurs bought out the final year of his contract and waived him on March 1, 2010, freeing him to sign with another team.\n\n===Boston Celtics (2010)===\nOn March 4, 2010, Finley reached a verbal agreement with the [[Boston Celtics]] to join the team for the remainder of the 2009\u201310 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/boston/nba/news/story?id=4966307|title=Michael Finley says he has agreement to join Boston Celtics|accessdate=March 4, 2010|last=Stein |first=Marc |date=March 4, 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> He signed with the Celtics on March 6, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press_release/press030610-celtics-sign-michael-finley.html|title=Celtics sign Michael Finley|accessdate=March 7, 2010|date=March 6, 2010 |work=[[NBA.com]]}}</ref> The Celtics would reach the [[2010 NBA Finals]], but would lose to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in seven games.

retired professional basketball player and current [[film producer]] and also Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Dallas Mavericks. He played 15 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He was a two-time NBA All-Star and won an NBA championship with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in 2007.\n\n==High school career==\nFinley attended [[Proviso East High School]] in [[Maywood, Illinois]], graduating in 1991. In Finley's senior season, Proviso East won the 1991 IHSA class AA boys basketball tournament,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marchmadness.org/records/yearly/1991baa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 18, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117085645/http://www.marchmadness.org/records/yearly/1991baa.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2007  }}</ref> and Finley was named to the all-tournament team. Finley's teammates, known collectively as the \"Three Amigos\", included future NBA draftees [[Sherrell Ford]] and [[Donnie Boyce]].\n\nIn 2007, Finley was voted one of the \"[[100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament]]\".<ref>[http://www.ihsa.org/initiatives/legends/index.htm IHSA \u2013 Legends of Boys Basketball<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==College career==\nThe 6' 7\" [[shooting guard]]/[[small forward]] was originally drafted out of [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] by the [[Phoenix Suns]] as the 21st overall pick of the [[1995 NBA draft]]. Finley held the all-time scoring record at [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] for eleven years before being passed by [[Alando Tucker]] on March 10, 2007.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=270690275 Illinois Fighting Illini vs. Wisconsin Badgers \u2013 Recap \u2013 March 10, 2007 \u2013 ESPN]</ref>\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Phoenix Suns (1995\u20131996)===\nFinley was named to the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] [[NBA All-Rookie First Team]] and finished third in [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]] voting after averaging fifteen points, 4.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game. He became only the third rookie in Suns history to score over 1,000&nbsp;points in a season. Despite playing all 82 games in his rookie season, Finley was injured on the final day of regular season and did not play in the playoffs. He was traded by the Suns on December 26, 1996<ref name=\"nbabio\" /> to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] along with [[Sam Cassell]], [[A. C. Green]] and a second-round draft pick for [[Jason Kidd]], [[Tony Dumas]] and [[Loren Meyer]].\n\n===Dallas Mavericks (1996\u20132005)===\nIn his first season with the Mavericks, Finley led the team in scoring, assists and steals. Along with point guard [[Steve Nash]] and forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]], he became an integral part of the Mavericks' late '90s \"run and gun\" offense.\n\nIn 2000, he was selected to represent the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] in the 2000 [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], in which he scored eleven points. On January 23, 2001, Finley tied an NBA record by recording eight steals in one half of a game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_steals.html |title=Regular Season Records: Steals |access-date=September 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420123304/http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_steals.html |archive-date=April 20, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2001, he was again selected to represent the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] on All-Star weekend. He played for the [[United States men's national basketball team|US national team]] in the [[2002 FIBA World Championship]],<ref>[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_2002.html 2002 USA Basketball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714000000/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_2002.html |date=July 14, 2007 }}</ref> which lost a record-three games and failed to win a championship for the first time in a major competition since [[FIBA]] opened international competitions to NBA players.\n\nWhile Finley began to play more of a supporting role ([[small forward]]) as he aged and teammate [[Dirk Nowitzki]] blossomed, he remained a clutch player for the Mavericks. In 2005, he was waived by Dallas to avoid luxury taxes (as part of the league's new labor agreement) on his 51.8&nbsp;million US$ salary over the next three years. Finley became an unrestricted free agent and after being pursued by [[Detroit Pistons|Detroit]], [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minnesota]], and [[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]], he elected to remain in [[Texas]] with the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\n===San Antonio Spurs (2005\u20132010; First NBA title)===\nIn [[San Antonio]] he adapted well to a secondary role as [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]]'s backup, developing and emphasizing his outside shooting. The Spurs were knocked out of the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]] by his former team one year after he made the switch. During the series, Finley was punched below the belt by former teammate [[Jason Terry]] during Game 5, which earned Terry a suspension for the next game of the series.\n\nIn the fifth and final game of San Antonio's first-round series against [[Denver Nuggets|Denver]] in 2007, Finley set the Spurs' record for three-point field goals in a playoff game, making eight of nine attempts. He eclipsed the previous record of seven set by teammate [[Bruce Bowen]] in 2003. Finley won his only NBA championship in 2007 with the San Antonio Spurs in his 12th NBA season.\n\nAt Finley's request, the Spurs bought out the final year of his contract and waived him on March 1, 2010, freeing him to sign with another team.\n\n===Boston Celtics (2010)===\nOn March 4, 2010, Finley reached a verbal agreement with the [[Boston Celtics]] to join the team for the remainder of the 2009\u201310 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/boston/nba/news/story?id=4966307|title=Michael Finley says he has agreement to join Boston Celtics|accessdate=March 4, 2010|last=Stein |first=Marc |date=March 4, 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> He signed with the Celtics on March 6, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press_release/press030610-celtics-sign-michael-finley.html|title=Celtics sign Michael Finley|accessdate=March 7, 2010|date=March 6, 2010 |work=[[NBA.com]]}}</ref> The Celtics would reach the [[2010 NBA Finals]], but would lose to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in seven games. At the end of the season, Finley announced he would retire.\n\n==Personal life==\nFinley began playing basketball in elementary school. His favorite player was [[Michael Jordan]] and he would occasionally go to [[Chicago Bulls]] games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael

He was a major [[Calvinist]] opponent of [[John Wesley]].  He is best remembered as the author of the hymn [[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|\"Rock of Ages\"]].  Three of his other hymns \u2013 \"A Debtor to Mercy Alone\", \"Deathless Principle, Arise\" and \"Object of My First Desire\" \u2013 are still occasionally sung today.\n\n==Background and early life, 1740\u201355==\nAugustus Toplady was born in [[Farnham]], Surrey, England in November 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland.  Richard Toplady became a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Royal Marines]] in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major.  In May 1741, shortly after Augustus' birth, Richard participated in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] (1741), the most significant battle of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342), during the course of which he died, most likely of [[yellow fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheltering in the Rock |publisher=Banner of Truth |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822223800/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leaving Augustus' mother to raise the boy alone.\n\nToplady's mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of [[Chilham]] from 1711 until his death in 1736.  Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to [[Westminster]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] from 1750 to 1755.\n\n==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755\u201360==\nIn 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nShortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of [[John Wesley]], in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his ''Dying Avowal'', Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his [[effectual calling]] from God.\n\nHaving undergone his religious conversion under the preaching of a [[Methodist]], Toplady initially followed Wesley in supporting [[Arminianism]]. In 1758, however, the 18-year-old Toplady read [[Thomas Manton]]'s seventeenth-century sermon on [[Gospel of John|John]]&nbsp;17 and [[Girolamo Zanchi|Jerome Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562). These works convinced Toplady that [[Calvinism]], not Arminianism, was correct.\n\nIn 1759, Toplady published his first book, ''Poems on Sacred Subjects''.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Trinity College in 1760, Toplady and his mother returned to Westminster. There, Toplady met and was influenced by several prominent Calvinist ministers, including [[George Whitefield]], [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]], and [[William Romaine]]. It was John Gill who in 1760 urged Toplady to publish his translation of Zanchius's work on predestination, Toplady commenting that \"I was not then, however, sufficiently delivered from the fear of man.\"<ref>{{Citation | volume = 1 | last = Toplady | title = Works | page = 189}}, at {{Citation | page = 34 | first = T | last = Wrights | year = 1911 | type = biography | title = Toplady}}.</ref>\n\n==Church ministry: 1762\u201378==\nIn 1762, [[Edward Willes (priest)|Edward Willes]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], ordained Toplady as an Anglican [[Anglican ministry#Deacons|deacon]], appointing him [[curate]] of [[Blagdon]], located in the [[Mendip Hills]] of [[Somerset]].\n\nToplady wrote his famous hymn ''Rock of Ages'' in 1763.  A local tradition \u2013 discounted by most historians \u2013 holds that he wrote the hymn after seeking shelter under a large rock at [[Burrington Combe]], a magnificent ravine close to Blagdon, during a [[thunderstorm]].\n\nUpon being ordained [[Anglican ministry#Priests|priest]] in 1764, Toplady returned to London briefly, and then served as curate of [[Farleigh Hungerford]] for a little over a year (1764\u201365). He then returned to stay with friends in London for 1765\u201366.\n\nIn May 1766, he became incumbent of [[Harpford]] and [[Venn Ottery]], two villages in [[Devon]].  In 1768, however, he learned that he had been named to this incumbency because it had been purchased for him; seeing this as [[simony]], he chose to exchange the incumbency for the post of [[Vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of [[Broadhembury]], another Devon village.  He would serve as vicar of Broadhembury until his death, although he received leave to be absent from Broadhembury from 1775 on.\n\nToplady never married, though he did have relationships with two women.  The first was [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], the founder of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]], a Calvinist Methodist series of congregations.  Toplady first met Huntingdon in 1763, and preached in her chapels several times in 1775 during his absence from Broadhembury.  The second was [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom he first met in 1773, and with whom he spent a large amount of time in the years 1773\u201377.\n\n===Animals and Natural World===\nToplady was a prolific essayist and letter correspondent and wrote on a wide range of topics. He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work ''Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system'', wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in \"A Short Essay on Original Sin\", and in a public debate delivered a speech on \"Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?\". In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals.<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustus | last = Toplady | title = The Works | place = London | publisher = J Chidley | year = 1837 | origyear = 1794 | pages = 409\u201316, 443\u201346, 518\u201339}}.</ref> Toplady's position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries [[Joseph Butler]], [[Richard Dean (curate)|Richard Dean]], [[Humphry Primatt]] and [[John Wesley]], and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, [[G. H. Pember|George Hawkins Pember]], [[George N. H. Peters]], Joseph Seiss, and James Macauley developed the arguments in more detail in the context of the debates about [[animal welfare]], [[animal rights]] and [[vivisection]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Keith | last = Thomas | title = Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500\u20131800 | place = London | publisher = Penguin | year = 1984 | ISBN = 978-0-14-014686-8}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | editor1-first = Andrew | editor1-last = Linzey | editor2-first = Tom | editor2-last = Regan | title = Animals and Christianity: A Book of Readings | place = London | publisher = SPCK | year = 1989 | ISBN = 0-281-04373-6}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Rod | last = Preece | title = Darwinism, Christianity and the Great Vivisection Debate | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | year = 2003 | pages = 399\u2013419}}.</ref>\n\n===Calvinist controversialist: 1769\u201378===\nToplady's first salvo into the world of religious controversy came in 1769 when he wrote a book in response to a situation at the [[University of Oxford]].  Six students had been expelled from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] because of their Calvinist views, which [[Thomas Nowell]] criticised as inconsistent with the views of the Church of England. Toplady then criticised Nowell's position in his book ''The Church of England Vindicated from the Charge of Arminianism'', which argued that Calvinism, not Arminianism, was the position historically held by the Church of England.\n\n1769 also saw Toplady publish his translation of [[Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562), one of the works which had convinced Toplady to become a Calvinist in 1758.  Toplady entitled his translation ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted''.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uJEPAAAAIAAJPPA8,M1 | title = The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted | first = Girolamo | last = Zanchi}}, translated by Toplady, with a letter to John Wesley appended.</ref> This work drew a vehement response from John Wesley, thus initiating a protracted pamphlet debate between Toplady and Wesley about whether the Church of England was historically Calvinist or Arminian.  This debate peaked in 1774, when Toplady published his 700-page ''The Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England'', a massive study which traced the doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] from the period of the [[Early Church]] through to [[William Laud]]. The section about the [[Synod of Dort]] contained a footnote identifying five basic propositions of the Calvinist faith, arguably the first appearance in print of the summary of Calvinism known as the \"[[five points of Calvinism]]\".\n\nThe relationship between Toplady and Wesley that had initially been cordial, involving exchanges of letters in Toplady's Arminian days, became increasingly bitter and reached its nadir with the \"Zanchy affair\".<ref>{{Citation | chapter = 8 | first = George | last = Ella | year = 2000 | type = biography | title = A Debtor to Mercy Alone}}.</ref> Wesley took exception to the publication of Toplady's translation of Zanchius's work on predestination in 1769 and published, in turn, an abridgment of that work titled \"The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted\", adding his own comment that \"The sum of all is this: One in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate will be damned, do what they can. Reader believe this, or be damned. Witness my hand.\" Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius's views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions were attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.\n\nToplady published a response in the form of \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\".<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206024136/http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm |date=6 December 2007 }} (26 March 1770).</ref>  Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work \"The Consequenses Proved\" that responded to Toplady's letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady.{{Efn | The abridgement was not included in Wesley's \"Collected Works\" until 1872.}}  Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that \"I do not fight with chimney-sweepers.  He is too dirty a writer for me to meddle with. I should only foul my fingers. I read his title-page, and troubled myself no farther. I leave him to Mr Sellon. He cannot be in better hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bayliss |first1=Peter |title=Rock of Ages |url=http://www.ensignmessage.com/archives/rockofages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021002200/http://www.ensignmessage.com/archives/rockofages.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 October 2004 |publisher=This England Magazine |accessdate=3 July 2016 }}</ref><!--But compare the letter to Wesley from 1771. At least up to that point it appears that Toplady received no response.-->\n\n==Last years==\n\nToplady spent his last three years mainly in London, preaching regularly in a [[Huguenot|French Calvinist]] chapel at Orange Street (off of Haymarket), most spectacularly in 1778, when he appeared to rebut charges being made by Wesley's followers that he had renounced Calvinism on his deathbed.\n\nToplady died of [[tuberculosis]] on 11 August 1778.  He was buried at [[Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road]].\n\n==Hymns==\n\n*''A Debtor To Mercy Alone'' n. 7 in [[The Believers Hymn Book]]\n*''Compared with Christ, in all beside'' n. 760 in [[The Church Hymn book 1872]] (1772)\n*''Deathless spirit, now arise'' n. 1381 in [[The Church Hymn book 1872]] (1776)\n*''Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness'' n. 80 in [[The Church Hymn book 1872]] (1776).

He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work \"Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system\", wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in \"A Short Essay on Original Sin\", and in a public debate delivered a speech on \"Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?\". In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals.<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustus | last = Toplady | title = The Works | place = London | publisher = J Chidley | year = 1837 | origyear = 1794 | pages = 409\u201316, 443\u201346, 518\u201339}}.</ref> Toplady's position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries [[Joseph Butler]], [[Richard Dean (curate)|Richard Dean]], [[Humphry Primatt]] and [[John Wesley]], and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, [[G. H. Pember|George Hawkins Pember]], [[George N. H. Peters]], Joseph Seiss, and James Macauley developed the arguments in more detail in the context of the debates about [[animal welfare]], [[animal rights]] and [[vivisection]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Keith | last = Thomas | title = Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500\u20131800 | place = London | publisher = Penguin | year = 1984 | ISBN = 978-0-14-014686-8}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | editor1-first = Andrew | editor1-last = Linzey | editor2-first = Tom | editor2-last = Regan | title = Animals and Christianity: A Book of Readings | place = London | publisher = SPCK | year = 1989 | ISBN = 0-281-04373-6}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Rod | last = Preece | title = Darwinism, Christianity and the Great Vivisection Debate | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | year = 2003 | pages = 399\u2013419}}.</ref>\n\n===Calvinist controversialist: 1769\u201378===\nToplady's first salvo into the world of religious controversy came in 1769 when he wrote a book in response to a situation at the [[University of Oxford]].  Six students had been expelled from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] because of their Calvinist views, which [[Thomas Nowell]] criticised as inconsistent with the views of the Church of England. Toplady then criticised Nowell's position in his book ''The Church of England Vindicated from the Charge of Arminianism'', which argued that Calvinism, not Arminianism, was the position historically held by the Church of England.\n\n1769 also saw Toplady publish his translation of [[Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562), one of the works which had convinced Toplady to become a Calvinist in 1758.  Toplady entitled his translation ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted''.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uJEPAAAAIAAJPPA8,M1 | title = The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted | first = Girolamo | last = Zanchi}}, translated by Toplady, with a letter to John Wesley appended.</ref> This work drew a vehement response from John Wesley, thus initiating a protracted pamphlet debate between Toplady and Wesley about whether the Church of England was historically Calvinist or Arminian.  This debate peaked in 1774, when Toplady published his 700-page ''The Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England'', a massive study which traced the doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] from the period of the [[Early Church]] through to [[William Laud]]. The section about the [[Synod of Dort]] contained a footnote identifying five basic propositions of the Calvinist faith, arguably the first appearance in print of the summary of Calvinism known as the \"[[five points of Calvinism]]\".\n\nThe relationship between Toplady and Wesley that had initially been cordial, involving exchanges of letters in Toplady's Arminian days, became increasingly bitter and reached its nadir with the \"Zanchy affair\".<ref>{{Citation | chapter = 8 | first = George | last = Ella | year = 2000 | type = biography | title = A Debtor to Mercy Alone}}.</ref> Wesley took exception to the publication of Toplady's translation of Zanchius's work on predestination in 1769 and published, in turn, an abridgment of that work titled \"The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted\", adding his own comment that \"The sum of all is this: One in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate will be damned, do what they can. Reader believe this, or be damned. Witness my hand.\" Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius's views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions were attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.\n\nToplady published a response in the form of \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\".<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206024136/http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm |date=6 December 2007 }} (26 March 1770).</ref>  Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work \"The Consequenses Proved\" that responded to Toplady's letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady.{{Efn | The abridgement was not included in Wesley's \"Collected Works\" until 1872.}}  Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that \"I do not fight with chimney-sweepers.  He is too dirty a writer for me to meddle with. I should only foul my fingers. I read his title-page, and troubled myself no farther. I leave him to Mr Sellon. He cannot be in better hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bayliss |first1=Peter |title=Rock of Ages |url=http://www.ensignmessage.com/archives/rockofages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021002200/http://www.ensignmessage.com/archives/rockofages.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 October 2004 |publisher=This England Magazine |accessdate=3 July 2016 }}</ref><!--But compare the letter to Wesley from 1771. At least up to that point it appears that Toplady received no response.-->\n\n==Last years==\n\nToplady spent his last three years mainly in London, preaching regularly in a [[Huguenot|French Calvinist]] chapel at Orange Street (off of Haymarket), most spectacularly in 1778, when he appeared to rebut charges being made by Wesley's followers that he had renounced Calvinism on his deathbed.\n\nToplady died of [[tuberculosis]] on 11 August 1778.  He was buried at [[Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road]].\n\n==Hymns==\n\n*''A Debtor To Mercy Alone'' n. 7 in [[The Believers Hymn Book]]\n*''Compared with Christ, in all beside'' n. 760 in [[The Church Hymn book 1872]] (1772)\n*''Deathless spirit, now arise'' n. 1381 in [[The Church Hymn book 1872]] (1776)\n*''Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness'' n. 80 in [[The Church Hymn book 1872]] (1776).
