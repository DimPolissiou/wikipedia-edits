Captain [[Darren Sammy]] also led a late charge that produced 108 runs in the latter 10 overs to set Sri Lanka a target of 138. They then restricted Sri Lanka to 39/1 after eight overs, produced two run outs and held each Sri Lankan batsman to no more than 33 (posted by captain [[Mahela Jayawardene]]). [[Nuwan Kulasekara]] mustered a brief fightback (26 runs from 16 balls) but holed out to leave the tail end exposed, and Sri Lanka was soon all out 36 runs short. Samuels earned [[Man of the Match]] honors for being the top-scoring batsman on either side while also taking 1\u201315 in his four overs of bowling.\n\nThe win marked the West Indies' first win in an ICC event since the [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|2004 Champions Trophy]] and their third ICC world title \u2013 though it was also their first since the 1979 World Cup, when a team including [[Viv Richards]], [[Michael Holding]] and [[Clive Lloyd]] had won the tournament for the second time in a row. It also meant they became the second team to have won all three ICC global trophies \u2013 the World Cup, the Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20 (India had been the first, completing their set at the [[ICC World T20]] in 2007.)\n{{Limited overs matches\n| date = 7 October\n| time = 19:00\n| daynight = yes\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|WIN}}\n| score1 = 137/6 (20 overs)\n| score2 = 101 (18.4 overs)\n| team2 = {{cr|SRI}}\n| runs1 = [[Marlon Samuels]] 78 (55)\n| wickets1 = [[Ajantha Mendis]] 4/12 (4 overs)\n| runs2 = [[Mahela Jayawardene]] 33 (36)\n| wickets2 = [[Sunil Narine]] 3/9 (3.4 overs)\n| result = West Indies won by 36 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2012/engine/match/533298.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[R.

Captain [[Darren Sammy]] also led a late charge that produced 108 runs in the latter 10 overs to set Sri Lanka a target of 138. They then restricted Sri Lanka to 39/1 after eight overs, produced two run outs and held each Sri Lankan batsman to no more than 33 (posted by captain [[Mahela Jayawardene]]). [[Nuwan Kulasekara]] mustered a brief fightback (26 runs from 16 balls) but holed out to leave the tail end exposed, and Sri Lanka was soon all out 36 runs short. Samuels earned [[Man of the Match]] honors for being the top-scoring batsman on either side while also taking 1\u201315 in his four overs of bowling.\n\nThe win marked the West Indies' first win in an ICC event since the [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|2004 Champions Trophy]] and their third ICC world title \u2013 though it was also their first since the 1979 World Cup, when a team including [[Viv Richards]], [[Michael Holding]] and [[Clive Lloyd]] had won the tournament for the second time in a row. It also meant they became the second team to have won all three ICC global trophies \u2013 the World Cup, the Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20 (India had been the first, completing their set at the [[ICC World T20]] in 2007.)\n{{Limited overs matches\n| date = 7 October\n| time = 19:00\n| daynight = yes\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|WIN}}\n| score1 = 137/6 (20 overs)\n| score2 = 101 (18.4 overs)\n| team2 = {{cr|SRI}}\n| runs1 = [[Marlon Samuels]] 78 (55)\n| wickets1 = [[Ajantha Mendis]] 4/12 (4 overs)\n| runs2 = [[Mahela Jayawardene]] 33 (36)\n| wickets2 = [[Sunil Narine]] 3/9 (3.4 overs)\n| result = West Indies won by 36 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2012/engine/match/533298.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[R.

Vaulting was not included this year. The competitions were held from 21 to 27 July 1924. 17 nations fielded teams: [[Austria at the 1924 Summer Olympics|Austria]], Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, USA, and Yugoslavia, with Germany not being invited. Of those 17 countries, only 5 fielded teams in all 3 disciplines: France, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia. A total of 111 entries and 126 horses competed. Horses in both the jumping and eventing competitions were required to carry at least {{convert|75|kg}}.\n\n==Disciplines==\n===Show jumping===\nThe jumping competition was held over a 1060-meter course with fences up to 1.40 meters and at a speed of 400 m/min. Civilians were allowed to compete, although many teams still had army officers. 34 of the 43 riders finished, but 17 of those had time penalties over the challenging course, which were added at a 1/4 point per second over time. 11 nations competed.\n\n===Dressage===\n9 nations and 24 riders total competed in the dressage competition. Unlike today, the dressage test had a time limit. For the 1924 Games, the 10.5 minute time allowed was too short and the first few riders garnered point deductions for taking too long, while those that went later cut corners and performed the test as quickly as possible. The test was performed in a 60 m x 20 m arena, as it is today, but the 5 judges all sat together on one of the short sides of the area, rather than being spread out at different points. Dressage required the horses to be ridden in a plain snaffle and split bit.\n\n===Eventing===\n44 riders from 13 countries competed in the eventing competition, with only 32 finishing. 8 riders were eliminated during the endurance test, 1 during the jumping test, and 3 did not contest the jumping following endurance day. The dressage test was worth 200 points total for the competition; phases A, C, and E of the endurance test were worth 200 points, steeplechase was worth 500 points, and cross-country 700 points; and the jumping test was worth 400 total points. The endurance test held a new format that would be used for several additional Olympic Games:\n\n* Phase A: Roads and Tracks (7&nbsp;km long in 29 min 10 s)\n* Phase B: Steeplechase (4&nbsp;km at 550 m/min, to be completed in 7 min 2 s)\n* Phase C: Roads and Tracks (15&nbsp;km at 240 m/min, to be completed in 1 h 2 min 30 s)\n* Phase D: Cross Country (8&nbsp;km course of 36 obstacles, with a max height of 1.15 meters and width of 3.5 meters, at 450 m/min, completed in 17 min 46 s)\n* Phase E: Free Gallop (2&nbsp;km gallop at 333 m/min, to be completed in 6 min)\n\n==Medal summary==\n{|

Civilians were allowed to compete, although many teams still had army officers. 34 of the 43 riders finished, but 17 of those had time penalties over the challenging course, which were added at a 1/4 point per second over time. 11 nations competed.\n\n===Dressage===\n9 nations and 24 riders total competed in the dressage competition. Unlike today, the dressage test had a time limit. For the 1924 Games, the 10.5 minute time allowed was too short and the first few riders garnered point deductions for taking too long, while those that went later cut corners and performed the test as quickly as possible. The test was performed in a 60 m x 20 m arena, as it is today, but the 5 judges all sat together on one of the short sides of the area, rather than being spread out at different points. Dressage required the horses to be ridden in a plain snaffle and split bit.\n\n===Eventing===\n44 riders from 13 countries competed in the eventing competition, with only 32 finishing. 8 riders were eliminated during the endurance test, 1 during the jumping test, and 3 did not contest the jumping following endurance day. The dressage test was worth 200 points total for the competition; phases A, C, and E of the endurance test were worth 200 points, steeplechase was worth 500 points, and cross-country 700 points; and the jumping test was worth 400 total points. The endurance test held a new format that would be used for several additional Olympic Games:\n\n* Phase A: Roads and Tracks (7&nbsp;km long in 29 min 10 s)\n* Phase B: Steeplechase (4&nbsp;km at 550 m/min, to be completed in 7 min 2 s)\n* Phase C: Roads and Tracks (15&nbsp;km at 240 m/min, to be completed in 1 h 2 min 30 s)\n* Phase D: Cross Country (8&nbsp;km course of 36 obstacles, with a max height of 1.15 meters and width of 3.5 meters, at 450 m/min, completed in 17 min 46 s)\n* Phase E: Free Gallop (2&nbsp;km gallop at 333 m/min, to be completed in 6 min)\n\n==Medal summary==\n{|

Most recently he was the coach of the [[USC Trojans men's basketball|USC Trojans]] basketball team.\n\nO'Neill was born in [[Malone (village), New York|Malone, New York]] and attended [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.  He lettered in basketball for three years in college, 1976\u201379, and in 1978 the McGill Redman had a school-record 28 win season and entered the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport men's basketball championship]] tournament.  He graduated from McGill in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in education, and later earned his master's degree in secondary education from [[Marycrest College Historic District|Marycrest College]] in 1983, where he also served as head coach of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] basketball team for the 1982\u201383 season.<ref name=McGilluscpress>[https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/mcgill-grad-o%E2%80%99neill-appointed-coach-usc-trojans-107440 McGill grad O\u2019Neill appointed coach of USC Trojans], McGill University, June 21, 2009, accessed April 29, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Malone, New York]], O'Neill grew up in nearby [[Chateaugay (town), New York|Chateaugay]] and graduated from Chateaugay Central School in 1975.\n\n==Early coaching career==\nO'Neill's head coaching career began with tenures at [[North Country Community College]] ([[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]], [[New York (state)|New York]]), [[Marycrest College]] ([[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], [[Iowa]]), [[Marquette University|Marquette]], [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]].  During his tenure as the Northwestern coach O'Neill is most notably remembered for a game with Indiana where the rowdy Northwestern faithful chanted \"Hoosier Daddy\" (a play on \"Who's Your Daddy?\") at opposing coach [[Bob Knight]]. Of course this did not sit well with Knight as he and O'Neill got into it during the contest. However all was settled under a practice gym basket well after the game as ESPN camera crews caught the coaches talking their issues out.  He would eventually become an assistant coach under [[Jeff Van Gundy]] with the [[New York Knicks]]. In 2001, he joined the [[Detroit Pistons]] under head coach [[Rick Carlisle]].\n\n==Marquette Golden Eagles==\nAs the head coach at [[Marquette Golden Eagles|Marquette]], O'Neill led the then-Warriors to two 20+ win seasons, two [[NCAA]] tournament appearances, and a [[Great Midwest Conference]] Championship.  O'Neill played a prominent role in the 1994 Oscar-nominated documentary, ''[[Hoop Dreams]]'.\n\n==Toronto Raptors 2003\u201304==\nThe [[McGill University]] graduate returned to Canada in June 2003 as the head coach of the [[Toronto Raptors]]. His [[Toronto Raptors#2003-04|tenure]] was marked by inconsistency among his players, but the team was 25\u201325 after 50 games and in a position to return to the playoffs. However, injuries to key players resulted in the team going 8\u201324 to finish the season three games out of a playoff spot.  On April 17, 2004, O'Neill was fired in the aftermath of a disappointing [[2003-04 NBA season|2003\u20132004 season]],  after making some remarks which were taken to question the team's commitment to winning.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/us_sport/3634099.stm \"Toronto sack O'Neill], bbc.co.uk, April 17, 2004, accessed April 21, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Indiana Pacers==\nIn the [[2004-05 NBA season|2004\u20132005 season]] he was hired as an assistant coach with the [[Indiana Pacers]] where he rejoined head coach [[Rick Carlisle]].<ref>http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/oct/04/the-grizzlies-defensive-guru-coach-ko/</ref>\n\n==Arizona Wildcats 2007\u201308==\nOn May 1, 2007 it was announced that O'Neill would replace [[Jim Rosborough]] as the assistant coach to [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Lute Olson]] at the [[University of Arizona]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2857199 |title=O'Neill replaces Rosborough on Olson's staff |date=May 1, 2007 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> O'Neill was an assistant under Olson during Arizona's rise to national prominence in the 1980s, and used it as a launching board to attain his first major head coaching position at Marquette.\n\nOn November 4, 2007, Olson announced that he was taking an \"indefinite leave of absence\", and that O'Neill would assume Olson's head coaching duties in his absence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3094359 |title=Olson will take indefinite leave of absence due to personal matter |date=November 4, 2007 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> On December 6 Olson released a statement stating that he would be extending his leave of absence for the remainder of the season.

[[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams.  Most recently he was the coach of the [[USC Trojans men's basketball|USC Trojans]] basketball team.\n\nO'Neill was born in [[Malone (village), New York|Malone, New York]] and attended [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.  He lettered in basketball for three years in college, 1976\u201379, and in 1978 the McGill Redman had a school-record 28 win season and entered the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport men's basketball championship]] tournament.  He graduated from McGill in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in education, and later earned his master's degree in secondary education from [[Marycrest College Historic District|Marycrest College]] in 1983, where he also served as head coach of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] basketball team for the 1982\u201383 season.<ref name=McGilluscpress>[https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/mcgill-grad-o%E2%80%99neill-appointed-coach-usc-trojans-107440 McGill grad O\u2019Neill appointed coach of USC Trojans], McGill University, June 21, 2009, accessed April 29, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Malone, New York]], O'Neill grew up in nearby [[Chateaugay (town), New York|Chateaugay]] and graduated from Chateaugay Central School in 1975.\n\n==Early coaching career==\nO'Neill's head coaching career began with tenures at [[North Country Community College]] ([[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]], [[New York (state)|New York]]), Marycrest College ([[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], [[Iowa]]), [[Marquette University|Marquette]], [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]].  During his tenure as the Northwestern coach O'Neill is most notably remembered for a game with Indiana where the rowdy Northwestern faithful chanted \"Hoosier Daddy\" (a play on \"Who's Your Daddy?\") at opposing coach [[Bob Knight]]. Of course this did not sit well with Knight as he and O'Neill got into it during the contest. However all was settled under a practice gym basket well after the game as ESPN camera crews caught the coaches talking their issues out.  He would eventually become an assistant coach under [[Jeff Van Gundy]] with the [[New York Knicks]]. In 2001, he joined the [[Detroit Pistons]] under head coach [[Rick Carlisle]].\n\n==Marquette Golden Eagles==\nAs the head coach at [[Marquette Golden Eagles|Marquette]], O'Neill led the then-Warriors to two 20+ win seasons, two [[NCAA]] tournament appearances, and a [[Great Midwest Conference]] Championship.  O'Neill played a prominent role in the 1994 Oscar-nominated documentary, ''[[Hoop Dreams]]'.\n\n==Toronto Raptors 2003\u201304==\nThe [[McGill University]] graduate returned to Canada in June 2003 as the head coach of the [[Toronto Raptors]]. His [[Toronto Raptors#2003-04|tenure]] was marked by inconsistency among his players, but the team was 25\u201325 after 50 games and in a position to return to the playoffs. However, injuries to key players resulted in the team going 8\u201324 to finish the season three games out of a playoff spot.  On April 17, 2004, O'Neill was fired in the aftermath of a disappointing [[2003-04 NBA season|2003\u20132004 season]],  after making some remarks which were taken to question the team's commitment to winning.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/us_sport/3634099.stm \"Toronto sack O'Neill], bbc.co.uk, April 17, 2004, accessed April 21, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Indiana Pacers==\nIn the [[2004-05 NBA season|2004\u20132005 season]] he was hired as an assistant coach with the [[Indiana Pacers]] where he rejoined head coach [[Rick Carlisle]].<ref>http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/oct/04/the-grizzlies-defensive-guru-coach-ko/</ref>\n\n==Arizona Wildcats 2007\u201308==\nOn May 1, 2007 it was announced that O'Neill would replace [[Jim Rosborough]] as the assistant coach to [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Lute Olson]] at the [[University of Arizona]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2857199 |title=O'Neill replaces Rosborough on Olson's staff |date=May 1, 2007 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> O'Neill was an assistant under Olson during Arizona's rise to national prominence in the 1980s, and used it as a launching board to attain his first major head coaching position at Marquette.\n\nOn November 4, 2007, Olson announced that he was taking an \"indefinite leave of absence\", and that O'Neill would assume Olson's head coaching duties in his absence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3094359 |title=Olson will take indefinite leave of absence due to personal matter |date=November 4, 2007 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> On December 6 Olson released a statement stating that he would be extending his leave of absence for the remainder of the season.

The team started the season 3\u20136, fueling speculation that it would be O'Neill's last at USC.
