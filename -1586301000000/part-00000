For the [[2014 FIA World Endurance Championship season|2014 season]], he drove Toyota's new car&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Toyota TS040 Hybrid]]. With four wins and seven podiums from the eight races, Buemi became World Endurance Drivers' Champion with teammate [[Anthony Davidson]].<ref name=\"WEC Champions\"/>\n\n===Formula E (2014\u2013present)===\n\nBuemi is currently the most successful driver in the series' history having claimed more wins, poles, fastest laps and points than any other driver in the series.\n\n====Renault e.dams (2014\u20132018)====\n\nBuemi raced in the [[2014\u201315 Formula E season|inaugural Formula E season]] for [[DAMS|e.dams]] alongside Frenchman [[Nicolas Prost]].\n\n====2014\u201315====\n\nBuemi's season did not start off easily with a retirement in [[2014 Beijing ePrix|Beijing]] having started from last on the grid and being unable to set a qualifying time at the following round in [[2014 Putrajaya ePrix|Putrajaya]], he lined up 19th on the grid. Buemi drove a brilliant recovery race having started in 19th and finishing 3rd on the podium ahead of his teammate who started in 11th. At the third round of the season Buemi secured his first race victory in [[2014 Punta del Este ePrix|Punta del Este]]. Buemi started on pole at the following round in [[2015 Buenos Aires ePrix|Buenos Aires]] for the first time in his career but crashed out of the race after leading. Buemi went on to win in [[2015 Monaco ePrix|Monaco]] and the [[2015 London ePrix|first London race]], both from pole position, whereas he finished second in [[2015 Berlin ePrix|Berlin]].  Buemi finished the season second in the championship, one point short of Nelson Piquet Jr.'s tally.\n\n====2015\u201316====\n[[File:2015 Punta del Este ePrix - Race - 19.JPG|thumbnail|right|Buemi at the [[2015 Punta del Este ePrix]]]]\nIn season two, Buemi dominated the early stages of the championship.  In the season opening round in [[2015 Beijing ePrix|Beijing]] Buemi secured pole, fastest lap and the race win.  The story was looking much the same in the following round in [[2015 Putrajaya ePrix|Putrajaya]] before Buemi's car experienced mechanical failure while leading the race.  Having made a mistake in qualifying in [[2015 Punta del Este ePrix|Punta del Este]], Buemi lined up fifth on the grid, but went on to claim his third fastest lap in three races and another race victory. Next he finished second in [[2016 Buenos Aires ePrix|Buenos Aires]] and [[2016 Mexico City ePrix|Mexico]].\n\nAfter a third-place finish at Paris, Buemi scored his third win of the season at [[2016 Berlin ePrix|Berlin]], setting up a nail bitting finale in [[2016 London ePrix|London]]. With Buemi needing to finish ahead of rival [[Lucas di Grassi]] to win the championship in the second race of the weekend, he was hit off by no other than Di Grassi himself at the first corner. Therefore, the title was to be headed to whoever could get the fastest lap bonus points in their second car. Despite the immense pressure, Buemi cruised to the fastest lap to become Formula E champion 2015-16.\n\n====2016\u201317====\n\nSeason three started exceptionally well for Buemi, as he won the first three rounds of the [[2016-17 Formula E season|championship]], becoming the first Formula E driver to achieve the feat of three consecutive wins. Buemi would go on to take three more wins at [[2017 Monaco ePrix|Monaco]],<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Sebastien Buemi wins intense Formula E Monaco ePrix|url=http://autoweek.com/article/other-motorsports/sebastien-buemi-wins-intense-formula-e-monaco-eprix|magazine=[[Autoweek]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications|Crain Communications, Inc.]]|date=13 May 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> [[2017 Paris ePrix|Paris]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Another win for Buemi in Paris Formula E race|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-electric-france-idUSKCN18G0V1|work=[[Reuters|Reuters.com]]|date=20 May 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> and [[2017 Berlin ePrix|Berlin]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title=S\u00e9bastien Buemi wins Formula E race in Berlin|url=http://autoweek.com/article/other-motorsports/sebastien-buemi-wins-formula-e-race-berlin-0|magazine=[[Autoweek]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications|Crain Communications, Inc.]]|date=11 June 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> before the final 4 races in [[2017 New York ePrix|New York City]] and [[2017 Montreal ePrix|Montreal]], both double headers.\n\nHowever, Buemi skipped the New York event due to his [[2017 FIA World Endurance Championship season|WEC]] commitments with Toyota and participated in the [[2017 6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring|6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring]] instead, with [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] F1 test and reserve driver [[Pierre Gasly]] taking his place.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Gasly favourite to replace Buemi for New York ePrix|url=https://www.motorsport.com/formula-e/news/gasly-favourite-to-replace-buemi-for-new-york-eprix-921249/|magazine=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport.com|Motorsport Network]]|date=23 June 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> In addition, he was disqualified from two races for technical infringements. Ultimately, this loss of points led to Buemi missing out on the championship as rival [[Lucas di Grassi]] took the title at the final race.\n\n====2017\u201318====\n\nBuemi endured a tough start to the season, taking only one point from the opening double-header at [[2017 Hong Kong ePrix|Hong Kong]], having been involved in some incidents, including with previous seasons' title rival Lucas di Grassi. Buemi hit back with pole position at [[2018 Marrakesh ePrix|Marrakesh]]. He led the race throughout, until 4 laps from the end, he was passed by the Mahindra of [[Felix Rosenqvist]]. He achieved two podium finishes at the next two races, to leave him in 4th place in the standings. However, he crashed out of the following race in [[2018 Punta del Este ePrix|Punta del Este]]. His Renault e.dams, however, proved not to be as competitive as previous seasons, and while consistently scoring in the points, he did not achieve a race win or podium for the next 4 races. In the final ePrix of the season, a double-header at [[2018 New York City ePrix|New York]], Buemi qualified on pole in both rounds, with the final round being achieved in the first wet qualifying session in Formula E history. However, he would slip behind faster cars in the races to 3rd and 4th respectively. This meant he finished the season in 4th place, his lowest position in the standings since Formula E began, with 125 points. Renault e.dams finished the season 5th in the standings, the first time they had not won the Teams' Championship, with Buemi scoring 125 out of the team's 133 points.\n\n====Nissan e.dams (2018\u2013present)====\n\nIt was announced that the [[DAMS]] would switch from Renault to Nissan from the [[2018-19 Formula E season|2018-19]] season. Buemi was initially meant to partner [[Alexander Albon]], who raced for the DAMS Formula 2 team, but he was released by DAMS to join Buemi's former team, [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] to race in F1 in [[2019 Formula One World Championship|2019]]. Albon was replaced by [[Oliver Rowland]], who had previously raced for DAMS in Formula 2 in 2017.\n\n====2018\u201319====\n\nBuemi started the season with 3rd place on the grid, but slipped to 6th by the end of the race. At the next round in [[2019 Marrakesh ePrix|Marrakesh]], Buemi again started 3rd on the grid, but had to avoid the spinning Techeetah of [[Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne]] and fell down the order. However, by the end of the race, he recovered to 8th place. At the next race, in [[2019 Santiago ePrix|Santiago]], he inherited pole position when Lucas di Grassi was disqualified for a technical infringement. However, he crashed out of lead towards the end of the race due to a brake failure. Buemi's misfortune continued, when at the next race, both he and his teammate Rowland ran out of energy a lap before the end of the race, running in 4th and 3rd respectively, after Nissan had miscalculated the number of laps remaining. This was followed by a suspension failure causing him to retire from the following round. At the next round he crashed during his superpole run and therefore qualified 6th, but he was later disqualified for a technical infringement and had to start from the pit lane. By the last lap, he had made his way up to 8th place, but while attempting to overtake [[Robin Frijns]], Buemi ploughed into the back of him, causing Frijns to take out di Grassi, moving Buemi up to 6th, while di Grassi retired on the spot, and Frijns limped back home in 14th. Buemi was given a 10-second time penalty for causing the collision and was classified 8th, the position he was in before the crash. He also had trouble in [[2019 Rome ePrix|Rome]] and [[2019 Paris ePrix|Paris]]. However, after taking pole for the [[2019 Berlin ePrix|Berlin ePrix]], his results improved. He finished second, after di Grassi overtook him and won the race. In [[2019 Swiss ePrix|Bern]], and in Race 2 in [[2019 New York City ePrix|New York]], he finished third. His first victory of the season came in Race 1 in [[2019 New York City ePrix|New York]], after taking pole position. He was under attack from [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]] driver [[Alex Lynn]]. However, the Brit retired due to a loss of power. After that, Buemi held a comfortable margin to win the race over Lynn\u2019s teammate, [[Mitch Evans]], who had an incredible comeback from 13th position on the grid. By the end of the season, Buemi had overtaken 11 drivers, including title contenders Evans and di Grassi, to climb from 13th to 2nd in the championship.\n\n==Personal life==\nAs of 2009 Buemi was officially resident in [[Bahrain]], living with his family and his girlfriend Jennifer.<ref>[http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/other/f1-sebastien-buemi-to-stay-in-tax-free-bahrain?artid=104353 \"S\u00e9bastien Buemi to stay in tax-free Bahrain\"] Auto123.com 2009-01-16.

For the [[2014 FIA World Endurance Championship season|2014 season]], he drove Toyota's new car&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Toyota TS040 Hybrid]].

Buemi drove a brilliant recovery race having started in 19th and finishing 3rd on the podium ahead of his teammate who started in 11th. At the third round of the season Buemi secured his first race victory in [[2014 Punta del Este ePrix|Punta del Este]]. Buemi started on pole at the following round in [[2015 Buenos Aires ePrix|Buenos Aires]] for the first time in his career but crashed out of the race after leading. Buemi went on to win in [[2015 Monaco ePrix|Monaco]] and the [[2015 London ePrix|first London race]], both from pole position, whereas he finished second in [[2015 Berlin ePrix|Berlin]].

In the season opening round in [[2015 Beijing ePrix|Beijing]] Buemi secured pole, fastest lap and the race win.  The story was looking much the same in the following round in [[2015 Putrajaya ePrix|Putrajaya]] before Buemi's car experienced mechanical failure while leading the race.  Having made a mistake in qualifying in [[2015 Punta del Este ePrix|Punta del Este]], Buemi lined up fifth on the grid, but went on to claim his third fastest lap in three races and another race victory. Next he finished second in [[2016 Buenos Aires ePrix|Buenos Aires]] and [[2016 Mexico City ePrix|Mexico]].\n\nAfter a third-place finish at Paris, Buemi scored his third win of the season at [[2016 Berlin ePrix|Berlin]], setting up a nail bitting finale in [[2016 London ePrix|London]]. With Buemi needing to finish ahead of rival [[Lucas di Grassi]] to win the championship in the second race of the weekend, he was hit off by no other than Di Grassi himself at the first corner. Therefore, the title was to be headed to whoever could get the fastest lap bonus points in their second car. Despite the immense pressure, Buemi cruised to the fastest lap to become Formula E champion 2015-16.\n\n====2016\u201317====\n\nSeason three started exceptionally well for Buemi, as he won the first three rounds of the [[2016-17 Formula E season|championship]], becoming the first Formula E driver to achieve the feat of three consecutive wins. Buemi would go on to take three more wins at [[2017 Monaco ePrix|Monaco]],<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Sebastien Buemi wins intense Formula E Monaco ePrix|url=http://autoweek.com/article/other-motorsports/sebastien-buemi-wins-intense-formula-e-monaco-eprix|magazine=[[Autoweek]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications|Crain Communications, Inc.]]|date=13 May 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> [[2017 Paris ePrix|Paris]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Another win for Buemi in Paris Formula E race|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-electric-france-idUSKCN18G0V1|work=[[Reuters|Reuters.com]]|date=20 May 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> and [[2017 Berlin ePrix|Berlin]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title=S\u00e9bastien Buemi wins Formula E race in Berlin|url=http://autoweek.com/article/other-motorsports/sebastien-buemi-wins-formula-e-race-berlin-0|magazine=[[Autoweek]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications|Crain Communications, Inc.]]|date=11 June 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> before the final 4 races in [[2017 New York ePrix|New York City]] and [[2017 Montreal ePrix|Montreal]], both double headers.\n\nHowever, Buemi skipped the New York event due to his [[2017 FIA World Endurance Championship season|WEC]] commitments with Toyota and participated in the [[2017 6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring|6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring]] instead, with [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] F1 test and reserve driver [[Pierre Gasly]] taking his place.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Gasly favourite to replace Buemi for New York ePrix|url=https://www.motorsport.com/formula-e/news/gasly-favourite-to-replace-buemi-for-new-york-eprix-921249/|magazine=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport.com|Motorsport Network]]|date=23 June 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> In addition, he was disqualified from two races for technical infringements. Ultimately, this loss of points led to Buemi missing out on the championship as rival [[Lucas di Grassi]] took the title at the final race.\n\n====2017\u201318====\n\nBuemi endured a tough start to the season, taking only one point from the opening double-header at [[2017 Hong Kong ePrix|Hong Kong]], having been involved in some incidents, including with previous seasons' title rival Lucas di Grassi. Buemi hit back with pole position at [[2018 Marrakesh ePrix|Marrakesh]]. He led the race throughout, until 4 laps from the end, he was passed by the Mahindra of [[Felix Rosenqvist]]. He achieved two podium finishes at the next two races, to leave him in 4th place in the standings. However, he crashed out of the following race in [[2018 Punta del Este ePrix|Punta del Este]]. His Renault e.dams, however, proved not to be as competitive as previous seasons, and while consistently scoring in the points, he did not achieve a race win or podium for the next 4 races. In the final ePrix of the season, a double-header at [[2018 New York City ePrix|New York]], Buemi qualified on pole in both rounds, with the final round being achieved in the first wet qualifying session in Formula E history. However, he would slip behind faster cars in the races to 3rd and 4th respectively. This meant he finished the season in 4th place, his lowest position in the standings since Formula E began, with 125 points. Renault e.dams finished the season 5th in the standings, the first time they had not won the Teams' Championship, with Buemi scoring 125 out of the team's 133 points.\n\n====Nissan e.dams (2018\u2013present)====\n\nIt was announced that the [[DAMS]] would switch from Renault to Nissan from the [[2018-19 Formula E season|2018-19]] season. Buemi was initially meant to partner [[Alexander Albon]], who raced for the DAMS Formula 2 team, but he was released by DAMS to join Buemi's former team, [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] to race in F1 in [[2019 Formula One World Championship|2019]]. Albon was replaced by [[Oliver Rowland]], who had previously raced for DAMS in Formula 2 in 2017.\n\n====2018\u201319====\n\nBuemi started the season with 3rd place on the grid, but slipped to 6th by the end of the race. At the next round in [[2019 Marrakesh ePrix|Marrakesh]], Buemi again started 3rd on the grid, but had to avoid the spinning Techeetah of [[Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne]] and fell down the order. However, by the end of the race, he recovered to 8th place. At the next race, in [[2019 Santiago ePrix|Santiago]], he inherited pole position when Lucas di Grassi was disqualified for a technical infringement. However, he crashed out of lead towards the end of the race due to a brake failure. Buemi's misfortune continued, when at the next race, both he and his teammate Rowland ran out of energy a lap before the end of the race, running in 4th and 3rd respectively, after Nissan had miscalculated the number of laps remaining. This was followed by a suspension failure causing him to retire from the following round. At the next round he crashed during his superpole run and therefore qualified 6th, but he was later disqualified for a technical infringement and had to start from the pit lane. By the last lap, he had made his way up to 8th place, but while attempting to overtake [[Robin Frijns]], Buemi ploughed into the back of him, causing Frijns to take out di Grassi, moving Buemi up to 6th, while di Grassi retired on the spot, and Frijns limped back home in 14th. Buemi was given a 10-second time penalty for causing the collision and was classified 8th, the position he was in before the crash. He also had trouble in [[2019 Rome ePrix|Rome]] and [[2019 Paris ePrix|Paris]]. However, after taking pole for the [[2019 Berlin ePrix|Berlin ePrix]], his results improved. He finished second, after di Grassi overtook him and won the race. In [[2019 Swiss ePrix|Bern]], and in Race 2 in [[2019 New York City ePrix|New York]], he finished third. His first victory of the season came in Race 1 in [[2019 New York City ePrix|New York]], after taking pole position. He was under attack from [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]] driver [[Alex Lynn]]. However, the Brit retired due to a loss of power. After that, Buemi held a comfortable margin to win the race over Lynn\u2019s teammate, [[Mitch Evans]], who had an incredible comeback from 13th position on the grid. By the end of the season, Buemi had overtaken 11 drivers, including title contenders Evans and di Grassi, to climb from 13th to 2nd in the championship.\n\n==Personal life==\nAs of 2009 Buemi was officially resident in [[Bahrain]], living with his family and his girlfriend Jennifer.<ref>[http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/other/f1-sebastien-buemi-to-stay-in-tax-free-bahrain?artid=104353 \"S\u00e9bastien Buemi to stay in tax-free Bahrain\"] Auto123.com 2009-01-16.

In February 2016, Buemi became a father with the birth of his son Jules. He welcomed the birth of his second son Theo in January 2018.\n\nIn 2013, Buemi and [[Johnny Herbert]] mentored 6 contestants in a primetime [[ITV4]] [[reality series]], with the aim of taking players of the ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' videogames to the [[Dubai 24 Hour]] race as real drivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touchline.tv/gaming/gran-turismo-academy-series-confirmed-for-itv4 |title=Gran Turismo Academy series confirmed for ITV4 |website=www.touchline.tv |date=January 10, 2013 |access-date=November 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213154336/http://www.touchline.tv/gaming/gran-turismo-academy-series-confirmed-for-itv4 |archive-date=February 13, 2013 }}</ref> Other countries in Europe had heats mentored by [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eu.gran-turismo.com/ie/news/d50120.html |title=GT Academy 2012 European Race Camp Gets Underway |date=August 17, 2012 |website=eu.gran-turismo.com |access-date=November 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307021222/http://eu.gran-turismo.com/ie/news/d50120.html |archive-date=March 7, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\"\n!

He is best remembered for forging the [[Bradshaw Trail]] from [[San Bernardino, California]] to [[La Paz, Arizona|La Paz]], in the [[New Mexico Territory]], in 1862<ref>La Paz became part of the [[Arizona Territory]] in 1863, and later the state of [[Arizona]].</ref>.  Initially this gave the populated areas of California's west coast a more direct route to the [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|Colorado River Gold Rush]] fields, but more importantly the trail opened up the [[Southern California]] [[Colorado Desert]] region, and beyond, to settlement and development.<ref>Johnston, pp 7-8.</ref>  \n\nAs part of the trail, and in partnership with William Warringer, on June 16, 1862, Bradshaw set up a ferry service to cross the Colorado River.  The ferry transported travelers across the river from a location called Providence Point in California, to La Paz in the New Mexico territory.<ref>Gunther, pp 407.</ref>\n\nBradshaw died in La Paz on December 2, 1864, after his throat was slashed with a [[drawknife]].<ref name=\"Block1\" />  Newspaper reports at the time stated Bradshaw had committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Private Letters from Arizona ... |agency=Petaluma Journal and Argus |volume=X |issue= 46 |page= 1 |publisher=McNabb & Cassidy |date=December 29, 1864}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=From Prescott Courier |agency=Holbrook Argus, Holbrook Arizona |volume= 1|issue= 5 |page= 4 |date=January 9, 1896}}</ref>  Given the nature of his death, and no witnesses, historians, such as Francis J.

cases===\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\n\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%. A CDC study released 28 January 2013, estimated that the Pandemic H1N1 vaccine saved roughly 300 lives and prevented about 1 million illnesses in the US. The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion.

Between 123,000 and 203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths were estimated globally for the last 9 months of 2009. The majority (62\u201385%) were attributed to persons under 65 years of age. The burden varied greatly among countries. There was an almost 20-fold higher mortality in some countries in the Americas than in Europe. The model attributed 148,000\u2013249,000 respiratory deaths to influenza in an average pre-pandemic season, with only 19% in persons <65 years of age.<ref name=\"mortality estimate worldwide\">{{cite journal |last=Simonsen |first=Lone |last2=Spreeuwenberg |first2=Peter |last3=Lustig |first3=Roger |last4=Taylor |first4=Robert J. |last5=Fleming |first5=Douglas M. |last6=Kroneman |first6=Madelon |last7=Van Kerkhove |first7=Maria D. |last8=Mounts |first8=Anthony W. |last9=Paget |first9=W.

While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\n\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%.

The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion.

Between 123,000 and 203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths were estimated globally for the last 9 months of 2009. The majority (62\u201385%) were attributed to persons under 65 years of age. The burden varied greatly among countries. There was an almost 20-fold higher mortality in some countries in the Americas than in Europe.

His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the [[Dutch Golden Age]], when [[:Category:Art of the Dutch Golden Age|Dutch art]] (especially [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch painting]]), although in many ways antithetical to the [[Baroque|Baroque style]] that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative and gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as [[Jan Vermeer]] of Delft, Rembrandt was also an avid [[art collector]] and [[art dealer|dealer]].\n\nRembrandt never went abroad, but he was considerably influenced by the work of the [[Italian masters]] and [[Netherlandish art]]ists who had studied in Italy, like [[Pieter Lastman]], the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], and [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high,<ref>Gombrich, p. 427.</ref> and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters.<ref name=Clark_203>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203}}</ref>\n\nRembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. [[Self-portraits by Rembrandt|His self-portraits]] form a unique and intimate biography, in which the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity.<ref name=\"Gombrich, p. 420\"/> Rembrandt's foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive technique into a true [[art form]], along with [[Jacques Callot]]. His reputation as the greatest [[etcher]] in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime and never questioned since. Few of [[List of paintings by Rembrandt|his paintings]] left the [[Dutch Republic]] while he lived, but his [[old master prints|prints]] were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.\n\nIn his works he exhibited knowledge of classical [[iconography]], which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt's knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Jewish Amsterdam|Jewish population]].<ref name=Clark_203_204>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203\u2013204}}</ref> Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called \"one of the great prophets of civilization\".<ref name=Clark_205>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=205}}</ref> The French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] said, \"Compare me with Rembrandt!

Until then, he had signed with a combination of initials or monograms. In late 1632, he began signing solely with his first name, \"Rembrant\". He added the \"d\" in the following year and stuck to this spelling for the rest of his life. Although we can only speculate, this change must have had a meaning for Rembrandt, which is generally interpreted as his wanting to be known by his first name like the great figures of the Italian Renaissance: Leonardo, Raphael etc., who did not sign with their first names, if at all.

She would later charge Rembrandt with [[breach of promise]] (a euphemism for seduction under [breached] promise to marry) and was awarded alimony of 200 guilders a year.<ref name=Bull-28/> Rembrandt worked to have her committed to an asylum or poorhouse (called a \"bridewell\") at [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], after learning she had pawned jewelry he had given her that once belonged to Saskia.<ref>Driessen, pp. 151\u201357</ref>\n\nIn the late 1640s Rembrandt began a relationship with the much younger [[Hendrickje Stoffels]], who had initially been his maid. In 1654 they had a daughter, Cornelia, bringing Hendrickje a summons from the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed Church]] to answer the charge \"that she had committed the acts of a whore with Rembrandt the painter\". She admitted this and was banned from receiving communion. Rembrandt was not summoned to appear for the Church council because he was not a member of the Reformed Church.<ref>Slive, p. 82</ref> The two were considered legally wed under common law, but Rembrandt had not married Hendrickje. Had he remarried he would have lost access to a trust set up for Titus in Saskia's will.<ref name=Slive-71/>\n\nRembrandt lived beyond his means, buying art (including bidding up his own work), prints (often used in his paintings) and rarities, which probably caused a court arrangement to avoid his bankruptcy in 1656, by selling most of his paintings and large collection of antiquities. The sale list survives and gives us a good insight into Rembrandt's collections, which, apart from [[Old Master]] paintings and drawings, included busts of the Roman Emperors, suits of Japanese armor among many objects from Asia, and collections of natural history and minerals.  But the prices realized in the sales in 1657 and 1658 were disappointing.<ref>Slive, p. 84</ref> Rembrandt was forced to sell his house and his printing-press and move to more modest accommodation on the [[Rozengracht]] in 1660.<ref>Schwartz, p. 12. The house sale was in 1658, but was agreed with two years for Rembrandt to vacate.</ref> The authorities and his creditors were generally accommodating to him, except for the Amsterdam [[painters' guild]], which introduced a new rule that no one in Rembrandt's circumstances could trade as a painter. To get around this, Hendrickje and Titus set up a [[dummy corporation]] as art dealers in 1660, with Rembrandt as an employee.<ref>Clark, 1974 p. 105</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Memorial Marker Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Rembrandt Memorial Marker Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\n\nIn 1661 Rembrandt (or rather the new business) was contracted to complete work for the newly built city hall, but only after Govert Flinck, the artist previously commissioned, died without beginning to paint.

The word \"beweegelijkheid\" is also argued to mean \"emotion\" or \"motive\".

His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man, through the dapper and very successful portrait-painter of the 1630s, to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his old age. Together they give a remarkably clear picture of the man, his appearance and his psychological make-up, as revealed by his richly weathered face.<ref>While the popular interpretation is that these paintings represent a personal and introspective journey, it is possible that they were painted to satisfy a market for self-portraits by prominent artists.

A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, thrusting into the riddle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer's attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light\u2014an overwhelming clarity\u2014and a brooding duskiness.<ref>Taylor, Michael (2007).[http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html Rembrandt's Nose: Of Flesh & Spirit in the Master's Portraits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505200753/http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html |date=5 May 2016 }} p. 21, D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers, Inc., New York {{ISBN|978-1-933045-44-3}}'</ref>\n\nIn a number of biblical works, including ''The Raising of the Cross'', ''Joseph Telling His Dreams'' and ''[[The Stoning of Saint Stephen]]'', Rembrandt painted himself as a character in the crowd. Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt \"a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life\".<ref>Durham, p. 60.</ref>\n\nAmong the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt's work are his use of [[chiaroscuro]], the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from [[Caravaggio]], or, more likely, from the Dutch [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]], but adapted for very personal means.<ref>Bull, et al., pp. 11\u201313.</ref> Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age. His immediate family\u2014his wife Saskia, his son Titus and his common-law wife Hendrickje\u2014often figured prominently in his paintings, many of which had biblical or historical themes.\n\nDrawings by Rembrandt and his pupils have been extensively studied by many artists and scholars<ref>Such as [[Otto Benesch]], [[David Hockney]], [[Nigel Konstam]], [[Jakob Rosenberg (art historian)|Jakob Rosenberg]], [[Gary Schwartz (art historian)|Gary Schwartz]].</ref> through the centuries. His original draughtsmanship has been described as an individualistic art style that was very similar to East Asian old masters, most notably Chinese masters:<ref>Mendelowitz, Daniel Marcus: ''Drawing''. (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, Inc., 1967), p. 305. As Mendelowitz (1967) noted: \"Probably no one has combined to as great a degree as Rembrandt a disciplined exposition of what his eye saw and a love of line as a beautiful thing in itself. His \"Winter Landscape\" displays the virtuosity of performance of an Oriental master, yet unlike the Oriental calligraphy, it is not based on an established convention of brush performance. It is as personal as handwriting.\"</ref> a \"combination of formal clarity and [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] vitality in the movement of pen or brush that is closer to [[Chinese painting]] in technique and feeling than to anything in European art before the twentieth century\".<ref>Sullivan, Michael: ''The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art''. (University of California Press, 1989), p. 91</ref>\n\n===Periods, themes and styles===\nThroughout his career Rembrandt took as his primary subjects the themes of portraiture, landscape and narrative painting. For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - The Abduction of Europa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Abduction of Europa (Rembrandt)|''The Abduction of Europa'']], 1632. Oil on panel. The work has been described as  \"...a shining example of the 'golden age' of [[Baroque]] painting\".<ref>Clough, p. 23</ref>]]\n\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt's skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIt was during Rembrandt's Leiden period (1625\u20131631) that Lastman's influence was most prominent. It is also likely that at this time Lievens had a strong impact on his work as well.<ref name=Wetering-284>van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small, but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry). Religious and [[allegory|allegorical]] themes were favored, as were [[tronie]]s.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1626 Rembrandt produced his first etchings, the wide dissemination of which would largely account for his international fame.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1629 he completed ''[[Judas Repentant, Returning the Pieces of Silver]]'' and ''[[Artist in his studio|The Artist in His Studio]]'', works that evidence his interest in the handling of light and variety of paint application, and constitute the first major progress in his development as a painter.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt, Portret van Haesje v.Cleyburg 1634.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical portrait from 1634, when Rembrandt was enjoying great commercial success]]\n\nDuring his early years in Amsterdam (1632\u20131636), Rembrandt began to paint dramatic biblical and mythological scenes in high contrast and of large format (''[[The Blinding of Samson]]'', 1636, ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Rembrandt)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', c.&nbsp;1635 ''[[Dana\u00eb (Rembrandt)|Dana\u00eb]]'', 1636 but reworked later), seeking to emulate the baroque style of [[Rubens]].<ref>van de Wetering, p. 287.</ref> With the occasional help of assistants in Uylenburgh's workshop, he painted numerous portrait commissions both small ([[Jacob de Gheyn III (painting)|''Jacob de Gheyn&nbsp;III'']]) and large (''Portrait of the Shipbuilder Jan Rijcksen and his Wife'', 1633, ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', 1632).<ref>van de Wetering, p. 286.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1630s Rembrandt had produced a few paintings and many etchings of [[landscape painting|landscapes]]. Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (''Cottages before a Stormy Sky'', c.&nbsp;1641; ''The Three Trees'', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted ''[[The Night Watch]]'', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt - Zelfportret - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Self Portrait'', 1658, [[Frick Collection]], a masterpiece of the final style, \"the calmest and grandest of all his portraits\"<ref>Clark 1978, p. 28</ref>]]\n\nIn the decade following the ''Night Watch'', Rembrandt's paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (''Susanna and the Elders'', 1637\u201347).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163\u201365.</ref>\nAt the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\n\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt's style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of 'finish' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt's brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155\u201365.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting's surface. The end result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 157\u201358, 190.</ref>\n\nIn later years biblical themes were still depicted often, but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (''James the Apostle'', 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (''[[The Jewish Bride]]'', c.&nbsp;1666)\u2014in love, in life, and before God.<ref>\"In Rembrandt's (late) great portraits we feel face to face with real people, we sense their warmth, their need for sympathy and also their loneliness and suffering. Those keen and steady eyes that we know so well from Rembrandt's self-portraits must have been able to look straight into the human heart.\" Gombrich, p. 423.</ref><ref>\"It (''The Jewish Bride'') is a picture of grown-up love, a marvelous amalgam of richness, tenderness, and trust... the heads which, in their truth, have a spiritual glow that painters influenced by the classical tradition could never achieve.\" Clark, p. 206.</ref>\n\n===Etchings===\n[[File:Rembrandt - The windmill - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Windmill'', 1641, [[etching]]]]\n\nRembrandt produced [[etching]]s for most of his career, from 1626 to 1660, when he was forced to sell his printing-press and practically abandoned etching. Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<ref>Schwartz, 1994, pp. 8\u201312</ref> He took easily to etching and, though he also learned to use a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and partly [[engraving|engraved]] many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing, but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5\u20136</ref> He worked on the so-called ''[[Hundred Guilder Print]]'' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9\u201310</ref>\n\n[[File:Die landschaft mit den drei baeumen.jpg|thumb|left|''The Three Trees'', 1643, etching]]\n\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"plate tone,\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the twenty-seven self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. There are forty-six landscapes, mostly small, which largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints. A few erotic, or just obscene, compositions have no equivalent in his paintings.<ref>See Schwartz, 1994, where the works are divided by subject, following [[Adam Bartsch|Bartsch]].</ref> He owned, until forced to sell it, a magnificent collection of prints by other artists, and many borrowings and influences in his work can be traced to artists as diverse as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Hercules Seghers]], and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].\n\n===''The Night Watch''===\n{{main|The Night Watch}}\n[[File:La ronda de noche, por Rembrandt van Rijn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Night Watch]]'' or ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'', 1642. Oil on canvas; on display at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]\n\nRembrandt painted the large painting ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' between 1640 and 1642. This picture was called ''De Nachtwacht'' by the Dutch and ''The Night Watch'' by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] because by the 18th century the picture was so dimmed and defaced that it was almost indistinguishable, and it looked quite like a night scene. After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day\u2014a party of [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight.\n\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the ''[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]'', the musketeer branch of the civic militia. Rembrandt departed from convention, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal, rather a line-up than an action scene. Instead he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission (what kind of mission, an ordinary patrol or some special event, is a matter of debate).\n\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Amsterdam town hall]] in 1715; the Rijksmuseum has a smaller copy of what is thought to be the full original composition; the four figures in the front are at the centre of the canvas. The painting is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]].\n\n===Indian Miniatures===\n[[File:Rembrandt 208.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Rembrandt drawing of an Indian Mughal painting]]\nRembrandt was interested in [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniatures]], especially around the 1650s. He drew versions of some 23 Mughal paintings, and may have owned an album of them. These miniatures include paintings of [[Shah Jahan]], [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Dara Shikoh]].

Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future|url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\n\nOne example of activity is ''[[The Polish Rider]]'', in New York's [[Frick Collection]]. Rembrandt's authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century, but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt's closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn's remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost's authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick, with [[Simon Schama]] (in his 1999 book ''Rembrandt's Eyes'') and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both arguing for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt's authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the 'Lisowczyk' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., ''Artibus et Historiae'', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197\u2013205.

For example, the exact subject being portrayed in ''[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]'' (recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum) has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). ''Rembrandt's Eyes''. Knopf, p. 720.</ref> Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]] who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.<ref>Schama, pp 582\u2013591.</ref>\n\nAnother painting, ''Pilate Washing His Hands'', is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master's command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |publisher=Outpost Art |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing. In 2005 four oil paintings previously attributed to Rembrandt's students were reclassified as the work of Rembrandt himself: ''Study of an Old Man in Profile'' and ''Study of an Old Man with a Beard'' from a US private collection, ''[[Study of a Weeping Woman]]'', owned by the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], and ''Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet'', painted in 1640.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4276034.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Lost Rembrandt works discovered |publisher=BBC News  |date=23 September 2005 |accessdate=7 October 2009}}</ref> The ''Old Man Sitting in a Chair'' is a further example: in 2014, Professor [[Ernst van de Wetering]] offered his view to ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the demotion of the 1652 painting ''Old Man Sitting in a Chair'' \"was a vast mistake...it is a most important painting.

Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate. Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt's own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments.<ref>\"...Rembrandt was not always the perfectly consistent, logical Dutchman he was originally anticipated to be.\" Ackley, p. 13.</ref> As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.<ref>van de Wetering, p. x.</ref> It is highly likely that there will never be universal agreement as to what does and what does not constitute a genuine Rembrandt.\n\n==Painting materials==\n[[File:Rembrandt - Saskia van Uylenburgh in Arcadian Costume - WGA19164.jpg|thumb|''Saskia as Flora'', 1635]]\n\nTechnical investigation of Rembrandt's paintings in the possession of the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister]]<ref>K\u00fchn, Hermann. \u2018Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgr\u00fcnden Rembrandts, durchgef\u00fchrt an den Gem\u00e4lden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden\u2019(Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden), Maltechnik/Restauro, issue 4 (1977): 223\u2013233</ref> and in the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]<ref>K\u00fchn, Hermann. \u2018Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgr\u00fcnden Rembrandts, durchgef\u00fchrt an den Gem\u00e4lden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel\u2019 (Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel), Maltechnik/Restauro, volume 82 (1976): 25\u201333</ref> has been conducted by Hermann K\u00fchn in 1977.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\", but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\". In 1633 he added&nbsp;a&nbsp;\"d\", and maintained this form consistently from then on, proving that this minor change had a meaning for him (whatever it might have been). This change is purely visual; it does not change the way his name is pronounced. Curiously enough, despite the large number of paintings and etchings signed with this modified first name, most of the documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original \"Rembrant\" spelling. (Note: the rough chronology of signature forms above applies to the paintings, and to a lesser degree to the etchings; from 1632, presumably, there is only one etching signed \"RHL-v.

The great shadow of the old master required a decided attitude. A late Romantic painter and critic, like [[Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin|Fromentin]] was, if he happened not to like some of Rembrandt's pictures, he felt obliged to justify his feeling. The greatness of the dramatic old master was for artists of about 1875 not a matter for doubt. 'Either I am wrong', Fromentin wrote from Holland 'or everybody else is wrong'. When Fromentin realized his inability to like some of the works by Rembrandt he formulated the following comments: 'I even do not dare to write down such a blasphemy; I would get ridiculed if this is disclosed'. Only about twenty-five years earlier another French Romantic master [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], when expressing his admiration for Rembrandt, has written in his ''Journal'' a very different statement: '... perhaps one day we will discover that Rembrandt is a much greater painter than [[Raphael]]. It is a blasphemy which would make hair raise on the heads of all the academic painters'. In 1851 the blasphemy was to put Rembrandt above Raphael. In 1875 the blasphemy was not to admire everything Rembrandt had ever produced.

His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the [[Dutch Golden Age]], when [[:Category:Art of the Dutch Golden Age|Dutch art]] (especially [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch painting]]), although in many ways antithetical to the [[Baroque|Baroque style]] that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative and gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as [[Jan Vermeer]] of Delft, Rembrandt was also an avid [[art collector]] and [[art dealer|dealer]].\n\nRembrandt never went abroad, but he was considerably influenced by the work of the [[Italian masters]] and [[Netherlandish art]]ists who had studied in Italy, like [[Pieter Lastman]], the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], and [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high,<ref>Gombrich, p. 427.</ref> and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters.<ref name=Clark_203>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203}}</ref>\n\nRembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. [[Self-portraits by Rembrandt|His self-portraits]] form a unique and intimate biography, in which the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity.<ref name=\"Gombrich, p. 420\"/> Rembrandt's foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive technique into a true [[art form]], along with [[Jacques Callot]]. His reputation as the greatest [[etcher]] in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime and never questioned since. Few of [[List of paintings by Rembrandt|his paintings]] left the [[Dutch Republic]] while he lived, but his [[old master prints|prints]] were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.\n\nIn his works he exhibited knowledge of classical [[iconography]], which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt's knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Jewish Amsterdam|Jewish population]].<ref name=Clark_203_204>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203\u2013204}}</ref> Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called \"one of the great prophets of civilization\".<ref name=Clark_205>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=205}}</ref> The French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] said, \"Compare me with Rembrandt!

He added the \"d\" in the following year and stuck to this spelling for the rest of his life.

In 1639 they moved to a prominent newly built house (now the [[Rembrandt House Museum]]) in the upscale 'Breestraat' (eng.: 'Broadway'), today known as [[Jodenbreestraat]] (Jodenbreestraat 4,1011 NK Amsterdam-now) in what was becoming the Jewish quarter; then a young upcoming neighborhood.

In 1654 they had a daughter, Cornelia, bringing Hendrickje a summons from the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed Church]] to answer the charge \"that she had committed the acts of a whore with Rembrandt the painter\". She admitted this and was banned from receiving communion.

The sale list survives and gives us a good insight into Rembrandt's collections, which, apart from [[Old Master]] paintings and drawings, included busts of the Roman Emperors, suits of Japanese armor among many objects from Asia, and collections of natural history and minerals.  But the prices realized in the sales in 1657 and 1658 were disappointing.<ref>Slive, p. 84</ref> Rembrandt was forced to sell his house and his printing-press and move to more modest accommodation on the [[Rozengracht]] in 1660.<ref>Schwartz, p. 12. The house sale was in 1658, but was agreed with two years for Rembrandt to vacate.</ref> The authorities and his creditors were generally accommodating to him, except for the Amsterdam [[painters' guild]], which introduced a new rule that no one in Rembrandt's circumstances could trade as a painter.

A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, thrusting into the riddle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer's attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light\u2014an overwhelming clarity\u2014and a brooding duskiness.<ref>Taylor, Michael (2007).[http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html Rembrandt's Nose: Of Flesh & Spirit in the Master's Portraits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505200753/http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html |date=5 May 2016 }} p. 21, D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers, Inc., New York {{ISBN|978-1-933045-44-3}}'</ref>\n\nIn a number of biblical works, including ''The Raising of the Cross'', ''Joseph Telling His Dreams'' and ''[[The Stoning of Saint Stephen]]'', Rembrandt painted himself as a character in the crowd.

As Mendelowitz (1967) noted: \"Probably no one has combined to as great a degree as Rembrandt a disciplined exposition of what his eye saw and a love of line as a beautiful thing in itself.

For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - The Abduction of Europa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Abduction of Europa (Rembrandt)|''The Abduction of Europa'']], 1632. Oil on panel. The work has been described as  \"...a shining example of the 'golden age' of [[Baroque]] painting\".<ref>Clough, p. 23</ref>]]\n\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt's skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIt was during Rembrandt's Leiden period (1625\u20131631) that Lastman's influence was most prominent. It is also likely that at this time Lievens had a strong impact on his work as well.<ref name=Wetering-284>van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small, but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry).

Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (''Cottages before a Stormy Sky'', c.&nbsp;1641; ''The Three Trees'', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted ''[[The Night Watch]]'', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt - Zelfportret - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Self Portrait'', 1658, [[Frick Collection]], a masterpiece of the final style, \"the calmest and grandest of all his portraits\"<ref>Clark 1978, p. 28</ref>]]\n\nIn the decade following the ''Night Watch'', Rembrandt's paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (''Susanna and the Elders'', 1637\u201347).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163\u201365.</ref>\nAt the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\n\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt's style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of 'finish' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt's brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155\u201365.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting's surface. The end result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 157\u201358, 190.</ref>\n\nIn later years biblical themes were still depicted often, but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (''James the Apostle'', 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (''[[The Jewish Bride]]'', c.&nbsp;1666)\u2014in love, in life, and before God.<ref>\"In Rembrandt's (late) great portraits we feel face to face with real people, we sense their warmth, their need for sympathy and also their loneliness and suffering. Those keen and steady eyes that we know so well from Rembrandt's self-portraits must have been able to look straight into the human heart.\" Gombrich, p. 423.</ref><ref>\"It (''The Jewish Bride'') is a picture of grown-up love, a marvelous amalgam of richness, tenderness, and trust... the heads which, in their truth, have a spiritual glow that painters influenced by the classical tradition could never achieve.\" Clark, p. 206.</ref>\n\n===Etchings===\n[[File:Rembrandt - The windmill - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Windmill'', 1641, [[etching]]]]\n\nRembrandt produced [[etching]]s for most of his career, from 1626 to 1660, when he was forced to sell his printing-press and practically abandoned etching. Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<ref>Schwartz, 1994, pp. 8\u201312</ref> He took easily to etching and, though he also learned to use a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and partly [[engraving|engraved]] many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing, but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5\u20136</ref> He worked on the so-called ''[[Hundred Guilder Print]]'' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9\u201310</ref>\n\n[[File:Die landschaft mit den drei baeumen.jpg|thumb|left|''The Three Trees'', 1643, etching]]\n\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"plate tone,\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the twenty-seven self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. There are forty-six landscapes, mostly small, which largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints. A few erotic, or just obscene, compositions have no equivalent in his paintings.<ref>See Schwartz, 1994, where the works are divided by subject, following [[Adam Bartsch|Bartsch]].</ref> He owned, until forced to sell it, a magnificent collection of prints by other artists, and many borrowings and influences in his work can be traced to artists as diverse as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Hercules Seghers]], and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].\n\n===''The Night Watch''===\n{{main|The Night Watch}}\n[[File:La ronda de noche, por Rembrandt van Rijn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Night Watch]]'' or ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'', 1642. Oil on canvas; on display at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]\n\nRembrandt painted the large painting ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' between 1640 and 1642. This picture was called ''De Nachtwacht'' by the Dutch and ''The Night Watch'' by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] because by the 18th century the picture was so dimmed and defaced that it was almost indistinguishable, and it looked quite like a night scene. After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day\u2014a party of [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight.\n\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the ''[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]'', the musketeer branch of the civic militia. Rembrandt departed from convention, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal, rather a line-up than an action scene. Instead he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission (what kind of mission, an ordinary patrol or some special event, is a matter of debate).\n\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Amsterdam town hall]] in 1715; the Rijksmuseum has a smaller copy of what is thought to be the full original composition; the four figures in the front are at the centre of the canvas. The painting is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]].\n\n===Indian Miniatures===\n[[File:Rembrandt 208.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Rembrandt drawing of an Indian Mughal painting]]\nRembrandt was interested in [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniatures]], especially around the 1650s. He drew versions of some 23 Mughal paintings, and may have owned an album of them. These miniatures include paintings of [[Shah Jahan]], [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Dara Shikoh]].  They may also have influenced the costumes and other aspects of his works.<ref>Schrader, Stephanie; et al.

Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future|url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\n\nOne example of activity is ''[[The Polish Rider]]'', in New York's [[Frick Collection]]. Rembrandt's authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century, but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt's closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn's remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost's authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick, with [[Simon Schama]] (in his 1999 book ''Rembrandt's Eyes'') and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both arguing for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt's authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the 'Lisowczyk' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., ''Artibus et Historiae'', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197\u2013205.

There is a book on the subject:''Responses to Rembrandt; Who painted the Polish Rider?'' by Anthony Bailey (New York, 1993)</ref>\n\n[[File:Mann mit dem Goldhelm.jpg|thumb|''[[The Man with the Golden Helmet]]'', [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin]], once one of the most famous \"Rembrandt\" portraits, is no longer attributed to the master.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/arts/art-view-in-search-of-the-real-thing.html |title=Art View; In Search of the Real Thing|author=John Russell|date= December 1, 1985|work=New York Times }}</ref>]]\n\nA similar issue was raised by Simon Schama in his book ''Rembrandt's Eyes'' concerning the verification of titles associated with the subject matter depicted in Rembrandt's works. For example, the exact subject being portrayed in ''[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]'' (recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum) has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). ''Rembrandt's Eyes''. Knopf, p. 720.</ref> Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]] who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.<ref>Schama, pp 582\u2013591.</ref>\n\nAnother painting, ''Pilate Washing His Hands'', is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master's command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |publisher=Outpost Art |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing. In 2005 four oil paintings previously attributed to Rembrandt's students were reclassified as the work of Rembrandt himself: ''Study of an Old Man in Profile'' and ''Study of an Old Man with a Beard'' from a US private collection, ''[[Study of a Weeping Woman]]'', owned by the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], and ''Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet'', painted in 1640.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4276034.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Lost Rembrandt works discovered |publisher=BBC News  |date=23 September 2005 |accessdate=7 October 2009}}</ref> The ''Old Man Sitting in a Chair'' is a further example: in 2014, Professor [[Ernst van de Wetering]] offered his view to ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the demotion of the 1652 painting ''Old Man Sitting in a Chair'' \"was a vast mistake...it is a most important painting.

Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate. Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt's own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments.<ref>\"...Rembrandt was not always the perfectly consistent, logical Dutchman he was originally anticipated to be.\" Ackley, p. 13.</ref> As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.<ref>van de Wetering, p. x.</ref> It is highly likely that there will never be universal agreement as to what does and what does not constitute a genuine Rembrandt.\n\n==Painting materials==\n[[File:Rembrandt - Saskia van Uylenburgh in Arcadian Costume - WGA19164.jpg|thumb|''Saskia as Flora'', 1635]]\n\nTechnical investigation of Rembrandt's paintings in the possession of the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister]]<ref>K\u00fchn, Hermann. \u2018Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgr\u00fcnden Rembrandts, durchgef\u00fchrt an den Gem\u00e4lden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden\u2019(Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden), Maltechnik/Restauro, issue 4 (1977): 223\u2013233</ref> and in the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]<ref>K\u00fchn, Hermann. \u2018Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgr\u00fcnden Rembrandts, durchgef\u00fchrt an den Gem\u00e4lden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel\u2019 (Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel), Maltechnik/Restauro, volume 82 (1976): 25\u201333</ref> has been conducted by Hermann K\u00fchn in 1977.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\", but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\".

His printmaking studio has been set up with a printing press, where replica prints are printed.  The museum has a few Rembrandt paintings, many loaned, but an important collection of his prints, a good selection of which are on rotating display. All major [[print room]]s have large collections of Rembrandt prints, although as some exist in only a single impression, no collection is complete. The degree to which these collections are displayed to the public, or can easily be viewed by them in the print room, varies greatly.\n\n==Influence and recognition==\n[[File:Nachtwacht-in-3D.jpg|thumb|188px|Rembrandt statue and the sculptures of ''[[The Night Watch]]'' in 3D at the [[Rembrandtplein]] in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Leiden Rembrandt Statue.jpg|thumb|188px|Rembrandt statue in Leiden]]\nRembrandt is one of the most famous<ref>Golahny, Amy (2001), '[https://www.academia.edu/11872097/Use_and_Misuse_of_Rembrandt_Dutch_Crossing_2001 The Use and Misuse of Rembrandt: An Overview of Popular Reception],'.

The great shadow of the old master required a decided attitude. A late Romantic painter and critic, like [[Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin|Fromentin]] was, if he happened not to like some of Rembrandt's pictures, he felt obliged to justify his feeling. The greatness of the dramatic old master was for artists of about 1875 not a matter for doubt. 'Either I am wrong', Fromentin wrote from Holland 'or everybody else is wrong'. When Fromentin realized his inability to like some of the works by Rembrandt he formulated the following comments: 'I even do not dare to write down such a blasphemy; I would get ridiculed if this is disclosed'. Only about twenty-five years earlier another French Romantic master [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], when expressing his admiration for Rembrandt, has written in his ''Journal'' a very different statement: '... perhaps one day we will discover that Rembrandt is a much greater painter than [[Raphael]]. It is a blasphemy which would make hair raise on the heads of all the academic painters'. In 1851 the blasphemy was to put Rembrandt above Raphael. In 1875 the blasphemy was not to admire everything Rembrandt had ever produced. Between these two dates, the appreciation of Rembrandt reached its turning point and since that time he was never deprived of the high rank in the art world.|200px||Rembrandt scholar [[Jan Bia\u0142ostocki]] (1972)<ref name=\"Bia\u0142ostocki\">[[Jan Bia\u0142ostocki|Bia\u0142ostocki, Jan]] (1972), 'Rembrandt and Posterity,'.

It is defined as, \"engaging in two or more overlapping, synchronous conversations\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.degarmo.com/multicommunicating-effectively-to-increase-productivity|title=Multicommunicating Effectively to Increase Productivity {{!}} DeGarmo|website=www.degarmo.com|access-date=2016-03-25|date=2010-07-07}}</ref> The term multicommunicating was coined by Turner, Reinsch and Tinsley,<ref name=\"Turner, J. W. 2008\">Turner, J. W., Reinsch, L. & Tinsley, C. (2008). Multicommunicating: A practice whose time has come? Academy of Management Review, 33(2), 391-403.</ref> who propose that [[Simultaneity|simultaneous]] conversations can be conducted using an ever increasing array of media, including face-to-face, phone and email tools for [[communication]]. Multicommunicating has evolved with the rapid development of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technology]] (ICT) and is a prevalent form of behavior in new and emerging digital media applications such as [[Slack (software)|Slack]] and [[Skype]]. \n\nThe practice has become more and more prevalent in recent years and it has received attention from academic fields. Up to now, the majority of academic [[research]] focuses on its professional implications and outlines a number of key factors shaping the act of multicommunicating. For instance, the flexibility of communication tempo, the compartmentalization of conversations, and the topics and intensity of interactions are all contributing factors toward a person's choice of engaging in multicommunicating as well as his or her ultimate success with the practice.\n\nThe reason why multicommunicating is possible from a physiological and [[Cognition|cognitive]] perspective is because humans, or '''presence allocators''', are typically able to think faster than they are able to talk or type.<ref name=\"Turner, J. W. 2008\" /> Nonetheless, most neuroscience studies imply that we are not truly cognitively capable of [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]]; we are just able to switch between tasks. This means that those of us who are most adept at apparent multitasking, or multicommunicating, are essentially very quick at juggling our attention(s) between messages.<ref>Ocasio, W. (2011). Attention to Attention. Journal of Organizational Science, 22(5), 1-11.</ref>\n\nNotably, many people engage in multiple conversations as a direct response to the requests of others. Employees frequently believe that multicommunicating increases their [[productivity]] and work [[efficiency]], however in-depth interviews about the practice of multicommunicating have often revealed some mixed results. Research has also shown that the most commonly used combinations for multicommunicating are the telephone and email, followed by the telephone and text-based messaging (text message, instant message, etc.).<ref>Turner, J. W., & Reinsch, L. (no year). Multicommunicating and Interpersonal Presence: Developing New Constructs for Studying New Phenomena.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nMulticommunicating primarily builds off [[Edward T. Hall|Hall]]'s work on [[polychronicity]], [[Goffman]]'s theory of the presentation of self, and [[Richard L. Daft|Daft]] and Lengel's notion of [[Media richness theory|media richness]]. The practice also bears relevance to [[media ecology]] theory as well as [[channel expansion theory]].  \n\n=== Hall's polychronicity ===\nMulticommunicating is closely related to [[Edward T. Hall|Hall]]'s 1959 work on [[polychronicity]]; in fact, multicommunicating was initially called 'polychronic communication' in one of Turner and Reinsch' first scholarly presentations of the concept to the wider academic community.<ref>Turner, J. W., & Reinsch, L. (2005). Polychronic Communication in the Workplace: The Temporal Structure of \"Connected Time\". Paper Presented at the National Communication Association Conference, Boston, MA, November, 2005.</ref> In his 1959 book ''The Silent Language,'' Hall coined the term polychronicity and in subsequent works developed the argument that polychronicity is a measure of a culture's preference toward engaging in several activities at a time. An important conceptual transition then occurred in the late 1990s, when Bluedron<ref>Bluedorn, A. C., et al. (1999). Polychronicity and the inventory of polychronic values (IVP): The development of an instrument to measure a fundamental dimension of organizational culture. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 14(3/4), 205-230.</ref> became one of the first scholars to adapt the term polychronicity from the cultural context and to apply it to the workplace.\n\n=== Goffman's presentation of self ===\n[[Goffman]]'s theory of [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life|the presentation of self]], which suggests that people engage in a world of multistage dramas, also plays an informing role in the construction of multicommunicating. The notion that we tailor our behavior to suit our environmental contexts and situations is indeed, true in conversations, too. Nonetheless, where multicommunicating differentiates itself from Goffman's theory of the presentation of self is that a 'presence allocator' picks up their appropriate behavior cues from the interaction and the [[Media (communication)|medium]] itself as opposed to the 'actor', who picks up his or her cues for appropriate behavior from their physical environment. Goffman's theory set the stage for further studies for which computer-mediated contexts (CMC) shape online self-presentation.<ref>Kuznekoff, Jeffrey H. \u201cThe Online Presentation of Self: Re-Examining Goffman\u2019s Presentation of Self Across Contemporary CMC Contexts.\u201d Ohio University / OhioLINK, 2012. Print.</ref>\n\n=== Daft and Lengel's media richness theory ===\n[[Richard L. Daft|Daft]] and Lengel's research on [[media richness theory]] or, how employees choose which technologies to use in the workplace, is another important concept for multicommunicating. Similar to [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan]]'s notion of '[[The Medium Is the Massage|the medium is the message]]', Daft and Lengel argue that different media have varying qualities that make them more or less suited for certain interactions. \n\nIn a study about the relationship between managerial communication and media selection, Daft and Lengel encourage communication media that emphasizes face-to-face interaction.<ref>Daft, Richard L., Lengel, Robert H., and Trevino, Linda Klebe. \u201cMessage Equivocality, Media Selection, and Manager Performance: Implications for Information Systems.\u201d ''MIS \u00a0\u00a0 Quarterly'' 11.3 (1987): 355\u2013366. Web.</ref> For example, a relatively complex interaction, such as an important conversation with a new business partner, will likely be carried out with as rich a medium as possible. This rich medium would be a communication technology, like Skype or even a face-to-face conversation, which would allow for maximum information and submersion in the interaction. Conversely, a more casual and routine conversation, such as the making of lunch plans with a co-worker, could easily be carried out over a less contextually rich medium like an office chat or a text message.\n\nMulticommunicating takes the medium selection concept from media richness theory and suggests that some of the same characteristics that contribute to making medium choices may also contribute to the reasons a person might multicommunicate. For example, if a conversation is not very complicated or equivocal, a person might be more likely to engage in multiple conversations.  A conversation that is more complicated might make it hard for multicommunicating to take place.<ref>Turner, J. W., & Reinsch, L. (2007). The Business Communicator as Presence Allocator: Multicommunicating, Equivocality, and Status at Work (2007). Journal of Business and Communication, 44(1), 36-58.</ref>\n\n=== Media ecology theory ===\nOrganizational norms shape the frequency and usage of multicommunication within an organization. In this sense, the practice of multicommunicating is a type of multiple media practices, also known as [[multimedia]], because people often use more than one media when engaging in multiple conversations.<ref>{{cite book|title=The international encyclopedia of organizational communication|others=Scott, Craig R. (Craig Richard),, Lewis, Laurie K.,, Barker, James R. (James Robert), 1957-, Keyton, Joann,, Kuhn, Timothy,, Turner, Paaige K.|isbn=9781118955604|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=951778628|last1 = Scott|first1 = Craig|last2=Lewis|first2=Laurie|date=2017-03-06}}</ref> [[media ecology]] Theory centers on the principles that there is a strong connection between media, technology and communication, and how media and communication processes influence human perception, feeling, understanding and value, and usually all three are used when engaged in multiple conversations in a technology enriched workplace.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.|isbn=9780073534282|edition= Fifth|location=New York, NY|oclc=844725577}}</ref>\n\n=== Channel expansion theory ===\nClosely connected to [[media richness theory]] is also the notion of [[channel expansion theory]],<ref>Carlson, J., & Zmud, R. (1995). Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential.  The Academy of Management Journal, 42(2), 153-170.</ref> which suggests that as an individual becomes more familiar with a specific [[technology]], his or her perception of its capabilities and richness expands. Thus, somebody who is very comfortable with a certain chat site may perceive it to be richer in contextual nature than somebody who is only familiar with its most basic functionalities. This contributes to our understanding of multicommunicating in the sense that a persons' experience with various media may make them more adept at picking up contextually rich conversation signals as well as more prepared for handling certain communication technologies. However, even though [[channel expansion theory]] implies there are positive effects associated with the familiarity of a technology, this does not necessarily suggest that as a person's perception of media richness increases, the process of multicommunicating becomes simplified.\n\n== Multicommunicating within multitasking ==\nMulticommunicating is similar in nature to the notion of [[human multitasking|multitasking]]. The difference between multicommunicating and [[Media multitasking|multitasking]] can be confusing since both of the terms talk about people participating in two events at the same time. In essence, multicommunicating is a complex form of multitasking.<ref>Turner, Jeanine. \u201cMulticommunicator Aspirational Stress, Suggestions for Teaching and Research, and Other Insights After 10 Years of Multicommunication Research.\u201d ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication'' 33.2 (2018): 141\u2013171. Web.</ref> \n\nMulticommunicating departs from multitasking as it refers specifically to managing multiple conversations, people and media&nbsp;\u2013 not just tasks&nbsp;\u2013 at the same time. Stephen, Cho and Ballard elucidate this distinction in a 2011 paper which compares dovetailing (sequential communication) with multicommunication (simultaneous interactions).<ref>Stephens, K., Cho, J., & Ballard, D. (2012). Simultaneity, Sequentiality, and Speed: Organizational Messages About Multiple-Task Completion. Human Communication Research, 38(1), 23-47.</ref> In addition, multicommunicating often occurs unbeknown to one's communication partners.\n\nMultitasking refers to a user engaging in multitasking behavior when s/he performs more than one unrelated task concurrently,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Benbunan-Fich|first=Raquel|last2=Adler|first2=Rachel F.|last3=Mavlanova|first3=Tamilla|date=2011-07-01|title=Measuring Multitasking Behavior with Activity-based Metrics|journal=ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.

Multicommunicating, however, involves people participating in two simultaneous conversations, which not only requires adequate attention on both tasks, but also coordination between the two.

Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref> While these subcategories have particular defining characteristics, they are largely overlapping with other categories.\n\n==Specific characteristics==\n\nResearch suggests that there are two characteristics which help to determine a person's choice of communication media when engaging in multicommunicating: compartmentalization and flexibility of tempo.\n\n====Compartmentalization====\n{{Quote_box\n| width = 30%\n| align = bottom\n| quote = Compartmentalization and Fexibility of Tempo help to determine the success of an episode of multicommunicating.\n| title = Specific Characteristics\n}}\n[[Compartmentalization (psychology)|Compartmentalization]] refers to the ability and ease of cross-conversations. For instance, an online chat allows one to move relatively freely from one conversation to another. In this case, the ability to hide conversations from the multiple communication partners is an important factor of compartmentalization, too. Certain \n\n====Flexibility of tempo====\n\nFlexibility of tempo refers to the amount of time a person has to respond to a certain message. Face-to-face communication often allows for less flexibility of tempo than does a text message.\n\nMost typically, users choose to combine media technologies such as the telephone (described as non-flexible in tempo and partially compartmentalized) with those such as electronic text (described as high in both flexibility and compartmentalization capabilities). Of course, sometimes presence allocators do not have a choice about one or more of the media they engage with. However, specific combinations of communication media may contribute strongly toward the success or, lack thereof, one has with multicommunicating.\n\n==Successful and unsuccessful instances==\n\nTo multicommunicate or not to multicommunicate&nbsp;\u2013 what is it that makes an multicommunicating episode successful? Several factors, including '''intensity''', '''topic of conversation''', '''[[Equivocation (information theory)|equivocality]]''', and the '''presence allocator''' themselves may help to determine the outcomes of an [[episode]] of multicommunicating.\n\n=== Intensity of communication ===\n'''Intensity''' of communication is one of the key factors in multicommunicating because it helps to predict the amount of attention and importance a specific conversation holds. Typically, conversation intensity increases with more, simultaneous conversations, a faster pace of conversion, a broader range of topics, and a wider mix of [[social role]]s. Overly high intensity has sometimes been reported as a factor for unsuccessful multicommunicating.\n\n=== Topic of conversation ===\nThe '''topics''' or themes of episodes of multicommunicating are another key factor determining overall success. Put simply, the more alike the themes of the simultaneous conversations, the more congruent an experience and easier a time the presence allocator has in information processing and conversation-switching. Similarly, the more divergent the topics or themes of conversation, the bigger the cognitive strain on the presence allocator and the higher the chance for confusion or conversation mix-ups.\n\n=== Equivocality ===\nThe notion of '''equivocality''' is closely related to topic or theme of communication and is another key factor, which may help to determine the success of multicommunicating. Equivocality refers to the possibility for misinterpretation and studies suggest that the higher the potential for equivocality in a conversation, the more likely an individual is to pick a medium of communication that is rich in contextual cues, or that has high media-richness. The possibility for equivocality extends to episodes of multicommunicating, too, and could potentially be compounded if one has to switch their attention between media&nbsp;\u2013 or does not engage in [[rich-media]] conversations when necessary.\n\n=== Presence allocator ===\nThere are limits to our working memory that in turn restrict our cognitive information processing capabilities. Performance deteriorates when these limits are exceeded. Because of these limits, performing two tasks at the same time or rapidly switching between two tasks results in decreased task performance in terms of accuracy and response time. These problems can be partially alleviated (but not eliminated) by practice and physical compatibility of the tasks being performed, but they increase with task complexity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Ann-Frances|last2=Webster|first2=Jane|date=2012-11-08|title=Multicommunicating: Juggling Multiple Conversations in the Workplace|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=24|issue=2|pages=352\u2013371|doi=10.1287/isre.1120.0446|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>\n\nOverall, research advocates that presence allocators have the most successful experiences with multicommunicating episodes when engaged in multiple conversations with contextually appropriate media around similar topics. Likewise, the frequent reports of unsuccessful multicommunicating episodes include a sense of high intensity, equivocality and theme confusion. In those cases, information overload can occur to the point where a conversation slows down, becomes confounded or altogether stops.\n\n==Implications==\n\nThe first studies of multicommunicating began when instant messaging first became common practice.<ref>Turner, Jeanine. \u201cMulticommunicator Aspirational Stress, Suggestions for Teaching and Research, and Other Insights After 10 Years of Multicommunication Research.\u201d ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication'' 33.2 (2018): 141\u2013171. </ref> While the study of multicommunicating is still in its emergent stages, it appears to be increasingly relevant to a fast-paced, multitasking society.  Some implications of multicommunicating and suggestions for further studies include:\n\n===Productivity===\n\nMost people indicate that they multicommunicate in order to become more efficient. However, this goal of efficiency has received some mixed results. Despite the notion that getting several things done at once makes us more productive, research has indicated that polychronicity is negatively correlated with deadlines.<ref>Kaufman, C.F., Lane, P.M. and Lindquist, J.D. (1991). Exploring More than 24 Hours a Day: A Preliminary Investigation of Polychronic Time Use. Journal of Consumer Research, 18, 392\u2013401.</ref> More specifically, when it comes to communication and multiple conversations many people reveal a breaking point, at which they can no longer juggle [[Synchronity|synchronous]] messages. Significant numbers of research subjects also indicate that they prefer to stay away from multicommunicating altogether when it comes to important conversations which require strong attention.\n\nSeveral scholars also hypothesized that perceived communication workload can influence people engaging in multicommunicating. Since perceived heavy workload gives people a sense of loss of time, which may result to people compensating for the effect of being overloaded by multicommunicating. However, as revealed by related research results, perceived communication overload did not predict meeting multitasking behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Stephens|first = Keri K.|last2 = Davis|first2 = Jennifer|date = 2009-06-08|title = The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|volume = 23|issue = 1|pages = 63\u201383|doi = 10.1177/0893318909335417|issn = 0893-3189}}</ref>\n\n=== Perceived incivility ===\nBy employing the [[social exchange theory]], which views social behavior as \"an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige\" where \"persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them\",<ref>Homans, G.

[[Attentional Social Presence Theory]] developed by Turner & Foss<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Jeanine Warisse|last2=Foss|first2=Sonja K|date=2018-02-01|title=Options for the Construction of Attentional Social Presence in a Digitally Enhanced Multicommunicative Environment|journal=Communication Theory|volume=28|issue=1|pages=22\u201345|doi=10.1093/ct/qty002|issn=1050-3293}}</ref> suggests that there are four types of presences when we engage in multiple conversations: '''budgeted''', '''entitled''', '''competitive''' and '''invitational'''.\n\n* Budgeted presence happens when you engage in multiple conversations at once, for instance, talking to your friend while also sending an email.\n* Entitled presence happens when you can take your audience\u2019s technology away or someone takes  your technology away, for instance, you're in class and the professor asks to put your phones away.\n* Competitive presence happens when you try to persuade other people or group of people to pay attention to you, and you seem to have to compete with their communication technology, for instance, when you're trying to share a personal story with your friend, but they're on their phone and are not paying attention to you.\n* Invitational presence happens when you decide to focus on your audience and you are making a concrete effort to be in the moment (only one conversation), you are focused only on that interaction, for instance, you are having a one-on-one conversation with your friend, there is no technology involved and there are no distractions.\n\nEach presence involves the control of our audience and technology, the choices we make, and how we interact.\n\nIs there a way to measure our social presence? In her paper \u201cToward a more robust theory and measure of social presence<ref>{{cite journal|last=Biocca|first=Frank|last2=Harms|first2=Chad|last3=Burgoon|first3=Judee K.|date=October 2003|title=Toward a More Robust Theory and Measure of Social Presence: Review and Suggested Criteria|journal=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments|volume=12|issue=5|pages=456\u2013480|doi=10.1162/105474603322761270|issn=1054-7460}}</ref>\u201d Biocca, Harms & Burgoon contribute to the understanding of social behavior in mediated environments, which allows researchers to predict and measure differences among interfaces and guide the design of new social environments and interfaces\n\n===Organizational norms and perceptions===\nMulticommunicating is especially present in team collaborations. In order to be more effective in their workplace, teams would use different platforms for their communication practices. There are a number of communication platforms such as [[Slack (software)|Slack]] that include multiple '''Social Media Channels''' (social networking platforms and instant messaging). The media capabilities of these platforms, including integrations for diverse information and communication technologies, enable '''[[affordance]]s''' for both highly adaptable and centralized team communication practices. A recent research shows that team communication platforms (also known as TCPs) enable affordances for multicommunication and attention allocation including flexible scaling of '''media modality''' and '''synchronicity'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Anders|first=Abram|date=2016-01-19|title=Team Communication Platforms and Emergent Social Collaboration Practices|journal= International Journal of Business Communication|volume=53|issue=2|pages=224\u2013261|doi=10.1177/2329488415627273|issn=2329-4884}}</ref>\n\nAnother important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn organizational settings, research suggests that individual's decisions to use informational communication technology are influenced by what they observe other members do in the organization, which is positive related to their multicommunicating behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|date=2009|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=|journal=Management Communication Quarterly Online|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> The perception of what others think about multicommunicating is also another significant predictor on this behaviors. Often, people hide the fact that they are multicommunicating from their conversational partners because they report an underlying perception of rudeness or partiality of conversational investment associated with multicommunicating. However, if people perceive that multicommunicating is acceptable in the organizations, they will not feel embarrassed and will engage in this kind of behaviors more often.\n\nDepending on the organizational culture, multicommunicating can become particularly crucial and bear negative effects in a professional or office setting. Conversely, research suggests that employees who follow [[organizational communication]] norms receive higher performance ratings than those who don't. Therefore, if multicommunicating were considered an organizational '[[Norm (social)|norm]]', its practice could also bring positive feedback.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile multicommunicating can be a controversial topic in research and practice, it is an increasingly common organizational realty. Further research into cognitive abilities, organizational settings and expanding virtual work opportunities, as well as technology will likely carry significant findings for our personal and professional lives.\n\n=== Multicommunication on Workplace Productivity ===\nMulticommunication can change the ways in which teams work and interact within the organization. An  important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others. In their research Stephens and Davis (2009) talk about the social influences on electronic multitasking in organizational meetings.<ref name=\"Stephens 63\u201383\">{{cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer|date=2009-06-08|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|volume=23|issue=1|pages=63\u201383|doi=10.1177/0893318909335417|issn=0893-3189}}</ref> [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]<nowiki/>s have infiltrated meetings and allowed a new range of communicative behaviors to emerge. The observation of organizational norms and the perception of others\u2019 thoughts concerning the use of ICTs for multitasking during a meeting explain a considerable amount of variance in how individuals use ICTs to communicate electronically in meetings.<ref name=\"Stephens 63\u201383\" />\n\nRelating to this point, Belanger and Watson (2006) made a study exploring how virtual team members structure their use of multiple media to attain strategic goals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=B\u00e9langer|first=France|last2=Watson-Manheim|first2=Mary Beth|date=July 2006|title=Virtual Teams and Multiple Media: Structuring Media Use to Attain Strategic Goals|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|volume=15|issue=4|pages=299\u2013321|doi=10.1007/s10726-006-9044-8|issn=0926-2644}}</ref> In today\u2019s work environment, individuals working in teams must learn to manage their time for communication and coordination, and to add to this complexity teams can range from completely virtual environments to face-to-face and all the technologies that are involved. Cardon and Dai (2014) did a study that examines the nature of mobile phone use in meetings among Chinese professionals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=W.|first=Cardon, Peter|last2=Ying|first2=Dai|date=2014|title=Mobile Phone Use in Meetings among Chinese Professionals: Perspectives on Multicommunication and Civility|url=https://commons.emich.edu/gabc/vol3/iss1/2/|journal=Global Advances in Business Communication|volume=3|issue=1|issn=2164-1692}}</ref> Using mobile phones in meetings is a form of multicommunicaion, but the etiquette associated with mobile phone use differ across cultures. Multicommunicating via mobile phones in meetings is mostly client-based and relationship-based, and it changes among cultures and across generations.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nCriticisms of multicommunication theory at large are not prevalent considering the obvious reason that multicommunicating is a relatively newly defined and studied behavior. However, due to the fact that multicommunicating has been largely studied for its professional implications, recent critical research suggests that multicommunicating behavior may have adverse effects on individual productivity, <ref>CAMERON A-F and WEBSTER J (2013) Multicommunicating: juggling multiple conversations in the workplace. Information Systems Research 24(2), 352\u2013371.</ref> workplace relationships,<ref>CAMERON A-F and WEBSTER J (2011) Relational outcomes of multicommunicating: integrating incivility and social exchange perspectives. Organization Science 22(3), 754\u2013771, doi:10.1287/orsc.1100.0540.</ref> and stress management.<ref>MARULANDA-CARTER L and JACKSON TW (2012) Effects of e-mail addiction and interruptions on employees. Journal of Systems and Information Technology 14(1), 82\u201394.</ref> \n\nCameron draws from several disciplines, including management and cognitive and social psychology, to provide several misconceptions about multicommunication. After conducting empirical research, she claims that multicommunicating, contrary to popular belief, may render an individual in fact less accessible, less productive, and potentially more rude in certain professional contexts. She points out that multicommunicating behavior, especially among those with a weak ability to focus, has often increased errors, reduced contribution between ongoing conversations, and increased confusion in the workplace.<ref>Ann-Frances, Cameron et al. \u201cFour Common Multicommunicating Misconceptions.\u201d ''European Journal of\u00a0 Information Systems'' 25.5 (2016): 465-471. </ref> In doing so, many people multicommunicate as an uncontrolled habit rather than a strategic form of communication, offering more negative implications than positive. Cameron, however, does not advocate against multicommunication, but rather for people to better understand their multicommunicating behaviors and to practice multicommunicating more intentionally.  \n\nMulticommunicating's practical implications also have drawn criticism in gender studies. Soukup's analysis of [[computer-mediated communication]] through a critical ethnography of gendered chatrooms illustrates the normative forms of behavior among genders online. In distinct gendered chatrooms, masculine participants mostly demonstrated more aggressive and argumentative, while feminine participants mostly sought relationships and intimacy.<ref>Soukup, C. (2000). Building a Theory of Multi-Media CMC: An Analysis, Critique and Integration of Computer-Mediated Communication Theory and Research.

Paskewitz and Beck later conducted research about texting during workplace meetings and determined that women perceive individuals who practice multicommunicating more negatively than men. At the same time, the gender of the multicommunicator did not play a role in these perceptions.<ref>Paskewitz, Emily A, and Beck, Stephenson J. \u201cExploring Perceptions of Multicommunicator Texting During Meetings.\u201d ''Computers in Human Behavior'' 101 (2019): 238\u2013247.

Academy of Management Review, 33(2), 391-403.</ref> who propose that [[Simultaneity|simultaneous]] conversations can be conducted using an ever increasing array of media, including face-to-face, phone and email tools for [[communication]]. Multicommunicating has evolved with the rapid development of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technology]] (ICT) and is a prevalent form of behavior in new and emerging digital media applications such as [[Slack (software)|Slack]] and [[Skype]]. \n\nThe practice has become more and more prevalent in recent years and it has received attention from academic fields. Up to now, the majority of academic [[research]] focuses on its professional implications and outlines a number of key factors shaping the act of multicommunicating. For instance, the flexibility of communication tempo, the compartmentalization of conversations, and the topics and intensity of interactions are all contributing factors toward a person's choice of engaging in multicommunicating as well as his or her ultimate success with the practice.\n\nThe reason why multicommunicating is possible from a physiological and [[Cognition|cognitive]] perspective is because humans, or '''presence allocators''', are typically able to think faster than they are able to talk or type.<ref name=\"Turner, J. W. 2008\" /> Nonetheless, most neuroscience studies imply that we are not truly cognitively capable of [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]]; we are just able to switch between tasks. This means that those of us who are most adept at apparent multitasking, or multicommunicating, are essentially very quick at juggling our attention(s) between messages.<ref>Ocasio, W. (2011). Attention to Attention. Journal of Organizational Science, 22(5), 1-11.</ref>\n\nNotably, many people engage in multiple conversations as a direct response to the requests of others. Employees frequently believe that multicommunicating increases their [[productivity]] and work [[efficiency]], however in-depth interviews about the practice of multicommunicating have often revealed some mixed results. Research has also shown that the most commonly used combinations for multicommunicating are the telephone and email, followed by the telephone and text-based messaging (text message, instant message, etc.).<ref>Turner, J. W., & Reinsch, L. (no year). Multicommunicating and Interpersonal Presence: Developing New Constructs for Studying New Phenomena.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nMulticommunicating primarily builds off [[Edward T. Hall|Hall]]'s work on [[polychronicity]], [[Goffman]]'s theory of the presentation of self, and [[Richard L. Daft|Daft]] and Lengel's notion of [[Media richness theory|media richness]]. The practice also bears relevance to [[media ecology]] theory as well as [[channel expansion theory]].  \n\n=== Hall's polychronicity ===\nMulticommunicating is closely related to [[Edward T. Hall|Hall]]'s 1959 work on [[polychronicity]]; in fact, multicommunicating was initially called 'polychronic communication' in one of Turner and Reinsch' first scholarly presentations of the concept to the wider academic community.<ref>Turner, J. W., & Reinsch, L. (2005). Polychronic Communication in the Workplace: The Temporal Structure of \"Connected Time\". Paper Presented at the National Communication Association Conference, Boston, MA, November, 2005.</ref> In his 1959 book ''The Silent Language,'' Hall coined the term polychronicity and in subsequent works developed the argument that polychronicity is a measure of a culture's preference toward engaging in several activities at a time. An important conceptual transition then occurred in the late 90's, when Bluedron<ref>Bluedorn, A. C., et al. (1999). Polychronicity and the inventory of polychronic values (IVP): The development of an instrument to measure a fundamental dimension of organizational culture. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 14(3/4), 205-230.</ref> became one of the first scholars to adapt the term polychronicity from the cultural context and to apply it to the workplace.\n\n=== Goffman's presentation of self ===\n[[Goffman]]'s theory of [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life|the presentation of self]], which suggests that people engage in a world of multistage dramas, also plays an informing role in the construction of multicommunicating. The notion that we tailor our behavior to suit our environmental contexts and situations is indeed, true in conversations, too. Nonetheless, where multicommunicating differentiates itself from Goffman's theory of the presentation of self is that a 'presence allocator' picks up their appropriate behavior cues from the interaction and the [[Media (communication)|medium]] itself as opposed to the 'actor', who picks up his or her cues for appropriate behavior from their physical environment. Goffman's theory set the stage for further studies for which computer-mediated contexts (CMC) shape online self-presentation.<ref>Kuznekoff, Jeffrey H. \u201cThe Online Presentation of Self: Re-Examining Goffman\u2019s Presentation of Self Across Contemporary CMC Contexts.\u201d Ohio University / OhioLINK, 2012. Print.</ref>\n\n=== Daft and Lengel's media richness theory ===\n[[Richard L. Daft|Daft]] and Lengel's research on [[media richness theory]] or, how employees choose which technologies to use in the workplace, is another important concept for multicommunicating. Similar to [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan]]'s notion of '[[The Medium Is the Massage|the medium is the message]]', Daft and Lengel argue that different media have varying qualities that make them more or less suited for certain interactions. \n\nIn a study about the relationship between managerial communication and media selection, Daft and Lengel encourage communication media that emphasizes face-to-face interaction.<ref>Daft, Richard L., Lengel, Robert H., and Trevino, Linda Klebe. \u201cMessage Equivocality, Media Selection, and Manager Performance: Implications for Information Systems.\u201d ''MIS \u00a0\u00a0 Quarterly'' 11.3 (1987): 355\u2013366.

This rich medium would be a communication technology, like Skype or even a face-to-face conversation, which would allow for maximum information and submersion in the interaction. Conversely, a more casual and routine conversation, such as the making of lunch plans with a co-worker, could easily be carried out over a less contextually rich medium like an office chat or a text message.\n\nMulticommunicating takes the medium selection concept from media richness theory and suggests that some of the same characteristics that contribute to making medium choices may also contribute to the reasons a person might multicommunicate. For example, if a conversation is not very complicated or equivocal, a person might be more likely to engage in multiple conversations.  A conversation that is more complicated might make it hard for multicommunicating to take place.<ref>Turner, J. W., & Reinsch, L. (2007).

In this sense, the practice of multicommunicating is a type of multiple media practices, also known as [[multimedia]], because people often use more than one media when engaging in multiple conversations.<ref>{{cite book|title=The international encyclopedia of organizational communication|others=Scott, Craig R.

(1995). Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential.  The Academy of Management Journal, 42(2), 153-170.</ref> which suggests that as an individual becomes more familiar with a specific [[technology]], his or her perception of its capabilities and richness expands. Thus, somebody who is very comfortable with a certain chat site may perceive it to be richer in contextual nature than somebody who is only familiar with its most basic functionalities. This contributes to our understanding of multicommunicating in the sense that a persons' experience with various media may make them more adept at picking up contextually rich conversation signals as well as more prepared for handling certain communication technologies. However, even though [[channel expansion theory]] implies there are positive effects associated with the familiarity of a technology, this does not necessarily suggest that as a person's perception of media richness increases, the process of multicommunicating becomes simplified.\n\n== Multicommunicating within multitasking ==\nMulticommunicating is similar in nature to the notion of [[human multitasking|multitasking]]. The difference between multicommunicating and [[Media multitasking|multitasking]] can be confusing since both of the terms talk about people participating in two events at the same time. In essence, multicommunicating is a complex form of multitasking.<ref>Turner, Jeanine. \u201cMulticommunicator Aspirational Stress, Suggestions for Teaching and Research, and Other Insights After 10 Years of Multicommunication Research.\u201d ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication'' 33.2 (2018): 141\u2013171.

(2012). Simultaneity, Sequentiality, and Speed: Organizational Messages About Multiple-Task Completion.

Multicommunicating, however, involves people participating in two simultaneous conversations, which not only requires adequate attention on both tasks, but also coordination between the two. The timing and the pace of communication is also at least partially controlled by others and must mediate between different times of exchanges.<ref>Ann-Frances, Cameron, et al. \"Four Common Multicommunicating Misconceptions.\" ''European Journal of Information Systems'' 25.5 (2016): 465-71.

Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref> While these subcategories have particular defining characteristics, they are largely overlapping with other categories.\n\n==Specific characteristics==\n\nResearch suggests that there are two characteristics which help to determine a person's choice of communication media when engaging in multicommunicating: compartmentalization and flexibility of tempo.\n\n====Compartmentalization====\n{{Quote_box\n| width = 30%\n| align = bottom\n| quote = Compartmentalization and Fexibility of Tempo help to determine the success of an episode of multicommunicating.\n| title = Specific Characteristics\n}}\n[[Compartmentalization (psychology)|Compartmentalization]] refers to the ability and ease of cross-conversations. For instance, an online chat allows one to move relatively freely from one conversation to another. In this case, the ability to hide conversations from the multiple communication partners is an important factor of compartmentalization, too. Certain \n\n====Flexibility of tempo====\n\nFlexibility of tempo refers to the amount of time a person has to respond to a certain message. Face-to-face communication often allows for less flexibility of tempo than does a text message.\n\nMost typically, users choose to combine media technologies such as the telephone (described as non-flexible in tempo and partially compartmentalized) with those such as electronic text (described as high in both flexibility and compartmentalization capabilities). Of course, sometimes presence allocators do not have a choice about one or more of the media they engage with. However, specific combinations of communication media may contribute strongly toward the success or, lack thereof, one has with multicommunicating.\n\n==Successful and unsuccessful instances==\n\nTo multicommunicate or not to multicommunicate&nbsp;\u2013 what is it that makes an multicommunicating episode successful? Several factors, including '''intensity''', '''topic of conversation''', '''[[Equivocation (information theory)|equivocality]]''', and the '''presence allocator''' themselves may help to determine the outcomes of an [[episode]] of multicommunicating.\n\n=== Intensity of communication ===\n'''Intensity''' of communication is one of the key factors in multicommunicating because it helps to predict the amount of attention and importance a specific conversation holds. Typically, conversation intensity increases with more, simultaneous conversations, a faster pace of conversion, a broader range of topics, and a wider mix of [[social role]]s. Overly high intensity has sometimes been reported as a factor for unsuccessful multicommunicating.\n\n=== Topic of conversation ===\nThe '''topics''' or themes of episodes of multicommunicating are another key factor determining overall success. Put simply, the more alike the themes of the simultaneous conversations, the more congruent an experience and easier a time the presence allocator has in information processing and conversation-switching. Similarly, the more divergent the topics or themes of conversation, the bigger the cognitive strain on the presence allocator and the higher the chance for confusion or conversation mix-ups.\n\n=== Equivocality ===\nThe notion of '''equivocality''' is closely related to topic or theme of communication and is another key factor, which may help to determine the success of multicommunicating. Equivocality refers to the possibility for misinterpretation and studies suggest that the higher the potential for equivocality in a conversation, the more likely an individual is to pick a medium of communication that is rich in contextual cues, or that has high media-richness. The possibility for equivocality extends to episodes of multicommunicating, too, and could potentially be compounded if one has to switch their attention between media&nbsp;\u2013 or does not engage in [[rich-media]] conversations when necessary.\n\n=== Presence allocator ===\nThere are limits to our working memory that in turn restrict our cognitive information processing capabilities. Performance deteriorates when these limits are exceeded. Because of these limits, performing two tasks at the same time or rapidly switching between two tasks results in decreased task performance in terms of accuracy and response time. These problems can be partially alleviated (but not eliminated) by practice and physical compatibility of the tasks being performed, but they increase with task complexity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Ann-Frances|last2=Webster|first2=Jane|date=2012-11-08|title=Multicommunicating: Juggling Multiple Conversations in the Workplace|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=24|issue=2|pages=352\u2013371|doi=10.1287/isre.1120.0446|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>\n\nOverall, research advocates that presence allocators have the most successful experiences with multicommunicating episodes when engaged in multiple conversations with contextually appropriate media around similar topics. Likewise, the frequent reports of unsuccessful multicommunicating episodes include a sense of high intensity, equivocality and theme confusion. In those cases, information overload can occur to the point where a conversation slows down, becomes confounded or altogether stops.\n\n==Implications==\n\nThe first studies of multicommunicating began when instant messaging first became common practice.<ref>Turner, Jeanine. \u201cMulticommunicator Aspirational Stress, Suggestions for Teaching and Research, and Other Insights After 10 Years of Multicommunication Research.\u201d ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication'' 33.2 (2018): 141\u2013171. </ref> While the study of multicommunicating is still in its emergent stages, it appears to be increasingly relevant to a fast-paced, multitasking society.  Some implications of multicommunicating and suggestions for further studies include:\n\n===Productivity===\n\nMost people indicate that they multicommunicate in order to become more efficient. However, this goal of efficiency has received some mixed results. Despite the notion that getting several things done at once makes us more productive, research has indicated that polychronicity is negatively correlated with deadlines.<ref>Kaufman, C.F., Lane, P.M. and Lindquist, J.D. (1991). Exploring More than 24 Hours a Day: A Preliminary Investigation of Polychronic Time Use. Journal of Consumer Research, 18, 392\u2013401.</ref> More specifically, when it comes to communication and multiple conversations many people reveal a breaking point, at which they can no longer juggle [[Synchronity|synchronous]] messages. Significant numbers of research subjects also indicate that they prefer to stay away from multicommunicating altogether when it comes to important conversations which require strong attention.\n\nSeveral scholars also hypothesized that perceived communication workload can influence people engaging in multicommunicating. Since perceived heavy workload gives people a sense of loss of time, which may result to people compensating for the effect of being overloaded by multicommunicating. However, as revealed by related research results, perceived communication overload did not predict meeting multitasking behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Stephens|first = Keri K.|last2 = Davis|first2 = Jennifer|date = 2009-06-08|title = The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|volume = 23|issue = 1|pages = 63\u201383|doi = 10.1177/0893318909335417|issn = 0893-3189}}</ref>\n\n=== Perceived incivility ===\nBy employing the [[social exchange theory]], which views social behavior as \"an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige\" where \"persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them\",<ref>Homans, G.

And the incivility perceived in multicommunicating may lead to mistrust in working places.<ref name=\":1\">Cameron, A., & Webster, J. (2010).

[[Attentional Social Presence Theory]] developed by Turner & Foss<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Jeanine Warisse|last2=Foss|first2=Sonja K|date=2018-02-01|title=Options for the Construction of Attentional Social Presence in a Digitally Enhanced Multicommunicative Environment|journal=Communication Theory|volume=28|issue=1|pages=22\u201345|doi=10.1093/ct/qty002|issn=1050-3293}}</ref> suggests that there are four types of presences when we engage in multiple conversations: '''budgeted''', '''entitled''', '''competitive''' and '''invitational'''.\n\n* Budgeted presence happens when you engage in multiple conversations at once, for instance, talking to your friend while also sending an email.\n* Entitled presence happens when you can take your audience\u2019s technology away or someone takes  your technology away, for instance, you're in class and the professor asks to put your phones away.\n* Competitive presence happens when you try to persuade other people or group of people to pay attention to you, and you seem to have to compete with their communication technology, for instance, when you're trying to share a personal story with your friend, but they're on their phone and are not paying attention to you.\n* Invitational presence happens when you decide to focus on your audience and you are making a concrete effort to be in the moment (only one conversation), you are focused only on that interaction, for instance, you are having a one-on-one conversation with your friend, there is no technology involved and there are no distractions.\n\nEach presence involves the control of our audience and technology, the choices we make, and how we interact.\n\nIs there a way to measure our social presence? In her paper \u201cToward a more robust theory and measure of social presence<ref>{{cite journal|last=Biocca|first=Frank|last2=Harms|first2=Chad|last3=Burgoon|first3=Judee K.|date=October 2003|title=Toward a More Robust Theory and Measure of Social Presence: Review and Suggested Criteria|journal=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments|volume=12|issue=5|pages=456\u2013480|doi=10.1162/105474603322761270|issn=1054-7460}}</ref>\u201d Biocca, Harms & Burgoon contribute to the understanding of social behavior in mediated environments, which allows researchers to predict and measure differences among interfaces and guide the design of new social environments and interfaces\n\n===Organizational norms and perceptions===\nMulticommunicating is especially present in team collaborations. In order to be more effective in their workplace, teams would use different platforms for their communication practices. There are a number of communication platforms such as [[Slack (software)|Slack]] that include multiple '''Social Media Channels''' (social networking platforms and instant messaging). The media capabilities of these platforms, including integrations for diverse information and communication technologies, enable '''[[affordance]]s''' for both highly adaptable and centralized team communication practices. A recent research shows that team communication platforms (also known as TCPs) enable affordances for multicommunication and attention allocation including flexible scaling of '''media modality''' and '''synchronicity'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Anders|first=Abram|date=2016-01-19|title=Team Communication Platforms and Emergent Social Collaboration Practices|journal= International Journal of Business Communication|volume=53|issue=2|pages=224\u2013261|doi=10.1177/2329488415627273|issn=2329-4884}}</ref>\n\nAnother important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn organizational settings, research suggests that individual's decisions to use informational communication technology are influenced by what they observe other members do in the organization, which is positive related to their multicommunicating behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|date=2009|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=|journal=Management Communication Quarterly Online|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> The perception of what others think about multicommunicating is also another significant predictor on this behaviors. Often, people hide the fact that they are multicommunicating from their conversational partners because they report an underlying perception of rudeness or partiality of conversational investment associated with multicommunicating. However, if people perceive that multicommunicating is acceptable in the organizations, they will not feel embarrassed and will engage in this kind of behaviors more often.\n\nDepending on the organizational culture, multicommunicating can become particularly crucial and bear negative effects in a professional or office setting. Conversely, research suggests that employees who follow [[organizational communication]] norms receive higher performance ratings than those who don't. Therefore, if multicommunicating were considered an organizational '[[Norm (social)|norm]]', its practice could also bring positive feedback.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile multicommunicating can be a controversial topic in research and practice, it is an increasingly common organizational realty. Further research into cognitive abilities, organizational settings and expanding virtual work opportunities, as well as technology will likely carry significant findings for our personal and professional lives.\n\n=== Multicommunication on Workplace Productivity ===\nMulticommunication can change the ways in which teams work and interact within the organization. An  important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others. In their research Stephens and Davis (2009) talk about the social influences on electronic multitasking in organizational meetings.<ref name=\"Stephens 63\u201383\">{{cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer|date=2009-06-08|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|volume=23|issue=1|pages=63\u201383|doi=10.1177/0893318909335417|issn=0893-3189}}</ref> [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]<nowiki/>s have infiltrated meetings and allowed a new range of communicative behaviors to emerge. The observation of organizational norms and the perception of others\u2019 thoughts concerning the use of ICTs for multitasking during a meeting explain a considerable amount of variance in how individuals use ICTs to communicate electronically in meetings.<ref name=\"Stephens 63\u201383\" />\n\nRelating to this point, Belanger and Watson (2006) made a study exploring how virtual team members structure their use of multiple media to attain strategic goals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=B\u00e9langer|first=France|last2=Watson-Manheim|first2=Mary Beth|date=July 2006|title=Virtual Teams and Multiple Media: Structuring Media Use to Attain Strategic Goals|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|volume=15|issue=4|pages=299\u2013321|doi=10.1007/s10726-006-9044-8|issn=0926-2644}}</ref> In today\u2019s work environment, individuals working in teams must learn to manage their time for communication and coordination, and to add to this complexity teams can range from completely virtual environments to face-to-face and all the technologies that are involved. Cardon and Dai (2014) did a study that examines the nature of mobile phone use in meetings among Chinese professionals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=W.|first=Cardon, Peter|last2=Ying|first2=Dai|date=2014|title=Mobile Phone Use in Meetings among Chinese Professionals: Perspectives on Multicommunication and Civility|url=https://commons.emich.edu/gabc/vol3/iss1/2/|journal=Global Advances in Business Communication|volume=3|issue=1|issn=2164-1692}}</ref> Using mobile phones in meetings is a form of multicommunicaion, but the etiquette associated with mobile phone use differ across cultures. Multicommunicating via mobile phones in meetings is mostly client-based and relationship-based, and it changes among cultures and across generations.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nCriticisms of multicommunication theory at large are not prevalent considering the obvious reason that multicommunicating is a relatively newly defined and studied behavior. However, due to the fact that multicommunicating has been largely studied for its professional implications, recent critical research suggests that multicommunicating behavior may have adverse effects on individual productivity, <ref>CAMERON A-F and WEBSTER J (2013) Multicommunicating: juggling multiple conversations in the workplace. Information Systems Research 24(2), 352\u2013371.</ref> workplace relationships,<ref>CAMERON A-F and WEBSTER J (2011) Relational outcomes of multicommunicating: integrating incivility and social exchange perspectives. Organization Science 22(3), 754\u2013771, doi:10.1287/orsc.1100.0540.</ref> and stress management.<ref>MARULANDA-CARTER L and JACKSON TW (2012) Effects of e-mail addiction and interruptions on employees. Journal of Systems and Information Technology 14(1), 82\u201394.</ref> \n\nCameron draws from several disciplines, including management and cognitive and social psychology, to provide several misconceptions about multicommunication. After conducting empirical research, she claims that multicommunicating, contrary to popular belief, may render an individual in fact less accessible, less productive, and potentially more rude in certain professional contexts. She points out that multicommunicating behavior, especially among those with a weak ability to focus, has often increased errors, reduced contribution between ongoing conversations, and increased confusion in the workplace.<ref>Ann-Frances, Cameron et al. \u201cFour Common Multicommunicating Misconceptions.\u201d ''European Journal of\u00a0 Information Systems'' 25.5 (2016): 465-471. </ref> In doing so, many people multicommunicate as an uncontrolled habit rather than a strategic form of communication, offering more negative implications than positive. Cameron, however, does not advocate against multicommunication, but rather for people to better understand their multicommunicating behaviors and to practice multicommunicating more intentionally.  \n\nMulticommunicating's practical implications also have drawn criticism in gender studies. Soukup's analysis of [[computer-mediated communication]] through a critical ethnography of gendered chatrooms illustrates the normative forms of behavior among genders online. In distinct gendered chatrooms, masculine participants mostly demonstrated more aggressive and argumentative, while feminine participants mostly sought relationships and intimacy.<ref>Soukup, C. (2000). Building a Theory of Multi-Media CMC: An Analysis, Critique and Integration of Computer-Mediated Communication Theory and Research. ''New Media & Society'', ''2''(4), 407\u2013425. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444800002004002</nowiki></ref> These earlier findings have significant implications on multicommunicating behavior. Paskewitz and Beck later conducted research about texting during workplace meetings and determined that women perceive individuals who practice multicommunicating more negatively than men. At the same time, the gender of the multicommunicator did not play a role in these perceptions.<ref>Paskewitz, Emily A, and Beck, Stephenson J. \u201cExploring Perceptions of Multicommunicator Texting During Meetings.\u201d ''Computers in Human Behavior'' 101 (2019): 238\u2013247.
