The Shamarpa is the second most important teacher of the Karma Kagyu school after the [[Karmapa]]. The Karmapas are sometimes referred to as the Black Hat Lamas, referring to their [[Black Crown]].\n\n[[Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama]], prophesied that \"future Karmapas shall manifest in two [[Trikaya|Nirmanakaya]] forms\". Later, [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]] presented his principal student, Khedrup Drakpa Senge, a ruby-red crown that was an exact replica of his own Black Crown. The Karmapa explained that it symbolised their identical nature and so the lineage of the Shamarpas started. The 14th Shamarpa was recognised by [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIn 1956 Shamar Rinpoche and his brother [[Jigme Rinpoche]] went to [[Tsurphu]], the seat of the Karmapas in Lhasa. The 4 year old Shamarpa showed special abilities, including recognizing a few monks from a previous life at Yangpachen monastery.

The Shamarpa is the second most important teacher of the Karma Kagyu school after the [[Karmapa]]. The Karmapas are sometimes referred to as the Black Hat Lamas, referring to their [[Black Crown]].\n\n[[Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama]], prophesied that \"future Karmapas shall manifest in two [[Trikaya|Nirmanakaya]] forms\". Later, [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]] presented his principal student, Khedrup Drakpa Senge, a ruby-red crown that was an exact replica of his own Black Crown. The Karmapa explained that it symbolised their identical nature and so the lineage of the Shamarpas started. The 14th Shamarpa was recognised by [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIn 1956 Shamar Rinpoche and his brother [[Jigme Rinpoche]] went to [[Tsurphu]], the seat of the Karmapas in Lhasa. The 4 year old Shamarpa showed special abilities, including recognizing a few monks from a previous life at Yangpachen monastery. With these special signs the 16th Karmapa asked the Dalai Lama to revoke the prohibition of the Sharmapa incarnations.

The skin is washed with water and lime ([[Calcium hydroxide]]), but not together.

The \"inside body side\" of the skin is usually the lighter and more refined of the two. The hair follicles may be visible on the outer side, together with any scarring made while the animal was alive. The membrane can also show the pattern of the animal's vein network called the \"veining\" of the sheet.<ref name=\"Codex\">{{Cite web |url=http://codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_physDesc.aspx |title=\"Recording the physical features of Codex Sinaiticus\".

The number of sheets extracted from the piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the given dimensions requested by the order. For example, the average calfskin could provide roughly three and a half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when it is folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a bifolium. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.<ref name=\"daniel\">Thompson, Daniel. \"Medieval Parchment-Making\".

Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in their ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies'', that \"the quire was the scribe's basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages\".<ref>Clemens and Graham 2007, p. 14.</ref> Guidelines are then made on the membrane. They note \"'pricking' is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of its ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text.

The only UK company still producing traditional parchment and vellum is William Cowley (established 1870), which is based in [[Newport Pagnell]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. A modern imitation is made of [[cotton]]. Known as paper vellum, this material is considerably cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and drafting supply stores. Some brands of [[writing paper]] and other sorts of paper use the term \"vellum\" to suggest quality.\n\nVellum is still used for Jewish scrolls, of the [[Torah]] in particular, for luxury book-binding, memorial books, and for various documents in [[calligraphy]].  It is also used on instruments such as the [[banjo]] and the [[bodhran]], although synthetic skins are available for these instruments and have become more commonly used.\n\n==Paper vellum==\nModern imitation vellum is made from plasticized rag cotton or fibers from interior tree bark. Terms include: paper vellum, Japanese vellum, and vegetable vellum.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Paper vellum is usually translucent and its various [[Paper size|sizes]] are often used in applications where tracing is required, such as [[architectural plan]]s.  Its dimensions are more stable than a linen or paper sheet, which is frequently critical in the development of large scaled drawings such as [[blueprint]]s. Paper vellum has also become extremely important in hand or chemical reproduction technology for dissemination of plan copies. Like a high-quality traditional vellum, paper vellum could be produced thin enough to be virtually [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to strong light, enabling a source drawing to be used directly in the reproduction of field-used drawings.<ref>Drafting, 60\u201361; Yee, Rendow, ''Architectural Drawing: A Visual Compendium of Types and Methods'', 4th edition, 2012, John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|1118310446}}, 781118310441, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hphgl8Tu1HEC&pg=PT1532 google]</ref>\n\n==Preservation==\n{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}\nVellum is ideally stored in a stable environment with constant temperature and 30%&nbsp;(\u00b1&nbsp;5%) [[relative humidity]].

The manufacture involves the cleaning, bleaching, stretching on a frame (a \"herse\"), and scraping of the skin with a crescent-shaped knife (a \"lunarium\" or \"lunellum\"). To create tension, scraping is alternated with wetting and drying. A final finish may be achieved by abrading the surface with [[pumice]], and treating with a preparation of lime or chalk to make it accept writing or printing ink.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nModern \"paper vellum\" is made of synthetic plant material, and is called such for its usage and quality similarities.

The only UK company still producing traditional parchment and vellum is William Cowley (established 1870), which is based in [[Newport Pagnell]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. A modern imitation is made of [[cotton]]. Known as paper vellum, this material is considerably cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and drafting supply stores. Some brands of [[writing paper]] and other sorts of paper use the term \"vellum\" to suggest quality.\n\nVellum is still used for Jewish scrolls, of the [[Torah]] in particular, for luxury book-binding, memorial books, and for various documents in [[calligraphy]].  It is also used on instruments such as the [[banjo]] and the [[bodhran]], although synthetic skins are available for these instruments and have become more commonly used.\n\n==Paper vellum==\nModern imitation vellum is made from plasticized rag cotton or fibers from interior tree bark. Terms include: paper vellum, Japanese vellum, and vegetable vellum.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Paper vellum is usually translucent and its various [[Paper size|sizes]] are often used in applications where tracing is required, such as [[architectural plan]]s.  Its dimensions are more stable than a linen or paper sheet, which is frequently critical in the development of large scaled drawings such as [[blueprint]]s. Paper vellum has also become extremely important in hand or chemical reproduction technology for dissemination of plan copies. Like a high-quality traditional vellum, paper vellum could be produced thin enough to be virtually [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to strong light, enabling a source drawing to be used directly in the reproduction of field-used drawings.<ref>Drafting, 60\u201361; Yee, Rendow, ''Architectural Drawing: A Visual Compendium of Types and Methods'', 4th edition, 2012, John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|1118310446}}, 781118310441, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hphgl8Tu1HEC&pg=PT1532 google]</ref>\n\n==Preservation==\n{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}\nVellum is ideally stored in a stable environment with constant temperature and 30%&nbsp;(\u00b1&nbsp;5%) [[relative humidity]].
