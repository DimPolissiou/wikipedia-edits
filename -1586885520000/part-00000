A queen consort usually shares her husband's social [[Royal and noble ranks|rank]] and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical [[title]]s, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers.\n\nIn contrast, a [[queen regnant]] is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a [[monarch]], who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.\n\n==Titles==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe title of [[king consort]] for the husband of a [[queen regnant|reigning queen]] is rare. Examples are [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], in [[Scotland]]; [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine of Bourbon-Vend\u00f4me]] in [[Navarre]]; [[Francis, Duke of C\u00e1diz]], in [[Spain]]; and [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] in [[Portugal]].\n\nWhere some title other than that of king is held by the sovereign, his wife is referred to by the feminine equivalent, such as [[princess consort]] or empress consort.\n\nIn monarchies where [[polygamy]] has been practiced in the past (such as [[Morocco]] and [[Thailand]]), or is practiced today (such as the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nation and the various [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] polities), the number of wives of the king varies. In Morocco, [[King Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed VI]] has broken with tradition and given his wife, [[Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco|Lalla Salma]], the title of princess. Prior to the reign of King Mohammed VI, the Moroccan monarchy had no such title. In [[Thailand]], the king and queen must both be of [[royal descent]]. The king's other consorts are accorded royal titles that confer status.\n\nOther cultures maintain different traditions on queenly status. A Zulu [[chieftain]] designates one of his wives as \"[[Great Wife]]\", which would be the equivalent to queen consort. Conversely, in [[Yorubaland]], all of a chief's consorts are essentially of equal rank. Although one of their number, usually the one who has been married to the chief for the longest time, may be given a [[chieftaincy]] of her own to highlight her relatively higher status when compared to the other wives; she does not share her husband's ritual power as a chieftain. When a woman is to be vested with an authority similar to that of the chief, she is usually a [[Iyalode (title)|lady courtier]] in his service who is not married to him, but who is expected to lead his female subjects on his behalf.\n\n==Role==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nIn general, the consorts of monarchs have no power {{Lang|lat|per se}}, even when their position is [[constitution]]ally or [[statute|statutorily]] recognized. However, often the queen consort of a deceased king (the [[dowager queen]] or [[queen mother]]) has served as [[regent]] if her child, the successor to the throne, was still a minor\u2014for example:\n\n* [[Anne of Kiev]], wife of [[Henry I of France]]\n* [[Queen Munjeong|Munjeong]], mother of [[Myeongjong of Joseon|King Myeongjong of Korea]]\n* [[Mary of Guise]], mother of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]\n* [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]], grandmother of [[Sebastian of Portugal]]\n* [[Marie de Medici]], mother of [[Louis XIII of France]]\n* [[K\u00f6sem Sultan]], mother of [[Sultan Murad IV]] of the Ottoman Empire\n* [[Luisa de Guzm\u00e1n]], mother of [[Afonso VI of Portugal]]\n* [[Lakshmi Bai]], the Rani of Jhansi and mother of Damodar Rao\n* [[Maria Christina of Austria]], mother of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]]\n* [[Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont]], mother of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]\n*[[Anna Khanum]], mother of [[Abbas II of Persia]]\n* [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Helen of Greece]], mother of King [[Michael of Romania]]\n\nBesides these examples, there have been many cases of queens consort being shrewd or ambitious stateswomen and, usually (but not always) unofficially, being among the king's most trusted advisors. In some cases, the queen consort has been the chief power behind her husband's throne; e.g. [[Maria Luisa of Parma]], wife of [[Charles IV of Spain]].\n\n==Examples of queens and empresses consort==\n\n[[File:Annajagiello.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne of Bohemia and Hungary]], consort of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]]]]\n[[File:Sophia Magdalene of Sweden coin c 1785.jpg|thumb|Queen [[Sophia Magdalena of Denmark|Sophia Magdalene]] wearing the crown of the Queen of [[Sweden]].]]\n\n'''Past queens consort''':\n\n* Queen [[Hui-bin Jang|Jang]], consort to [[Sukjong of Joseon]].

Ciders can be classified from dry to sweet. Their appearance ranges from cloudy with sediment to completely clear, and their colour ranges from almost colourless to amber to brown. The variations in clarity and colour are mostly due to filtering between pressing and [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. Some apple varieties will produce a clear cider without any need for filtration. Both sparkling and still ciders are made; the sparkling variety is the more common.\n\nModern, mass-produced ciders closely resemble [[sparkling wine]] in appearance. More traditional brands tend to be darker and cloudier. They are often stronger than the mass-produced varieties and taste more strongly of apples. Almost colourless, white cider has the same apple juice content as conventional cider but is harder to create because the cider maker has to blend various apples to create a clearer liquid. White ciders tend to be sweeter and more refreshing. They are typically 7\u20138 %&nbsp;ABV in strength. Black cider, by contrast, is dry amber premium cider which has an alcohol content of 7\u20138 %&nbsp;ABV. The descriptor black usually comes after the brand name such as ''Union Black'' and ''Barnstormer Black''.\n\n== Cider styles ==\n===Geography and origins===\n\nCider is an ancient beverage. No one knows when or where it was first made, because the native distribution of its principal component, the apple, is so widespread, from the Near East to northwestern Europe. In the cider market, ciders can be broken down into two main styles, standard and specialty. The first group consists of modern ciders and heritage ciders. Modern ciders are produced from culinary apples such as [[Gala (apple)|Gala]]. Heritage ciders are produced from heritage, cider specific, crab or wild apples, like [[Golden Russet]]. Historically, cider was made from the only resources available to make it,<ref name=\"naborg\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.northamericanbrewers.org/about/contributed-articles-by-naba-members/cider-styles-a-primer/|title=North American Brewing Association|last=Beckwith|first=Bob|date=May 18, 2000|website=North American Brewing Association}}</ref> so style wasn't a large factor when considering the production process. Apples were historically confined to the cooler climates of Western Europe and Britain where civilisation was slow to develop record keeping.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delage|first=Elisabeth|last2=Bohuon|first2=G.|last3=Baron|first3=A.|last4=Drilleau|first4=J.-F.|date=August 1991|title=High-performance liquid chromatography of the phenolic compounds in the juice of some French cider apple varieties|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=555|issue=1\u20132|pages=125\u2013136|doi=10.1016/s0021-9673(01)87172-7|issn=0021-9673}}</ref> Cider was first made from [[crab apples]], ancestors of the bittersweet and bittersharp apples used by today's English cider makers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DuPont|first=M.

Cider styles evolved based on the methods used, the apples available and local tastes. Production techniques developed, as with most technology, by trial and error. In fact, the variables were nearly too widespread to track, including: spontaneous fermentation, the type of vessels used, environmental conditions, and the apple varieties. Refinements came much later when cider became a commercial product and the process was better understood. However, since there is growing popularity in ciders, the production of specialty styles has begun to increase.<ref name=\"naborg\" />\n\n===Modern ciders===\n\nModern ciders are made from culinary apples and are lower in [[tannin]]s and higher in acidity than other cider styles.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://ciderassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/USACM-Style-Guidelines-V1pt1.pdf|title=Cider Style Guide|last=United States Association of Cider Makers|date=October 2017|website=USACM}}</ref> Common culinary apples used in modern ciders include [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]], [[Golden Delicious]], [[Jonagold]], [[Granny Smith]], [[Gala (apple)|Gala]], and [[Fuji (apple)|Fuji]].<ref name=\":2\" /> A sweet or low alcohol cider may tend to have a strong aromatic and flavour character of apple, while drier and higher alcohol ciders will tend to produce a wider range of fruity aromas and flavours.<ref name=\":2\" /> Modern ciders vary in color from pale to yellow and can range from brilliant to a hazy clarity.<ref name=\":2\" /> Clarity can be altered through various cider making practices, depending on the cider maker's intentions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Heritage ciders===\n\nHeritage ciders are made from both culinary and cider apples, including bittersweet, bittersharp, heirlooms, wild apples, and crabapples.<ref name=\":2\" /> Common apples used in heritage cider production include [[Dabinett]], [[Kingston Black Apple|Kingston Black]], [[Roxbury Russet]], and [[Wickson]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Heritage ciders are higher in tannins than modern ciders.

There is no restriction to apple varieties used and the list of specialty styles continues to expand. Listed on the USACM Cider Style Guide, specialty styles include: fruit, hopped, spiced, wood-aged, sour, and iced ciders. Fruit ciders have other fruit or juices added before or after fermentation, like cherries, blueberries, and cranberries.<ref name=\":2\" /> Hopped cider is fermented with added [[hops]], common [[List of hop varieties|hop varieties]] being [[Cascade hop|Cascade]], Citra, Galaxy, and Mosaic.<ref name=\":2\" /> Spiced ciders have various spices added to the cider before, during, or after fermentation.<ref name=\":2\" /> Spices like cinnamon and ginger are popular to use in production.<ref name=\":2\" /> Wood-aged ciders are ciders that are either fermented or aged in various types of wood barrels, to aid in extraction of woody, earthy flavours.<ref name=\":2\" /> Sour ciders are high acid ciders that are produced with non-standard, non-[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Saccharomyces]] [[yeast]] and bacteria, which enhance [[Acetic acid|acetic]] and [[Lactic acid fermentation|lactic acid]] production, in order to reach a sour profile.<ref name=\":2\" /> Ice ciders can be made by using pre-pressed frozen juice or frozen whole apples. Whole apples either come frozen from the orchard, dependent on harvest date, or are stored in a freezer prior to pressing. When the pre-pressed juice or whole apples freeze, sugars are concentrated and mostly separated from the water. Whole apples are then pressed in order to extract the concentrated juice. For the pre-pressed juice the concentrated solution is drawn off while thawing occurs.<ref name=\":2\" /> Although, according to the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB) cider producers can only label a product 'Ice Cider' if it is produced from apples naturally frozen outdoors.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTwo styles not mentioned in the USACM Cider Style Guide are Ros\u00e9 and Sparkling Cider.

There are many hundreds of varieties of cultivars developed specifically for cider making.\n\n[[File:Tou d'preinseu, Morel Farm, J\u00e8rri.jpg|thumb|left|Few traditional horse-drawn circular cider presses are still in use, but many may still be seen used as garden ornaments, flower planters, or architectural features]]\n\nOnce the apples are gathered from trees in [[orchards]] they are ''scratted'' (ground down) into what is called ''[[pomace]]'' or ''pommage''. Historically this was done using pressing stones with circular troughs, or by a cider mill. Cider mills were traditionally driven by the hand, water-mill, or horse-power. In modern times, they are likely to be powered by electricity. The pulp is then transferred to the cider press and built up in layers known as ''cheeses'' into a block.\n\nTraditionally the method for squeezing the juice from the apples involves placing sweet straw or haircloths between the layers of pomace. This will alternate with slatted ash-wood racks until there is a pile of ten or twelve layers.\n\nThe ''set'' is then subjected to increasing degrees of pressure until all the 'must' or juice is squeezed from the pomace. This juice, after being strained in a coarse hair-sieve, is then put into either open vats or closed casks. The pressed pulp is given to farm animals as winter feed, composted, discarded or used to make [[liqueur]]s.<ref name=\"Somerset Cider\">{{cite web | first= James | last= Crowden | title= Somerset Cider | publisher= [[Somerset County Council]] | url= http://www.somerset.gov.uk/celebratingsomerset/cidermap/home.htm | accessdate= 2006-06-20 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060524050427/http://www.somerset.gov.uk/celebratingsomerset/cidermap/home.htm | archive-date= 2006-05-24 | url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Fermentation ===\n{{Main|Fermentation (food)}}\n\nFermentation of ciders occurs by a very similar mechanism to the fermentation of wine. The process of alcoholic fermentation is characterised by the conversion of simple sugars into ethanol by yeasts, especially ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''.<ref name=\"whenWhy\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dashko | first1 = S. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = N. | last3 = Compagno | first3 = C. | last4 = Pi\u0161kur | first4 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Why, when, and how did yeast evolve alcoholic fermentation? | url = | journal = FEMS Yeast Research | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 826\u2013832 | doi = 10.1111/1567-1364.12161 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This is because, as \"Crabtree positive\" yeasts, they produce ethanol even during aerobic fermentation; in contrast, Crabtree-negative yeasts produce only biomass and carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"whenWhy\" /> This adaptation allows them a competitive edge in the fermentation of ciders due to their high alcohol tolerance, and because of this tolerance, it is common for ciders to be fermented to dryness, although that is not always the case. Fermentations will carry on until the yeasts run out of nutrients and can no longer metabolise, resulting in a \"stuck\" fermentation,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Boudreau | first1 = T.

This temperature would be low for most kinds of fermentation, but is beneficial for cider, as it leads to slower fermentation with less loss of delicate aromas. Fermentation can occur due to natural yeasts that are present in the must; alternately, some cider makers add cultivated strains of cider yeast, such as ''[[Saccharomyces bayanus]]''.\n\nDuring the initial stages of fermentation, there are elevated levels of carbon dioxide as the yeasts multiply and begin to break down the sugar into ethanol.<ref name=\"The Science of Cidermaking\"/> In addition to fermentative metabolism of yeast, certain organoleptic compounds are formed that have an effect on the quality of cider, such as other alcohols, esters and other volatile compounds.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arias Abrodo|first1=Pilar|title=Fatty Acid Composition of Cider Obtained by traditional or controlled fermentation|journal=Food Chemistry|date=2005|pages=183\u2013187}}</ref> After fermentation, racking occurs into a clean vessel, trying to leave behind as much yeast as possible.<ref name=\"The Science of Cidermaking\"/> Shortly before the fermentation consumes all the sugar, the liquor is \"racked\" ([[siphon]]ed) into new vats. This leaves dead yeast cells and other undesirable material at the bottom of the old vat. At this point, it becomes important to exclude airborne acetic bacteria, so vats are filled completely to exclude air. The fermenting of the remaining available sugar generates a small amount of carbon dioxide that forms a protective layer, reducing air contact. This final fermentation creates a small amount of [[carbonation]]. Extra sugar may be added specifically for this purpose. Racking is sometimes repeated if the liquor remains too cloudy.\n\nApple-based juice may also be combined with fruit to make a fine cider; fruit pur\u00e9es or flavourings can be added, such as [[grape]], [[cherry]], [[raspberry]], or [[cranberry]].\n\nThe cider is ready to drink after a three-month fermentation period, although it is more often matured in the vats for up to three years.<ref>{{cite web| title= History of cider| publisher= W3commerce| year= 2000| url= http://www.history-of-cider.co.uk/index.html| accessdate= 2006-06-20| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061001010518/http://www.history-of-cider.co.uk/index.html| archive-date= 2006-10-01| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Blending and bottling ===\n[[File:Cider making Jersey.jpg|thumb|upright|Layers of pomace wrapped in canvas]]\n\nFor larger-scale cider production, ciders from vats produced from different varieties of apple may be blended to accord with market taste. If the cider is to be bottled, usually some extra sugar is added for sparkle. Higher quality ciders can be made using the [[Sparkling wine production|champagne method]], but this is expensive in time and money and requires special corks, bottles, and other equipment.

Tannins are polyphenol compounds that are naturally occurring in apples. Depending on the type of cider apple the producer is using, the tannin levels will be different. The more well-known ciders typically have lower tannin levels while traditional ciders have more.

Inoculation with different strains of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and other yeast strains with strong fermentative metabolism traits, including ''[[Saccharomyces bayanus]]'' and ''[[Torulaspora delbrueckii]]'' strains, has been shown to produce few differences in cider phenolic compounds, save for concentrations of phloretin (see [[Phloretin]]) in samples that underwent malolactic fermentation. Spontaneous fermentation commenced by indigenous yeasts and finished by ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' can produce ciders with similar concentrations of important non-volatile acids (see [[nonvolatile acid]]), including lactic acid, succinic acid and acetic acid, while concentrations of volatile compounds such as methanol and 1-butanol, were present in different concentrations, dependent on apple cultivar. Extending the time during which the cider remains in contact with yeast lees increased concentrations of most of the minor volatile compounds present, especially fatty acids, ethyl esters and alcohols. Major volatile compound concentrations did not exhibit a similar pattern, with ''iso''-butanol, amyl alcohols, and acetoine decreasing 1-propanol decreasing.\n\nSparkling ciders can be produced using different methods, including the Champenoise method used to produce champagne. Use of different strains of indigenous ''Saccharomyces'' to perform secondary fermentation produced ciders with consistent alcohol and acidic characteristics, variable glycerol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, propanol, ''i''-butanol and 2-phenylethanol characteristics and acceptable sensory analysis results.\n\n== Yeast ==\nThe selection of yeast used for cider production is critical to the quality of the final product. As with other fermented beverages, like [[wine]] and [[beer]], the strain of yeast used to carry out the [[alcoholic fermentation]] also converts precursor molecules into the odorants found in the final product. In general, two broad categories of yeast are used for cider making: commercially developed strains and wild, or autochthonous, strains. In either case, the species tend to be either ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' or ''Saccharomyces bayanus.'' Commercial strains are available for purchase from numerous distributors, and their characteristics are typically outlined in manuals from the companies. Selection for fermentation may be based on a yeast's ability to ferment at particular sugar concentrations, temperatures, or pH. Some producers may also select for yeasts that produce [[Killer yeast|killer factors]], allowing them to out-compete other yeast in the juice, or they may select yeast that contribute [[mouthfeel]] or specific aromas to the cider.<ref>Scott Laboratories Cider Handbook (2015-2016). http://www.scottlab.com/pdf/2015CiderHandbook.pdf</ref>\n\n\"Wild fermentations\" occur when autochthonous yeast are allowed to carry out fermentation; indigenous yeasts can spontaneously initiate fermentation without any addition of other yeast strains by the cider maker. Autochthonous yeasts are wild yeast strains that are endemic to the specific location in which a cider is produced; this is the traditional method used for cider making, and many producers feel that the strains unique to their cidery contribute a sense of [[terroir]] to their product. Wild yeast populations can be incredibly diverse and commonly include species of ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Pichia]]'', ''[[Hanseniaspora]]'' and ''[[Metschnikowia]].''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valles|first=B|last2=Pando Bedri\u00f1ana|first2=R|last3=Tascon|first3=N|last4=Simon|first4=A|last5=Madrera|first5=R|date=2007|title=Yeast species associated with the spontaneous fermentation of cider|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=25\u201331|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2006.04.001|pmid=16943091|issn=0740-0020}}</ref> Typically, the native yeast take up residence in the cidery, and can be important to the unique flavour of the product.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pando Bedri\u00f1ana|first=R.|last2=Querol Sim\u00f3n|first2=A.|last3=Su\u00e1rez Valles|first3=B.|date=2010|title=Genetic and phenotypic diversity of autochthonous cider yeasts in a cellar from Asturias|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=27|issue=4|pages=503\u2013508|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2009.11.018|pmid=20417399|issn=0740-0020}}</ref> Although it was once believed that the native yeast carrying out these spontaneous fermentations also came from the orchard itself, research has shown that the microbes cultured from apples in the orchard do not align with the microbes found during the various stages of fermentation, suggesting that the sole source of native yeast is the cidery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alonso|first=Sergio|last2=Laca|first2=Amanda|last3=Rendueles|first3=Manuel|last4=Mayo|first4=Baltasar|last5=D\u00edaz|first5=Mario|date=2015-03-19|title=Cider Apple Native Microbiota Characterization by PCR-DGGE|journal=Journal of the Institute of Brewing|language=en|volume=121|issue=2|pages=287\u2013289|doi=10.1002/jib.220|issn=0046-9750}}</ref> Indigenous yeast strain population dynamics are affected by climatic conditions, apple variety, geographic location, and cider making technologies used.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Genetic and phenotypic diversity of autochthonous cider yeasts in a cellar from Asturias|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b6e/43f01d51b79048dc42342e766a7f9b742736.pdf|journal=Food Microbiology|via=Elsevier|year=2010}}</ref> These variables cause different regions to host unique endemic yeast populations.

Calvados is made throughout [[Normandy]], France, not just in the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]] [[Department (country subdivision)|d\u00e9partement]]. It is made from cider by double distillation. In the first pass, the result is a liquid containing 28\u201330% alcohol. After the second pass, the concentration of alcohol is about 40%.\n\nApplejack is a strong alcoholic beverage made in North America by concentrating cider, either by the traditional method of [[Fractional freezing|freeze distillation]] or by true evaporative [[distillation]]. In traditional freeze distillation, a barrel of cider is left outside during the winter. When the temperature is low enough, the water in the cider starts to freeze. If the ice is removed, the (now more concentrated) alcoholic solution is left behind in the barrel. If the process is repeated often enough, and the temperature is low enough, the alcohol concentration is raised to 20\u201330% alcohol by volume. Home production of applejack is popular in Europe.\n\nA few producers in [[Quebec]] and England, inspired by [[ice wine]], have developed [[ice cider]] (French: ''cidre de glace''). For this product, the apples are frozen either before or after being harvested. Its alcohol concentration is 9\u201313 % [[alcohol by volume|ABV]].\n\nA popular [[Ap\u00e9ritif and digestif|ap\u00e9ritif]] in Normandy is ''[[pommeau]]'', a drink produced by blending unfermented apple juice and apple brandy in the barrel (the high alcoholic content of the spirit prevents fermentation of the juice and the blend takes on the character of the aged barrel).\n\n[[Cocktail]]s may include cider. Besides [[Kir (cocktail)|kir]] and [[Snakebite (beer cocktail)|snakebite]], an example is [[Black Velvet (beer cocktail)|Black Velvet]] in a version of which cider may replace champagne.\n\nCider may also be used to make [[vinegar]]. [[Apple cider vinegar]] is noted for its high acidity and flavour.\n\n== Related drinks ==\n\nOther fruits can be used to make cider-like drinks. The most popular is made from fermented [[pear]] juice, known as perry. It is called ''poir\u00e9'' in France and produced mostly in [[Lower Normandy]] there. A branded sweet perry known as [[Babycham]], marketed principally as a women's drink and sold in miniature champagne-style bottles, was once popular but has become unfashionable. Another related drink is a form of mead, known as [[mead|cyser]]. Cyser is a blend of honey and apple juice fermented together.\n\nAlthough not widely made in modern times, various other [[pome]] fruits can produce palatable drinks. [[Apicius]], in Book II of ''[[De re coquinaria]]'', includes a recipe calling for [[quince]] cider.\n\n== National varieties ==\n=== Europe ===\n\nBefore the development of rapid long distance transportation, regions of cider consumption generally coincided with those of cider production. As such, cider was said to be more common than wine in 12th-century [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]<ref>Fletcher, R.A., ''Liber Sancti Jacobi''</ref> and certainly the idea of it was present in England by the Conquest of 1066, using crab apples: the word \"Wassail\" is derived from a Saxon phrase, w\u00e6s h\u00e6l\": it is what would have been said by Saxons as a toast at [[Yuletide]]. Southern Italy, by contrast, though indeed possessing apples, had no tradition for cider apples at all and like its other neighbours on the Mediterranean Sea preserved the Roman tradition of apples as an ingredient for desserts, as evidenced by the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii, descriptions by Classical writers and playwrights, and [[Apicius]], whose famous cookbook does not contain a single recipe for fermenting apples but rather includes them as part of main courses, especially accompanying pork.\n\n==== Austria ====\n\nIn Austria, cider is made in the southwest of [[Lower Austria]], the so-called \"[[Mostviertel]]\" and in [[Upper Austria]] as well as in parts of [[Styria]]. Almost every farmer there has some apple or pear trees. Many farmers also have a kind of inn called a \"Mostheuriger\", similar to a [[heuriger]] for new wine, where they serve cider and traditional fare. Non-sparkling cider is typically called \"Most\". Austria's most popular sparkling cider [[Goldkehlchen]] is produced in south [[Styria]] and marketed internationally since 2013 by the company founders Adam and Eva.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==== Belgium ====\n\nCidrerie Ruwet SA, established in 1898, is the only independent craft cider producer in Belgium. In addition to their own brand Ruwet, the company produces 'high-end' ciders for private labels.\n\nHeineken owns the other Belgian cider maker Stassen SA, who in addition to their own local brands such as Strassen X Cider also produce Strongbow Jacques, a 5.5% ABV cider with [[cherry]], [[raspberry]], and [[blackcurrant]] flavours. [[Zonhoven]]-based Konings NV specialises in private label ciders for European retailers and offers a wide variety of flavours and packaging options to the beverage industry. ''[[Stella Artois]] Cidre'' is produced in Zonhoven and has been marketed since 2011.<ref>{{cite web | publisher= Knack | title= Konings maakt Stella Artois Cidre | date= 30 March 2011 | url= http://trends.knack.be/economie/bedrijven/konings-maakt-stella-artois-cidre/article-normal-231333.html | accessdate= 2012-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Denmark ====\n\nDespite a strong apple tradition, Denmark has little cider production. Six places that produce cider in Denmark are Pomona (since 2003), Fej\u00f8 Cider (since 2003), Dancider (since 2004), \u00d8rb\u00e6k Bryggeri (since 2006), Ciderprojektet (since 2008), and Svaneke Bryghus (since 2009). All are inspired mainly by English and French cider styles. The assortment of imported ciders has grown significantly since 2000, prior to that only ciders from Sweden, primarily non-alcoholic, were generally available. The leading cider on the Danish market is made by [[CULT A/S]].<ref>Business.dk http://www.business.dk/foedevarer/cult-overhaler-somersby-cider</ref>\nIn 2008, [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] launched an alcoholic cider in Denmark called [[Somersby cider]] which has an alcohol content of 4.7% and a sweet taste.<ref>{{cite web | title= Somersby Cider | publisher= Carlsberg Group | url= http://www.carlsberggroup.com/brands/Pages/SomersbyCider.aspx | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pressesystemet.dk/default.asp?id=1910 Very ApS | Somersby Cider byder for\u00e5ret velkommen! - Pressesystemet.dk<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526205108/http://www.pressesystemet.dk/default.asp?id=1910 |date=2012-05-26 }}</ref>\n\n==== Finland ====\n\nThe best-known brands labelled as cider are ''[[Golden Cap (cider)|Golden Cap]]'', ''[[Fizz (cider)|Fizz]]'', and ''Upcider''. They typically contain 4.5\u20134.7 %vol of alcohol. Virtually all Finnish \"cider\" is produced from fermented apple (or pear) juice concentrate mixed with water and is not cider as per the traditional description of the drink. Flavoured ciders, available in a large selection, are very popular and widely available in stores, with a variety of flavours ranging from forest berry to rhubarb and vanilla.\n\n==== France ====\n\nFrance was one of the countries that inherited a knowledge of apple cultivation from both the Celtic [[Gauls]] and the later [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who ruled the country for approximately 500 years: both had knowledge of grafting and keeping apples. The earliest mentions of cider in this country go back to the Greek geographer [[Strabo]]: he speaks of the profusion of apple trees in [[Gaul]] and describes a cider-like drink.<ref>{{cite web | title= About \"Cidre\" | publisher= La Chouette | url= http://www.lachouettecider.com/en/about-cidre/?accept-condition=1 | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 9th century, Charlemagne, in the Capitulars, ordered skilled brewers (the Sicetores) to always be present on his estates to make him ale, \"pomm\u00e9\" (pomacium), perry and all the liquors liable to be used as drinks, and also ordered an expansion of planting apple trees in what is now Northern France.<ref>{{cite web | title= Cider History | publisher= Apple Journal | url= http://www.applejournal.com/fr05.htm | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cidre Artisinal from Brittany.jpg|thumb|upright|Artisanal cider from Brittany]]\n\nFrench ''cidre'' ({{IPA-fr|sid\u0281}}) is an alcoholic drink produced predominantly in Normandy and [[Brittany]]. It varies in strength from below 4% alcohol to considerably more. Cidre Doux is a sweet cider, usually up to 3% in strength. 'Demi-Sec' is 3\u20135% and Cidre Brut is a strong dry cider of 4.5% alcohol and above. Most French ciders are sparkling. Higher quality cider is sold in champagne-style bottles (''cidre bouch\u00e9''). Many ciders are sold in corked bottles, but some screw-top bottles exist.\nIn cr\u00eaperies ([[cr\u00eape]] restaurants) in Brittany, cider is generally served in traditional ceramic bowls (or wide cups) rather than glasses. A ''kir Breton'' (or ''kir normand'') is a cocktail [[ap\u00e9ritif]] made with cider and [[Cr\u00e8me de cassis|cassis]], rather than white wine and cassis for the traditional ''[[kir (cocktail)|kir]]''. The Domfrontais, in the [[Orne]] (Basse-Normandie), is famous for its pear cider (poir\u00e9). The ''calvados du Domfrontais'' is made of cider and poir\u00e9.\n\nSome cider is also made in southwestern France, in the French part of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. It is a traditional drink there and is making a recovery. Ciders produced here are generally of the style seen in the Spanish part of the Basque Country. A recently popular variety is the Akived, a piquant drink served cold.\n\n[[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], from Normandy, and Lambig from Brittany are a spirits made of cider through a process called double [[distillation]]. In the first pass, the result is a liquid containing 28%\u201330% alcohol. In a second pass, the amount of alcohol is augmented to about 40%.\n\n==== Germany ====\n{{Main|Apfelwein}}\n[[File:Apfelwein Dose Odenwald 20100221.jpg|thumb|right|upright|\"Apfelwein\" by [[Bembel-With-Care]], made from traditional [[Odenwald|Odenw\u00e4lder]] orchards]]\n\nGerman cider, usually called ''[[Apfelwein]]'' (apple wine), and regionally known as ''Ebbelwoi'', ''Apfelmost'' (apple must), ''Viez'' (from [[Latin]] ''vice'', the second or substitute wine), or ''Saurer Most'' (sour must), has an alcohol content of 5.5\u20137% and a tart, sour taste.\n\nGerman cider is mainly produced and consumed in [[Hessen]], particularly in the [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], [[Wetterau]], and [[Odenwald]] areas, in Moselfranken, [[Merzig]] ([[Saarland]]) and the [[Trier]] area, as well as the lower [[Saar (river)|Saar]] area and the region bordering on Luxembourg and in the area along the [[Neckar]] River in [[Swabia]]. In these regions, several large producers, as well as numerous small, private producers, often use traditional recipes. An official ''Viez'' route or cider route connects [[Saarburg]] with the border to Luxembourg.\n\n==== Ireland ====\n[[File:Magners cider.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Magners cider]]\n\nCider is a popular drink in Ireland. A single cider, [[Bulmers (Republic of Ireland)|Bulmers]], dominates sales in Ireland: owned by [[C&C Group plc|C&C]] and produced in [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]], Bulmers has a connected history to the British Bulmers cider brand up until 1949. Outside the Republic of Ireland, C&C brand their cider as Magners. It is very popular in Ireland to drink cider over ice and encouraged in their advertising. [[Cidona]], a non-alcoholic version of Bulmers, is a popular [[soft drink]] in Ireland and used to be a C&C-owned brand. However, in recent years, other ciders have begun to take a large share in the market, for example, Heineken's 'Orchard Thieves'.\n\nThere has been a renaissance in the smaller artisanal cider producers since 2010. These now number more than a dozen across the island of Ireland and offer the consumer a broad range of differing, typically non-mainstream flavour profiles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciderireland.com|title=Cider Ireland {{!}} the best source for real cider in Ireland|website=www.ciderireland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Orchard Thieves - Heineken Ireland|publisher=Heineken|url=http://www.heinekenireland.ie/Brands/Orchard-Thieves/#| accessdate=26 October 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Italy ====\n\nCider was once widely produced in [[northern Italy]]'s apple growing regions, with a marked decline during [[Economy of Italy under Fascism, 1922\u20131943|fascist rule]], due to the introduction of a law banning the industrial production of alcoholic beverages derived from fruits of less than 7% [[ABV]], which was aimed at protecting [[Italian wine|wine producers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sottocoperta.net/cucina/enologia/art24.htm |title=SIDRO: TRA I FOLLETTI E LE FATE&nbsp;... |author=Henry Tiziana |publisher=sottocoperta.net |accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref>\nPresent laws and regulations are favourable to cider makers, but production has only survived in a few [[Alps|alpine]] locations, mostly in the regions of [[Trentino]], and in [[Piedmont]], where it is known as ''vin \u00ebd pom'' (apple wine) or ''pomada'', because it traditionally was left to ferment in a vat along with grape [[pomace]], giving it a distinctive reddish colour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.specialissimo.it/eventi/osservatorio-sidro.asp |title=Osservatorio per il sidro |publisher=specialissimo.it |accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the Netherlands, cider is not as commonly available as in its surrounding countries. In 2007, [[Heineken]] started testing a cider-based drink branded [[Jillz]] in a number of bars throughout the country. The beverage, an [[alcopop]] made by blending sparkling water, fruit flavouring, malt, and cider, is marketed towards female drinkers as an alternative to beer. At the same time, Heineken also introduced Strongbow Gold as a secondary brand to provide the choice of a real cider, which was targeted to a male audience. Both beverages contain 5% alcohol by volume, which is similar to a typical draught beer in the Netherlands. Other brands are available in supermarkets, most noticeably Magners and Savanna Dry,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savannacider.nl/info.html|title=Savanna Cider|accessdate=28 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702113132/http://www.savannacider.nl/info.html|archive-date=2 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in liquor stores, generally, a broader range may be obtained.\n\n====Norway====\nIn Norway, cider (sider) is a naturally fermented apple juice. Pear juice is sometimes mixed with the apple to get a better fermenting process started.\n\nThree brands of sparkling cider with an abv of approximately 10% are available to the Norwegian public through distribution by the monopoly outlet [[Vinmonopolet]], ''Hardanger Sider Sprudlande'' from [[Hardanger]], ''Krunesider'' from [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] sourcing apples from Hardanger, and ''Liersider'' from [[Lier, Norway|Lier]].<ref name=BT>{{cite web |last=Hofseth |first=Arne, ''Bergens Tidende'' |title=Sprudlande Hardanger i stettglas |url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/hordaland/article271897.ece |date=2006-05-29 |language=Norwegian |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316050112/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/hordaland/article271897.ece |archive-date=2007-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=VG>{{cite web |last=Jacobsen |first=Aase E., ''VG'' |title=Brusende nasjonalf\u00f8lelse |url=http://www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=139419 |date=2006-05-29 |language=Norwegian |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112061911/http://www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=139419 |archive-date=2009-01-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In line with the law of 1975 prohibiting all advertising of alcoholic beverages of abv above 2.5%,<ref name=alkoloven>{{cite web |last=Stortinget |title=Alkoholloven |url=http://www.stortinget.no/inno/2004/200405-019-005.html |language=Norwegian |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512173522/http://www.stortinget.no/inno/2004/200405-019-005.html |archive-date=2011-05-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the products receive little exposure despite a few favourable press reviews.<ref name=VG/><ref name=aperitif/>\n\nCiders of low alcohol levels are widely available, mostly brands imported from Sweden; carbonated soft drinks with no alcoholic content may also be marketed as \"cider\".<ref name=aperitif>{{cite web |last=\u00d8rjas\u00e6ter |first=Lars Ola, ''Aperitif'' |title=N\u00f8dvendig opprydding |url=http://www.aperitif.no/index.db2?id=82063 |date=2005-04-20 |language=Norwegian |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229200758/http://www.aperitif.no/index.db2?id=82063 |archive-date=2008-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Portugal====\nCider was once very popular in [[northern Portugal]]<ref name=\"Ref-1\">{{cite web |url= http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/1504.pdf |title=A Regi\u00e3o dos Vinhos Verdes |page=139|author=H\u00e9lder Marques|publisher=Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|year= 1987|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> where its production was larger than wine production until the 11th century,<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/> but nowadays, its popularity has decreased and it is mostly consumed in the coasts of Minho, \u00c2ncora e Lima, where it is used as a refreshment for thirst.

Asturias amounts more than 80% of the whole production of Spain. The consumption of cider in Asturias is of 54 litres per person/year, probably the highest in any European region.\nOne of the most popular ciders in Spain is called \"El Gaitero\" (the bagpipe player) which can be found everywhere in Spain and which is produced in this region. However, it must not be confused with the traditional Asturian cider as it is a sparkling cider more in the way of French ciders. It is a factory produced cider, sweet and very foamy, much like lambrusco, different from the more artisan and traditional cider productions. Recently, new apple tree plantations have been started in grounds belonging to the old coal mines, once important in Asturias.\n\nThe first testimony about cider in Asturias was made by Greek geographer Strabo in 60 BC.\n\nThe traditional Asturian ''sidra'' is a still cider of 4\u20138% strength, although there are other varieties. Traditionally, it is served in ''sidrer\u00edas'' and ''chigres'', pubs specialising in cider where it is also possible to have other drinks as well as traditional food. One of the most outstanding characteristics is that it is poured in very small quantities from a height into a wide glass, with the arm holding the bottle extended upwards and the one holding the glass extended downwards. This technique is called ''escanciar un cul\u00edn'' (also ''echar un cul\u00edn'') and is done to get air bubbles into the drink (''espalmar''), thus giving it a sparkling taste like Champagne that lasts a very short time.\nCider is also poured from barrels in the traditional Espichas.\n\n[[File:Sagardotegian txotxetik edaten.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basque people]] drinking cider in a ''[[sagardotegi]]'' (cider house)]]\nCider has also been popular in the Basque Country for centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.applejournal.com/fr05.htm|quote=\"...Before the Christian era, the various peoples of Europe had succeeded in producing beverages more or less similar to cider from a variety of fruit.

From the 1980s, government and gastronomic associations have worked to revive this culture in all Basque regions. Known as ''sagardoa'' (IPA: /s\u033aa'gardoa/), it is drunk either bottled or in a [[cider house]] (called a ''[[sagardotegi]]''), where it is poured from barrels. Most of \"sagardotegis\" are in the north of [[Gipuzkoa]] (Astigarraga, Hernani, Urnieta, and Usurbil), but they can be found everywhere in Gipuzkoa, the northwest of [[Navarre]] and the [[northern Basque country]].\n\nCider tasting events are popular in the Basque province of Gipuzkoa, where stalls are set up on the street selling the drink from several producers at cheap prices and served until stock runs out.\n\n====Sweden====\n[[File:Rekorderlig berries.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A glass of [[Rekorderlig]] wild-berries cider]]\nDue to Swedish law, stores in Sweden cannot sell cider with less than 15 percentage juice by volume under the name Cider.<ref name=\"Livsmedelsverkets f\u00f6reskrifter om cider | LIVSFS 2005:11(H 161) (Swedish)\">[http://www.slv.se/upload/dokument/Lagstiftning/2005-2006/2005-11.pdf Livsmedelsverkets f\u00f6rfattningssamling LIVSFS 2005:11 (H 161)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511161632/http://www.slv.se/upload/dokument/Lagstiftning/2005-2006/2005-11.pdf |date=2011-05-11 }}, (2009-10-21) (in Swedish).</ref> \"Cider\" with none or less than 15% juice is instead usually sold as ''\"Apple/Pear beverage of cider character\"'' (Swedish: ''\"\u00c4pple-/P\u00e4rondryck med Ciderkarakt\u00e4r\"'').

The drink was made popular in the 19th century when apple production increased due to progress in [[pomology]]. At the turn of the century, cider consumption was at 28.1 litres per person. In the 1920s, advantages in the [[pasteurisation]] of apple juice and the emerging [[temperance movement]] led to a strong decrease of cider production.<ref name=\"Kulinarisches Erbe der Schweiz (German)\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160405192315/http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/product.aspx?id=448 Die Texte zu den Produkten sind in der Regel in der jeweiligen Landessprache abgefasst] (German)</ref>\n\nToday, typical Swiss cider consists of fermented apple juice mixed with 30% fresh juice which is added for sweetness.

The former are made using a much higher percentage of true [[cider apple]]s and so are richer in tannins and sharper in flavour. Kent and East Anglia ciders tend to use a higher percentage of or are exclusively made from, culinary and dessert fruit; they tend to be clearer, more vinous and lighter in body and flavour.\n\nAt one end of the scale are the traditional, small [[farm]]-produced varieties. These are non-carbonated and usually cloudy orange in appearance. Britain's West Country contains many of these farms which have an abundance of ancient varieties of specialist cider-apples. Production is often on such a small scale, the product being sold only at the site of manufacture or in local [[public house|pubs]] and shops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/travel/fare-of-the-country-england-s-realm-of-cider-with-a-kick.html?sec=travel&pagewanted=1 |title=Fare of the country; England's Realm Of Cider With a Kick|date=1989-04-02|accessdate=2006-06-20 |work=The New York Times | first=Paul | last=Lewis}}</ref> At the other end of the scale are the factories mass-producing brands such as [[Strongbow Cider|Strongbow]] and [[Blackthorn Cider|Blackthorn]].\n\nMass-produced cider, such as that produced by [[H.

The colour is likely to be golden yellow with a clear appearance from the [[filtration]]. ''White ciders'' are almost colourless in appearance.\n\n=== Americas ===\nIn the US, \"[[apple cider|cider]]\" often refers to unfiltered apple juice, traditionally made with a distinct sweet-tart taste, and in these regions, the fermented beverage is known as \"hard cider\". In Canada, the terms \"cider\" and \"apple cider\" are interchangeable although they generally refer to alcoholic and juice beverages, respectively.\n\n====Argentina====\nIn Argentina, cider, or ''sidra'' is by far the most popular alcoholic [[carbonated]] drink during the [[Christmas]] and New Year holidays. It has traditionally been considered the choice of the middle and lower classes (along with ''anan\u00e1 fizz ''and pineapple juice), whereas the higher classes would rather go for champagne or local sparkling wines for their Christmas or New Year toast. Popular commercial brands of cider are ''Real'', ''La Victoria'', \"Rama Caida\", Tunuyan. It is usually marketed in 0.72-litre glass or plastic bottles. However, there has been lately a campaign by some bottlers to make cider a drink consumed all year round, in any occasion, and not only seasonally. Cider now comes in smaller bottle sizes and commercials show people drinking at any time<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYyGzexJ9o|title=Sidra Real|date=15 November 2011|work=YouTube|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> (and not only toasting with it around a traditional Christmas or New Year table).\n\n==== Canada ====\nCider is produced commercially in every Canadian province except Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan, usually with a 5\u20137% alcohol content although the term is also used for some non-fermented apple juices. According to the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, alcoholic cider is an alcoholic fermentation of apple juice that does not contain more than 13% absolute alcohol by volume (ABV) or less than 2.5% ABV. [[File:Verger lafrance.jpg|thumb|Frozen apples in Quebec for the making of ice cider]]\n\n[[Quebec cider]] is considered a traditional alcoholic beverage. It is generally sold in 750&nbsp;ml bottles, has an alcohol content generally between 7% and 13% (with aperitifs ciders having alcohol content up to 20%), and can be served as a substitute for wine. As in the rest of the world, sparkling cider is getting more and more popular in Quebec and thanks to the law cider sold in the province can only be made from 100% pure apple juice.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Cider making was, however, forbidden from the early years of British rule as it was in direct conflict with established British brewers' interests (most notably [[John Molson]]). In recent years, a new type called [[ice cider]] has been sold. This type of cider is made from apples with a particularly high level of sugar caused by natural frost.\n\nThe regulations regarding cider in Canada are fairly strict in terms of sourcing and alcohol content. For it to be legally sold as cider, it must be the product of the [[Ethanol fermentation|alcoholic fermentation]] of apple juice and it must contain no less than 2.5 and no more than 13.0 percent [[alcohol by volume]]. However, the list of ingredients that may be added during manufacture is quite flexible and allows for 17 different categories of foods, chemicals and gases.<ref name=page33/> \n\n====Chile====\nCider has been made in Chile since [[Colonial Chile|colonial times]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016|New Market Report=\"Cider/Perry in Chile - New Market Report.\" ClickPress, 27 June 2016. Infotrac Newsstand, http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A456567342/STND?u=ccsf_main&sid=STND&xid=c0688ee3.}} [[Zona Sur, Chile|Southern Chile]] accounts for nearly all cider production in the country. Chileans make a distinction between \"''sidra''\" (\"cider\"), in fact, sparkling cider, and \"''chicha de manzana''\" (\"apple [[chicha]]\"), a homemade cider that is considered of less quality.\n\n====Mexico====\nTwo types of cider (''sidra'') are sold in Mexico. One type is a popular apple-flavoured, carbonated soft drink, sold under a number of soft drink brands, such as [[Sidral Mundet]] and [[Manzana Lift]] (both [[Coca-Cola]] [[FEMSA]] brands), [[Manzanita Sol]] (owned by [[PepsiCo]]), and [[Sidral Aga]] from Group AGA. The other type, alcoholic ''sidra'', is a sparkling cider typically sold in Champagne-style bottles with an alcohol content comparable to beer. ''Sidra'' was, due to the expense of imported [[champagne]], sometimes used as a substitute for [[New Year's Eve]] toasts in Mexico, as it is also a sweet, fruity drink. However, now the practice is to drink cider on Christmas Eve, celebrated with the family, and champagne on New Year's celebrated with friends. Cider beverages form a very small share of the Mexican alcoholic beverage market, with the figures for 2009 volume sales amounting to only 3.8&nbsp;million&nbsp;litres.\n\n====United States====\n{{main|Cider in the United States}}\n\nIn the United States, the definition of \"cider\" is usually broader than in Europe and specifically Ireland and the UK. There are two types, one being traditional alcoholic ''hard cider'' and the other ''sweet'' or ''soft cider'', often simply called ''apple cider''.\n\n====Uruguay====\nCider [[Fizz (cocktail)|fizz]] or fizz is a cider variety made by mixing and fermenting various fruit juices other than apple with cider, as ''anan\u00e1 fizz'' (pineapple juice), ''frutilla fizz'' (strawberry juice) or ''durazno fizz'' (peach juice).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Asia===\n====East Asia====\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nUsually, cider in East Asia refers to a [[soft drink]] similar to [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] or [[lemonade]].\n\nA popular drink in China is called \"Apple Vinegar\", which is apple juice. Shanxi Province is noted for the \"vinegar\" produced there.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, the terms {{nihongo|\"cidre\"|\u30b7\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb|sh\u012bdoru}} or \"apple [[sparkling wine]]\" usually refer to the alcoholic beverage to distinguish it from the sparkling unalcoholic soda drink, cider, although both terms are now interchangeably used. While Japan is not historically a cider-making country, there is currently a renaissance of new, younger cider makers in the prefectures of Aomori and Nagano. \n\nIn 2019, the number of international ciders imported to Japan increased, signifying a start to its popularity among Japanese consumers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reeve|first=Lee|date=2019|title=Kanpai!|url=https://www.inciderjapan.com|journal=InCiderJapan|volume=5|pages=4|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reeve|first=Lee|date=2020|title=Kanpai!|url=https://www.inciderjapan.com|journal=InCiderJapan|volume=8|pages=4|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== India ====\nRecent economic growth has led to development of new categories of alcohol in India. Cider is one such category. New product launches are seen in almost all metropolitan cities. The nuanced taste and rich legacy of cider from the British era helps the prospects of the drink in the bored scenario of pale lagers.\n\nAlso a filtered non-alcoholic carbonated apple juice called \"[[Appy Fizz]]\" was introduced by Parle in India in 2005 and it became an instant hit. Recently, they have decided to push the brand beyond the Rupees 1,000 crore mark.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/X3uFw16lYwB4gWv5n0O82O/Parle-Agro-plans-Rs100-crore-marketing-push-for-Appy-Fizz.html|title=Parle Agro plans Rs100 crore marketing push for Appy Fizz|last=Tewari|first=Saumya|date=2018-05-11|work=livemint.com/|access-date=2018-05-13}}</ref>\n\n====Pakistan====\nNon-alcoholic, apple-flavoured carbonated drinks are popular in the country, with local brands such as Mehran Bottler's Apple Sidra and [[Murree Brewery]]'s Big Apple in the market.\n\n===Africa===\n====Kenya====\nEast African Breweries launched Tusker Premium Cider in 2017.\n\n====South Africa====\nThere are two main brands of cider produced in South Africa, Hunters and Savanna Dry. They are produced and distributed through [[Distell Group Limited]]. Hunters Gold was first introduced in South Africa in 1988 as an alternative to beer. The Hunters range includes Hunters Dry, Hunters Gold, Hunters Export and Hunters Edge launched in April 2017. [[Savanna Dry]] was introduced in 1996 and also comes in a Light Premium variety as well as in a Savanna Dark variant.\n\n===Oceania===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\n====Australia====\nThe composition of cider is defined in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and \"means the fruit wine prepared from the juice or must of apples and no more than 25% of the juice or must of pears\".\nCider has been made in Australia since its early settlement. Primarily this production has been for limited local usage, with national commercial distribution and sales dominated by two brands: Mercury Cider and Strongbow. Since early 2005, they have been joined in the market by numerous new producers including [[Three Oaks Cider]], [[Pipsqueak (cider)|Pipsqueak]], and [[Tooheys Brewery|Tooheys 5 Seeds Cider]] as well as imported brands like [[Magners]], [[Weston's Cider|Weston's]], [[Monteith's]], [[Kopparbergs Brewery|Kopparberg]], Rekorderlig, and [[Somersby cider|Somersby]].\n\nWith the growth in interest in cider, the number of local producers has increased. Some cider producers are attempting to use more traditional methods and traditional cider apple varieties such as Henry's of Harcourt and Crucible in S.W. Victoria. Other smaller brands rely on the available culinary (standard eating\u2014supermarket and cooking apples) fruit. In the Yarra Valley early producers were Kelly Brothers cider and Lilydale. Later came Napoleone & Co. The Bridge Road Brewery and Amulet Winery, both in Victoria's Beechworth, have released ciders. South Australia's boutique ciders include Lobo (Adelaide Hills), The Hills Cider (Adelaide Hills), Thorogoods (Burra), and Aussie Cider (Barossa). In [[Western Australia]], the number of cider producers has also grown in the southwest region, particularly in areas where wine is also produced with producers in [[Denmark, Western Australia|Denmark]], [[Pemberton, Western Australia|Pemberton]], and [[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]]. In [[Tasmania]], there are a number of boutique cider makers including Red Sails (Middleton), Pagan Cider (Huon Valley), Dickens Cider (Tamar Valley), and Spreyton Cider (Spreyton). Willie Smiths is a medium to large producer of commercial and craft cider.\n\n====New Zealand====\nIn New Zealand, cider is categorised as a fruit wine and the rules which define what can be called a cider are very lax\u2014the standards do not even specify a minimum for the amount of apple juice required to call a drink \"cider\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2011C00589|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.7.3 - Fruit Wine and Vegetable Wine|last=Health|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref> At the same time [[Ready to Drink]] beverages are not permitted for sale in supermarkets and grocery outlets. These two factors have resulted in the production of a wide range of low juice content, sweet, often flavoured drinks under the \"cider\" banner being used to circumvent this restriction. Most of these ciders are produced and marketed by the three large brewers (Lion Nathan, DB and Independent).\n\nMost New Zealand ciders are made from concentrate or from reject apples from the country's significant export apple industry. These ciders are made year round with little consideration given to maturation.\n\nA few producers have demonstrated that NZ's excellence in apple production can translate into the manufacture of world class ciders. [[Peckham's Cider]] is the principal producer in this class. They make whole juice ciders from apples grown specifically for cidermaking, principally from their own orchard of 30 heritage cider varieties. They have won Champion Cider in the NZ Cider Awards in 2015, 2016 and 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidernz.com/awards.html|title=Awards|website=CIDER NEW ZEALAND|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref>\n\nAbel Cider of Nelson is another producer to make vintage cider from 100% freshly harvested apples and pears. Unlike the bulk producers, Abel hand harvest tree ripened fruit, crush it, then ferment until dry. Abel is unfined and unfiltered, meaning they allow the cider to naturally clarify via gravity; this gentle process helps preserve the natural fruit characteristics.\n\nAll mass-produced ciders in New Zealand are loosely regulated with their minimum content of fruit juice and alcohol content (mostly 4 to 5%).\n\n[[Lion Nathan|Lion]] produces Isaac's ciders from concentrate under the Mac's trademark. The range includes three artificial flavours: apple, pear, and berry with limited edition ciders that are released seasonally. Their [[Speight's]] brand also makes a cider from concentrate.\n\nThe [[Dominion Breweries]] brands [[Monteith's]] Brewery in [[Greymouth]] on the west coast of the South Island makes an apple and a pear cider while their Old Mout Cider\u2014based in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in the South Island\u2014is blending fruit wines with cider to create fruit ciders including boysenberry and feijoa varieties. Rekorderlig Cider (Pear, Wild Berries, Mango and Raspberry, Strawberry and Lime, Apple and Blackcurrant and Apple and spice), and Johnny Arrow Cider are another two brands owned by this company.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Drink}}\n* [[Fassbrause]]\n* [[Hard soda]]\n* [[List of cider brands]]\n* [[List of beverages]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Farmhouse Cider & Scrumpy'', Bob Bunker 1999\n* ''[[Household Cyclopedia]]'', 1881\n* ''The History and Virtues of Cyder'', R.

Ciders can be classified from dry to sweet. Their appearance ranges from cloudy with sediment to completely clear, and their colour ranges from almost colourless to amber to brown. The variations in clarity and colour are mostly due to filtering between pressing and [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. Some apple varieties will produce a clear cider without any need for filtration. Both sparkling and still ciders are made; the sparkling variety is the more common.\n\nModern, mass-produced ciders closely resemble [[sparkling wine]] in appearance. More traditional brands tend to be darker and cloudier. They are often stronger than the mass-produced varieties and taste more strongly of apples. Almost colourless, white cider has the same apple juice content as conventional cider but is harder to create because the cider maker has to blend various apples to create a clearer liquid. White ciders tend to be sweeter and more refreshing. They are typically 7\u20138 %&nbsp;ABV in strength. Black cider, by contrast, is dry amber premium cider which has an alcohol content of 7\u20138 %&nbsp;ABV. The descriptor black usually comes after the brand name such as ''Union Black'' and ''Barnstormer Black''.\n\n== Cider styles ==\n===Geography and origins===\n\nCider is an ancient beverage. No one knows when or where it was first made, because the native distribution of its principal component, the apple, is so widespread, from the Near East to northwestern Europe. In the cider market, ciders can be broken down into two main styles, standard and specialty. The first group consists of modern ciders and heritage ciders. Modern ciders are produced from culinary apples such as [[Gala (apple)|Gala]]. Heritage ciders are produced from heritage, cider specific, crab or wild apples, like [[Golden Russet]]. Historically, cider was made from the only resources available to make it,<ref name=\"naborg\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.northamericanbrewers.org/about/contributed-articles-by-naba-members/cider-styles-a-primer/|title=North American Brewing Association|last=Beckwith|first=Bob|date=May 18, 2000|website=North American Brewing Association}}</ref> so style wasn't a large factor when considering the production process.

Cider styles evolved based on the methods used, the apples available and local tastes. Production techniques developed, as with most technology, by trial and error. In fact, the variables were nearly too widespread to track, including: spontaneous fermentation, the type of vessels used, environmental conditions, and the apple varieties. Refinements came much later when cider became a commercial product and the process was better understood. However, since there is growing popularity in ciders, the production of specialty styles has begun to increase.<ref name=\"naborg\" />\n\n===Modern ciders===\n\nModern ciders are made from culinary apples and are lower in [[tannin]]s and higher in acidity than other cider styles.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://ciderassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/USACM-Style-Guidelines-V1pt1.pdf|title=Cider Style Guide|last=United States Association of Cider Makers|date=October 2017|website=USACM}}</ref> Common culinary apples used in modern ciders include [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]], [[Golden Delicious]], [[Jonagold]], [[Granny Smith]], [[Gala (apple)|Gala]], and [[Fuji (apple)|Fuji]].<ref name=\":2\" /> A sweet or low alcohol cider may tend to have a strong aromatic and flavour character of apple, while drier and higher alcohol ciders will tend to produce a wider range of fruity aromas and flavours.<ref name=\":2\" /> Modern ciders vary in color from pale to yellow and can range from brilliant to a hazy clarity.<ref name=\":2\" /> Clarity can be altered through various cider making practices, depending on the cider maker's intentions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Heritage ciders===\n\nHeritage ciders are made from both culinary and cider apples, including bittersweet, bittersharp, heirlooms, wild apples, and crabapples.<ref name=\":2\" /> Common apples used in heritage cider production include [[Dabinett]], [[Kingston Black Apple|Kingston Black]], [[Roxbury Russet]], and [[Wickson]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Heritage ciders are higher in tannins than modern ciders.

Fruit ciders have other fruit or juices added before or after fermentation, like cherries, blueberries, and cranberries.<ref name=\":2\" /> Hopped cider is fermented with added [[hops]], common [[List of hop varieties|hop varieties]] being [[Cascade hop|Cascade]], Citra, Galaxy, and Mosaic.<ref name=\":2\" /> Spiced ciders have various spices added to the cider before, during, or after fermentation.<ref name=\":2\" /> Spices like cinnamon and ginger are popular to use in production.<ref name=\":2\" /> Wood-aged ciders are ciders that are either fermented or aged in various types of wood barrels, to aid in extraction of woody, earthy flavours.<ref name=\":2\" /> Sour ciders are high acid ciders that are produced with non-standard, non-[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Saccharomyces]] [[yeast]] and bacteria, which enhance [[Acetic acid|acetic]] and [[Lactic acid fermentation|lactic acid]] production, in order to reach a sour profile.<ref name=\":2\" /> Ice ciders can be made by using pre-pressed frozen juice or frozen whole apples. Whole apples either come frozen from the orchard, dependent on harvest date, or are stored in a freezer prior to pressing. When the pre-pressed juice or whole apples freeze, sugars are concentrated and mostly separated from the water. Whole apples are then pressed in order to extract the concentrated juice. For the pre-pressed juice the concentrated solution is drawn off while thawing occurs.<ref name=\":2\" /> Although, according to the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB) cider producers can only label a product 'Ice Cider' if it is produced from apples naturally frozen outdoors.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTwo styles not mentioned in the USACM Cider Style Guide are Ros\u00e9 and Sparkling Cider.

There are many hundreds of varieties of cultivars developed specifically for cider making.\n\n[[File:Tou d'preinseu, Morel Farm, J\u00e8rri.jpg|thumb|left|Few traditional horse-drawn circular cider presses are still in use, but many may still be seen used as garden ornaments, flower planters, or architectural features]]\n\nOnce the apples are gathered from trees in [[orchards]] they are ''scratted'' (ground down) into what is called ''[[pomace]]'' or ''pommage''. Historically this was done using pressing stones with circular troughs, or by a cider mill. Cider mills were traditionally driven by the hand, water-mill, or horse-power. In modern times, they are likely to be powered by electricity. The pulp is then transferred to the cider press and built up in layers known as ''cheeses'' into a block.\n\nTraditionally the method for squeezing the juice from the apples involves placing sweet straw or haircloths between the layers of pomace. This will alternate with slatted ash-wood racks until there is a pile of ten or twelve layers.\n\nThe ''set'' is then subjected to increasing degrees of pressure until all the 'must' or juice is squeezed from the pomace. This juice, after being strained in a coarse hair-sieve, is then put into either open vats or closed casks. The pressed pulp is given to farm animals as winter feed, composted, discarded or used to make [[liqueur]]s.<ref name=\"Somerset Cider\">{{cite web | first= James | last= Crowden | title= Somerset Cider | publisher= [[Somerset County Council]] | url= http://www.somerset.gov.uk/celebratingsomerset/cidermap/home.htm | accessdate= 2006-06-20 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060524050427/http://www.somerset.gov.uk/celebratingsomerset/cidermap/home.htm | archive-date= 2006-05-24 | url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Fermentation ===\n{{Main|Fermentation (food)}}\n\nFermentation of ciders occurs by a very similar mechanism to the fermentation of wine. The process of alcoholic fermentation is characterised by the conversion of simple sugars into ethanol by yeasts, especially ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''.<ref name=\"whenWhy\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dashko | first1 = S. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = N. | last3 = Compagno | first3 = C. | last4 = Pi\u0161kur | first4 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Why, when, and how did yeast evolve alcoholic fermentation? | url = | journal = FEMS Yeast Research | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 826\u2013832 | doi = 10.1111/1567-1364.12161 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This is because, as \"Crabtree positive\" yeasts, they produce ethanol even during aerobic fermentation; in contrast, Crabtree-negative yeasts produce only biomass and carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"whenWhy\" /> This adaptation allows them a competitive edge in the fermentation of ciders due to their high alcohol tolerance, and because of this tolerance, it is common for ciders to be fermented to dryness, although that is not always the case. Fermentations will carry on until the yeasts run out of nutrients and can no longer metabolise, resulting in a \"stuck\" fermentation,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Boudreau | first1 = T.

This temperature would be low for most kinds of fermentation, but is beneficial for cider, as it leads to slower fermentation with less loss of delicate aromas. Fermentation can occur due to natural yeasts that are present in the must; alternately, some cider makers add cultivated strains of cider yeast, such as ''[[Saccharomyces bayanus]]''.\n\nDuring the initial stages of fermentation, there are elevated levels of carbon dioxide as the yeasts multiply and begin to break down the sugar into ethanol.<ref name=\"The Science of Cidermaking\"/> In addition to fermentative metabolism of yeast, certain organoleptic compounds are formed that have an effect on the quality of cider, such as other alcohols, esters and other volatile compounds.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arias Abrodo|first1=Pilar|title=Fatty Acid Composition of Cider Obtained by traditional or controlled fermentation|journal=Food Chemistry|date=2005|pages=183\u2013187}}</ref> After fermentation, racking occurs into a clean vessel, trying to leave behind as much yeast as possible.<ref name=\"The Science of Cidermaking\"/> Shortly before the fermentation consumes all the sugar, the liquor is \"racked\" ([[siphon]]ed) into new vats. This leaves dead yeast cells and other undesirable material at the bottom of the old vat. At this point, it becomes important to exclude airborne acetic bacteria, so vats are filled completely to exclude air. The fermenting of the remaining available sugar generates a small amount of carbon dioxide that forms a protective layer, reducing air contact. This final fermentation creates a small amount of [[carbonation]]. Extra sugar may be added specifically for this purpose. Racking is sometimes repeated if the liquor remains too cloudy.\n\nApple-based juice may also be combined with fruit to make a fine cider; fruit pur\u00e9es or flavourings can be added, such as [[grape]], [[cherry]], [[raspberry]], or [[cranberry]].\n\nThe cider is ready to drink after a three-month fermentation period, although it is more often matured in the vats for up to three years.<ref>{{cite web| title= History of cider| publisher= W3commerce| year= 2000| url= http://www.history-of-cider.co.uk/index.html| accessdate= 2006-06-20| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061001010518/http://www.history-of-cider.co.uk/index.html| archive-date= 2006-10-01| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Blending and bottling ===\n[[File:Cider making Jersey.jpg|thumb|upright|Layers of pomace wrapped in canvas]]\n\nFor larger-scale cider production, ciders from vats produced from different varieties of apple may be blended to accord with market taste. If the cider is to be bottled, usually some extra sugar is added for sparkle. Higher quality ciders can be made using the [[Sparkling wine production|champagne method]], but this is expensive in time and money and requires special corks, bottles, and other equipment. Some home brewers use beer bottles, which work perfectly well, and are inexpensive. This allows the cider to become naturally carbonated.\n\n== Chemistry ==\n\n=== Flavour compounds ===\n[[Phenolic content in wine|Tannins]] are crucial flavour compounds in cider. Since perfecting the tannin content in the cider is needed for optimal success, the tannins or \"polyphenols of apples are largely implicated in cider quality.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Polyphenol Profiles of French Cider Apple Varieties|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=47|issue=12|pages=4847\u20134853|last=Sanoner|first=P|date=1999|doi=10.1021/jf990563y|pmid=10606541}}</ref> They are important because they control the [[Astringency (wine)|astringency]] and bitterness of the cider. Tannins are necessary components to focus on when producing cider because the length of the aftertaste of the cider (astringency) and bitterness are both strong chemicals that affect people's opinion on the cider. Tannins are polyphenol compounds that are naturally occurring in apples. Depending on the type of cider apple the producer is using, the tannin levels will be different. The more well-known ciders typically have lower tannin levels while traditional ciders have more. One example of a common tannin present in cider is [[Procyanidin B2]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Phenolics of Ciders: Bitterness and Astringency|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume=29|issue=5|pages=478\u2013483|last=Lea|first=A|date=1978|doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740290512}}</ref>\n\nThe [[acid]]s in cider play a vital role in both the cider making process and in the final flavour of a finished cider.

Inoculation with different strains of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and other yeast strains with strong fermentative metabolism traits, including ''[[Saccharomyces bayanus]]'' and ''[[Torulaspora delbrueckii]]'' strains, has been shown to produce few differences in cider phenolic compounds, save for concentrations of phloretin (see [[Phloretin]]) in samples that underwent malolactic fermentation. Spontaneous fermentation commenced by indigenous yeasts and finished by ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' can produce ciders with similar concentrations of important non-volatile acids (see [[nonvolatile acid]]), including lactic acid, succinic acid and acetic acid, while concentrations of volatile compounds such as methanol and 1-butanol, were present in different concentrations, dependent on apple cultivar. Extending the time during which the cider remains in contact with yeast lees increased concentrations of most of the minor volatile compounds present, especially fatty acids, ethyl esters and alcohols. Major volatile compound concentrations did not exhibit a similar pattern, with ''iso''-butanol, amyl alcohols, and acetoine decreasing 1-propanol decreasing.\n\nSparkling ciders can be produced using different methods, including the Champenoise method used to produce champagne. Use of different strains of indigenous ''Saccharomyces'' to perform secondary fermentation produced ciders with consistent alcohol and acidic characteristics, variable glycerol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, propanol, ''i''-butanol and 2-phenylethanol characteristics and acceptable sensory analysis results.\n\n== Yeast ==\nThe selection of yeast used for cider production is critical to the quality of the final product. As with other fermented beverages, like [[wine]] and [[beer]], the strain of yeast used to carry out the [[alcoholic fermentation]] also converts precursor molecules into the odorants found in the final product. In general, two broad categories of yeast are used for cider making: commercially developed strains and wild, or autochthonous, strains. In either case, the species tend to be either ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' or ''Saccharomyces bayanus.'' Commercial strains are available for purchase from numerous distributors, and their characteristics are typically outlined in manuals from the companies. Selection for fermentation may be based on a yeast's ability to ferment at particular sugar concentrations, temperatures, or pH. Some producers may also select for yeasts that produce [[Killer yeast|killer factors]], allowing them to out-compete other yeast in the juice, or they may select yeast that contribute [[mouthfeel]] or specific aromas to the cider.<ref>Scott Laboratories Cider Handbook (2015-2016). http://www.scottlab.com/pdf/2015CiderHandbook.pdf</ref>\n\n\"Wild fermentations\" occur when autochthonous yeast are allowed to carry out fermentation; indigenous yeasts can spontaneously initiate fermentation without any addition of other yeast strains by the cider maker. Autochthonous yeasts are wild yeast strains that are endemic to the specific location in which a cider is produced; this is the traditional method used for cider making, and many producers feel that the strains unique to their cidery contribute a sense of [[terroir]] to their product. Wild yeast populations can be incredibly diverse and commonly include species of ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Pichia]]'', ''[[Hanseniaspora]]'' and ''[[Metschnikowia]].''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valles|first=B|last2=Pando Bedri\u00f1ana|first2=R|last3=Tascon|first3=N|last4=Simon|first4=A|last5=Madrera|first5=R|date=2007|title=Yeast species associated with the spontaneous fermentation of cider|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=25\u201331|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2006.04.001|pmid=16943091|issn=0740-0020}}</ref> Typically, the native yeast take up residence in the cidery, and can be important to the unique flavour of the product.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pando Bedri\u00f1ana|first=R.|last2=Querol Sim\u00f3n|first2=A.|last3=Su\u00e1rez Valles|first3=B.|date=2010|title=Genetic and phenotypic diversity of autochthonous cider yeasts in a cellar from Asturias|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=27|issue=4|pages=503\u2013508|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2009.11.018|pmid=20417399|issn=0740-0020}}</ref> Although it was once believed that the native yeast carrying out these spontaneous fermentations also came from the orchard itself, research has shown that the microbes cultured from apples in the orchard do not align with the microbes found during the various stages of fermentation, suggesting that the sole source of native yeast is the cidery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alonso|first=Sergio|last2=Laca|first2=Amanda|last3=Rendueles|first3=Manuel|last4=Mayo|first4=Baltasar|last5=D\u00edaz|first5=Mario|date=2015-03-19|title=Cider Apple Native Microbiota Characterization by PCR-DGGE|journal=Journal of the Institute of Brewing|language=en|volume=121|issue=2|pages=287\u2013289|doi=10.1002/jib.220|issn=0046-9750}}</ref> Indigenous yeast strain population dynamics are affected by climatic conditions, apple variety, geographic location, and cider making technologies used.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Genetic and phenotypic diversity of autochthonous cider yeasts in a cellar from Asturias|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b6e/43f01d51b79048dc42342e766a7f9b742736.pdf|journal=Food Microbiology|via=Elsevier|year=2010}}</ref> These variables cause different regions to host unique endemic yeast populations.

The production of sparkling cider requires a second round of fermentation, and a second yeast selection. The yeast used for the secondary fermentation in sparkling cider production serve the same purpose as the yeast used in the [[champagne method]] of sparkling wine production: to generate [[carbonation]] and distinct aromas with a fermentation that occurs in the bottle. The yeast are selected based on critical properties, such as tolerance to high pressure, low temperature, and high ethanol concentration, as well as an ability to [[Flocculation|flocculate]], which allows for [[riddling]] to remove the yeast when the fermentation has finished.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Su\u00e1rez Valles|first=Bel\u00e9n|last2=Pando Bedri\u00f1ana|first2=Rosa|last3=Lastra Queipo|first3=Ana|last4=Mangas Alonso|first4=Juan Jos\u00e9|date=2008|title=Screening of cider yeasts for sparkling cider production (Champenoise method)|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=25|issue=5|pages=690\u2013697|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2008.03.004|pmid=18541168|issn=0740-0020}}</ref> Some researchers have also suggested that non-Saccharomyces yeasts could be used to release additional flavour or mouthfeel compounds, as they may contain enzymes, such as [[Beta-glucosidase|\u03b2-glucosidase]], [[Xylan 1,4-b-xylosidase|\u03b2-xylosidase]], or [[polygalacturonase]], which ''Saccharomyces'' yeast may not produce.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pando Bedri\u00f1ana|first=R.|last2=Lastra Queipo|first2=A.|last3=Su\u00e1rez Valles|first3=B.|date=2011-12-29|title=Screening of Enzymatic Activities in Non-Saccharomyces Cider Yeasts|journal=Journal of Food Biochemistry|language=en|volume=36|issue=6|pages=683\u2013689|doi=10.1111/j.1745-4514.2011.00583.x|issn=0145-8884}}</ref>\n\nNot all yeast associated with cider production are necessary for fermentation; many are considered spoilage microbes and can be a significant source of off odors in the finished product.

A variety of ciders and perries will be available for tasting and buying. Such festivals may be organised by [[pub]]s, cider producers, or cider-promoting private organisations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n== Uses and variations ==\n\n[[Calvados (brandy)|Calvados]] and [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]] are distilled from cider. Calvados is made throughout [[Normandy]], France, not just in the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]] [[Department (country subdivision)|d\u00e9partement]]. It is made from cider by double distillation. In the first pass, the result is a liquid containing 28\u201330% alcohol. After the second pass, the concentration of alcohol is about 40%.\n\nApplejack is a strong alcoholic beverage made in North America by concentrating cider, either by the traditional method of [[Fractional freezing|freeze distillation]] or by true evaporative [[distillation]]. In traditional freeze distillation, a barrel of cider is left outside during the winter. When the temperature is low enough, the water in the cider starts to freeze. If the ice is removed, the (now more concentrated) alcoholic solution is left behind in the barrel. If the process is repeated often enough, and the temperature is low enough, the alcohol concentration is raised to 20\u201330% alcohol by volume. Home production of applejack is popular in Europe.\n\nA few producers in [[Quebec]] and England, inspired by [[ice wine]], have developed [[ice cider]] (French: ''cidre de glace''). For this product, the apples are frozen either before or after being harvested. Its alcohol concentration is 9\u201313 % [[alcohol by volume|ABV]].\n\nA popular [[Ap\u00e9ritif and digestif|ap\u00e9ritif]] in Normandy is ''[[pommeau]]'', a drink produced by blending unfermented apple juice and apple brandy in the barrel (the high alcoholic content of the spirit prevents fermentation of the juice and the blend takes on the character of the aged barrel).\n\n[[Cocktail]]s may include cider. Besides [[Kir (cocktail)|kir]] and [[Snakebite (beer cocktail)|snakebite]], an example is [[Black Velvet (beer cocktail)|Black Velvet]] in a version of which cider may replace champagne.\n\nCider may also be used to make [[vinegar]]. [[Apple cider vinegar]] is noted for its high acidity and flavour.\n\n== Related drinks ==\n\nOther fruits can be used to make cider-like drinks. The most popular is made from fermented [[pear]] juice, known as perry. It is called ''poir\u00e9'' in France and produced mostly in [[Lower Normandy]] there. A branded sweet perry known as [[Babycham]], marketed principally as a women's drink and sold in miniature champagne-style bottles, was once popular but has become unfashionable. Another related drink is a form of mead, known as [[mead|cyser]]. Cyser is a blend of honey and apple juice fermented together.\n\nAlthough not widely made in modern times, various other [[pome]] fruits can produce palatable drinks. [[Apicius]], in Book II of ''[[De re coquinaria]]'', includes a recipe calling for [[quince]] cider.\n\n== National varieties ==\n=== Europe ===\n\nBefore the development of rapid long distance transportation, regions of cider consumption generally coincided with those of cider production. As such, cider was said to be more common than wine in 12th-century [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]<ref>Fletcher, R.A., ''Liber Sancti Jacobi''</ref> and certainly the idea of it was present in England by the Conquest of 1066, using crab apples: the word \"Wassail\" is derived from a Saxon phrase, w\u00e6s h\u00e6l\": it is what would have been said by Saxons as a toast at [[Yuletide]]. Southern Italy, by contrast, though indeed possessing apples, had no tradition for cider apples at all and like its other neighbours on the Mediterranean Sea preserved the Roman tradition of apples as an ingredient for desserts, as evidenced by the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii, descriptions by Classical writers and playwrights, and [[Apicius]], whose famous cookbook does not contain a single recipe for fermenting apples but rather includes them as part of main courses, especially accompanying pork.\n\n==== Austria ====\n\nIn Austria, cider is made in the southwest of [[Lower Austria]], the so-called \"[[Mostviertel]]\" and in [[Upper Austria]] as well as in parts of [[Styria]]. Almost every farmer there has some apple or pear trees. Many farmers also have a kind of inn called a \"Mostheuriger\", similar to a [[heuriger]] for new wine, where they serve cider and traditional fare. Non-sparkling cider is typically called \"Most\". Austria's most popular sparkling cider [[Goldkehlchen]] is produced in south [[Styria]] and marketed internationally since 2013 by the company founders Adam and Eva.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==== Belgium ====\n\nCidrerie Ruwet SA, established in 1898, is the only independent craft cider producer in Belgium. In addition to their own brand Ruwet, the company produces 'high-end' ciders for private labels.\n\nHeineken owns the other Belgian cider maker Stassen SA, who in addition to their own local brands such as Strassen X Cider also produce Strongbow Jacques, a 5.5% ABV cider with [[cherry]], [[raspberry]], and [[blackcurrant]] flavours. [[Zonhoven]]-based Konings NV specialises in private label ciders for European retailers and offers a wide variety of flavours and packaging options to the beverage industry. ''[[Stella Artois]] Cidre'' is produced in Zonhoven and has been marketed since 2011.<ref>{{cite web | publisher= Knack | title= Konings maakt Stella Artois Cidre | date= 30 March 2011 | url= http://trends.knack.be/economie/bedrijven/konings-maakt-stella-artois-cidre/article-normal-231333.html | accessdate= 2012-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Denmark ====\n\nDespite a strong apple tradition, Denmark has little cider production. Six places that produce cider in Denmark are Pomona (since 2003), Fej\u00f8 Cider (since 2003), Dancider (since 2004), \u00d8rb\u00e6k Bryggeri (since 2006), Ciderprojektet (since 2008), and Svaneke Bryghus (since 2009). All are inspired mainly by English and French cider styles. The assortment of imported ciders has grown significantly since 2000, prior to that only ciders from Sweden, primarily non-alcoholic, were generally available. The leading cider on the Danish market is made by [[CULT A/S]].<ref>Business.dk http://www.business.dk/foedevarer/cult-overhaler-somersby-cider</ref>\nIn 2008, [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] launched an alcoholic cider in Denmark called [[Somersby cider]] which has an alcohol content of 4.7% and a sweet taste.<ref>{{cite web | title= Somersby Cider | publisher= Carlsberg Group | url= http://www.carlsberggroup.com/brands/Pages/SomersbyCider.aspx | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pressesystemet.dk/default.asp?id=1910 Very ApS | Somersby Cider byder for\u00e5ret velkommen! - Pressesystemet.dk<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526205108/http://www.pressesystemet.dk/default.asp?id=1910 |date=2012-05-26 }}</ref>\n\n==== Finland ====\n\nThe best-known brands labelled as cider are ''[[Golden Cap (cider)|Golden Cap]]'', ''[[Fizz (cider)|Fizz]]'', and ''Upcider''. They typically contain 4.5\u20134.7 %vol of alcohol. Virtually all Finnish \"cider\" is produced from fermented apple (or pear) juice concentrate mixed with water and is not cider as per the traditional description of the drink. Flavoured ciders, available in a large selection, are very popular and widely available in stores, with a variety of flavours ranging from forest berry to rhubarb and vanilla.\n\n==== France ====\n\nFrance was one of the countries that inherited a knowledge of apple cultivation from both the Celtic [[Gauls]] and the later [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who ruled the country for approximately 500 years: both had knowledge of grafting and keeping apples. The earliest mentions of cider in this country go back to the Greek geographer [[Strabo]]: he speaks of the profusion of apple trees in [[Gaul]] and describes a cider-like drink.<ref>{{cite web | title= About \"Cidre\" | publisher= La Chouette | url= http://www.lachouettecider.com/en/about-cidre/?accept-condition=1 | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 9th century, Charlemagne, in the Capitulars, ordered skilled brewers (the Sicetores) to always be present on his estates to make him ale, \"pomm\u00e9\" (pomacium), perry and all the liquors liable to be used as drinks, and also ordered an expansion of planting apple trees in what is now Northern France.<ref>{{cite web | title= Cider History | publisher= Apple Journal | url= http://www.applejournal.com/fr05.htm | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cidre Artisinal from Brittany.jpg|thumb|upright|Artisanal cider from Brittany]]\n\nFrench ''cidre'' ({{IPA-fr|sid\u0281}}) is an alcoholic drink produced predominantly in Normandy and [[Brittany]]. It varies in strength from below 4% alcohol to considerably more. Cidre Doux is a sweet cider, usually up to 3% in strength. 'Demi-Sec' is 3\u20135% and Cidre Brut is a strong dry cider of 4.5% alcohol and above. Most French ciders are sparkling. Higher quality cider is sold in champagne-style bottles (''cidre bouch\u00e9''). Many ciders are sold in corked bottles, but some screw-top bottles exist.\nIn cr\u00eaperies ([[cr\u00eape]] restaurants) in Brittany, cider is generally served in traditional ceramic bowls (or wide cups) rather than glasses. A ''kir Breton'' (or ''kir normand'') is a cocktail [[ap\u00e9ritif]] made with cider and [[Cr\u00e8me de cassis|cassis]], rather than white wine and cassis for the traditional ''[[kir (cocktail)|kir]]''. The Domfrontais, in the [[Orne]] (Basse-Normandie), is famous for its pear cider (poir\u00e9). The ''calvados du Domfrontais'' is made of cider and poir\u00e9.\n\nSome cider is also made in southwestern France, in the French part of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. It is a traditional drink there and is making a recovery. Ciders produced here are generally of the style seen in the Spanish part of the Basque Country. A recently popular variety is the Akived, a piquant drink served cold.\n\n[[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], from Normandy, and Lambig from Brittany are a spirits made of cider through a process called double [[distillation]]. In the first pass, the result is a liquid containing 28%\u201330% alcohol. In a second pass, the amount of alcohol is augmented to about 40%.\n\n==== Germany ====\n{{Main|Apfelwein}}\n[[File:Apfelwein Dose Odenwald 20100221.jpg|thumb|right|upright|\"Apfelwein\" by [[Bembel-With-Care]], made from traditional [[Odenwald|Odenw\u00e4lder]] orchards]]\n\nGerman cider, usually called ''[[Apfelwein]]'' (apple wine), and regionally known as ''Ebbelwoi'', ''Apfelmost'' (apple must), ''Viez'' (from [[Latin]] ''vice'', the second or substitute wine), or ''Saurer Most'' (sour must), has an alcohol content of 5.5\u20137% and a tart, sour taste.\n\nGerman cider is mainly produced and consumed in [[Hessen]], particularly in the [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], [[Wetterau]], and [[Odenwald]] areas, in Moselfranken, [[Merzig]] ([[Saarland]]) and the [[Trier]] area, as well as the lower [[Saar (river)|Saar]] area and the region bordering on Luxembourg and in the area along the [[Neckar]] River in [[Swabia]]. In these regions, several large producers, as well as numerous small, private producers, often use traditional recipes. An official ''Viez'' route or cider route connects [[Saarburg]] with the border to Luxembourg.\n\n==== Ireland ====\n[[File:Magners cider.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Magners cider]]\n\nCider is a popular drink in Ireland. A single cider, [[Bulmers (Republic of Ireland)|Bulmers]], dominates sales in Ireland: owned by [[C&C Group plc|C&C]] and produced in [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]], Bulmers has a connected history to the British Bulmers cider brand up until 1949. Outside the Republic of Ireland, C&C brand their cider as Magners. It is very popular in Ireland to drink cider over ice and encouraged in their advertising. [[Cidona]], a non-alcoholic version of Bulmers, is a popular [[soft drink]] in Ireland and used to be a C&C-owned brand. However, in recent years, other ciders have begun to take a large share in the market, for example, Heineken's 'Orchard Thieves'.\n\nThere has been a renaissance in the smaller artisanal cider producers since 2010. These now number more than a dozen across the island of Ireland and offer the consumer a broad range of differing, typically non-mainstream flavour profiles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciderireland.com|title=Cider Ireland {{!}} the best source for real cider in Ireland|website=www.ciderireland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Orchard Thieves - Heineken Ireland|publisher=Heineken|url=http://www.heinekenireland.ie/Brands/Orchard-Thieves/#| accessdate=26 October 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Italy ====\n\nCider was once widely produced in [[northern Italy]]'s apple growing regions, with a marked decline during [[Economy of Italy under Fascism, 1922\u20131943|fascist rule]], due to the introduction of a law banning the industrial production of alcoholic beverages derived from fruits of less than 7% [[ABV]], which was aimed at protecting [[Italian wine|wine producers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sottocoperta.net/cucina/enologia/art24.htm |title=SIDRO: TRA I FOLLETTI E LE FATE&nbsp;... |author=Henry Tiziana |publisher=sottocoperta.net |accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref>\nPresent laws and regulations are favourable to cider makers, but production has only survived in a few [[Alps|alpine]] locations, mostly in the regions of [[Trentino]], and in [[Piedmont]], where it is known as ''vin \u00ebd pom'' (apple wine) or ''pomada'', because it traditionally was left to ferment in a vat along with grape [[pomace]], giving it a distinctive reddish colour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.specialissimo.it/eventi/osservatorio-sidro.asp |title=Osservatorio per il sidro |publisher=specialissimo.it |accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the Netherlands, cider is not as commonly available as in its surrounding countries. In 2007, [[Heineken]] started testing a cider-based drink branded [[Jillz]] in a number of bars throughout the country. The beverage, an [[alcopop]] made by blending sparkling water, fruit flavouring, malt, and cider, is marketed towards female drinkers as an alternative to beer. At the same time, Heineken also introduced Strongbow Gold as a secondary brand to provide the choice of a real cider, which was targeted to a male audience.

Cider is known in Poland as Cydr or Jab\u0142ecznik. In 2013, Poles drank 2 million litres of cider, which adds up to 1% of the country's annual alcohol sales. Sales more than doubled from the previous year. In the summer of 2014, Minister of Economy [[Janusz Piechoci\u0144ski]] supported in vain the creation of a draft law to legalise television cider publicity.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sedia|first=Giuseppe|date=16 September 2015|url=http://www.krakowpost.com/9952/2015/09/the-rise-of-polish-cider|title= The Rise of Polish Cider|work=[[Krakow Post]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe category is just gaining popularity among consumers.

Asturias amounts more than 80% of the whole production of Spain. The consumption of cider in Asturias is of 54 litres per person/year, probably the highest in any European region.\nOne of the most popular ciders in Spain is called \"El Gaitero\" (the bagpipe player) which can be found everywhere in Spain and which is produced in this region. However, it must not be confused with the traditional Asturian cider as it is a sparkling cider more in the way of French ciders. It is a factory produced cider, sweet and very foamy, much like lambrusco, different from the more artisan and traditional cider productions. Recently, new apple tree plantations have been started in grounds belonging to the old coal mines, once important in Asturias.\n\nThe first testimony about cider in Asturias was made by Greek geographer Strabo in 60 BC.\n\nThe traditional Asturian ''sidra'' is a still cider of 4\u20138% strength, although there are other varieties. Traditionally, it is served in ''sidrer\u00edas'' and ''chigres'', pubs specialising in cider where it is also possible to have other drinks as well as traditional food. One of the most outstanding characteristics is that it is poured in very small quantities from a height into a wide glass, with the arm holding the bottle extended upwards and the one holding the glass extended downwards. This technique is called ''escanciar un cul\u00edn'' (also ''echar un cul\u00edn'') and is done to get air bubbles into the drink (''espalmar''), thus giving it a sparkling taste like Champagne that lasts a very short time.\nCider is also poured from barrels in the traditional Espichas.\n\n[[File:Sagardotegian txotxetik edaten.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basque people]] drinking cider in a ''[[sagardotegi]]'' (cider house)]]\nCider has also been popular in the Basque Country for centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.applejournal.com/fr05.htm|quote=\"...Before the Christian era, the various peoples of Europe had succeeded in producing beverages more or less similar to cider from a variety of fruit.

Volcler, Societe|website=applejournal.com}}</ref> Whilst [[Txakoli]] and [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] wines became more popular in Biscay, \u00c1lava, and Navarre during the 19th century, there is still a strong [[Basque cider]] culture in [[Gipuzkoa]]. From the 1980s, government and gastronomic associations have worked to revive this culture in all Basque regions. Known as ''sagardoa'' (IPA: /s\u033aa'gardoa/), it is drunk either bottled or in a [[cider house]] (called a ''[[sagardotegi]]''), where it is poured from barrels. Most of \"sagardotegis\" are in the north of [[Gipuzkoa]] (Astigarraga, Hernani, Urnieta, and Usurbil), but they can be found everywhere in Gipuzkoa, the northwest of [[Navarre]] and the [[northern Basque country]].\n\nCider tasting events are popular in the Basque province of Gipuzkoa, where stalls are set up on the street selling the drink from several producers at cheap prices and served until stock runs out.\n\n====Sweden====\n[[File:Rekorderlig berries.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A glass of [[Rekorderlig]] wild-berries cider]]\nDue to Swedish law, stores in Sweden cannot sell cider with less than 15 percentage juice by volume under the name Cider.<ref name=\"Livsmedelsverkets f\u00f6reskrifter om cider | LIVSFS 2005:11(H 161) (Swedish)\">[http://www.slv.se/upload/dokument/Lagstiftning/2005-2006/2005-11.pdf Livsmedelsverkets f\u00f6rfattningssamling LIVSFS 2005:11 (H 161)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511161632/http://www.slv.se/upload/dokument/Lagstiftning/2005-2006/2005-11.pdf |date=2011-05-11 }}, (2009-10-21) (in Swedish).</ref> \"Cider\" with none or less than 15% juice is instead usually sold as ''\"Apple/Pear beverage of cider character\"'' (Swedish: ''\"\u00c4pple-/P\u00e4rondryck med Ciderkarakt\u00e4r\"''). Brands of cider in Sweden include [[Rekorderlig]], [[Kivik]], [[Herrljunga Cider|Herrljunga]] and [[Kopparbergs Brewery|Kopparberg]].\n\n====Switzerland====\nIn Switzerland cider is called ''Suure Most'' or ''Saft'' in the German-speaking part, ''Cidre'' in the [[Romandy]], and ''Sidro'' in the Italian-speaking regions. The drink was made popular in the 19th century when apple production increased due to progress in [[pomology]]. At the turn of the century, cider consumption was at 28.1 litres per person. In the 1920s, advantages in the [[pasteurisation]] of apple juice and the emerging [[temperance movement]] led to a strong decrease of cider production.<ref name=\"Kulinarisches Erbe der Schweiz (German)\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160405192315/http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/product.aspx?id=448 Die Texte zu den Produkten sind in der Regel in der jeweiligen Landessprache abgefasst] (German)</ref>\n\nToday, typical Swiss cider consists of fermented apple juice mixed with 30% fresh juice which is added for sweetness. This drink is then [[pasteurised]] and [[Carbonation#Natural and artificial carbonation|force-carbonated]]. Imported cider is not common as according to Swiss laws cider must contain more than 70% of juice.<ref name=\"Schweizerische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung SGE: Das Cassis-de-Dijon-Prinzip\">[http://www.sge-ssn.ch/media/spezial_2-11_d.pdf Schweizerische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung SGE: Das Cassis-de-Dijon-Prinzip] (German)</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{Main|Cider in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Cider-strongbow.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[pint glass]] of [[Strongbow cider]]]]\nThere are two broad main traditions in cider production in the UK: the West Country tradition and the eastern Kent and [[East Anglia]] tradition. The former are made using a much higher percentage of true [[cider apple]]s and so are richer in tannins and sharper in flavour. Kent and East Anglia ciders tend to use a higher percentage of or are exclusively made from, culinary and dessert fruit; they tend to be clearer, more vinous and lighter in body and flavour.\n\nAt one end of the scale are the traditional, small [[farm]]-produced varieties. These are non-carbonated and usually cloudy orange in appearance. Britain's West Country contains many of these farms which have an abundance of ancient varieties of specialist cider-apples. Production is often on such a small scale, the product being sold only at the site of manufacture or in local [[public house|pubs]] and shops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/travel/fare-of-the-country-england-s-realm-of-cider-with-a-kick.html?sec=travel&pagewanted=1 |title=Fare of the country; England's Realm Of Cider With a Kick|date=1989-04-02|accessdate=2006-06-20 |work=The New York Times | first=Paul | last=Lewis}}</ref> At the other end of the scale are the factories mass-producing brands such as [[Strongbow Cider|Strongbow]] and [[Blackthorn Cider|Blackthorn]].\n\nMass-produced cider, such as that produced by [[H. P. Bulmer|Bulmers]], is likely to be [[pasteurised]] and [[Carbonation#Natural and artificial carbonation|force-carbonated]]. The colour is likely to be golden yellow with a clear appearance from the [[filtration]]. ''White ciders'' are almost colourless in appearance.\n\n=== Americas ===\nIn the US, \"[[apple cider|cider]]\" often refers to unfiltered apple juice, traditionally made with a distinct sweet-tart taste, and in these regions, the fermented beverage is known as \"hard cider\". In Canada, the terms \"cider\" and \"apple cider\" are interchangeable although they generally refer to alcoholic and juice beverages, respectively.\n\n====Argentina====\nIn Argentina, cider, or ''sidra'' is by far the most popular alcoholic [[carbonated]] drink during the [[Christmas]] and New Year holidays. It has traditionally been considered the choice of the middle and lower classes (along with ''anan\u00e1 fizz ''and pineapple juice), whereas the higher classes would rather go for champagne or local sparkling wines for their Christmas or New Year toast. Popular commercial brands of cider are ''Real'', ''La Victoria'', \"Rama Caida\", Tunuyan. It is usually marketed in 0.72-litre glass or plastic bottles. However, there has been lately a campaign by some bottlers to make cider a drink consumed all year round, in any occasion, and not only seasonally. Cider now comes in smaller bottle sizes and commercials show people drinking at any time<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYyGzexJ9o|title=Sidra Real|date=15 November 2011|work=YouTube|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> (and not only toasting with it around a traditional Christmas or New Year table).\n\n==== Canada ====\nCider is produced commercially in every Canadian province except Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan, usually with a 5\u20137% alcohol content although the term is also used for some non-fermented apple juices. According to the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, alcoholic cider is an alcoholic fermentation of apple juice that does not contain more than 13% absolute alcohol by volume (ABV) or less than 2.5% ABV. [[File:Verger lafrance.jpg|thumb|Frozen apples in Quebec for the making of ice cider]]\n\n[[Quebec cider]] is considered a traditional alcoholic beverage. It is generally sold in 750&nbsp;ml bottles, has an alcohol content generally between 7% and 13% (with aperitifs ciders having alcohol content up to 20%), and can be served as a substitute for wine. As in the rest of the world, sparkling cider is getting more and more popular in Quebec and thanks to the law cider sold in the province can only be made from 100% pure apple juice.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Cider making was, however, forbidden from the early years of British rule as it was in direct conflict with established British brewers' interests (most notably [[John Molson]]). In recent years, a new type called [[ice cider]] has been sold. This type of cider is made from apples with a particularly high level of sugar caused by natural frost.\n\nThe regulations regarding cider in Canada are fairly strict in terms of sourcing and alcohol content. For it to be legally sold as cider, it must be the product of the [[Ethanol fermentation|alcoholic fermentation]] of apple juice and it must contain no less than 2.5 and no more than 13.0 percent [[alcohol by volume]]. However, the list of ingredients that may be added during manufacture is quite flexible and allows for 17 different categories of foods, chemicals and gases.<ref name=page33/> \n\n====Chile====\nCider has been made in Chile since [[Colonial Chile|colonial times]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016|New Market Report=\"Cider/Perry in Chile - New Market Report.\" ClickPress, 27 June 2016.

Chileans make a distinction between \"''sidra''\" (\"cider\"), in fact, sparkling cider, and \"''chicha de manzana''\" (\"apple [[chicha]]\"), a homemade cider that is considered of less quality.\n\n====Mexico====\nTwo types of cider (''sidra'') are sold in Mexico. One type is a popular apple-flavoured, carbonated soft drink, sold under a number of soft drink brands, such as [[Sidral Mundet]] and [[Manzana Lift]] (both [[Coca-Cola]] [[FEMSA]] brands), [[Manzanita Sol]] (owned by [[PepsiCo]]), and [[Sidral Aga]] from Group AGA. The other type, alcoholic ''sidra'', is a sparkling cider typically sold in Champagne-style bottles with an alcohol content comparable to beer. ''Sidra'' was, due to the expense of imported [[champagne]], sometimes used as a substitute for [[New Year's Eve]] toasts in Mexico, as it is also a sweet, fruity drink. However, now the practice is to drink cider on Christmas Eve, celebrated with the family, and champagne on New Year's celebrated with friends. Cider beverages form a very small share of the Mexican alcoholic beverage market, with the figures for 2009 volume sales amounting to only 3.8&nbsp;million&nbsp;litres.\n\n====United States====\n{{main|Cider in the United States}}\n\nIn the United States, the definition of \"cider\" is usually broader than in Europe and specifically Ireland and the UK. There are two types, one being traditional alcoholic ''hard cider'' and the other ''sweet'' or ''soft cider'', often simply called ''apple cider''.\n\n====Uruguay====\nCider [[Fizz (cocktail)|fizz]] or fizz is a cider variety made by mixing and fermenting various fruit juices other than apple with cider, as ''anan\u00e1 fizz'' (pineapple juice), ''frutilla fizz'' (strawberry juice) or ''durazno fizz'' (peach juice).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Asia===\n====East Asia====\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nUsually, cider in East Asia refers to a [[soft drink]] similar to [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] or [[lemonade]].\n\nA popular drink in China is called \"Apple Vinegar\", which is apple juice. Shanxi Province is noted for the \"vinegar\" produced there.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, the terms {{nihongo|\"cidre\"|\u30b7\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb|sh\u012bdoru}} or \"apple [[sparkling wine]]\" usually refer to the alcoholic beverage to distinguish it from the sparkling unalcoholic soda drink, cider, although both terms are now interchangeably used. While Japan is not historically a cider-making country, there is currently a renaissance of new, younger cider makers in the prefectures of Aomori and Nagano. \n\nIn 2019, the number of international ciders imported to Japan increased, signifying a start to its popularity among Japanese consumers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reeve|first=Lee|date=2019|title=Kanpai!|url=https://www.inciderjapan.com|journal=InCiderJapan|volume=5|pages=4|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reeve|first=Lee|date=2020|title=Kanpai!|url=https://www.inciderjapan.com|journal=InCiderJapan|volume=8|pages=4|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== India ====\nRecent economic growth has led to development of new categories of alcohol in India. Cider is one such category. New product launches are seen in almost all metropolitan cities. The nuanced taste and rich legacy of cider from the British era helps the prospects of the drink in the bored scenario of pale lagers.\n\nAlso a filtered non-alcoholic carbonated apple juice called \"[[Appy Fizz]]\" was introduced by Parle in India in 2005 and it became an instant hit. Recently, they have decided to push the brand beyond the Rupees 1,000 crore mark.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/X3uFw16lYwB4gWv5n0O82O/Parle-Agro-plans-Rs100-crore-marketing-push-for-Appy-Fizz.html|title=Parle Agro plans Rs100 crore marketing push for Appy Fizz|last=Tewari|first=Saumya|date=2018-05-11|work=livemint.com/|access-date=2018-05-13}}</ref>\n\n====Pakistan====\nNon-alcoholic, apple-flavoured carbonated drinks are popular in the country, with local brands such as Mehran Bottler's Apple Sidra and [[Murree Brewery]]'s Big Apple in the market.\n\n===Africa===\n====Kenya====\nEast African Breweries launched Tusker Premium Cider in 2017.\n\n====South Africa====\nThere are two main brands of cider produced in South Africa, Hunters and Savanna Dry. They are produced and distributed through [[Distell Group Limited]]. Hunters Gold was first introduced in South Africa in 1988 as an alternative to beer. The Hunters range includes Hunters Dry, Hunters Gold, Hunters Export and Hunters Edge launched in April 2017. [[Savanna Dry]] was introduced in 1996 and also comes in a Light Premium variety as well as in a Savanna Dark variant.\n\n===Oceania===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\n====Australia====\nThe composition of cider is defined in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and \"means the fruit wine prepared from the juice or must of apples and no more than 25% of the juice or must of pears\".\nCider has been made in Australia since its early settlement. Primarily this production has been for limited local usage, with national commercial distribution and sales dominated by two brands: Mercury Cider and Strongbow. Since early 2005, they have been joined in the market by numerous new producers including [[Three Oaks Cider]], [[Pipsqueak (cider)|Pipsqueak]], and [[Tooheys Brewery|Tooheys 5 Seeds Cider]] as well as imported brands like [[Magners]], [[Weston's Cider|Weston's]], [[Monteith's]], [[Kopparbergs Brewery|Kopparberg]], Rekorderlig, and [[Somersby cider|Somersby]].\n\nWith the growth in interest in cider, the number of local producers has increased. Some cider producers are attempting to use more traditional methods and traditional cider apple varieties such as Henry's of Harcourt and Crucible in S.W. Victoria. Other smaller brands rely on the available culinary (standard eating\u2014supermarket and cooking apples) fruit. In the Yarra Valley early producers were Kelly Brothers cider and Lilydale. Later came Napoleone & Co. The Bridge Road Brewery and Amulet Winery, both in Victoria's Beechworth, have released ciders. South Australia's boutique ciders include Lobo (Adelaide Hills), The Hills Cider (Adelaide Hills), Thorogoods (Burra), and Aussie Cider (Barossa). In [[Western Australia]], the number of cider producers has also grown in the southwest region, particularly in areas where wine is also produced with producers in [[Denmark, Western Australia|Denmark]], [[Pemberton, Western Australia|Pemberton]], and [[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]]. In [[Tasmania]], there are a number of boutique cider makers including Red Sails (Middleton), Pagan Cider (Huon Valley), Dickens Cider (Tamar Valley), and Spreyton Cider (Spreyton). Willie Smiths is a medium to large producer of commercial and craft cider.\n\n====New Zealand====\nIn New Zealand, cider is categorised as a fruit wine and the rules which define what can be called a cider are very lax\u2014the standards do not even specify a minimum for the amount of apple juice required to call a drink \"cider\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2011C00589|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.7.3 - Fruit Wine and Vegetable Wine|last=Health|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref> At the same time [[Ready to Drink]] beverages are not permitted for sale in supermarkets and grocery outlets. These two factors have resulted in the production of a wide range of low juice content, sweet, often flavoured drinks under the \"cider\" banner being used to circumvent this restriction. Most of these ciders are produced and marketed by the three large brewers (Lion Nathan, DB and Independent).\n\nMost New Zealand ciders are made from concentrate or from reject apples from the country's significant export apple industry. These ciders are made year round with little consideration given to maturation.\n\nA few producers have demonstrated that NZ's excellence in apple production can translate into the manufacture of world class ciders. [[Peckham's Cider]] is the principal producer in this class. They make whole juice ciders from apples grown specifically for cidermaking, principally from their own orchard of 30 heritage cider varieties. They have won Champion Cider in the NZ Cider Awards in 2015, 2016 and 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidernz.com/awards.html|title=Awards|website=CIDER NEW ZEALAND|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref>\n\nAbel Cider of Nelson is another producer to make vintage cider from 100% freshly harvested apples and pears. Unlike the bulk producers, Abel hand harvest tree ripened fruit, crush it, then ferment until dry. Abel is unfined and unfiltered, meaning they allow the cider to naturally clarify via gravity; this gentle process helps preserve the natural fruit characteristics.\n\nAll mass-produced ciders in New Zealand are loosely regulated with their minimum content of fruit juice and alcohol content (mostly 4 to 5%).\n\n[[Lion Nathan|Lion]] produces Isaac's ciders from concentrate under the Mac's trademark. The range includes three artificial flavours: apple, pear, and berry with limited edition ciders that are released seasonally. Their [[Speight's]] brand also makes a cider from concentrate.\n\nThe [[Dominion Breweries]] brands [[Monteith's]] Brewery in [[Greymouth]] on the west coast of the South Island makes an apple and a pear cider while their Old Mout Cider\u2014based in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in the South Island\u2014is blending fruit wines with cider to create fruit ciders including boysenberry and feijoa varieties. Rekorderlig Cider (Pear, Wild Berries, Mango and Raspberry, Strawberry and Lime, Apple and Blackcurrant and Apple and spice), and Johnny Arrow Cider are another two brands owned by this company.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Drink}}\n* [[Fassbrause]]\n* [[Hard soda]]\n* [[List of cider brands]]\n* [[List of beverages]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Farmhouse Cider & Scrumpy'', Bob Bunker 1999\n* ''[[Household Cyclopedia]]'', 1881\n* ''The History and Virtues of Cyder'', R.

French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable [[fur]]-bearing animals, especially the [[American Beaver|beaver]], which were becoming rare in [[Europe]]. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.\n\nAnother early French attempt at settlement in North America took place in 1564 at [[Fort Caroline]], now [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Intended as a haven for [[Huguenot]]s, Caroline was founded under the leadership of [[Ren\u00e9 Goulaine de Laudonni\u00e8re]] and [[Jean Ribault]]. It was sacked by the [[Spain|Spanish]] led by [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]] who then established the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] on 20 September 1565.\n\n[[Acadia]] and [[Canada (New France)]] were inhabited by [[indigenous peoples of North America|indigenous]] nomadic [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples and sedentary [[Iroquoian]] peoples. These lands were full of unexploited and valuable natural resources, which attracted all of Europe. By the 1580s, French trading companies had been set up, and ships were contracted to bring back furs. Much of what transpired between the indigenous population and their European visitors around that time is not known, for lack of historical records.<ref name=Riendeau/>\n\nOther attempts at establishing permanent settlements were also failures. In 1598, a French trading post was established on [[Sable Island]], off the coast of Acadia, but was unsuccessful.

There he participated decisively in a battle against the Iroquois, killing two Iroquois chiefs with the first shot of his [[arquebus]].

Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. But the severely underpopulated New France almost fell completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] led a Canadian and Huron [[militia]] against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement. In 1663, New France finally became more secure when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] made it a royal province, taking control away from the [[Company of One Hundred Associates]].

The government of the colony was reformed along the lines of the government of France, with the Governor General and [[Intendant of New France|Intendant]] subordinate to the Minister of the Marine in France. In 1665, [[Jean Talon]] was sent by Minister of the Marine [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to New France as the first Intendant. These reforms limited the power of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.\n\nThe [[1666 census of New France]] was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665\u201366. It showed a population of 3,215 ''habitants'' in New France, many more than there had been only a few decades earlier, but also a great difference in the number of men (2,034) and women (1,181).<ref name = Talon>{{cite web |title=Statistics for the 1666 Census |url=http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/aaweb-bin/aamain/itemdisp?sessionKey=999999999_142&l=0&d=2&v=0&lvl=1&itm=30327415 |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |year=2006 |accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nTalon tried to reform the seigneurial system, forcing the ''seigneurs'' to actually reside on their land, and limiting the size of the ''seigneuries'', in an attempt to make more land available to new settlers. These schemes were ultimately unsuccessful. Very few settlers arrived, and the various industries established by Talon did not surpass the importance of the fur trade.\n\n===Settlers and their families===\n[[File:The Arrival of the French Girls at Quebec, 1667 - C.W.

They came expressly to settle, stay in one place to make the New France settlement function. Waves of recruits came in response to the requests for men with specific skills, like farming, apothecaries, blacksmiths. As couples married, cash incentives to have large families were put in place, and were effective.\n\nTo strengthen the colony and make it the centre of [[French colonial empire|France's colonial empire]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] decided to send single women, aged between 15 and 30 known as the [[King's Daughters]] or in French, les filles du roi, to New France, paying for their passage and granting goods or money as a dowry. Approximately 800 arrived during 1663\u20131673. The King's Daughters found husbands among the male settlers within a year or two, as well as a new life for themselves. They came on their own choice, many because they could not make a favorable marriage in the social hierarchy in France. They were from commoner families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France. By 1672, the population of New France had risen to 6,700, from 3,200 in 1663.<ref name=peupl>{{cite web |title=Le peuplement d'un pays |url=http://www.mcq.org/histoire/filles_du_roi/peuplem.html |publisher=Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation |year=1998}}</ref>\n[[File:1664AmeriqueNord.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Political map of the northeastern part of North America in 1664]]\nAt the same time, marriages with the indigenous peoples were encouraged, and [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]], known as ''engag\u00e9s'', were also sent to New France.

During the 16th and early 17th centuries New France's economy was heavily centered on its [[Atlantic]] fisheries. This would change in the later half of the 17th and 18th centuries as [[France|French]] settlement penetrated further into the continental interior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watkins |first=Melville H. |title=A Staple Theory of Economic Growth |journal=The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013158 |date=May 1963 |jstor=139461 |doi=10.2307/139461}}</ref> Here French economic interests would shift and concentrate itself on the development of the [[North American fur trade]].

It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the [[Company of New France]] was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of [[furs]] from French territories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=E. R. |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ram/1942/v21/n1/300228ar.pdf |title=The Evolution of Montreal under the French Regime |journal=Report of the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=1942 |pp=20\u201341 |doi=10.7202/300228ar}}</ref> By trading with various indigenous populations and securing the main markets its power grew steadily for the next decade. As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.\n\nThe fur trade itself was based on a [[commodity]] of small bulk but yet high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French [[colony]]. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the [[fur trade]] had on its neighbouring areas of the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Innis |first=H.A. |title=Significant Factors in Canadian Economic Development |journal=Canadian Historical Review |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=374\u2013384 |date=1937 |doi=10.3138/CHR-018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the [[fur trade]], the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.\n\nThe founding of the [[Compagnie des Indes]] in 1718, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wien |first=Thomas |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1990/v1/n1/031021ar.pdf |title=Selling Beaver Skins in North America and Europe, 1720\u20131760: The Uses of Fur-Trade Imperialism |journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1990 |pp=293\u2013317 |doi=10.7202/031021ar}}</ref> This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associes, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices.

This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing [[Montreal]] and New France altogether; many began trading with either [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants to the south.<ref name = \"illegalfurtrade\"/>\n\nBy the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key stable good that supported much of New France's economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.\n\n===Coureurs des bois and voyageurs===\n[[File:Arrival of Radisson in an Indian camp 1660 Charles William Jefferys.jpg|thumb|The arrival of [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] in an Amerindian camp in 1660]]\nThe [[coureurs des bois]] were responsible for starting the flow of trade from [[Montreal]], carrying [[France|French]] goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their [[furs]]. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the [[Ottawa River]] as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/> The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the [[Iroquois]]. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.\n\nMontreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of [[Europe]]. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nThe issues caused a great rift in the [[colony]], and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The [[fur trade]] remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nAs time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called [[voyageurs]].\n\n===Indigenous peoples===\n[[File:Woodlands Shirt, c. 1720-1750.jpg|thumb|Leather Shirt, c. 1720\u20131750.

Made of antelope hide, the interlocking abstract painted designs probably represent the sacred [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]].]]\nThe [[French people|French]] were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friders |first=James S. |title=Native Peoples in Canada: Contemporary Conflicts |location=Scarborough: Ontario |publisher=Prentice-Hall Canada |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-1301-2204-9}}</ref>\n\nAs the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives' Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.\n\nThe fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |last2=Lewis |first2=Frank D. |title=Commerce by Frozen Sea: Native Americans and the European Fur Trade |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0812204827 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjc34n1z8pYC&pg=PP1}}</ref>\n\n===Formal entry of England in New France area fur trade===\n[[File:Claude Bernou Carte de lAmerique septentrionale.jpg|thumb|1681 French map of the New World above the equator: New France and the [[Great Lakes]] in the north, with a dark line as the [[Mississippi River]] to the west in the [[Illinois Country]] and the mouth of the river (and future New Orleans) then ''[[terra incognita]]'']]\n\nSince [[Henry Hudson]] had claimed [[Hudson Bay]], and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the [[Canada|Canadian]] north beyond the French-held territory of New France.

The Sovereign Council effectively acted as the functional equivalent of a Council of State (''Conseil d'\u00c9tat'') for New France, having the authority to hand down verdicts on final appeal.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} Initially, the Council convened once every week, and the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} The Council's practices evolved over time.

All royal judges and king's attorneys in New France had to be thoroughly familiar with this compilation of rules.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} The Custom governed various civil aspects of the daily life in New France, including property, marriage, inheritance, and so on.\n\n=====Montreal Island: transition from feudal justice to royal justice=====\nThe [[Island of Montreal]] was a special case because its judiciary had been previously held by the Society of St-Sulpice. In 1663, Governor-General of New France [[Augustin de Saffray de M\u00e9sy]] originally considered appointing [[Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve]] the Governor of the Island of Montreal and consolidating a royal jurisdiction on the island, but the plan garnered the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice|St-Sulpicians]]' disapproval, who held the Island as its own [[fief]]dom and effectively acted as the island's governor.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=253}} In other words, the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]] had not been able to seize effective control over the legal matters of the Island; instead, the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice|St-Sulpicians]] administered justice on the island.\n\nIt was not until 16 September 1666, that the St-Sulpicians finally handed over the justice of the Island of Montreal to the Intendant of New France.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=254}} In 1693, the French king commanded the replacement of the ecclesiastical courts in Montreal with a royal court composed of one royal judge, with appeals going to the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]]. The introduction of a royal court on the Montreal Island also resulted in the abolition of the feudal court in the fief of [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] (then held by the [[Jesuits]]).{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=261}}\n\n=====Quebec: founding of the Provostry of Quebec=====\nIn the Quebec City district, the lower court (''tribunal ant\u00e9rieur'') was established in 1664 and had jurisdiction to try cases at first instance, but then it was abolished in 1674.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}} The Sovereign Council appointed trial judges (''juges inf\u00e9rieurs'') to adjudicate cases at first instance until the [[Provost (civil)|Provost]]ry of Quebec (''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec'') was created in May 1677.\n\nThe Provostry of Quebec was located in the Hall of Justice (''palais de justice'') in Quebec City and had only one royal judge, also known as the civil and criminal lieutenant general of Quebec City, who heard both civil and criminal cases, as well as district police.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}} Additionally, a court clerk and a king's attorney were appointed to the court; if either of these two officers could not attend the trials due to illness or other untenable circumstances, the Intendant would appoint a temporary substitute.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}}\n\n===Criminal Justice===\n{{Main|Criminal Justice in New France}}\nIn the early stages of French colonization, the execution of criminal justice in New France were rather arbitrary.

As a result of the war, Maine fell to the New Englanders with the defeat of Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]] at Norridgewock and the subsequent retreat of the indigenous peoples from the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers to [[Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]] and [[B\u00e9cancour, Quebec|Becancour, Quebec]].{{efn|While New Englanders safely settled the land, not until the treaty of 1752 did Massachusetts officially lay claim to the entire Penobscot watershed, and in 1759, the Pownall Expedition, led by Governor [[Thomas Pownall]], established [[Fort Pownall]] on [[Cape Jellison]] in what is now [[Stockton Springs, Maine|Stockton Springs]].}}\n\n===King George's War===\n{{Main|King George's War}}\n\nPeace lasted in Canada until 1744, when news of the outbreak of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] ([[King George's War]] in North America) reached Fort Louisbourg. The French forces went on the attack first in a failed attempt to capture [[Annapolis Royal]], the capital of the British Nova Scotia. In 1745, [[William Shirley]], governor of [[Massachusetts]], led a counterattack on Louisbourg. Both France and New France were unable to relieve the siege, and Louisbourg fell to the British. With the famed [[Duc d'Anville Expedition]], France attempted to retake Acadia and the fortress in 1746 but failed. The fortress was returned to France under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], but the peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes.\n\n===Father Le Loutre's War===\n{{Main|Father Le Loutre's War}}\n\nWithin Acadia and Nova Scotia, [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) began with the British founding of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. During Father Le Loutre's War, New France established three forts along the border of present-day [[New Brunswick]] to protect it from a New England attack from Nova Scotia. The war continued until British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|victory at Fort Beausejour]], which dislodged Father Le Loutre from the region, thereby ending his alliance with the Maliseet, [[Acadians]] and [[Mi'kmaq]].<ref name=Grenier/>\n\n===French and Indian War===\n{{Main|French and Indian War|Expulsion of the Acadians}}\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of territorial claims in [[North America]] by 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]], which was part of the greater worldwide conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756 to 1763). Possessions of Britain (pink), France (blue), and Spain (orange, ''California, Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin not indicated'')]]\n\n[[Fort Duquesne]], located at the confluence of the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River]]s at the site of present-day [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], guarded the most important strategic location in the west at the time of the Seven Years' War. It was built to ensure that the [[Ohio River]] valley remained under French control. A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under [[Claude-Pierre P\u00e9caudy de Contrec\u0153ur]] drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.\n\nIn 1755, General [[Edward Braddock]] led [[Braddock Expedition|an expedition]] against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock's army was routed and Braddock was killed.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title=The Battle of the Monongahela |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1755 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).\n\nThe fight for control over Ohio Country led to the [[French and Indian War]], which began as the North American phase of the [[Seven Years' War]] (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel [[George Washington]] by the French [[troupes de la marine]] in the [[Ohio Country|Ohio valley]]. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the [[Battle of Fort Beausejour]] (1755) and then [[\u00cele Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]) (which also administered \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]].\n\nThroughout the war, the British forcibly removed the Acadians from their lands, which the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias resisted. The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] continued from 1755 to 1764.\n\nThese British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.\n\nThe following year the French had one victory and one defeat. The defeat was at the French fortress city of Louisbourg. The victory was at the strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George at the French fortress of Fort Carillon. The British force sent to capture Fort Carillon (held by just 3400 French regulars and marines with almost no militia or indigenous support) was the largest ever seen in America at that time: 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops under the command of General James Abercrombie. This battle cost the British 2200 troops, several artillery pieces against French losses of around 200 killed or wounded.\n\nWhile the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with [[Fort Beausejour]] and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the [[Battle of Beausejour]] and immediately after began the [[expulsion of the Acadians]]. \n\nIn the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. [[Fort de la Corne]] was built in 1753, by [[Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne]] just east of the [[Saskatchewan River Forks]] in what is today the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.\n\n==Treaties of cession==\n{{further|Conquest of New France (1758-1760)}}\nIn 1758, British forces again [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured Louisbourg]], allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General [[James Wolfe]] defeated the French under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after [[Montreal Campaign|the attack on Montreal]], which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]], surrendered to British Major General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] on 8 September 1760.

The [[Louisiana Territory]], under [[Spain|Spanish]] control since the end of the Seven Years' War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.\n\nTwelve years after the British defeated the French, the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in the Thirteen Colonies. Many French Canadians would take part in the war, including Major [[Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin]] and Admiral [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]]. After the British surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]] in 1781, the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave all former British claims in New France below the [[Great Lakes]] into the possession of the nascent [[United States]]. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.\n\nThe portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], 1791\u20131841, and then those regions were merged as the [[Province of Canada]] during 1841\u20131867, when the passage of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] instituted [[home rule]] for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the [[Confederation of Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the [[Colony of Nova Scotia]] but shortly thereafter the [[Colony of New Brunswick]], which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.\n\nIn Canada, the legacy of New France can be seen in the enduring [[Canadian identity#French Canadians and Identity in English Canada|Francophone identity]] of its descendants, which has led to [[Bilingualism in Canada|institutional bilingualism]] in Canada as a whole.\n\nThe only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (French: Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands {{convert|25|km|mi nmi}} off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada.\n\n==Political divisions of New France==\n[[File:Constitution-of-new-france-1759.png|thumb|A chart showing the political organization of New France, c. 1759]]\nThe territory of New France was divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], Hudson's Bay, [[Acadia]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|(Plaisance)]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=Francis2009 /><ref name=Territoire /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=canada_new_france |title=Canada at the Time of New France  |date=2004  |author=University of Ottawa |accessdate= March 24, 2017}}</ref> The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]], now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].<ref name=Johnston2001 /><ref name=Louisbourg /> Acadia had a difficult history, with the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]], remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003.

French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable [[fur]]-bearing animals, especially the [[American Beaver|beaver]], which were becoming rare in [[Europe]]. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.\n\nAnother early French attempt at settlement in North America took place in 1564 at [[Fort Caroline]], now [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Intended as a haven for [[Huguenot]]s, Caroline was founded under the leadership of [[Ren\u00e9 Goulaine de Laudonni\u00e8re]] and [[Jean Ribault]]. It was sacked by the [[Spain|Spanish]] led by [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]] who then established the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] on 20 September 1565.\n\n[[Acadia]] and [[Canada (New France)]] were inhabited by [[indigenous peoples of North America|indigenous]] nomadic [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples and sedentary [[Iroquoian]] peoples. These lands were full of unexploited and valuable natural resources, which attracted all of Europe. By the 1580s, French trading companies had been set up, and ships were contracted to bring back furs. Much of what transpired between the indigenous population and their European visitors around that time is not known, for lack of historical records.<ref name=Riendeau/>\n\nOther attempts at establishing permanent settlements were also failures.

Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. But the severely underpopulated New France almost fell completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] led a Canadian and Huron [[militia]] against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement. In 1663, New France finally became more secure when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] made it a royal province, taking control away from the [[Company of One Hundred Associates]]. In the same year the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al]] ceded its possessions to the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Seminaire de Saint-Sulpice]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Brian |title=In Its Corporate Capacity: the Seminary of Montreal as a Business Institution, 1816\u201376 |location=Montreal |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1986 |chapter=Chapter 1, Holy Housekeeping: The Company and Business Management |pages=[https://archive.org/details/initscorporateca0000youn/page/3 3\u201337] |isbn=978-0-7735-0554-4 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lEF2PSj_S-QC@pg=PA3 |url=https://archive.org/details/initscorporateca0000youn/page/3 }}</ref> The crown stimulated emigration to New France by paying for transatlantic passages and offering other incentives to those willing to move, and the population of New France grew to three thousand.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Alan |title=American Colonies: The Settling of North America |date=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-200210-0 |pages=365\u2013366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPoAQRgkrOcC&pg=PA365}}</ref>\n\nIn 1665, Louis XIV sent a French garrison, the [[Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment]], to Quebec. The government of the colony was reformed along the lines of the government of France, with the Governor General and [[Intendant of New France|Intendant]] subordinate to the Minister of the Marine in France. In 1665, [[Jean Talon]] was sent by Minister of the Marine [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to New France as the first Intendant. These reforms limited the power of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.\n\nThe [[1666 census of New France]] was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665\u201366. It showed a population of 3,215 ''habitants'' in New France, many more than there had been only a few decades earlier, but also a great difference in the number of men (2,034) and women (1,181).<ref name = Talon>{{cite web |title=Statistics for the 1666 Census |url=http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/aaweb-bin/aamain/itemdisp?sessionKey=999999999_142&l=0&d=2&v=0&lvl=1&itm=30327415 |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |year=2006 |accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nTalon tried to reform the seigneurial system, forcing the ''seigneurs'' to actually reside on their land, and limiting the size of the ''seigneuries'', in an attempt to make more land available to new settlers. These schemes were ultimately unsuccessful. Very few settlers arrived, and the various industries established by Talon did not surpass the importance of the fur trade.\n\n===Settlers and their families===\n[[File:The Arrival of the French Girls at Quebec, 1667 - C.W. Jefferys.jpg|thumb|One group of [[King's Daughters]] arrives at Quebec, 1667]]\n\nThe first settler was brought to Quebec by Champlain{{snd}}the apothecary Louis H\u00e9bert and his family, of Paris. They came expressly to settle, stay in one place to make the New France settlement function. Waves of recruits came in response to the requests for men with specific skills, like farming, apothecaries, blacksmiths. As couples married, cash incentives to have large families were put in place, and were effective.\n\nTo strengthen the colony and make it the centre of [[French colonial empire|France's colonial empire]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] decided to send single women, aged between 15 and 30 known as the [[King's Daughters]] or in French, les filles du roi, to New France, paying for their passage and granting goods or money as a dowry. Approximately 800 arrived during 1663\u20131673. The King's Daughters found husbands among the male settlers within a year or two, as well as a new life for themselves. They came on their own choice, many because they could not make a favorable marriage in the social hierarchy in France. They were from commoner families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France. By 1672, the population of New France had risen to 6,700, from 3,200 in 1663.<ref name=peupl>{{cite web |title=Le peuplement d'un pays |url=http://www.mcq.org/histoire/filles_du_roi/peuplem.html |publisher=Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation |year=1998}}</ref>\n[[File:1664AmeriqueNord.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Political map of the northeastern part of North America in 1664]]\nAt the same time, marriages with the indigenous peoples were encouraged, and [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]], known as ''engag\u00e9s'', were also sent to New France.

Industries such as fishing and farming, which had failed under Talon, began to flourish. A \"King's Highway\" (''[[Chemin du Roy]]'') was built between Montreal and Quebec to encourage faster trade. The shipping industry also flourished as new ports were built and old ones were upgraded. The number of colonists greatly increased.

During the 16th and early 17th centuries New France's economy was heavily centered on its [[Atlantic]] fisheries. This would change in the later half of the 17th and 18th centuries as [[France|French]] settlement penetrated further into the continental interior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watkins |first=Melville H. |title=A Staple Theory of Economic Growth |journal=The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013158 |date=May 1963 |jstor=139461 |doi=10.2307/139461}}</ref> Here French economic interests would shift and concentrate itself on the development of the [[North American fur trade]].

It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the [[Company of New France]] was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of [[furs]] from French territories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=E. R. |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ram/1942/v21/n1/300228ar.pdf |title=The Evolution of Montreal under the French Regime |journal=Report of the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=1942 |pp=20\u201341 |doi=10.7202/300228ar}}</ref> By trading with various indigenous populations and securing the main markets its power grew steadily for the next decade. As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.\n\nThe fur trade itself was based on a [[commodity]] of small bulk but yet high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French [[colony]]. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the [[fur trade]] had on its neighbouring areas of the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Innis |first=H.A. |title=Significant Factors in Canadian Economic Development |journal=Canadian Historical Review |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=374\u2013384 |date=1937 |doi=10.3138/CHR-018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the [[fur trade]], the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.\n\nThe founding of the [[Compagnie des Indes]] in 1718, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wien |first=Thomas |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1990/v1/n1/031021ar.pdf |title=Selling Beaver Skins in North America and Europe, 1720\u20131760: The Uses of Fur-Trade Imperialism |journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1990 |pp=293\u2013317 |doi=10.7202/031021ar}}</ref> This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associes, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices.

This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing [[Montreal]] and New France altogether; many began trading with either [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants to the south.<ref name = \"illegalfurtrade\"/>\n\nBy the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key stable good that supported much of New France's economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.\n\n===Coureurs des bois and voyageurs===\n[[File:Arrival of Radisson in an Indian camp 1660 Charles William Jefferys.jpg|thumb|The arrival of [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] in an Amerindian camp in 1660]]\nThe [[coureurs des bois]] were responsible for starting the flow of trade from [[Montreal]], carrying [[France|French]] goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their [[furs]]. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the [[Ottawa River]] as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/> The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the [[Iroquois]]. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.\n\nMontreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of [[Europe]]. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nThe issues caused a great rift in the [[colony]], and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The [[fur trade]] remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nAs time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called [[voyageurs]].\n\n===Indigenous peoples===\n[[File:Woodlands Shirt, c. 1720-1750.jpg|thumb|Leather Shirt, c. 1720\u20131750.

Made of antelope hide, the interlocking abstract painted designs probably represent the sacred [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]].]]\nThe [[French people|French]] were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friders |first=James S. |title=Native Peoples in Canada: Contemporary Conflicts |location=Scarborough: Ontario |publisher=Prentice-Hall Canada |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-1301-2204-9}}</ref>\n\nAs the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives' Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.\n\nThe fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |last2=Lewis |first2=Frank D. |title=Commerce by Frozen Sea: Native Americans and the European Fur Trade |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0812204827 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjc34n1z8pYC&pg=PP1}}</ref>\n\n===Formal entry of England in New France area fur trade===\n[[File:Claude Bernou Carte de lAmerique septentrionale.jpg|thumb|1681 French map of the New World above the equator: New France and the [[Great Lakes]] in the north, with a dark line as the [[Mississippi River]] to the west in the [[Illinois Country]] and the mouth of the river (and future New Orleans) then ''[[terra incognita]]'']]\n\nSince [[Henry Hudson]] had claimed [[Hudson Bay]], and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the [[Canada|Canadian]] north beyond the French-held territory of New France.

To secure New France's claim to the region, it established [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missions among the three largest indigenous villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River ([[Norridgewock]]); one further north on the [[Penobscot River]] ([[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Penobscot]]) and one on the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] ([[Meductic Indian Village / Fort Meductic|Medoctec]]).<ref>{{CRHP|14831|Meductic Indian Village / Fort Meductic National Historic Site of Canada |20 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=Grenier>{{cite book |first=John |last=Grenier |title=The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710\u20131760 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |date=2008 |p=51, 54 |isbn=978-0-8061-3876-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG5h6G5fWMC&pg=PA51}}</ref>\n\nThe war began on two fronts: when New England pushed its way through Maine and when New England established itself at [[Canso, Nova Scotia]].

The French forces went on the attack first in a failed attempt to capture [[Annapolis Royal]], the capital of the British Nova Scotia. In 1745, [[William Shirley]], governor of [[Massachusetts]], led a counterattack on Louisbourg. Both France and New France were unable to relieve the siege, and Louisbourg fell to the British. With the famed [[Duc d'Anville Expedition]], France attempted to retake Acadia and the fortress in 1746 but failed. The fortress was returned to France under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], but the peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes.\n\n===Father Le Loutre's War===\n{{Main|Father Le Loutre's War}}\n\nWithin Acadia and Nova Scotia, [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) began with the British founding of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. During Father Le Loutre's War, New France established three forts along the border of present-day [[New Brunswick]] to protect it from a New England attack from Nova Scotia. The war continued until British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|victory at Fort Beausejour]], which dislodged Father Le Loutre from the region, thereby ending his alliance with the Maliseet, [[Acadians]] and [[Mi'kmaq]].<ref name=Grenier/>\n\n===French and Indian War===\n{{Main|French and Indian War|Expulsion of the Acadians}}\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of territorial claims in [[North America]] by 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]], which was part of the greater worldwide conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756 to 1763).

It was built to ensure that the [[Ohio River]] valley remained under French control. A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under [[Claude-Pierre P\u00e9caudy de Contrec\u0153ur]] drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.\n\nIn 1755, General [[Edward Braddock]] led [[Braddock Expedition|an expedition]] against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock's army was routed and Braddock was killed.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title=The Battle of the Monongahela |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1755 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).\n\nThe fight for control over Ohio Country led to the [[French and Indian War]], which began as the North American phase of the [[Seven Years' War]] (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel [[George Washington]] by the French [[troupes de la marine]] in the [[Ohio Country|Ohio valley]]. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the [[Battle of Fort Beausejour]] (1755) and then [[\u00cele Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]) (which also administered \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]].\n\nThroughout the war, the British forcibly removed the Acadians from their lands, which the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias resisted. The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] continued from 1755 to 1764.\n\nThese British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.\n\nThe following year the French had one victory and one defeat. The defeat was at the French fortress city of Louisbourg. The victory was at the strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George at the French fortress of Fort Carillon. The British force sent to capture Fort Carillon (held by just 3400 French regulars and marines with almost no militia or indigenous support) was the largest ever seen in America at that time: 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops under the command of General James Abercrombie. This battle cost the British 2200 troops, several artillery pieces against French losses of around 200 killed or wounded.\n\nWhile the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with [[Fort Beausejour]] and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the [[Battle of Beausejour]] and immediately after began the [[expulsion of the Acadians]]. \n\nIn the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. [[Fort de la Corne]] was built in 1753, by [[Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne]] just east of the [[Saskatchewan River Forks]] in what is today the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.\n\n==Treaties of cession==\n{{further|Conquest of New France (1758-1760)}}\nIn 1758, British forces again [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured Louisbourg]], allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General [[James Wolfe]] defeated the French under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after [[Montreal Campaign|the attack on Montreal]], which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]], surrendered to British Major General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] on 8 September 1760.

The [[Louisiana Territory]], under [[Spain|Spanish]] control since the end of the Seven Years' War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.\n\nTwelve years after the British defeated the French, the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in the Thirteen Colonies. Many French Canadians would take part in the war, including Major [[Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin]] and Admiral [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]]. After the British surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]] in 1781, the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave all former British claims in New France below the [[Great Lakes]] into the possession of the nascent [[United States]]. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.\n\nThe portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], 1791\u20131841, and then those regions were merged as the [[Province of Canada]] during 1841\u20131867, when the passage of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] instituted [[home rule]] for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the [[Confederation of Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the [[Colony of Nova Scotia]] but shortly thereafter the [[Colony of New Brunswick]], which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.\n\nIn Canada, the legacy of New France can be seen in the enduring [[Canadian identity#French Canadians and Identity in English Canada|Francophone identity]] of its descendants, which has led to [[Bilingualism in Canada|institutional bilingualism]] in Canada as a whole.\n\nThe only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (French: Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands {{convert|25|km|mi nmi}} off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada.\n\n==Political divisions of New France==\n[[File:Constitution-of-new-france-1759.png|thumb|A chart showing the political organization of New France, c. 1759]]\nThe territory of New France was divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], Hudson's Bay, [[Acadia]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|(Plaisance)]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=Francis2009 /><ref name=Territoire /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=canada_new_france |title=Canada at the Time of New France  |date=2004  |author=University of Ottawa |accessdate= March 24, 2017}}</ref> The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]], now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].<ref name=Johnston2001 /><ref name=Louisbourg /> Acadia had a difficult history, with the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]], remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003.

His friend's parents are not college educated, though they have a good deal of money. They agree to accompany him to the store and to purchase the wine for him. He has $2.00, which his mother gave him, with which to purchase the wine, and, after a car ride in a brand new Buick during which he becomes embarrassed when questioned about what kind of car his father drives, John gives his friend's father the money. His friend's father, in what seems to be an active gesture of financial superiority signifying his internal struggle with the inferiority of his own education, purchases a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild 1937, and gives it to John along with $1.26 in change. John goes home to the dinner party somewhat dismayed, for the wrong reason, that he failed to follow his mother's instructions to buy a bottle that is \"inexpensive but nice.\"\n\nCh\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild wine plays a brief, but important part in the 1971 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''.

In the same time, in order to secure grape supplies and ensure the development of its Chilean branded wines business, Baron Philippe de Rothschild acquired 960 hectares from Vi\u00f1a Villavicencio.\n\n==Judgment of Paris==\nThe 1970 vintage took second place, and was the highest ranked French wine, at the historic 1976 [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]] [[wine competition]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn [[John Updike]]'s 1954 short story \"Friends from Philadelphia\", first published by ''[[The New Yorker]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1954-10-30#folio=032|title=The New Yorker Digital Edition : Oct 30, 1954|author=|date=|website=archives.newyorker.com}}</ref> the protagonist, John, attempts to buy a bottle of wine for his parents's dinner party, but he is denied, being too young to purchase alcohol. His parents are college educated, though not necessarily very wealthy. He seeks the help of his friend's parents at a nearby house as his home is about a mile up the road. His friend's parents are not college educated, though they have a good deal of money. They agree to accompany him to the store and to purchase the wine for him. He has $2.00, which his mother gave him, with which to purchase the wine, and, after a car ride in a brand new Buick during which he becomes embarrassed when questioned about what kind of car his father drives, John gives his friend's father the money. His friend's father, in what seems to be an active gesture of financial superiority signifying his internal struggle with the inferiority of his own education, purchases a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild 1937, and gives it to John along with $1.26 in change. John goes home to the dinner party somewhat dismayed, for the wrong reason, that he failed to follow his mother's instructions to buy a bottle that is \"inexpensive but nice.\"\n\nCh\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild wine plays a brief, but important part in the 1971 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''. Bond (played by [[Sean Connery]]), after tasting a glass of Mouton Rothschild 1955, casually remarks that he had expected a claret with the grand dinner he has been served.  When the villain [[Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd|Mr. Wint]] (played by [[Bruce Glover]]) replies that the cellars are poorly stocked with clarets, Bond exposes Wint's ignorance, replying that Mouton Rothschild, in fact, ''is'' a claret.<ref name=shades>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/ch%C3%A2teau-mouton-rothschild-premier-cru-class%C3%A9-bordeaux |title=Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild in Diamonds Are Forever |accessdate=2014-01-19 |work=Bond Lifestyle |publisher=www.jamesbondlifestyle.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Roald Dahl]] cites it as one of the world's greatest wines in his short story \"The Butler\", from ''[[More Tales of the Unexpected]]''.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]'', a bottle of Mouton Rothschild 1982 is visible on the table during the scene where Bernie proposes having his two employees killed and framed for his insurance fraud.\n\nIn Agatha Christie's short story \"The Labors of Hercules\", the story opens with Hercule Poirot speaking with Dr. Burton over a glass of Chateau Mouton Rothschild. Dr. Burton describes the wine as \"Very good wine, this. Very sound.\"\n\nIn the ''[[The Spy (TV series)]]'' approximately 5 minutes from the start of the episode #3 ''[[Alone in Damascus]]'', the Israeli spy ''[[Eli Cohen]]'' (''[[Sacha Baron Cohen]]'') orders a bottle of Mouton Rothschild 1945 during the scene in the restaurant on his marine trip from [[Buenos Aires]]: \"I'll have the '45 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild\".

A [[Field propulsion|propellantless drive]] is not necessarily reactionless when it constitutes an [[open system (thermodynamics)|open system]] interacting with external [[Field (physics)|field]]s; but a reactionless drive is a particular case of a propellantless drive that is a [[closed system]], presumably in contradiction with the [[Momentum#Conservation|law of conservation of momentum]]. Reactionless drives are often considered similar to a [[perpetual motion machine]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Winchell D. Chung Jr |title=Reactionless drives |url=http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/reactionlessdrive.php}}</ref> The name comes from [[Newton's third law]], often expressed as, \"for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"\n\nMany infeasible reactionless drives, such as the [[Dean drive]], are a staple of [[science fiction]] particularly for [[space propulsion]].\n\n== Closed systems ==\nThrough the years there have been numerous claims for functional reactionless drive designs using ordinary mechanics (i.e., devices not said to be based on quantum mechanics, relativity or atomic forces or effects). Two of these represent their general classes: the Dean drive is perhaps the best known example of a \"linear oscillating mechanism\" reactionless drive; the gyroscopic inertial thruster is perhaps the best known example of a \"rotating mechanism\" reactionless drive. These two also stand out as they both received much publicity from their promoters and the popular press in their day and both were eventually rejected when proven to not produce any reactionless drive forces. The rise and fall of these devices now serves as a cautionary tale for those making and reviewing similar claims.<ref name=NASA />\n\n=== Dean drive ===\nThe [[Dean drive]] was a mechanical device concept promoted by inventor Norman L.
