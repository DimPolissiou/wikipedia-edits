Introduced to organizing in Civil Rights Movement, he worked on the staff of the [[United Farm Workers]] for sixteen years, became trainer and organizer for political campaigns, unions and nonprofit groups, and returned to Harvard where he earned his PhD in Sociology (2000). He is credited with devising the successful [[grassroots organizing]] model and training for [[Barack Obama]]\u2019s winning [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]].<ref>Scott Martelle, \u201c[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/15/nation/na-ganz15 Famed organizer Marshall Ganz sees history in the making],\u201d ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', June 15, 2008.

After they moved to California, they lived in [[Fresno]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], where he attended local schools.  His father was a rabbi and his mother a teacher. For three years after World War II, his family lived in occupied Germany, where his father served as a US Army chaplain working with [[displaced persons]]. Having encountered survivors of the [[Holocaust]], his parents taught Marshall about the dangers of [[racism]] and [[anti-Semitism]].\n\nGanz entered Harvard in the fall of 1960. He left before graduating in 1964 to volunteer for the [[Mississippi Summer Project]], where he worked in a freedom house in [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]]. He helped to organize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] delegation to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]. He stayed on in Mississippi as a field secretary for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] in [[Amite County]].<ref>Marshall Ganz faculty profile, John F.

Dutton, 1971), pp. 50-51</ref>\n\n==Work with United Farm Workers==\n\nIn fall 1965 Ganz returned to California to work with [[Cesar Chavez]] to organize agricultural workers.  He served in a variety of positions for the [[United Farm Workers of America]], including organizer, field office administrator, negotiator, director of the grape and lettuce boycotts, and director of organizing.  For eight years, from 1973 to 1981, he was an elected member of the union's national executive board.  Chavez's background in the [[community organizing]] tradition shaped Ganz's understanding of organizing.\n\n[[Saul Alinsky]] had hired [[Fred Ross]] in 1947 to develop the [[Community Service Organization]] (CSO) to organize [[Mexican Americans]] in [[Los Angeles]] and California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]].  Chavez and [[Dolores Huerta]] learned community organizing working for Ross and CSO.  When Chavez shifted his focus to farm workers, he asked Ross to join him as director of organizing.  As Chavez's National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), as it was then named, battled the Teamsters for its first contract with the DiGiorgio corporation in 1966, it was Ross's methodical and disciplined approach to tracking each farm worker supporting the union that helped Chavez win.<ref>Ganz, ''Why David Sometimes Wins'', pp. 188-200.</ref> Chavez also took from CSO the idea of service organizations for the farm workers, to supplement the standard union activities.<ref>Ganz, ''Why David Sometimes Wins'', pp. 90-91.</ref>\n\nGanz's experience with the farm workers led him to formulate his concept of \u201cstrategic capacity.,\u201d He says this explains how Chavez's farmworker organizing succeeded, while earlier efforts by radicals, and contemporaneous campaigns by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) sponsored by the [[AFL-CIO]], and by the [[Teamsters]], failed.  Ganz defines strategy as \"how we turn what we have into what we need to get what we want.\"<ref>Ganz, ''Why David Sometimes Wins'', p. 8.</ref> Strategic capacity, for Ganz, consists of three elements: motivation, access to relevant knowledge, and deliberations that lead to new learning.  Chavez's efforts eventually prevailed because his organizing team had stronger motivation, deeper knowledge of the Mexican-American culture of the Central Valley, and diverse perspectives that generated fresh tactical ideas.<ref>Ganz, ''Why David Sometimes Wins'', pp. 117-118.</ref>\n\nAt the peak of its success in 1977, the UFWA stopped its aggressive organizing and turned inward. Chavez worked with Chuck Detrick, founder of the [[Synanon]] drug treatment cult, to transform the internal life of the union.  As Chavez purged the union of its long-term leaders and loyalty to Chavez became the primary criterion for employment, the UFWA lost its strategic capacity.  Over the next three years, members of the Executive Board opposed to the direction Chavez was taking the union resigned, including Ganz in 1981.<ref>Frank Bardacke, ''Trampling Out the Vintage: Cesar Chavez and the Two Souls of the United Farm Workers'' (Verso, 2011), pp. 550-721.</ref>  Union membership has dropped from a peak of 60,000 in the late 1970s to around 5,000 in 2009.<ref>Eric Brazil, \u201cChavez made UFW \u2013 and unmade it,\u201d ''San Francisco Chronicle'' and ''SFgate.com'',  July 19, 2009, p. E5.[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/19/IN1B18NVA6.DTL]</ref>\n\n==Political consultant==\n\nAfter leaving the UFWA in 1981, Ganz began working on California political campaigns\u2014directing field programs, training organizers, and leading strategic planning for such candidates as [[Nancy Pelosi]] for Congress, [[Alan Cranston]] for Senate, [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] for governor, and governor [[Jerry Brown]].  He also worked on campaigns of such unions as the [[Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union]] (HERE), [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), and the [[Screen Actors Guild]].  In 1987 he formed and served as executive director of two groups to develop organizing programs, Services for Organizing and Leadership, and The Organizing Institute.  He led voter registration, get-out-the-vote, and organizer training. He also conducted research on voting, leadership development, and community organizing.\n\n==Return to Harvard==\n\nGanz returned to Harvard in 1991 (after a 28-year absence) to finish his undergraduate degree in history and government, graduating in 1992.   He received a [[Master in Public Administration]] from the Kennedy School of Government in 1993 and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[sociology]] in 2000.<ref>Wolfgang, \u201cMarshall Ganz Seminar \u2013 Summary,\u201d Progressive Strategy Studies Project, 1 May 2006.\u201d[http://progressive-strategy2.blogspot.com/2006/05/marshall-ganz-seminar-summary.html]</ref>  He became an instructor for the Kennedy School in 1994. Since completing his doctorate in 2000, he has been a lecturer in public policy, teaching courses on organizing, leadership, civic engagement, and community action research.  He has collaborated with Harvard professors [[Theda Skocpol]] on African-American fraternal organizations, and with [[Lani Guinier]] for a course on law and social movements.\n\nMarshall Ganz teaches 4 courses at Harvard Kennedy School of Government:\n\n# [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/degrees/teaching-courses/course-listing/mld-355m Public Narrative: Self, Us, Now]. Public narrative is how we turn values into action\u2014the discursive process by which individuals, communities, and nations construct identity, formulate choices, and motivate action. Public narrative is a leadership art composed of three elements: a story of self, a story of us, and a story of now. Stories not only teach us how to act \u2013 they inspire us to act. Stories communicate our values through the language of the heart, our emotions. By telling our personal stories of challenges we have faced, choices we have made, and what we learned from the outcomes we can inspire others and share our own wisdom. Because stories allow us to express our values not as abstract principles, but as lived experience, they have the power to move others.<ref>WORKSHEET, TELLING YOUR PUBLIC STORY: Self, Us, Now by Marshall Ganz, Marshall Ganz, Kennedy School of Government, 2007</ref>\n# [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/degrees/teaching-courses/course-listing/mld-356m Public Narrative: Conflict, Continuity, Change]. This module builds on its prerequisite \u201cPublic Narrative: Self, Us, Now.\u201d Confronted with the same challenge, different leaders may respond with different narratives, calling on different \u201cus\u2019s,\u201d and each of which may elicit a different form of action. \n# [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/degrees/teaching-courses/course-listing/mld-377 Organizing: People, Power, Change]. In this course, students learn how to view social, economic, and political problems from an organizing perspective as well as how to act on them. Ganz focuses on teaching five key practices: how to turn values into motivated action; how to build relationships; how to structure leadership as a collaborative team; how to strategize; and how to translate commitments into action. This framework is equally useful for community, electoral, union, and social movement organizing.\n# [http://ksgexecprogram.harvard.edu/Programs/loa/overview.aspx Leadership, Organizing and Action: Leading Change]. Leadership, Organizing and Action: Leading Change is an Executive Education online program designed to reach leaders of civic, social, and political organizations from around the world who wish to learn how to organize communities that can mobilize power to make change. The program represents a unique online learning opportunity for nonprofit and non-governmental organization managers to interact with colleagues from around the world and Professor Ganz.\n\nIn addition to his teaching load, Ganz continues to be active in local politics. On June 11, 2014, Ganz endorsed [[Don Berwick]] for [[Governor of Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/holyoke_mayor_alex_morse_throw.html|title=Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse throws support behind Martha Coakley for governor of Massachusetts|author=Robert Rizzuto|work=MassLive Politics|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Organizing model==\n\nIn contrast to the structural emphasis of the once-dominant [[resource mobilization]] and [[political process]] schools of social movement analysis, Ganz emphasizes the subjective agency of social movement participants, whose values, intentions, and narratives constitute the essential material of analysis.  Ganz begins with the famous three questions of [[Hillel the Elder]], \"If I am not for myself, who will be?  And if I am for myself alone, what am \"I\"?  And if not now, when?\"  Ganz relates these questions to \"the story of self,\" \"the story of us,\" and \"the story of now.\"\n\nFor the 2008 Presidential campaign of Barack Obama, Ganz maintained that campaign workers approaching potential voters needed to be able to quickly tell their story of self to establish a relationship with the voter.  The story of us connected the values and interests of the campaign worker and voter with candidate Obama. What [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] called  \"the fierce urgency of now\" focused the voter's hopes on the imminent election. The importance of relationships, rather than campaign platforms, dominated the Camp Obama training program for campaign workers. Ganz has continued to develop this model in \"Camp OFA\" for [[Organizing for America]], the successor organization to the Obama campaign, and for \"Camp MoveOn,\" a training program for leaders of [[MoveOn.org]]'s local councils.\n\nThe Camp Obama model was based on the model first developed and used in a project for the [[Sierra Club]]. Ganz teamed up with Harvard psychology professor Ruth Wageman in an effort to improve the volunteer programs of local chapters.<ref>Sarah Lei Stirland, \u201cObama\u2019s Secret Weapons: Internet, Databases and Psychology,\u201d ''Wired'', October 29, 2008 [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/10/obamas-secret-w/]</ref>\n\n==Selected publications authored==\n\n===Books===\n\n*''What a Mighty Power We Can Be: African American Fraternal Groups and the Struggle for Racial Equality''.

Hauser]] Senior Lecturer in Leadership, Organizing, and Civil Society at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. Introduced to organizing in Civil Rights Movement, he worked on the staff of the [[United Farm Workers]] for sixteen years, became trainer and organizer for political campaigns, unions and nonprofit groups, and returned to Harvard where he earned his PhD in Sociology (2000). He is credited with devising the successful [[grassroots organizing]] model and training for [[Barack Obama]]\u2019s winning [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]].<ref>Scott Martelle, \u201c[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/15/nation/na-ganz15 Famed organizer Marshall Ganz sees history in the making],\u201d ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', June 15, 2008.

After they moved to California, they lived in [[Fresno]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], where he attended local schools.  His father was a rabbi and his mother a teacher. For three years after World War II, his family lived in occupied Germany, where his father served as a US Army chaplain working with [[displaced persons]]. Having encountered survivors of the [[Holocaust]], his parents taught Marshall about the dangers of [[racism]] and [[anti-Semitism]].\n\nGanz entered Harvard in the fall of 1960. He left before graduating in 1964 to volunteer for the [[Mississippi Summer Project]], where he worked in a freedom house in [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]]. He helped to organize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] delegation to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]. He stayed on in Mississippi as a field secretary for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] in [[Amite County]].<ref>Marshall Ganz faculty profile, John F.

Dutton, 1971), pp. 50-51</ref>\n\n==Work with United Farm Workers==\n\nIn fall 1965 Ganz returned to California to work with [[Cesar Chavez]] to organize agricultural workers.  He served in a variety of positions for the [[United Farm Workers of America]], including organizer, field office administrator, negotiator, director of the grape and lettuce boycotts, and director of organizing.  For eight years, from 1973 to 1981, he was an elected member of the union's national executive board.  Chavez's background in the [[community organizing]] tradition shaped Ganz's understanding of organizing.\n\n[[Saul Alinsky]] had hired [[Fred Ross]] in 1947 to develop the [[Community Service Organization]] (CSO) to organize [[Mexican Americans]] in [[Los Angeles]] and California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]].  Chavez and [[Dolores Huerta]] learned community organizing working for Ross and CSO.  When Chavez shifted his focus to farm workers, he asked Ross to join him as director of organizing.  As Chavez's National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), as it was then named, battled the Teamsters for its first contract with the DiGiorgio corporation in 1966, it was Ross's methodical and disciplined approach to tracking each farm worker supporting the union that helped Chavez win.<ref>Ganz, ''Why David Sometimes Wins'', pp. 188-200.</ref> Chavez also took from CSO the idea of service organizations for the farm workers, to supplement the standard union activities.<ref>Ganz, ''Why David Sometimes Wins'', pp. 90-91.</ref>\n\nGanz's experience with the farm workers led him to formulate his concept of \u201cstrategic capacity.,\u201d He says this explains how Chavez's farmworker organizing succeeded, while earlier efforts by radicals, and contemporaneous campaigns by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) sponsored by the [[AFL-CIO]], and by the [[Teamsters]], failed.  Ganz defines strategy as \"how we turn what we have into what we need to get what we want.\"<ref>Ganz, ''Why David Sometimes Wins'', p. 8.</ref> Strategic capacity, for Ganz, consists of three elements: motivation, access to relevant knowledge, and deliberations that lead to new learning.  Chavez's efforts eventually prevailed because his organizing team had stronger motivation, deeper knowledge of the Mexican-American culture of the Central Valley, and diverse perspectives that generated fresh tactical ideas.<ref>Ganz, ''Why David Sometimes Wins'', pp. 117-118.</ref>\n\nAt the peak of its success in 1977, the UFWA stopped its aggressive organizing and turned inward. Chavez worked with Chuck Detrick, founder of the [[Synanon]] drug treatment cult, to transform the internal life of the union.  As Chavez purged the union of its long-term leaders and loyalty to Chavez became the primary criterion for employment, the UFWA lost its strategic capacity.  Over the next three years, members of the Executive Board opposed to the direction Chavez was taking the union resigned, including Ganz in 1981.<ref>Frank Bardacke, ''Trampling Out the Vintage: Cesar Chavez and the Two Souls of the United Farm Workers'' (Verso, 2011), pp. 550-721.</ref>  Union membership has dropped from a peak of 60,000 in the late 1970s to around 5,000 in 2009.<ref>Eric Brazil, \u201cChavez made UFW \u2013 and unmade it,\u201d ''San Francisco Chronicle'' and ''SFgate.com'',  July 19, 2009, p. E5.[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/19/IN1B18NVA6.DTL]</ref>\n\n==Political consultant==\n\nAfter leaving the UFWA in 1981, Ganz began working on California political campaigns\u2014directing field programs, training organizers, and leading strategic planning for such candidates as [[Nancy Pelosi]] for Congress, [[Alan Cranston]] for Senate, [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] for governor, and governor [[Jerry Brown]].  He also worked on campaigns of such unions as the [[Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union]] (HERE), [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), and the [[Screen Actors Guild]].  In 1987 he formed and served as executive director of two groups to develop organizing programs, Services for Organizing and Leadership, and The Organizing Institute.  He led voter registration, get-out-the-vote, and organizer training. He also conducted research on voting, leadership development, and community organizing.\n\n==Return to Harvard==\n\nGanz returned to Harvard in 1991 (after a 28-year absence) to finish his undergraduate degree in history and government, graduating in 1992.   He received a [[Master in Public Administration]] from the Kennedy School of Government in 1993 and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[sociology]] in 2000.<ref>Wolfgang, \u201cMarshall Ganz Seminar \u2013 Summary,\u201d Progressive Strategy Studies Project, 1 May 2006.\u201d[http://progressive-strategy2.blogspot.com/2006/05/marshall-ganz-seminar-summary.html]</ref>  He became an instructor for the Kennedy School in 1994. Since completing his doctorate in 2000, he has been a lecturer in public policy, teaching courses on organizing, leadership, civic engagement, and community action research.  He has collaborated with Harvard professors [[Theda Skocpol]] on African-American fraternal organizations, and with [[Lani Guinier]] for a course on law and social movements.\n\nMarshall Ganz teaches 4 courses at Harvard Kennedy School of Government:\n\n# [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/degrees/teaching-courses/course-listing/mld-355m Public Narrative: Self, Us, Now]. Public narrative is how we turn values into action\u2014the discursive process by which individuals, communities, and nations construct identity, formulate choices, and motivate action. Public narrative is a leadership art composed of three elements: a story of self, a story of us, and a story of now. Stories not only teach us how to act \u2013 they inspire us to act. Stories communicate our values through the language of the heart, our emotions. By telling our personal stories of challenges we have faced, choices we have made, and what we learned from the outcomes we can inspire others and share our own wisdom. Because stories allow us to express our values not as abstract principles, but as lived experience, they have the power to move others.<ref>WORKSHEET, TELLING YOUR PUBLIC STORY: Self, Us, Now by Marshall Ganz, Marshall Ganz, Kennedy School of Government, 2007</ref>\n# [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/degrees/teaching-courses/course-listing/mld-356m Public Narrative: Conflict, Continuity, Change]. This module builds on its prerequisite \u201cPublic Narrative: Self, Us, Now.\u201d Confronted with the same challenge, different leaders may respond with different narratives, calling on different \u201cus\u2019s,\u201d and each of which may elicit a different form of action. \n# [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/degrees/teaching-courses/course-listing/mld-377 Organizing: People, Power, Change]. In this course, students learn how to view social, economic, and political problems from an organizing perspective as well as how to act on them. Ganz focuses on teaching five key practices: how to turn values into motivated action; how to build relationships; how to structure leadership as a collaborative team; how to strategize; and how to translate commitments into action. This framework is equally useful for community, electoral, union, and social movement organizing.\n# [http://ksgexecprogram.harvard.edu/Programs/loa/overview.aspx Leadership, Organizing and Action: Leading Change]. Leadership, Organizing and Action: Leading Change is an Executive Education online program designed to reach leaders of civic, social, and political organizations from around the world who wish to learn how to organize communities that can mobilize power to make change. The program represents a unique online learning opportunity for nonprofit and non-governmental organization managers to interact with colleagues from around the world and Professor Ganz.\n\nIn addition to his teaching load, Ganz continues to be active in local politics. On June 11, 2014, Ganz endorsed [[Don Berwick]] for [[Governor of Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/holyoke_mayor_alex_morse_throw.html|title=Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse throws support behind Martha Coakley for governor of Massachusetts|author=Robert Rizzuto|work=MassLive Politics|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Organizing model==\n\nIn contrast to the structural emphasis of the once-dominant [[resource mobilization]] and [[political process]] schools of social movement analysis, Ganz emphasizes the subjective agency of social movement participants, whose values, intentions, and narratives constitute the essential material of analysis.  Ganz begins with the famous three questions of [[Hillel the Elder]], \"If I am not for myself, who will be?  And if I am for myself alone, what am \"I\"?  And if not now, when?\"  Ganz relates these questions to \"the story of self,\" \"the story of us,\" and \"the story of now.\"\n\nFor the 2008 Presidential campaign of Barack Obama, Ganz maintained that campaign workers approaching potential voters needed to be able to quickly tell their story of self to establish a relationship with the voter.  The story of us connected the values and interests of the campaign worker and voter with candidate Obama. What [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] called  \"the fierce urgency of now\" focused the voter's hopes on the imminent election. The importance of relationships, rather than campaign platforms, dominated the Camp Obama training program for campaign workers. Ganz has continued to develop this model in \"Camp OFA\" for [[Organizing for America]], the successor organization to the Obama campaign, and for \"Camp MoveOn,\" a training program for leaders of [[MoveOn.org]]'s local councils.\n\nThe Camp Obama model was based on the model first developed and used in a project for the [[Sierra Club]]. Ganz teamed up with Harvard psychology professor Ruth Wageman in an effort to improve the volunteer programs of local chapters.<ref>Sarah Lei Stirland, \u201cObama\u2019s Secret Weapons: Internet, Databases and Psychology,\u201d ''Wired'', October 29, 2008 [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/10/obamas-secret-w/]</ref>\n\n==Selected publications authored==\n\n===Books===\n\n*''What a Mighty Power We Can Be: African American Fraternal Groups and the Struggle for Racial Equality''.

Until the 1906 visit of his niece Bertha, Lucas had not seen any member of his family since becoming an expatriate, yet he  remained in touch with his family and friends in America through correspondence. As he aged, he became more nostalgic about Baltimore, where he ultimately bequeathed his collection.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\">{{cite news |title=Lucas' will The fight over George A.

At his death, he owned 19,000 prints, 300 paintings, and 170 bronze sculptures.   Two months before his death, Lucas bequeathed his art to Henry Walters with the understanding that it would ultimately go to the [[Maryland Institute College of Art|Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts (MICA)]], which had been destroyed in the [[Great Baltimore Fire of 1904]].<ref name=\"research.frick\" /> In 1933, most of the art was transferred to the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] on indefinite loan and now forms part of the permanent collections of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] and the [[Walters Art Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1905-1960_A_Fresh_Start%E2%80%94Rise_of_Mount_Royal_Campus.html |title=1905-1960: A fresh Start-Rise of Mount Royal Campus |publisher=[[Maryland Institute College of Art]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810154517/http://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1905-1960_A_Fresh_Start%E2%80%94Rise_of_Mount_Royal_Campus.html |archivedate=2012-08-10 }}</ref> Thus, an uproar erupted within the Baltimore art community in 1995 when MICA threatened to sell their portion of Lucas' collection for resources to better fit their mission.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\" /> Many scholars, who especially appreciate Lucas' prints because they offer a comprehensive view of nineteenth-century graphic art, had enjoyed the convenience of the entire collection being housed in a single city.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*''The Diary of George A.

He was born in [[Xalapa|Jalapa]] in the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Veracruz]], a region of Mexico that figures prominently in much of his writing.  His most widely acclaimed novels are ''El Bordo'' (\u201cThe Precipice\u201d, 1960) and ''Otilia Rauda'' (1986), the latter filmed as ''La Mujer del Pueblo'' in 2001. Galindo studied at the Mexican National Autonomous University ([[UNAM]]) and in Paris.  He was the founder and first director of the [[University of Veracruz]] Press, where he also founded and edited the journal ''La Palabra y el Hombre'' (\u201cThe Word and the Man\u201d).\n\nHe was Director of the ''[[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]'' ([[National Institute of Fine Arts]]) from 1974 to 1976.\n\n==Prizes, Honours and Translations==\nGalindo was awarded the following prizes and honours: Honorary Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]], Polish award for Cultural Merit, [[Order of the Yugoslav Star|Order of the Star of Yugoslavia]], Mariano Azuela Prize, the Bellas Artes Literature Prize, the [[Xavier Villarrutia Prize]] and the [[Jos\u00e9 Fuentes Mares National Prize for Literature]].

It was their tenth successive season in the top flight of English football and although they finished 14th, lower than on any of the previous nine occasions, they finished high enough to maintain their top flight membership.\n\n==Season summary==\nWith the Premiership's lowest crowds and transfer budget, Wimbledon had begun most of their top division seasons since promotion in 1986 as pre-season relegation favourites, but the \"[[Crazy Gang (football)|Crazy Gang]]\" spirit kept Wimbledon going once again, although their 14th-place finish was their lowest since joining the top flight 10 seasons earlier.\n\n[[Dean Holdsworth]] and [[Efan Ekoku]] were once again a formidable strikerforce, while [[Vinnie Jones]] was as combative as ever and [[Oyvind Leonhardsen]]'s performances attracted attention from several bigger clubs. Manager [[Joe Kinnear]] managed to hold on to all his key assets, as well as adding a few more, over the close season as he grew ever more determined to defy the odds once again. \n\nIt was the last season at Wimbledon for long-serving goalkeeper [[Hans Segers]], who lost his place early in the season to [[Paul Heald]] and was transferred to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] soon afterwards. Within a few months however, Kinnear had decided on [[Neil Sullivan]] as his regular goalkeeper. \n\nThe season saw Wimbledon play in European competition for the first (and the only) time in their history, in the Intertoto Cup. However, as [[Selhurst Park]] was unavailable the club were forced to play the matches at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]'s [[Goldstone Ground]]. The lack of home support affected Wimbledon's performances, and they finished fourth in their group of five after a 4-0 home defeat to [[Turkey|Turkish]] club [[Bursaspor]], a 1-1 draw at [[Slovakia]]n side [[MFK Ko\u0161ice|Ko\u0161ice]], a 0-0 draw with [[Israel]]is [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]] at home and a 3-0 away defeat at [[Belgium|Belgian]] team [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]].\n\n==Kit==\n[[Core (company)|Core]] became Wimbledon's kit manufacturers for the season. [[Birmingham]]-based electronics company [[Elonex]] remained the kit sponsors.<ref>http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Wimbledon/Wimbledon.htm</ref>\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1995\u201396 FA Premier League}}\n{{:1995\u201396 FA Premier League|showteam=WDN}}\n\n;Results summary\n{{Fb_rs|hw=5|hd=6|hl=8|hgf=27|hga=33|aw=5|ad=5|al=9|agf=28|aga=37}}\n{{Fb_rs_footer|s=[http://www.statto.com/football/teams/wimbledon/1995-1996/table Statto]|date=September 2015}}\n\n;Results by round\n{{#invoke:sports rbr table|table|legendpos=b\n|header=Round\n|label1= Ground\n| res1=H/A/A/H/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/A/H/A/H/H/A/A/H/A/H/H/A/H/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/A/H/A\n|label2= Result\n| res2=W/W/L/D/W/L/L/L/L/L/L/L/D/L/D/D/D/L/D/W/W/L/L/W/L/L/D/D/D/L/W/W/D/W/W/L/L/D\n|label3= Position\n| res3=4/2/3/6/3/6/9/11/12/14/15/17/16/17/16/17/17/18/18/16/15/15/15/14/16/16/16/15/15/17/15/15/15/15/14/14/14/14\n<!-- -->\n|text_H=Home|text_A=Away\n|color_W=green2|text_W=Win\n|color_D=yellow2|text_D=Draw\n|color_L=red2|text_L=Loss\n|color_1=1st|color_2=2nd|color_3=3rd|color_18-=red1\n\n|source=[http://www.statto.com/football/teams/wimbledon/1995-1996/results Statto.com]\n|date=September 2015\n}}\n\n==Results==\n''Wimbledon's score comes first''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/wimbledon/1995-1996/results |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923060014/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/wimbledon/1995-1996/results |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Legend===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color: #d0ffe3;\"|<small>Win</small>\n|style=\"background-color: #ffffdd;\"|<small>Draw</small>\n|style=\"background-color: #ffd0e3;\"|<small>Loss</small>\n|}\n\n===FA Premier League===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%;

[[Wimbledon F.C.]] competed in the [[FA Premier League]] (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons). It was their tenth successive season in the top flight of English football and although they finished 14th, lower than on any of the previous nine occasions, they finished high enough to maintain their top flight membership.\n\n==Season summary==\nWith the Premiership's lowest crowds and transfer budget, Wimbledon had begun most of their top division seasons since promotion in 1986 as pre-season relegation favourites, but the \"[[Crazy Gang (football)|Crazy Gang]]\" spirit kept Wimbledon going once again, although their 14th-place finish was their lowest since joining the top flight 10 seasons earlier.\n\n[[Dean Holdsworth]] and [[Efan Ekoku]] were once again a formidable strikerforce, while [[Vinnie Jones]] was as combative as ever and [[Oyvind Leonhardsen]]'s performances attracted attention from several bigger clubs. Manager [[Joe Kinnear]] managed to hold on to all his key assets, as well as adding a few more, over the close season as he grew ever more determined to defy the odds once again. \n\nIt was the last season at Wimbledon for long-serving goalkeeper [[Hans Segers]], who lost his place early in the season to [[Paul Heald]] and was transferred to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] soon afterwards. Within a few months however, Kinnear had decided on [[Neil Sullivan]] as his regular goalkeeper. \n\nThe season saw Wimbledon play in European competition for the first (and the only) time in their history, in the Intertoto Cup. However, as [[Selhurst Park]] was unavailable the club were forced to play the matches at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]'s [[Goldstone Ground]]. The lack of home support affected Wimbledon's performances, and they finished fourth in their group of five after a 4-0 home defeat to [[Turkey|Turkish]] club [[Bursaspor]], a 1-1 draw at [[Slovakia]]n side [[MFK Ko\u0161ice|Ko\u0161ice]], a 0-0 draw with [[Israel]]is [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]] at home and a 3-0 away defeat at [[Belgium|Belgian]] team [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]].\n\n==Kit==\n[[Core (company)|Core]] became Wimbledon's kit manufacturers for the season. [[Birmingham]]-based electronics company [[Elonex]] remained the kit sponsors.<ref>http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Wimbledon/Wimbledon.htm</ref>\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1995\u201396 FA Premier League}}\n{{:1995\u201396 FA Premier League|showteam=WDN}}\n\n;Results summary\n{{Fb_rs|hw=5|hd=6|hl=8|hgf=27|hga=33|aw=5|ad=5|al=9|agf=28|aga=37}}\n{{Fb_rs_footer|s=[http://www.statto.com/football/teams/wimbledon/1995-1996/table Statto]|date=September 2015}}\n\n;Results by round\n{{#invoke:sports rbr table|table|legendpos=b\n|header=Round\n|label1= Ground\n| res1=H/A/A/H/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/A/H/A/H/H/A/A/H/A/H/H/A/H/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/A/H/A\n|label2= Result\n| res2=W/W/L/D/W/L/L/L/L/L/L/L/D/L/D/D/D/L/D/W/W/L/L/W/L/L/D/D/D/L/W/W/D/W/W/L/L/D\n|label3= Position\n| res3=4/2/3/6/3/6/9/11/12/14/15/17/16/17/16/17/17/18/18/16/15/15/15/14/16/16/16/15/15/17/15/15/15/15/14/14/14/14\n<!-- -->\n|text_H=Home|text_A=Away\n|color_W=green2|text_W=Win\n|color_D=yellow2|text_D=Draw\n|color_L=red2|text_L=Loss\n|color_1=1st|color_2=2nd|color_3=3rd|color_18-=red1\n\n|source=[http://www.statto.com/football/teams/wimbledon/1995-1996/results Statto.com]\n|date=September 2015\n}}\n\n==Results==\n''Wimbledon's score comes first''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/wimbledon/1995-1996/results |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923060014/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/wimbledon/1995-1996/results |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Legend===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color: #d0ffe3;\"|<small>Win</small>\n|style=\"background-color: #ffffdd;\"|<small>Draw</small>\n|style=\"background-color: #ffd0e3;\"|<small>Loss</small>\n|}\n\n===FA Premier League===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%;

Some companies such as Airbus are currently researching this possibility. The adding of EMALS would allow the civilian aircraft to use considerably less fuel (as a lot of fuel is used during take off, in comparison to cruising, when calculated per km flown). The idea is to have the aircraft take off at regular aircraft speed, and only use the catapult for take-off, not for landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.treehugger.com/aviation/civilian-airplanes-could-one-day-take-off-electric-catapults.html|title=Civilian Airplanes Could Someday Take-Off With Electric Catapults!|website=TreeHugger|accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2014/03/06/catapulting-ahead|title=Catapulting ahead|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=1 June 2019|journal=The Economist}}</ref>\n\nOther opportunities arise from the optimization of airline timetables, route networks and flight frequencies to increase load factors (minimize the number of empty seats flown),<ref>International Civil Aviation ''Organization Operational Opportunities to Minimize Fuel Use and Reduce Emissions'' (2001)</ref>  together with the optimization of airspace. However, these are each one-time gains, and as these opportunities are successively fulfilled, diminishing returns can be expected from the remaining opportunities.\n\nAnother possible reduction of the climate-change impact is the limitation of cruise altitude of aircraft. This would lead to a significant reduction in high-altitude contrails for a marginal trade-off of increased flight time and an estimated 4 percent increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Drawbacks of this solution include very limited airspace capacity to do this, especially in Europe and North America and increased fuel burn because jet aircraft are less efficient at lower cruise altitudes.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.geomatics.cv.imperial.ac.uk/html/ResearchActivities/..%5C..%5Cdocuments%5Cpublications%5Cyear2002%5Cwp25_williams_etal.pdf | last1 = Williams | first2 = Victoria | last2 = Robert B.

Globally, such programs included about 163 million people as reported in 2006.<ref name=economist>The Economist (2005, 20-Dec), ''[http://www.economist.com/node/5323615 Frequent-flyer miles \u2014 Funny money]''.</ref>  These programs benefit airlines by habituating people to air travel and, through the mechanics of partnerships with credit card companies and other businesses, in which high profit margin revenue streams can amount to selling free seats for a high price.<ref name=\"economist\"/> The only part of [[United Airlines]] business that was making money when the company filed for bankruptcy in 2002 was its frequent flyer program.<ref name=\"economist\"/>\n\nConcerning business travel, \"The ease of international air travel and the fact that, for most of us, the costs are met by our employers, means that ... globe trotting conference travel is often regarded as a perk of the job.\"<ref name=\"Reay-2004\"/> However, the perk usually is not only the business trip itself, but also the frequent flyer points which the individual accrues by taking the trip, and which can be redeemed later for personal air travel. Thus a [[conflict of interest]] is established, whereby bottom-up pressure may be created within a firm or government agency for travel that is really not necessary. Even when such conflict is not a motivation, the perk of frequent flyer miles can be expected to lead in many cases to personal trips that would not be taken if a ticket had to be paid for with personal funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.fr/scp/sun/facility/reduce/PDFs/EmissionReductionGuide.pdf|title=UNEP DTIE (Sustainable Consumption & Production Branch)(undated).

Instead, governments agreed to work through the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) to limit or reduce emissions and to find a solution to the allocation of emissions from international aviation in time for the second period of the Kyoto Protocol starting from 2009; however, the Copenhagen climate conference failed to reach an agreement.<ref>GreenAirOnline (2009, 22-Dec).

The scheme does not take effect until 2021 and will be voluntary until 2027, but many countries, including the US and China, have promised to begin at its 2020 inception date.

Some companies such as Airbus are currently researching this possibility. The adding of EMALS would allow the civilian aircraft to use considerably less fuel (as a lot of fuel is used during take off, in comparison to cruising, when calculated per km flown). The idea is to have the aircraft take off at regular aircraft speed, and only use the catapult for take-off, not for landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.treehugger.com/aviation/civilian-airplanes-could-one-day-take-off-electric-catapults.html|title=Civilian Airplanes Could Someday Take-Off With Electric Catapults!|website=TreeHugger|accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2014/03/06/catapulting-ahead|title=Catapulting ahead|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=1 June 2019|journal=The Economist}}</ref>\n\nOther opportunities arise from the optimization of airline timetables, route networks and flight frequencies to increase load factors (minimize the number of empty seats flown),<ref>International Civil Aviation ''Organization Operational Opportunities to Minimize Fuel Use and Reduce Emissions'' (2001)</ref>  together with the optimization of airspace. However, these are each one-time gains, and as these opportunities are successively fulfilled, diminishing returns can be expected from the remaining opportunities.\n\nAnother possible reduction of the climate-change impact is the limitation of cruise altitude of aircraft. This would lead to a significant reduction in high-altitude contrails for a marginal trade-off of increased flight time and an estimated 4 percent increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Drawbacks of this solution include very limited airspace capacity to do this, especially in Europe and North America and increased fuel burn because jet aircraft are less efficient at lower cruise altitudes.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.geomatics.cv.imperial.ac.uk/html/ResearchActivities/..%5C..%5Cdocuments%5Cpublications%5Cyear2002%5Cwp25_williams_etal.pdf | last1 = Williams | first2 = Victoria | last2 = Robert B.

With this, Urga became the highest civil authority in the country. Based on Urga's Mongol governor Sanzaidorj's petition, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] officially recognized an annual ceremony on Bogd Khan Mountain in 1778 and provided the annual imperial donations.

The forests of the mountains surrounding Ulaanbaatar are composed of evergreen pines, [[deciduous]] larches and [[birch]]es, while the riverine forest of the Tuul River is composed of broad-leaved, deciduous [[Populus|poplar]]s, [[elm]]s and [[willow]]s. As a point of reference, Ulaanbaatar lies on roughly the same latitude as [[Vienna]], [[Munich]], [[Orl\u00e9ans]], and [[Seattle]]. It lies on roughly the same longitude as [[Chongqing]], [[Hanoi]] and [[Jakarta]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Climate ===\nOwing to its high elevation, its relatively high latitude, its location hundreds of kilometres from any coast, and the effects of the [[Siberian anticyclone]], Ulaanbaatar is the coldest national capital in the world,<ref name=\"Montsame News Agency 2006, pg. 35\">Montsame News Agency.

The city council appoints the mayor. When his predecessor became prime minister in January 2006, former city manager Gombosuren Monkhbayar was elected mayor. Ulaanbaatar is governed as an independent first-level region, separate from the surrounding [[T\u00f6v Province|T\u00f6v Aimag]].\n\nThe city consists of a central district built in Soviet 1940s- and 1950s-style architecture, surrounded by and mingled with residential concrete towerblocks and large ger districts.

The problem is compounded by Ulaanbaatar's location in a valley between relatively high mountains, which shield the city from the winter winds and thus obstruct air circulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hasenkopf|first=Christa|title=Clearing the Air|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Spring 2012|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/clearing-air|accessdate=31 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506213627/http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/clearing-air|archive-date=6 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author= The World Bank|title=Mongolia: Air Pollution in Ulaanbaatar \u2013 Initial Assessment of Current Situation and Effects of Abatement Measures.|series=Sustainable Development Series: Discussion Paper|date=December 2009| publisher=The World Bank|place=Washington, D.C.|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMONGOLIA/Resources/Air_pollution_final_report.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2015}}{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Asia#Mongolia|l1=List of twin towns and sister cities in Mongolia}}\nUlaanbaatar is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|TUR}} [[Ankara]], Turkey (2003)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sister Cities of Ankara|url=https://www.ankara.bel.tr/en/foreign-relations-department/sister-cities-of-ankara|website=ankara.bel.tr|publisher=Ankara|accessdate=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|THA}} [[Bangkok]], Thailand\n*{{flagicon|LKA}} [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], United States<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Sister Cities|url=https://www.denversistercities.org/our-sister-cities/|website=denversistercities.org|publisher=Denver Sister Cities|accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|VIE}} [[Hanoi]], Vietnam\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Hohhot]], China\n*{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Incheon]], South Korea (2017)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sister Cities & Affiliated Cities|url=https://www.incheon.go.kr/en/EN020101|website=incheon.go.kr|publisher=Incheon Metropolitan Government|accessdate=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Irkutsk]], Russia<ref>{{cite web |title=\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f|url=http://admirk.ru/Pages/internationalrelationships.aspx|website=admirk.ru|publisher=Irkutsk|language=ru|accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Krasnoyarsk]], Russia<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u044b|url=http://www.krskstate.ru/ved/soglash/city_pobratimy|website=krskstate.ru|publisher=Krasnoyarsk Krai|language=ru|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Moscow]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Novosibirsk]], Russia<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u044b \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430|url=https://novo-sibirsk.ru/about/twin-cities/|website=novo-sibirsk.ru|publisher=Novosibirsk|language=ru|accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Seoul]], South Korea (1995)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sister and Friendship Cities|url=http://english.seoul.go.kr/policy-information/international-exchange/sister-cities/|website=seoul.go.kr|publisher=Seoul|accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|TWN}} [[Taipei]], Taiwan (1997)<ref>{{cite web |title=International Sister Cities|url=http://www.tcc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=81569D74DD82C7DB|website=tcc.gov.tw|publisher=Taipei City Council|accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Ulan-Ude]], Russia<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u044b|url=https://ulan-ude-eg.ru/gorod/goroda-pobratimy/|website=ulan-ude-eg.ru|publisher=Ulan-Ude|language=ru|accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Proximity to nearby urban centers abroad===\nUlaanbaatar has close ties to cities like [[Seoul]] ({{convert|1,995|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from UB), [[Hong Kong]] ({{convert|2,900|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from UB), [[Tokyo]] ({{convert|3,010|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from UB) and [[Moscow]] ({{convert|4,650|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from UB).

During the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Asian tsunami]] crisis, the 50th sent several crews and tons of food rations to Thailand to help those in need. Following the horrors of [[Hurricane Katrina]], 50th aircrews helped relocate survivors from the [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] areas to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].  Humanitarian missions were flown in and out of Haiti following a major earthquake in December 2010.\n\nIn 2012, elements of the 50th celebrated 70 years of history with members deployed to the [[774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron]] in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123306896 |last1=McCowan|first1=TSG Shawn|title=Historic flying units celebrate anniversary, continue making history|date=21 June 2012|publisher=455th Air Expeditionary Wing Public Affairs|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130801225816/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123306896 |archivedate=1 August 2013|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe squadron was inactivated on 1 April 2016 as part of the [[19th Airlift Wing]]s transition to the [[Lockheed C-130J Super Hercules]].\n\n===Air refueling mission===\nA ceremony marking the reactivation of the squadron was held at [[MacDill Air Force Base]], Florida on 2 October 2017.

The squadron also hauled food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, ordnance equipment, and other supplies to the front lines and evacuated patients to rear zone hospitals.  It dropped paratroops near [[Nijmegen]] and towed gliders carrying reinforcements during the [[Operation Market Garden]], the airborne attack on the Netherlands. In December, it participated in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] by releasing gliders with supplies for the [[101st Airborne Division]] near [[Bastogne]].\n\nMoved to Belgium in early 1945, and  participated in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, participating in the air assault across the [[Rhine River]] in March 1945, each aircraft towed two gliders with troops of the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]] and released them near [[Wesel]].\n\nAfter V-E Day, became part of the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]], and was part of the USAFE European Air Transport System (EATS), supporting the occupation forces in Germany as well as carrying supplies and personnel between various stations in Western Europe.

The squadron has been involved in major engagements around the world to include the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]], [[Persian Gulf War]], and the current [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].\n\nThe 50th is also known for [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian relief]]. During the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Asian tsunami]] crisis, the 50th sent several crews and tons of food rations to Thailand to help those in need. Following the horrors of [[Hurricane Katrina]], 50th aircrews helped relocate survivors from the [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] areas to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].  Humanitarian missions were flown in and out of Haiti following a major earthquake in December 2010.\n\nIn 2012, elements of the 50th celebrated 70 years of history with members deployed to the [[774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron]] in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123306896 |last1=McCowan|first1=TSG Shawn|title=Historic flying units celebrate anniversary, continue making history|date=21 June 2012|publisher=455th Air Expeditionary Wing Public Affairs|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130801225816/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123306896 |archivedate=1 August 2013|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe squadron was inactivated on 1 April 2016 as part of the [[19th Airlift Wing]]s transition to the [[Lockheed C-130J Super Hercules]].\n\n===Air refueling mission===\nA ceremony marking the reactivation of the squadron was held at [[MacDill Air Force Base]], Florida on 2 October 2017.

T. Rama Rao) is a deadly and daredevil gangster. A special Interpol officer David (Prabhakar Reddy) is assigned to work with SP Jagannath (Jaggayya). In spite of being on Interpol's most wanted list, Yugandhar remains elusive to the police. He kills one of his gang members Ramesh (Prasad Babu) when he finds out that he is an informer of the police. His fianc\u00e9e Kamini (Jayamalini) tries to avenge his death, but Yugandhar kills her also. Thereafter, Ramesh's sister Jaya (Jayasudha) takes judo and karate lessons in order to take revenge and she enters Yugandhar's gang. Once Police get an opportunity to nab Yugandhar, the police finally succeed. Unfortunately, Yugandhar dies, which Jagannath only knows and he secretly buries Yugandhar's body, ensuring that people believe he may still be alive; Jagannath while returning after the funeral of Yugandhar, to his fortune he encounters with Vijay (again N. T, Rama Rao), who resembles Yughandhar. Jagannath hatches a plan to replace Yughandhar with Vijay so he can arrest the rest of the gang. Vijay is a street dancer who adopts two orphan kids and looks after them affectionately. Jagannath requests Vijay to go in place of Yugandhar after assuring him that he will take care of the kids. Vijay agrees. In fact, the kids' father Ram Singh (Satyanarayana) is in jail. Ram Singh used to work in a circus company. He has an extraordinary talent for opening any type of locker. Once Shankar (Tyagaraju) one of the gang members offers Ram Singh to open a bank safe. In the beginning, Ram Singh refuses, but he is compelled to do so when his wife is in serious condition. Unfortunately, he was caught by Jagannath, in that attack Ram Singh loses a limb and his wife dies in hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Jagannath succeeds in sending Vijay into the gang as a person who has lost his memory. Ram Singh, just released from jail, begins his mission against Jagannath and his search for his children. Eventually, as Vijay, learns more and more about Yugandhar and announces to his colleagues that he got back his memory. Vijay manages to replace the red diary which contains entire details of the gang and plans to give it to Jagannath. Jaya goes after him, but Vijay survives the attack and explains that he is Vijay. Jaya apologizes to Vijay and they fall in love. Vijay informs Jaganadham about a celebration where all big smugglers and gangsters of the country are attending. When Jagannath is about to start, Ram Singh obstructs his way, but could not do so as he comes to know that his children are with Jagannath. Jaganadham tells him that he will inform regarding them in his return. But things take a drastic turn when the police raid the celebrations, Vijay's only witness to his true identity, Jagannath, is shot dead, and Vijay is arrested because the police think that he is Yugandhar. The diary that Vijay had handed over to Jagannath, which is his last hope, is stolen by Ram Singh. However, he escapes from the police and he begins to fight for himself and tries to prove his innocence. Jaya agrees to help him. Meanwhile, the gang kidnaps Ram Singh's children to take Vijay into their hold. Ram Singh blackmails the gang as he is possessing the dairy. In that process, he comes to know that Interpol officer David is the original gang leader who also murdered Jagannath. Ram Singh goes to negotiations with David when the police come there and Ram Singh was kept in a room where his children are present, Ram Singh takes children and runs away. At the same time, Vijay arrives, both of them mistake each other as the enemy of the children and a quarrel arose between them. After knowing the truth from the children, both of them join hands, along with Jaya, catch the entire gang and Vijay proves that he is not Yughandhar. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[N.T.

Vijay agrees. In fact, the kids' father Ram Singh (Satyanarayana) is in jail. Ram Singh used to work in a circus company. He has an extraordinary talent for opening any type of locker. Once Shankar (Tyagaraju) one of the gang members offers Ram Singh to open a bank safe. In the beginning, Ram Singh refuses, but he is compelled to do so when his wife is in serious condition. Unfortunately, he was caught by Jagannath, in that attack Ram Singh loses a limb and his wife dies in hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Jagannath succeeds in sending Vijay into the gang as a person who has lost his memory. Ram Singh, just released from jail, begins his mission against Jagannath and his search for his children. Eventually, as Vijay, learns more and more about Yugandhar and announces to his colleagues that he got back his memory. Vijay manages to replace the red diary which contains entire details of the gang and plans to give it to Jagannath. Jaya goes after him, but Vijay survives the attack and explains that he is Vijay. Jaya apologizes to Vijay and they fall in love. Vijay informs Jaganadham about a celebration where all big smugglers and gangsters of the country are attending. When Jagannath is about to start, Ram Singh obstructs his way, but could not do so as he comes to know that his children are with Jagannath. Jaganadham tells him that he will inform regarding them in his return. But things take a drastic turn when the police raid the celebrations, Vijay's only witness to his true identity, Jagannath, is shot dead, and Vijay is arrested because the police think that he is Yugandhar. The diary that Vijay had handed over to Jagannath, which is his last hope, is stolen by Ram Singh. However, he escapes from the police and he begins to fight for himself and tries to prove his innocence. Jaya agrees to help him. Meanwhile, the gang kidnaps Ram Singh's children to take Vijay into their hold. Ram Singh blackmails the gang as he is possessing the dairy. In that process, he comes to know that Interpol officer David is the original gang leader who also murdered Jagannath. Ram Singh goes to negotiations with David when the police come there and Ram Singh was kept in a room where his children are present, Ram Singh takes children and runs away. At the same time, Vijay arrives, both of them mistake each other as the enemy of the children and a quarrel arose between them.
