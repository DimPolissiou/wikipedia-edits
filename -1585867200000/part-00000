Murdoch is loosely based on [[Tony Tenser]], head of Tigon films. A more obscure figure the film ridicules is Louis \"Deke\" M. Heyward, the [[London]] representative of AIP ([[American International Pictures]]), who had previously clashed with the film's writer Michael Armstrong in 1969 during the making of Armstrong's directing debut, ''The Haunted House of Horror''. In ''Eskimo Nell'' Heyward is parodied as \"Big Dick\", a crass, foul-mouthed American producer from \"A.W.P Films\", and the backer of the hardcore porno version.

Though the film's plot and characters remained largely the same, the setting was updated from 1950s [[Israel]] to then-present day suburban [[Los Angeles]]. The soundtrack, a major facet of both films, was also updated from the original's golden oldies to more contemporary [[New wave music|new wave rock]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot closely follows the original Israeli film ''Eskimo Limon'' (''Lemon Popsicle''), and revolves around protagonist Gary, a typical [[high school]] student in early 1980s Los Angeles, and his friends Rick, the slick ladies' man, and David.\n\nMost of the plot involves their numerous attempts to have sex, which are usually successful for Rick and David, but rarely for Gary. Early in the film, the three boys pick up three girls with the promise of [[cocaine]] (instead they use [[Sweet'n Low]]). They go over to Gary's house where he gets stuck with the homely and overweight Millie, a friend of the other two more attractive girls. But their party is interrupted when Gary's parents return home and pandemonium ensues.\n\nA [[love triangle]] develops between Gary, Rick and Karen, a beautiful transfer student to their school who is a virgin that Rick is determined to have sex with.\n\nOne day Gary delivers pizza to Carmela, a woman whose sailor boyfriend is never home, and she tells him she wants more than just pizza. Being too afraid to follow up on it, he goes away and convinces his friends to go along with him. They drop by her home using the pretext they were nearby on a pizza delivery and decided to bring her over some extra pizzas. She lets them in, puts on music and performs a sexy dance routine, to the delight of the boys. She promptly [[fornication|fornicates]] with Rick and David, but her boyfriend Paco returns home just as Gary is about to have his turn, prompting them to flee.\n\nEventually, Rick gets Karen pregnant after they have sex only once, and he leaves her. Gary decides to help Karen pay for her [[abortion]] by selling most of his possessions and borrowing money from his boss. After the abortion, Gary and Karen spend the remainder of the weekend alone together in Gary's grandmother's house. While nursing her back to health, Gary tells Karen that he sincerely loves her. Karen appears to reciprocate and they both share a tender kiss. Karen invites Gary to her 18th birthday party the following week. Gary scrapes up a few more dollars and buys Karen a gold locket for her birthday.\n\nWhen Gary arrives at the party, his dreams of a lasting romance with Karen are shattered when he sees Karen [[making out]] with Rick. Despite what Rick had put Karen through, she apparently decided to take him back. Gary angrily leaves the party without saying a word to either of them, taking Karen's gift with him. Tears streaming down his face, Gary drives home alone, emotionally broken and defeated.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lawrence Monoson]] as Gary\n* [[Diane Franklin]] as Karen\n* [[Steve Antin]] as Rick\n* [[Joe Rubbo]] as David\n* [[Louisa Moritz]] as Carmela\n* Brian Peck as Victor\n* [[Kimmy Robertson]] as Rose\n* Tessa Richarde as Brenda\n* [[Winifred Freedman]] as Millie\n* Gerri Idol as Roxanne\n* Phil Rubenstein as Gino\n* Roberto Rodriquez as Paco\n* [[Harry Bugin]] as Doctor\n}}\n\n==Home media==\n\n===VHS, CED Videodisc===\nThe film was released on VHS and [[CED Videodisc]] by [[Cannon Films]], November 30, 1983.\n\n===LaserDisc===\nThe film was released by Guild Home Video on LaserDisc with a digital stereo soundtrack in 1984.\n\n===DVD===\nThe Region 1 [[DVD]] was first released in 2002 by [[Cannon Films]].

It is also known by the [[alternative title]] '''''Adam and Nicole'''''.\n\nThe making of the film was documented by the [[Man Alive (BBC)]] programme, in an episode about the British sex and horror film industry of the mid-seventies, titled \u2018Man Alive: Xploitation\u2019. The programme shows producer Bachoo Sen and director Trevor Wrenn trying to cast the role of \u2018an English rose who can ride a horse\u2019 (this is presumably the role played by Heather Deeley in the film).  A screening of the dailies in the programme shows the film to have been shot in the \u2018Italian style\u2019 of having the director talk to the performers whilst they act, meaning the film would have to be later re-dubbed.  The programme also reveals the film's writer \u2018Jon York\u2019, was actually a student at York University, and is seen writing the script in the University's library. The film is referred to by its shooting titles ''The Will'' and ''The Willing Sex'' during the programme.  Shooting started on 8 February 1975, and the film was released on 8 May 1975.  The house used in the film was at the time owned by a famous racing driver.\n\n''Erotic Inferno'' is also notable for being one of the few British sex films to have been viewed by moral reformer [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Lord Longford]], who saw the film and two others in 1975 in order to gain first hand experience of sex films, so that he could then morally condemn them.  Longford saw the film on a double bill with ''Hot Acts of Love'' at the Astral Cinema complex in Soho, he later went to see ''How to Seduce A Virgin'', directed by [[Jess Franco]], but walked out.  These three films were all later reviewed in Cinema X magazine under the banner \"Lord Longford- We rate his selection\".\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Old Man Barnard (Anthony Kenyon), a millionaire, is reported drowned at sea his gold digging sons Paul (Karl Lanchbury) and Martin (Chris Chittell) come looking for their inheritance. Arriving at the Barnard family estate they renew an old enemy in Adam (Michael Watkins), their father's butler. He tells them the Barnard mansion has to remain locked and bolted until the will is read, begrudgingly all three men and their girlfriends will have to stay in the neighbouring farmhouse over the weekend. Unbeknown to him Adam is Old Man Barnard's illegitimate son, a fact Paul and Martin are determined to keep from him. Secretly they fear the whole inheritance will go to Adam. With their privileged lifestyles hanging by a thread the Brothers Barnard decide to pursue Adam's finance Nicole (Jenny Westbrook).  Reasoning that she will know where Adam has hidden the keys to the mansion, so that they can break in and destroy evidence of Adam's parentage.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chris Chittell]] as Martin Barnard \n*[[Jennifer Westbrook|Jenny Westbrook]] as Nicole\n*Michael Watkins as Adam \n*Karl Lanchbury as Paul Barnard \n*Jeannie Collings as Brenda \n*Heather Deeley as Gayle \n*[[Mary Millington]] as Jane\n*[[Michael Sheard]] as Eric Gold \n*Anthony Kenyon as Old Mr. Barnard\n\n==Alternate versions==\nThree different edits of the film are known to exist; a version with the onscreen title '''Erotic Inferno''', issued on UK video by Hokushin in 1980  (approx 86 mins), '''Adam and Nicole''' (approx 78 mins), released on UK video in the late 1980s, and a version (approx 83 minutes), released on video in America, copyrighted 1981.\n\nThe UK Hokushin video release is the original uncut (pre-BBFC approved) version.\n\n* The title sequence in the Adam and Nicole version runs several seconds longer due to an onscreen title, which plays over the scene with Adam and the Monika Ringwald character.  This title is cut out of US version.\n* Approx 11 minutes: the sex scene between Martin and Brenda is significantly longer in the Adam and Nicole version, although the shorter US version includes a line of dialogue (\"Martin, you\u2019re hurting me, No\") missing from Adam and Nicole.\n* Approx 17 minutes: the sex scene between the two stablegirls in the Erotic Inferno version is missing shots of Jane (Mary Millington) removing her jeans (included in Adam and Nicole).  The closing shot of Gayle (Heather Deeley) in this sequence is different in both versions: the US version closes with a close-up of her topless, Adam and Nicole has a long shot of her with full frontal nudity.\n* Approx 32 minutes: dialogue scene between Adam and Nicole- the US version is missing shots of him kissing the key chain that is around Nicole's waist  (included in the Adam and Nicole version), but adds a close-up of the key with the line \"the key to our future happiness\" from Nicole (missing from the Adam and Nicole version).\n* Approx 59 minutes: the sex scene between Nicole and Martin is much longer in the US version, however the Adam and Nicole version contains shots from this scene not found in the US version.\n* Approx 64 minutes: the sex scene between Adam and Gayle is longer in the US version than the Adam and Nicole one.\n* Approx 67 minutes: the scene where Adam attacks Brenda in the bathroom is cut in the Adam and Nicole version, losing shots of him slapping her and trying to drown her in the bath.\n\nIn addition the film was also released on UK video in a short version, titled '''Private Shots presents Erotic Inferno''', running 14 minutes, 49 seconds.  A second US video release called '''Maid in Chains''' (issued by T-Z video) is the same edit as the previous US video, but has further cuts to the sex scene between Brenda and Martin and Adam's assault on Brenda in the bathroom.\n\n==References==\n\n'' Keeping the British End Up: Four Decades of Saucy Cinema'' by Simon Sheridan (fourth edition) (Titan Publishing, London) (2011)\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0186797}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081010165452/http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/cgi-bin/cms/Film/26989 1980 UK video cover]\n\n[[Category:1975 films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s sex comedy films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1975 film directed by Trevor Wrenn}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Erotic Inferno\n| director = Trevor Wrenn\n| producer = Bachoo Sen\n| writer = Jon York\n| starring = [[Chris Chittell]]<br>Jennifer Westbrook<br>Michael Watkins<br>Karl Lanchbury<br>Jeannie Collings<br>Heather Deeley<br/>[[Mary Millington]]\n| released = {{Film date|1975}}\n| country = United Kingdom\n| runtime = 80 minutes\n| language = [[English language|English]]\n}}\n'''''Erotic Inferno''''' is a 1975 British sex film, directed by Trevor Wrenn, and starring [[Chris Chittell]], Karl Lanchbury, Jennifer Westbrook, Heather Deeley and [[Mary Millington]] (under her married name Mary Maxted).

The closing shot of Gayle (Heather Deeley) in this sequence is different in both versions: the US version closes with a close-up of her topless, Adam and Nicole has a long shot of her with full frontal nudity.\n* Approx 32 minutes: dialogue scene between Adam and Nicole- the US version is missing shots of him kissing the key chain that is around Nicole\u2019s waist  (included in the Adam and Nicole version), but adds a close-up of the key with the line \"the key to our future happiness\" from Nicole (missing from the Adam and Nicole version).\n* Approx 59 minutes: the sex scene between Nicole and Martin is much longer in the US version, however the Adam and Nicole version contains shots from this scene not found in the US version.\n* Approx 64 minutes: the sex scene between Adam and Gayle is longer in the US version than the Adam and Nicole one.\n* Approx 67 minutes: the scene where Adam attacks Brenda in the bathroom is cut in the Adam and Nicole version, losing shots of him slapping her and trying to drown her in the bath.\n\nIn addition the film was also released on UK video in a short version, titled '''Private Shots presents Erotic Inferno''', running 14 minutes, 49 seconds.  A second US video release called '''Maid in Chains''' (issued by T-Z video) is the same edit as the previous US video, but has further cuts to the sex scene between Brenda and Martin and Adam\u2019s assault on Brenda in the bathroom.\n\n==References==\n\n'' Keeping the British End Up: Four Decades of Saucy Cinema'' by Simon Sheridan (fourth edition) (Titan Publishing, London) (2011)\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0186797}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081010165452/http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/cgi-bin/cms/Film/26989 1980 UK video cover]\n\n[[Category:1975 films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s sex comedy films]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (6)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_Inferno"}

''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity.

He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\" />\n\nSmith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as \"the never to be forgotten Hutcheson\"\u2014a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.<ref>Scott, W.&nbsp;R. \"The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&nbsp;R.

On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of \"the obvious and simple system of [[Natural and legal rights|natural liberty]]\".

When the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow]] died the next year, Smith took over the position.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 43\" /> He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as \"by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]\".<ref name=\"rae 1895 42\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}</ref>\n\nSmith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined \"mutual sympathy\" as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He based his explanation, not on a special \"moral sense\" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], one of the leaders of the [[Physiocracy|physiocratic]] school of thought|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]]\nFollowing the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}</ref> After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}</ref> For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Law]]s (LL.D.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|title=MyGlasgow \u2013 Archive Services \u2013 Exhibitions \u2013 Adam Smith in Glasgow \u2013 Photo Gallery \u2013 Honorary degree|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref> At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]\u2014who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume\u2014to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch.

Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgment creates an incentive to achieve \"mutual sympathy of sentiments\" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}</ref>\n\nSome scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}</ref> In recent years, however, some scholars<ref>Wight, Jonathan B.

Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation.

This last statement about \"an invisible hand\" has been interpreted in numerous ways.\n\n[[File:19th-century building at location where Adam Smith lived, 1767-1776.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Smith House|Later building on the site]] where Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations''|alt=A brown building]]\n<blockquote>As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.</blockquote>\n\nThose who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.</blockquote>However, in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:<blockquote>How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.</blockquote>[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]\nSmith's statement about the benefits of \"an invisible hand\" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that \"Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits\".<ref>Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.</ref> It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their \"conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.</ref> Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price \"which can be squeezed out of the buyers\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.</ref> Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants \"in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:\n\n<blockquote>It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)</blockquote>\n\nThe neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about \"an invisible hand\" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] \u2013 [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] \"Economics\" refers six times to Smith's \"invisible hand\". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.</ref> quotes Smith's \"invisible hand\" statement substituting \"general interest\" for \"public interest\". Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.</ref> concludes: \"Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.\"\n\n[[File:Smith - Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, 1922 - 5231847.tif|thumb|170px|1922 printing of ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']]\nVery differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote \"The Wealth of Nations\". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated ''The Wealth of Nations'' to him had he not died beforehand.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}</ref><ref>Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.</ref> To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living\u2014\"general plenty\" and \"universal opulence\"\u2014for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures \"The Wealth of Nations\". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the \"Wealth of Nations\" summarise this policy:\n\n<blockquote>The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;\n* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,\n* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith added that the \"abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.\"<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4</ref>\n\n===Other works===\n[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]\n\nShortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).<ref>''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===In economics and moral philosophy===\n''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith \u2013 Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.<ref name=\"100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith\">[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ 100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith] Retrieved 31 January 2012</ref>\n\nIn light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.<ref>L.Seabrooke (2006). \"Global Standards of Market Civilization\". p. 192. Taylor & Francis 2006</ref>\n\n[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith \"the most important substantive proposition in all of economics\". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.<ref>Stigler, George&nbsp;J.

Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}</ref>\n\nClassical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the \"[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]\". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Das Kapital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.<ref name=\"Roemer\">[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). \"Marxian Value Analysis\". ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, 383.</ref><ref>[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). \"Marx, Karl Heinrich\", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' v. 3, pp. 372, 376.</ref> The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.\n\n[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]\n\nThe body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]\" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term \"economics\" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for \"economic science\" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term \"[[political economy]]\" used by Smith.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Jevons, W.

(1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach'', 2nd ed., Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 32.</ref> Neoclassical economics systematised [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.<ref>Campos, Antonietta (1987). \"Marginalist Economics\", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320</ref>\n\nThe bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or \"economic man\" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in \"The Secret History of the Dismal Science\" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The \"Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics\", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=\u00a7Book I, Chapter 2}}</ref> and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.<ref>\"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy\" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&Levy,%20final.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004085614/http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart%26Levy%2C%20final.pdf |date=4 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSmith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:\n\n<blockquote>Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all. (Source: ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)</blockquote>\n\n===In British Imperial debates===\nSmith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. ''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.<ref>E.A. Benians, \u2018Adam Smith\u2019s project of an empire\u2019, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249\u201383</ref>\n\nSmith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire \"on the cheap\" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].<ref>Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846\u20131946'' (Oxford, 1997)</ref> By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.<ref>J. Shield Nicholson, ''A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith'' (London, 1909)</ref> As Marc-William Palen notes: \"On the one hand, Adam Smith\u2019s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire \u2018on the cheap\u2019. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith's theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before.\"<ref>Marc-William Palen, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9159669&fileId=S0018246X13000101 \u201cAdam Smith as Advocate of Empire, c. 1870\u20131932,\u201d] ''Historical Journal'' 57: 1 (March 2014): 179\u201398.</ref> Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.\n\n===Portraits, monuments, and banknotes===\n[[File:Adam Smith statue by Alexander Stoddart.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A statue of Smith in [[Edinburgh]]'s High Street, erected through private donations organised by the Adam Smith Institute]]\n\nSmith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 notes issued by the [[Clydesdale Bank]] in Scotland,<ref name=\"clydesdale\">{{cite web|url=http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |title=Clydesdale 50 Pounds, 1981 |publisher=Ron Wise's Banknoteworld |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030185820/http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |archivedate=30 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"scotbanks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |title=Current Banknotes : Clydesdale Bank |publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003071439/http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |archivedate=3 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of [[Bank of England \u00a320 note|\u00a320 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of England]], making him the first Scotsman to feature on an [[Bank of England note issues|English banknote]].<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |title=Smith replaces Elgar on \u00a320 note |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=BBC |date=29 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324062831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |archivedate=24 March 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:6 Burlington Gardens facade Smith.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of Smith built in 1867\u20131870 at the old headquarters of the [[University of London]], 6 Burlington Gardens]]\n\nA large-scale memorial of Smith by [[Alexander Stoddart]] was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh.

[[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith \"was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.\" In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an \"extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]\".<ref name=\"Brown93\">{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230\u201332 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}</ref> In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:\n\n<blockquote>The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.<ref name=\"Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2\">{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting \"justice\" and \"certain publick institutions\" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).\n\nAdditionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods \"of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual\" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: \"Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state\" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because \"we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk.

Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the \"Smithian\" identity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2008 |title=Toward a Public and Professional Identity for Our Economics |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=358\u201372 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/toward-a-public-and-professional-identity-for-our-economics |access-date=10 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228231445/http://econjwatch.org/articles/toward-a-public-and-professional-identity-for-our-economics |archive-date=28 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2009 |title=Desperately Seeking Smithians: Responses to the Questionnaire about Building an Identity |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=113\u201380 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/desperately-seeking-smithians-responses-to-the-questionnaire-about-building-an-identity |access-date=10 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228232751/http://econjwatch.org/articles/desperately-seeking-smithians-responses-to-the-questionnaire-about-building-an-identity |archive-date=28 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Economist [[David Ricardo]] set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\">Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\"/>\n\nSome have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,<ref>Martin, Christopher. \"Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795\u201396,\" ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110\u201325, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228230820/http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96 |date=28 December 2013 }}</ref> although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:<ref>A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8</ref>\n<blockquote>A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.</blockquote>\n\n===Criticism===\n\n[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The \"invisible hand\" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (\"atomistic\") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the \"invisible hand\" fails. He was also a bad person... and shouldnt have invented Econ!!!!!\n\nNobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: \"the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\"<ref>''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Organizational capital]]\n* [[List of abolitionist forerunners]]\n* [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts]]\n* [[List of people on banknotes#Scotland|People on Scottish banknotes]]\n\n==References==\n===Informational notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Benians, E.A.

''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as [[Horace Walpole]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=John |first1=McMurray |title=Capitalism's 'Founding Father' Often Quoted, Frequently Misconstrued |url=https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/capitalisms-founding-father-often-quoted-frequently-misconstrued/ |website=Investor.com |accessdate=31 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nSmith was born in [[Kirkcaldy]], in the [[Kingdom of Fife]], Scotland.

He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\" />\n\nSmith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as \"the never to be forgotten Hutcheson\"\u2014a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.<ref>Scott, W.&nbsp;R. \"The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&nbsp;R.

This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined \"mutual sympathy\" as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He based his explanation, not on a special \"moral sense\" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], one of the leaders of the [[Physiocracy|physiocratic]] school of thought|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]]\nFollowing the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}</ref> After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}</ref> For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Law]]s (LL.D.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|title=MyGlasgow \u2013 Archive Services \u2013 Exhibitions \u2013 Adam Smith in Glasgow \u2013 Photo Gallery \u2013 Honorary degree|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref> At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]\u2014who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume\u2014to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch.

Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgment creates an incentive to achieve \"mutual sympathy of sentiments\" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}</ref>\n\nSome scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}</ref> In recent years, however, some scholars<ref>Wight, Jonathan B.

They claim that in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the \"impartial spectator\" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation.

This last statement about \"an invisible hand\" has been interpreted in numerous ways.\n\n[[File:19th-century building at location where Adam Smith lived, 1767-1776.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Smith House|Later building on the site]] where Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations''|alt=A brown building]]\n<blockquote>As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.</blockquote>\n\nThose who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.</blockquote>However, in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:<blockquote>How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.</blockquote>[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]\nSmith's statement about the benefits of \"an invisible hand\" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that \"Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits\".<ref>Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.</ref> It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their \"conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.</ref> Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price \"which can be squeezed out of the buyers\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.</ref> Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants \"in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:\n\n<blockquote>It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)</blockquote>\n\nThe neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about \"an invisible hand\" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] \u2013 [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] \"Economics\" refers six times to Smith's \"invisible hand\". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.</ref> quotes Smith's \"invisible hand\" statement substituting \"general interest\" for \"public interest\". Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.</ref> concludes: \"Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.\"\n\n[[File:Smith - Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, 1922 - 5231847.tif|thumb|170px|1922 printing of ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']]\nVery differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote \"The Wealth of Nations\". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated ''The Wealth of Nations'' to him had he not died beforehand.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}</ref><ref>Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.</ref> To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living\u2014\"general plenty\" and \"universal opulence\"\u2014for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures \"The Wealth of Nations\". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the \"Wealth of Nations\" summarise this policy:\n\n<blockquote>The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;\n* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,\n* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith added that the \"abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.\"<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4</ref>\n\n===Other works===\n[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]\n\nShortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).<ref>''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===In economics and moral philosophy===\n''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith \u2013 Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.<ref name=\"100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith\">[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ 100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith] Retrieved 31 January 2012</ref>\n\nIn light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.<ref>L.Seabrooke (2006). \"Global Standards of Market Civilization\". p. 192.

It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.<ref>Stigler, George&nbsp;J.

Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}</ref>\n\nClassical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the \"[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]\". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Das Kapital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.<ref name=\"Roemer\">[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). \"Marxian Value Analysis\".

This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.\n\n[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]\n\nThe body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]\" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term \"economics\" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for \"economic science\" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term \"[[political economy]]\" used by Smith.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Jevons, W.

It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.<ref>Campos, Antonietta (1987). \"Marginalist Economics\", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320</ref>\n\nThe bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or \"economic man\" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in \"The Secret History of the Dismal Science\" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The \"Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics\", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=\u00a7Book I, Chapter 2}}</ref> and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.<ref>\"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy\" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&Levy,%20final.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004085614/http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart%26Levy%2C%20final.pdf |date=4 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSmith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:\n\n<blockquote>Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all. (Source: ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)</blockquote>\n\n===In British Imperial debates===\nSmith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. ''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.<ref>E.A. Benians, \u2018Adam Smith\u2019s project of an empire\u2019, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249\u201383</ref>\n\nSmith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire \"on the cheap\" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].<ref>Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846\u20131946'' (Oxford, 1997)</ref> By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.<ref>J.

[[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith \"was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.\" In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an \"extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]\".<ref name=\"Brown93\">{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230\u201332 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}</ref> In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:\n\n<blockquote>The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.<ref name=\"Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2\">{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting \"justice\" and \"certain publick institutions\" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).\n\nAdditionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods \"of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual\" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: \"Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state\" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because \"we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}</ref> In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:\n\n<blockquote>The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff \"seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ii.39).\n\n[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called \"natural liberty\"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.<ref name=\"Viner 1927\">{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198\u2013232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421}}</ref>\n\nEconomist [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] believes using the term \"free-market economics\" or \"free-market economist\" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading.

Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\">Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\"/>\n\nSome have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,<ref>Martin, Christopher. \"Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795\u201396,\" ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110\u201325, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228230820/http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96 |date=28 December 2013 }}</ref> although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:<ref>A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8</ref>\n<blockquote>A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.</blockquote>\n\n===Criticism===\n\n[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The \"invisible hand\" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (\"atomistic\") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the \"invisible hand\" fails.\n\nNobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: \"the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\"<ref>''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Organizational capital]]\n* [[List of abolitionist forerunners]]\n* [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts]]\n* [[List of people on banknotes#Scotland|People on Scottish banknotes]]\n\n==References==\n===Informational notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Benians, E.A.

Founded by Peter Loughrey in 1992, LAMA especially champions Modern and Contemporary works by [[California]] and West Coast artists and designers. \n\nAuctions are held three times a year in [[Van Nuys|Van Nuys]], California, and feature a wide range of material including [[painting]], [[photography]], [[Printmaking|prints]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramics]], [[furniture]], [[jewelry]], and [[lighting]]. Since LAMA\u2019s first auction on October 10, 1992, the boutique auction house has carved a niche in the international market with milestone auctions dedicated to individual designers [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Paul Laszlo]], and [[R.M. Schindler]], among others.<ref>Connie Koenenn (October 1999), [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/14/news/cl-22003 Thoroughly Modern Milieu], LA Times. Retrieved 01-21-2010.</ref> LAMA has set dozens of world auction records, including many for works by California artists and designers such as [[Peter Alexander (artist)|Peter Alexander]], [[Ruth Asawa]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Chris Burden]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Lorser Feitelson]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Vasa Mihich]], [[Kenneth Price|Ken Price]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[De Wain Valentine]]. \n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n==History==\n===1990s===\n\nIn October 1989, Peter Loughrey opened vintage furniture gallery Bedrock on La Brea Boulevard. Three years later, Loughrey founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA) and hosted the company's first auction on October 10, 1992. The inaugural auction featured 136 lots of Modern design, including works by [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Peter Max]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[Ettore Sottsass]]. \n\nIn 1993, Loughrey closed his gallery and landed in [[London]] to earn a degree in contemporary works of art through the [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]]. As a student, he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark [[Man Ray]] auction at [[Sotheby's]], London.\n\nIn 1995, Loughrey married Shannon Carragher and, together, they re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. The Loughreys conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss]] 'Samitaur' building in Culver City, California, on May 18, 1996. Their following auction was held five months later on October 27, 1996, at the IM Chait Gallery in [[Beverly Hills]].\n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of Modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. The auction house also acquired more than 500 Eames leg splints from an army surplus, which they sold at the gift shops at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles.\n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. It was featured in Wendy Moonan\u2019s [[New York Times]] article on the antiques market, in which she stated, \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> In February of that year, LAMA launched its website, bringing broader visibility to the company. To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was invited by Echoes Magazine to interview [[Pierre Koenig]], the architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]].\n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the Modern art and design markets. \u201cModern Monthly\u201d auctions were held with the average lot selling for less than $500 in a bid to reach young collectors through accessible prices. LAMA was commissioned by [[ARCO]] (Atlantic Ritchfield Corporation) to liquidate the company's corporate fine art collection \u2014 the first major fine art commission for the auction house. The same year, LAMA achieved a world record for any design by Charles Eames when the \u201cConversation\u201d prototype, a 1941 collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]], realized $129,000.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\nAfter achieving the world record for an Eames design in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity was chosen by John & Marilyn Neuhart to auction works from their private collection in July 2000 \u2013 the first ever single-owner auction dedicated to the works of Charles and Ray Eames. On offer were custom designs, sculptures, photographs, drawings, and ephemera by the Eameses curated by the Neuharts, who worked in the Eames Office and authored ''Eames Design: The Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames''. Also included was a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes \u2013 many of which are in permanent collections in public institutions. \n\nAcknowledging LAMA\u2019s swift ascent, Loughrey was included that year in ''Art & Auction'''s Power Issue.\n\nIn 2002, during the Loughreys\u2019 tenure directing [[Butterfield and Butterfield]]'s 20th Century Decorative Arts and Design department,  [[Playboy]] Enterprises selected Loughrey to conduct the first-ever auction of items from the magazine's archives, including fine art, photography, sculpture, drawings, and ephemera. That year, LAMA also organized the first auction dedicated to the collection of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd.\n\nIn 2003, Peter Loughrey joined [[PBS]]\u2019s [[Antiques Roadshow]] as an appraiser and continued to be featured on the program today until his passing in 2020. \n\nLAMA achieved two more world auction records in 2004, when works by [[George Nakashima]] sold for more than $100,000 \u2014 Nakashima remains a consistently featured LAMA artist today. The same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Loughrey to co-curate ''Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration''. Works by Italian designer, architect and artist Ponti continue to be regularly presented at LAMA sales.\n\nLoughrey also worked with ACME to co-curate another show in 2005, ''Dutch Design''. In May of that year, LAMA was the exclusive auctioneer of the entire contents of the [[Paul Laszlo]]-designed Hudspeth Residence. This was the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at auction at one time.\n\nLAMA established a new world record price for ''Marilyn (#28)'' by [[Andy Warhol]] at its June 3, 2007 Modern Art & Design Auction, where the work realized $144,000. Shortly after, [[Judy Chicago]]\u2019s ''Car Hood'' realized $288,000. \n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale, auctioning the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!, and, in October, the Loughreys left their West Hollywood location for LAMA\u2019s current showroom in Van Nuys, California. The space was formerly home to Stan Winston Studio and features a skylight added to accommodate the construction of the tyrannosaurus Rex for the film ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.\n\n===2010 to 2020===\nLAMA celebrated its 25th anniversary with its October 22, 2017 Modern Art & Design Auction; the Top Lot was [[Roy Lichtenstein]]\u2019s ''Reverie'', which sold for $175,000. Other top lots included works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Marchel Duchamp]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nLAMA\u2019s October 3, 2008 Modern Art & Design Auction saw the highest sale total in its history, with $5.17 million in sales achieving 125% over the low estimate. \n\nIn October 2019, LAMA introduced the LAMA app, holding their first online-only auction and welcoming web-based bidding on live auction lots. \n\nOn March 2020, Peter Loughrey passed away at from cancer in Los Angeles. Benedikt Taschen told David Keeps for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that Loughrey \u201cknew more about the fabric of California modernism than anyone.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Keeps |first1=David |title=My 'Antiques Roadshow' moment with auctioneer Peter Loughrey, champion of California modernism |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-03-23/peter-loughrey-antiques-roadshow-expert-los-angeles-modern-auctions |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Auctions==\n\n'''May 18, 1996''': This Modern Art & Design Auction featured works exclusively offered through LAMA from Richard Neutra\u2019s V.D.L.

Three years later, Loughrey founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA) and hosted the company's first auction on October 10, 1992. The inaugural auction featured 136 lots of Modern design, including works by [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Peter Max]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[Ettore Sottsass]]. \n\nIn 1993, Loughrey closed his gallery and landed in [[London]] to earn a degree in contemporary works of art through the [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]]. As a student, he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark [[Man Ray]] auction at [[Sotheby's]], London.\n\nIn 1995, Loughrey married Shannon Carragher and, together, they re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. The Loughreys conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss]] 'Samitaur' building in Culver City, California, on May 18, 1996. Their following auction was held five months later on October 27, 1996, at the IM Chait Gallery in [[Beverly Hills]].\n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of Modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. The auction house also acquired more than 500 Eames leg splints from an army surplus, which they sold at the gift shops at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles.\n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. It was featured in Wendy Moonan\u2019s [[New York Times]] article on the antiques market, in which she stated, \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> In February of that year, LAMA launched its website, bringing broader visibility to the company. To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was invited by Echoes Magazine to interview [[Pierre Koenig]], the architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]].\n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the Modern art and design markets. \u201cModern Monthly\u201d auctions were held with the average lot selling for less than $500 in a bid to reach young collectors through accessible prices. LAMA was commissioned by [[ARCO]] (Atlantic Ritchfield Corporation) to liquidate the company's corporate fine art collection \u2014 the first major fine art commission for the auction house. The same year, LAMA achieved a world record for any design by Charles Eames when the \u201cConversation\u201d prototype, a 1941 collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]], realized $129,000.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\nAfter achieving the world record for an Eames design in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity was chosen by John & Marilyn Neuhart to auction works from their private collection in July 2000 \u2013 the first ever single-owner auction dedicated to the works of Charles and Ray Eames. On offer were custom designs, sculptures, photographs, drawings, and ephemera by the Eameses curated by the Neuharts, who worked in the Eames Office and authored ''Eames Design: The Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames''. Also included was a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes \u2013 many of which are in permanent collections in public institutions. \n\nAcknowledging LAMA\u2019s swift ascent, Loughrey was included that year in ''Art & Auction'''s Power Issue.\n\nIn 2002, during the Loughreys\u2019 tenure directing [[Butterfield and Butterfield]]'s 20th Century Decorative Arts and Design department,  [[Playboy]] Enterprises selected Loughrey to conduct the first-ever auction of items from the magazine's archives, including fine art, photography, sculpture, drawings, and ephemera. That year, LAMA also organized the first auction dedicated to the collection of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd.\n\nIn 2003, Peter Loughrey joined [[PBS]]\u2019s [[Antiques Roadshow]] as an appraiser and continued to be featured on the program today until his passing in 2020. \n\nLAMA achieved two more world auction records in 2004, when works by [[George Nakashima]] sold for more than $100,000 \u2014 Nakashima remains a consistently featured LAMA artist today. The same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Loughrey to co-curate ''Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration''. Works by Italian designer, architect and artist Ponti continue to be regularly presented at LAMA sales.\n\nLoughrey also worked with ACME to co-curate another show in 2005, ''Dutch Design''. In May of that year, LAMA was the exclusive auctioneer of the entire contents of the [[Paul Laszlo]]-designed Hudspeth Residence. This was the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at auction at one time.\n\nLAMA established a new world record price for ''Marilyn (#28)'' by [[Andy Warhol]] at its June 3, 2007 Modern Art & Design Auction, where the work realized $144,000. Shortly after, [[Judy Chicago]]\u2019s ''Car Hood'' realized $288,000. \n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale, auctioning the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!, and, in October, the Loughreys left their West Hollywood location for LAMA\u2019s current showroom in Van Nuys, California. The space was formerly home to Stan Winston Studio and features a skylight added to accommodate the construction of the tyrannosaurus Rex for the film ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.\n\n===2010 to 2020===\nLAMA celebrated its 25th anniversary with its October 22, 2017 Modern Art & Design Auction; the Top Lot was [[Roy Lichtenstein]]\u2019s ''Reverie'', which sold for $175,000. Other top lots included works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Marchel Duchamp]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nLAMA\u2019s October 3, 2008 Modern Art & Design Auction saw the highest sale total in its history, with $5.17 million in sales achieving 125% over the low estimate. \n\nIn October 2019, LAMA introduced the LAMA app, holding their first online-only auction and welcoming web-based bidding on live auction lots. \n\nOn March 2020, Peter Loughrey passed away at from cancer in Los Angeles. Benedikt Taschen told David Keeps for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that Loughrey \u201cknew more about the fabric of California modernism than anyone.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Keeps |first1=David |title=My 'Antiques Roadshow' moment with auctioneer Peter Loughrey, champion of California modernism |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-03-23/peter-loughrey-antiques-roadshow-expert-los-angeles-modern-auctions |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Auctions==\n\n'''May 18, 1996''': This Modern Art & Design Auction featured works exclusively offered through LAMA from Richard Neutra\u2019s V.D.L.

Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], it is a direct sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], and the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]].  In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family.  The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation<!-- \"Organisation\" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling -->, which intends to stage a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]]. \n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series, [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], was being shot.  Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script.  Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|screenwriter strike]],<ref name=Goldberg /> they received no such credits in the final cut.  The title was chosen from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story.  Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]].  Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films.  Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise.  Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250\u2014the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film\u2014even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013}}</ref>  ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, garnering generally polarized reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance, the darker, grittier and realistic tone and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than the predecessor ''Casino Royale''.  {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589&nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nMoments after the end of the previous film, James Bond is driving from [[Lake Como]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding the then unknown organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell, is a double agent and attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and she has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police, paid off by Greene and Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the policemen are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]], who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that he now controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, and Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Bolivia's sole provider of water at significantly higher rates; if Medrano refuses, Greene will deprive the country of water until it [[societal collapse|collapses]]. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. \n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau, a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]].

Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure.

Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.<ref>{{cite news|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=James Bond: Quantum of Solace, Review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10540055/James-Bond-Quantum-of-Solace-review.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 December 2013|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 [[Satellite Awards]], winning Best Song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml|title=2008 13th Annual SATELLITE Awards|publisher=[[International Press Academy]]|accessdate=15 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209100353/http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml <!-- Added by H3llBot -->|archivedate=9 December 2008}}</ref> It was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997072.html |author=Dade Hayes|title=Critics Choice favors 'Milk,' 'Button'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref> and at the [[Empire Awards]], which is voted for by the public, it was shortlisted for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Newcomer, Best Thriller and Best Soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news|title=Empire Awards nominate 'Quantum of Solace' five times, vote now online|publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]]|date=2 March 2009|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=7396&t=mi6&s=news|accessdate=3 March 2009}}</ref> It was nominated for the [[Saturn Award]] for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, while Kurylenko and Dench were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |title=Nominations for the 35th Annual Saturn Awards |publisher=[[Saturn Award|Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films]] |accessdate=17 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221234527/http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |archivedate=21 February 2012  }}</ref> It was nominated by the [[7th Visual Effects Society Awards|Visual Effects Society Awards]] for \"Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/ayear/7th-annual-ves-awards|title=7th Annual VES Awards|work=visual effects society|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nMovie critic Gilbert Cruz listed the film's pre-titles sequence as the eighth-greatest car chase in film history.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gilbert Cruz|title=The 15 Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time|work=[[Time (magazine) | Time]]|date=1 May 2011|url=https://entertainment.time.com/2011/05/05/the-15-greatest-movie-car-chases-of-all-time/slide/quantum-of-solace-2008|accessdate=1 February 2020 | location=New York}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Eco-terrorism in fiction]]\n* [[Outline of James Bond]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* ''Bond on Set: Filming Quantum of Solace'', Greg Williams, DK ADULT (20 October 2008), {{ISBN|0-7566-4120-9}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Quantum of Solace}}\n{{commons category|Quantum of Solace (film)}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.007.com}}\n*{{IMDb title|0830515}}\n*{{Allmovie title|356351}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|quantum_of_solace}}\n*{{mojo title|jamesbond22}}\n\n{{James Bond films}}\n{{Quantum of Solace}}\n{{Marc Forster}}\n{{Paul Haggis}}\n{{Empire Award for Best Thriller}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s adventure films]]\n[[Category:2000s spy films]]\n[[Category:2000s sequel films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Best Thriller Empire Award winners]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British adventure films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:Central Intelligence Agency in fiction]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Eco-terrorism in fiction]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Environmental films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Arnold]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Marc Forster]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Michael G.

Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], it is a direct sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], and the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]].  In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family.  The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation<!-- \"Organisation\" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling -->, which intends to stage a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]]. \n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series, [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], was being shot.  Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script.  Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|screenwriter strike]],<ref name=Goldberg /> they received no such credits in the final cut.  The title was chosen from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story.  Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]].  Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films.  Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise.  Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250\u2014the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film\u2014even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013}}</ref>  ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, garnering generally polarized reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance, the darker, grittier and realistic tone and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than the predecessor ''Casino Royale''.  {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589&nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nMoments after the end of the previous film, James Bond is driving from [[Lake Como]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding the then unknown organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell, is a double agent and attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and she has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police, paid off by Greene and Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the policemen are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]], who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that he now controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, and Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Bolivia's sole provider of water at significantly higher rates; if Medrano refuses, Greene will deprive the country of water until it [[societal collapse|collapses]]. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. \n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau, a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]].

Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.<ref>{{cite news|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=James Bond: Quantum of Solace, Review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10540055/James-Bond-Quantum-of-Solace-review.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 December 2013|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 [[Satellite Awards]], winning Best Song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml|title=2008 13th Annual SATELLITE Awards|publisher=[[International Press Academy]]|accessdate=15 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209100353/http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2008.shtml <!-- Added by H3llBot -->|archivedate=9 December 2008}}</ref> It was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997072.html |author=Dade Hayes|title=Critics Choice favors 'Milk,' 'Button'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref> and at the [[Empire Awards]], which is voted for by the public, it was shortlisted for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Newcomer, Best Thriller and Best Soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news|title=Empire Awards nominate 'Quantum of Solace' five times, vote now online|publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]]|date=2 March 2009|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=7396&t=mi6&s=news|accessdate=3 March 2009}}</ref> It was nominated for the [[Saturn Award]] for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, while Kurylenko and Dench were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |title=Nominations for the 35th Annual Saturn Awards |publisher=[[Saturn Award|Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films]] |accessdate=17 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221234527/http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |archivedate=21 February 2012  }}</ref> It was nominated by the [[7th Visual Effects Society Awards|Visual Effects Society Awards]] for \"Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/ayear/7th-annual-ves-awards|title=7th Annual VES Awards|work=visual effects society|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nMovie critic Gilbert Cruz listed the film's pre-titles sequence as the eighth-greatest car chase in film history.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gilbert Cruz|title=The 15 Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time|work=[[Time (magazine) | Time]]|date=1 May 2011|url=https://entertainment.time.com/2011/05/05/the-15-greatest-movie-car-chases-of-all-time/slide/quantum-of-solace-2008|accessdate=1 February 2020 | location=New York}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Eco-terrorism in fiction]]\n* [[Outline of James Bond]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* ''Bond on Set: Filming Quantum of Solace'', Greg Williams, DK ADULT (20 October 2008), {{ISBN|0-7566-4120-9}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Quantum of Solace}}\n{{commons category|Quantum of Solace (film)}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.007.com}}\n*{{IMDb title|0830515}}\n*{{Allmovie title|356351}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|quantum_of_solace}}\n*{{mojo title|jamesbond22}}\n\n{{James Bond films}}\n{{Quantum of Solace}}\n{{Marc Forster}}\n{{Paul Haggis}}\n{{Empire Award for Best Thriller}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s adventure films]]\n[[Category:2000s spy films]]\n[[Category:2000s sequel films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Best Thriller Empire Award winners]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British adventure films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:Central Intelligence Agency in fiction]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Eco-terrorism in fiction]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Environmental films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Arnold]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Marc Forster]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Michael G.
