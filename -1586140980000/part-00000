Commonly nicknamed the \"Piano Man\" after his first major hit and signature [[Piano Man (song)|song of the same name]], he has led a commercially successful career as a solo artist since the 1970s, having released twelve studio albums from 1971 to 1993 as well as one studio album in 2001.

Growing up, he took piano lessons at the insistence of his mother. After dropping out of [[high school]] to pursue a musical career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After releasing the albums ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315|title=Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= 2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock and roll artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", two of his best-known songs today. After releasing the albums ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth and to date final studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring [[classical music|classical]] compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel also provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[animated film|animated]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger, and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., all of which he wrote himself,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |website=newyorker.com |accessdate= July 19, 2018}}</ref> and three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") managed to peak at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning five of them, including Album of the Year for ''52nd Street''. Joel was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1992), the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1999),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/billy-joel |title=Billy Joel |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| language= en |access-date= January 19, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] (2006). In 2001, Joel received the [[Johnny Mercer]] Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.songhall.org/awards/winner/Billy_Joel|title=Billy Joel: Johnny Mercer Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref> In 2013, Joel received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], for influencing American culture through the arts. Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has held a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe in which he sings several of his written songs. In 1987, he became one of the very first artists to hold a rock and roll tour in the [[Soviet Union]] following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock and roll music. Despite largely retiring from writing and releasing pop music following the release of ''River of Dreams'', he continues to tour; he frequently performs at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]]. Joel has been in several relationships, including marriages to Elizabeth Weber Small, model [[Christie Brinkley]], and chef [[Katie Lee (chef)|Katie Lee]]; since 2015, he has been married to Alexis Roderick, his fourth spouse. He also has three daughters: [[Alexa Ray Joel]] with Brinkley, and Della Rose and Remy Anne with Roderick.\n\n== Early life, family and education ==\nWilliam Martin Joel was born in [[the Bronx]], New York City, New York, on May 9, 1949.

It is perhaps best known for \"[[The Entertainer (song)|The Entertainer]]\", a No. 34 hit in the U.S. Upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote \"The Entertainer\" as a sarcastic response: \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" Although ''Streetlife Serenade'' is often considered{{By whom|date=February 2018}} one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs \"Los Angelenos\" and \"[[Root Beer Rag]]\", an [[instrumental]] that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.\n\nIn late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album.\n\nDisenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'', the first album he recorded with the group of hand-picked musicians who became the [[Billy Joel Band]]. Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\n\"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]\" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include \"[[Summer, Highland Falls]]\", \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\", (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit), and \"[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]]\", a concert mainstay.\n\n===1977\u20131979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===\nColumbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986). ''The Stranger'' was an enormous commercial success, yielding four Top-25 hits on the ''Billboard'' charts: \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\" (No. 3), \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)|Movin' Out]]\" (No. 17), \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\" ( No. 24), and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\" (No. 17).

The album sold over seven million copies, propelled to number one on the charts by the following hits: \"[[My Life (Billy Joel song)|My Life]]\" (No. 3); followed successes from the album were \"[[Big Shot (song)|Big Shot]]\" (No. 14), and \"[[Honesty (Billy Joel song)|Honesty]]\" (No. 24).

Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that \"people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\").\n\n''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart and yielded such hits as \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\" (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (No. 7, May 1980), \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\" (No. 19, September 1980), \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\" (No. 36, November 1980) and \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\", which became Joel's first ''Billboard'' number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980. \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40.

It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, \"Through The Long Night\" ([[B-side]] of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Yes It Is]]\".<ref name=\"unauthorized\" /> In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.<ref>{{citation |last1=Joel|first1=Billy|title=Billy Joel \u2013 Masterclass concert (Part 1) \u2013 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>\n\nHis next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded during larger US arenas and intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3&nbsp;million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With ''The Nylon Curtain'', Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\"<ref name=\"ncvideo\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;\u2013 from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name=\"ncvideo\" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]\" and \"[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]\". \"Allentown\" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting \"Pressure\" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release.

At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT214|title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics|first1=Michael|last1=Heatley|first2=Frank|last2=Hopkinson|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=Pavilion Books|accessdate=January 28, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn December, the title song, \"[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]\", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"[[The Longest Time]]\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]].

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger.  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and \u2013 to date \u2013 most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front'''s second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995.]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|alt=Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.|thumb|Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\n\nJoel visited the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, he performed a free concert in [[Rome]], with the [[Colosseum]] as the backdrop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/joel-and-adams-in-free-rome-concert-270269.html|title=Joel and Adams in free Rome concert|date=August 1, 2006|work=irishexaminer.com|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoel toured South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006, and subsequently toured the Southeastern U.S. in February and March 2007 before hitting the Midwest in the spring of 2007.

Proceeds from the song benefited the Homes For Our Troops foundation.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 4.jpg|thumb|Joel with [[Mike DelGuidice]] in 2016]]\nOn January 26, 2008, Joel performed with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] celebrating the 151st anniversary of the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]]. Joel performed his classical piece titled, \"Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)\" from Fantasies and Delusions arranged by [[Brad Ellis]]. He also played many of his less well-known pieces, with full orchestral backing arranged by Mr. Ellis, including the rarely performed ''Nylon Curtain'' songs \"Scandinavian Skies\" and \"Where's the Orchestra?\".\n\nOn March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend [[John Mellencamp]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.\n\nJoel's staying power as a touring act continues to the present day.

Growing up, he took piano lessons at the insistence of his mother. After dropping out of [[high school]] to pursue a musical career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After releasing the albums ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315|title=Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= 2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock and roll artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", two of his most well-known songs today. After releasing the albums ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth and to date final studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring [[classical music|classical]] compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel also provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[animated film|animated]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger, and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., all of which he wrote himself,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |website=newyorker.com |accessdate= July 19, 2018}}</ref> and three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") managed to peak at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning five of them, including Album of the Year for ''52nd Street''. Joel was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1992), the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1999),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/billy-joel |title=Billy Joel |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| language= en |access-date= January 19, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] (2006). In 2001, Joel received the [[Johnny Mercer]] Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.songhall.org/awards/winner/Billy_Joel|title=Billy Joel: Johnny Mercer Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref> In 2013, Joel received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], for influencing American culture through the arts. Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has held a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe in which he sings several of his written songs. In 1987, he became one of the very first artists to hold a rock and roll tour in the [[Soviet Union]] following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock and roll music. Despite largely retiring from writing and releasing pop music following the release of ''River of Dreams'', he continues to tour; he frequently performs at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]]. Joel has been in several relationships, including marriages to Elizabeth Weber Small, model [[Christie Brinkley]], and chef [[Katie Lee (chef)|Katie Lee]]; since 2015, he has been married to Alexis Roderick, his fourth spouse. He also has three daughters: [[Alexa Ray Joel]] with Brinkley, and Della Rose and Remy Anne with Roderick.\n\n== Early life, family and education ==\nWilliam Martin Joel was born in [[the Bronx]], New York City, New York, on May 9, 1949.

Columbia released a remastered version of ''Cold Spring Harbor ''in 1983, with certain songs shortened or re-orchestrated.\n\nJoel began his ''Cold Spring Harbor'' tour in the fall of 1971, touring with his band ([[Rhys Clark]] on drums, Al Hertzberg on guitar, and [[Larry Russell (bassist)|Larry Russell]] on bass guitar) throughout the US and Puerto Rico, opening for groups such as [[the J.

Joel's performance at the Puerto Rican [[Mar y Sol Pop Festival]] was especially well-received; and although recorded, Joel refused to have it published on the Mar Y Sol compilation album ''[[Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival (album)|Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival]]''.

Artie Ripp sold Joel's first contract to Columbia. [[Walter Yetnikoff]], the president of CBS/Columbia Records at the time, bought back the rights to Joel's songs in the late 1970s, giving the rights to Joel as a birthday gift.<ref>''The Last Play at Shea'' (documentary film). 2010.

Despite modest sales, ''Piano Man''<nowiki/>'s title track became his signature song, ending nearly every concert. That year Joel's touring band changed. Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by [[Doug Stegmeyer]], who stayed with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows. Joel's songwriting began attracting more attention; in 1974 [[Helen Reddy]] recorded \"You're My Home\" (''Piano Man'').\n\n===1974\u20131977: ''Streetlife Serenade'' and ''Turnstiles''===\nIn 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]''.

It is perhaps best known for \"[[The Entertainer (song)|The Entertainer]]\", a No. 34 hit in the U.S. Upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote \"The Entertainer\" as a sarcastic response: \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" Although ''Streetlife Serenade'' is often considered{{By whom|date=February 2018}} one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs \"Los Angelenos\" and \"[[Root Beer Rag]]\", an [[instrumental]] that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.\n\nIn late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album.\n\nDisenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'', the first album he recorded with the group of hand-picked musicians who became the [[Billy Joel Band]]. Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\n\"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]\" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include \"[[Summer, Highland Falls]]\", \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\", (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit), and \"[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]]\", a concert mainstay.\n\n===1977\u20131979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===\nColumbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986).

The album sold over seven million copies, propelled to number one on the charts by the following hits: \"[[My Life (Billy Joel song)|My Life]]\" (No. 3); followed successes from the album were \"[[Big Shot (song)|Big Shot]]\" (No. 14), and \"[[Honesty (Billy Joel song)|Honesty]]\" (No. 24). A cover of \"My Life\" (sung by Gary Bennett) became the theme song for a new television sitcom, ''[[Bosom Buddies]]'', which featured actor [[Tom Hanks]] in one of his earliest roles. ''52nd Street ''won Grammy awards for [[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]] and Album of the Year.\n\nIn 1979, Joel also traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place between March 2\u20134, alongside [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Stephen Stills]], the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], Mike Finnegan, [[Weather Report]], and an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata G\u00fcines]] and [[Orquesta Arag\u00f3n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storage.people.com/people/archive/jpgs/19790319/19790319-750-35.jpg |title=article on Havana Jam |work=People |date=March 19, 1979 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref> His performance is captured in [[Ernesto Juan Castellanos]]'s documentary ''[[Havana Jam '79]]''.\n\n===1979\u20131983: ''Glass Houses'' and ''The Nylon Curtain''===\nThe success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\", \"She's Always a Woman\", and \"Honesty\" led some critics to label Joel a \"[[ballad]]eer\" and \"[[soft rock]]er\". Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that \"people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\").\n\n''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart and yielded such hits as \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\" (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (No. 7, May 1980), \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\" (No. 19, September 1980), \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\" (No. 36, November 1980) and \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\", which became Joel's first ''Billboard'' number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980. \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40.

It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, \"Through The Long Night\" ([[B-side]] of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Yes It Is]]\".<ref name=\"unauthorized\" /> In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.<ref>{{citation |last1=Joel|first1=Billy|title=Billy Joel \u2013 Masterclass concert (Part 1) \u2013 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>\n\nHis next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded during larger US arenas and intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3&nbsp;million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With ''The Nylon Curtain'', Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\"<ref name=\"ncvideo\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;\u2013 from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name=\"ncvideo\" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]\" and \"[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]\". \"Allentown\" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting \"Pressure\" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release.

At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT214|title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics|first1=Michael|last1=Heatley|first2=Frank|last2=Hopkinson|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=Pavilion Books|accessdate=January 28, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn December, the title song, \"[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]\", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"[[The Longest Time]]\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]].

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger.  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and \u2013 to date \u2013 most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front'''s second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995.]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|alt=Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.|thumb|Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\n\nJoel visited the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, he performed a free concert in [[Rome]], with the [[Colosseum]] as the backdrop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/joel-and-adams-in-free-rome-concert-270269.html|title=Joel and Adams in free Rome concert|date=August 1, 2006|work=irishexaminer.com|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoel toured South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006, and subsequently toured the Southeastern U.S. in February and March 2007 before hitting the Midwest in the spring of 2007.

Most famously, she published her mother's memoir of the \u201cFirst Anniversary Ball of the Battle of San Jacinto.\u201d She wrote frequently about Texas history, but also submitted essays about education and gender issues. Her works caught the attention of Dora Fowler Arthur, editor of ''Texas Magazine'', who offered column space to the DRT in 1896.  She wrote articles for Dudley G. Wooten's ''Comprehensive History of Texas'' and for his ''New History of Texas for Schools''.<ref>McLemore (2015), pp. 161\u2013162.</ref>\n\nLooscan was a combatant in a schism within the DRT about the [[Alamo]] site in [[San Antonio]]. De Zavala, who had established an eponymous chapter of the DRT, was adamant about historical restoration and preservation. Looscan supported De Zavala and her principles. Clara Driscoll advocated remaking the site as an urban park. The acrimony of the debate resulted in Looscan withdrawing from the DRT.<ref>McLemore (2015), pp. 165\u2013166.</ref>\nThe Texas State Historical Association (TSHA), organized in 1897, recruited Looscan and other writers from the women's clubs and trained them for scholarly historical writing. After the Alamo dispute, Looscan and De Zavala remained engaged with the TSHA, though many other women dropped out in reaction to the Alamo dispute. Looscan continued to write and recruit other writers for the TSHA. In 1915, [[Eugene C. Barker]] appointed Looscan to serve as president of the Texas State Historical Commission. She promoted TSHA's magazine, with a focus on Houston as a base of expansion, approaching [[Rice University|Rice Institute]] and various women's clubs.<ref>McLemore (2015), 167\u2013169.</ref>\nLooscan resigned as president of TSHA in 1925, but remained active in the Association for the Preservation of the Historical Landmarks in Texas and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]].<ref>McLemore (2015), pp. 170\u2013171.</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:GC adele briscoe looscan.jpg|thumb|Grave marker for Adele Briscoe Looscan, Glenwood Cemetery, Houston.]]\nLooscan died in Houston on November 23, 1935 and was interred at [[Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas)|Glenwood Cemetery]].<ref name=HTO/> She donated an extensive collection of Texas history books to the [[Houston Public Library]] and the Looscan Neighborhood Library in Houston is named in her honor.<ref name=HTO/><ref name=BTC/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last=McLemore|first=Laura Lyons|title=Adele Briscoe Looscan: Daughter of the Republic|publisher=TCU Press|location=Fort Worth|year=2016}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/sjmh/00041/sjmh-00041.html Adele Briscoe Looscan Collection, San Jacinto Museum of History.]\n\n{{Portal bar|Biography|Texas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Looscan, Adele Briscoe}}\n[[Category:1848 births]]\n[[Category:1935 deaths]]\n[[Category:Historians of Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Texas]]\n[[Category:American historians]]\n[[Category:Members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy]]\n[[Category:American women historians]]\n[[Category:People from Harris County, Texas]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_Briscoe_Looscan"}

The series, written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[penciller|pencilled]] by [[George P\u00e9rez]], was first serialized as a 12-issue [[limited series (comics)|limited series]] from April 1985 to March 1986. As the main piece of a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event, some plot elements were featured in [[tie-in]] issues of other publications. Since its initial publication, the series has been reprinted in various formats and editions.\n\nThe idea for the series stemmed from Wolfman's desire to abandon the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]] depicted in the company's comics\u2014which he thought was unfriendly to readers\u2014and create a single, unified [[DC Universe]] (DCU). The foundation of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' developed through a character (the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]) introduced in Wolfman's ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' in July 1982 before the series itself started. P\u00e9rez was not the intended artist for the series, but was excited when he learned of it and called illustrating it some of the most fun he ever had.\n\nAt the start of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the [[Anti-Monitor]] (the Monitor's evil counterpart) is unleashed on the DC Multiverse and begins to destroy the various Earths that it comprises. The Monitor tries to recruit heroes from around the Multiverse but is murdered, while [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] collaborates with the villains to conquer the remaining Earths. However, both the heroes and villains are eventually united by the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]; the series concludes with [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]], [[Superboy-Prime]] and [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]] defeating the Anti-Monitor and the creation of a single Earth in place of the Multiverse. ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' is noted for its high death count; hundreds of characters died, including DC icons [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]] (the original [[Supergirl]]) and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]). The story's events resulted in the entire DCU being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].\n\nThe series was a bestseller for DC and has been reviewed positively by comic book critics, who praised its ambition and dramatic events. The story is credited with popularizing the idea of a large-scale crossover in comics. \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" is the first installment in what became known as the ''Crisis'' trilogy; it was followed by ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005\u20132006) and ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (2008\u20132009).

Art by George P\u00e9rez.]] -->\nThe conflicting stories of the DCU are explained as a Multiverse, containing many parallel universes and alternate versions of the characters, with the primary DC continuity referred to as Earth-One. A cosmic being from the beginning of time known as the Monitor catalogues these realities, but he has an evil counterpart, the [[Anti-Monitor]], who comes from an [[antimatter]] universe. After an accident with antimatter on one universe, the Anti-Monitor begins destroying many of the realities with a wave of antimatter, planning on becoming sole ruler of all realities.\n\nTo combat this, the Monitor recruits heroes from across time and space to set up five towers, to help merge the multiverse back into one to make it stronger. However, he is murdered by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]], who is possessed by one of the Anti-Monitor's demons. His death releases enough energy to project two of the last five parallel Earths into a protective limbo. The Anti-Monitor recruits [[Psycho-Pirate]] to his cause, infusing him with part of his power to manipulate the heroes of Earth-4, Earth-S and Earth-X against the rest; this fails when all five Earths enter the limbo universe. Harbinger then recruits heroes from the remaining Earths to lead an assault on the Anti-Monitor in the antimatter universe, using [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]'s powers to open a portal between the limbo and antimatter universes. [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] tracks down the Anti-Monitor at his fortress, and the heroes destroy a converter, powered by stellar energy, used to destroy the last five Earths; the injured Anti-Monitor retreats and Supergirl dies.\n\nDuring a lull in the war, the villains unite under [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], who kills Earth-Two's Alexei Luthor while recruiting the Earth-One Lex Luthor to conquer the remaining Earths. The Anti-Monitor meanwhile creates a new body for himself, and tries to use an antimatter cannon to penetrate the limbo universe and destroy the five partially merged Earths. The Flash (Barry Allen) dies stopping this attempt. A furious Anti-Monitor absorbs the energy of millions of worlds and vows to travel back through time to prevent the creation of the multiverse. The [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] unites the heroes and villains by warning them about the Anti-Monitor's plan; the heroes travel back in time to stop the Anti-Monitor, while the villains travel back in time to the ancient planet [[Oa]] to prevent renegade scientist [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] from creating the technology necessary for the Anti-Monitor's plan to succeed. The villains fail, and Krona continues his experiment. The Anti-Monitor waits for Alex Luthor to reopen the portal between the positive and antimatter universes, capturing the heroes, but a magically empowered Spectre creates an energy overload which shatters space and time. The five Earths merge into a single shared universe, and the superheroes return to the present; only those present at the dawn of time remember the original realities.\n\nA cosmically empowered Anti-Monitor attacks again, transporting the new Earth to the antimatter universe and summoning a horde of shadow demons. He falls in a carefully planned counterattack, culminating in a battle with [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]] (the Earth-Two Superman) Alexander Luthor of Earth-Three and [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] of Earth-Prime, with help from [[New Gods]] adversary [[Darkseid]]. In this final battle the Anti-Monitor, reduced to a flaming head, crashes into a star and is killed by the Earth-Two Superman. As they are the only four who remember the original past, Alex sends Earth-Two Superman, Earth-Two Lois Lane, Earth-Prime Superboy and himself to a pocket \"paradise\" dimension, leaving the heroes of the remaining Earth to sort out the aftermath of this crisis.\n\n==Reception==\nDespite relatively limited marketing<ref name=\"gerber\"/> and DC being unsure if the series would be successful, ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' was a bestseller.<ref name=\"monitoringthepast\"/>\n\n[[IGN]]{{'}}s Hilary Goldstein summarized the series as \"a crucial turning point for DC Comics\" and credited it with saving the company.

The series, written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[penciller|pencilled]] by [[George P\u00e9rez]], was first serialized as a 12-issue [[limited series (comics)|limited series]] from April 1985 to March 1986. As the main piece of a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event, some plot elements were featured in [[tie-in]] issues of other publications. Since its initial publication, the series has been reprinted in various formats and editions.\n\nThe idea for the series stemmed from Wolfman's desire to abandon the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]] depicted in the company's comics\u2014which he thought was unfriendly to readers\u2014and create a single, unified [[DC Universe]] (DCU). The foundation of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' developed through a character (the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]) introduced in Wolfman's ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' in July 1982 before the series itself started. P\u00e9rez was not the intended artist for the series, but was excited when he learned of it and called illustrating it some of the most fun he ever had.\n\nAt the start of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the [[Anti-Monitor]] (the Monitor's evil counterpart) is unleashed on the DC Multiverse and begins to destroy the various Earths that it comprises. The Monitor tries to recruit heroes from around the Multiverse but is murdered, while [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] collaborates with the villains to conquer the remaining Earths. However, both the heroes and villains are eventually united by the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]; the series concludes with [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]], [[Superboy-Prime]] and [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]] defeating the Anti-Monitor and the creation of a single Earth in place of the Multiverse. ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' is noted for its high death count; hundreds of characters died, including DC icons [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]] (the original [[Supergirl]]) and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]). The story's events resulted in the entire DCU being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].\n\nThe series was a bestseller for DC and has been reviewed positively by comic book critics, who praised its ambition and dramatic events.

Art by George P\u00e9rez.]] -->\nThe conflicting stories of the DCU are explained as a Multiverse, containing many parallel universes and alternate versions of the characters, with the primary DC continuity referred to as Earth-One. A cosmic being from the beginning of time known as the Monitor catalogues these realities, but he has an evil counterpart, the [[Anti-Monitor]], who comes from an [[antimatter]] universe. After an accident with antimatter on one universe, the Anti-Monitor begins destroying many of the realities with a wave of antimatter, planning on becoming sole ruler of all realities.\n\nTo combat this, the Monitor recruits heroes from across time and space to set up five towers, to help merge the multiverse back into one to make it stronger. However, he is murdered by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]], who is possessed by one of the Anti-Monitor's demons. His death releases enough energy to project two of the last five parallel Earths into a protective limbo. The Anti-Monitor recruits [[Psycho-Pirate]] to his cause, infusing him with part of his power to manipulate the heroes of Earth-4, Earth-S and Earth-X against the rest; this fails when all five Earths enter the limbo universe. Harbinger then recruits heroes from the remaining Earths to lead an assault on the Anti-Monitor in the antimatter universe, using [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]'s powers to open a portal between the limbo and antimatter universes. [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] tracks down the Anti-Monitor at his fortress, and the heroes destroy a converter, powered by stellar energy, used to destroy the last five Earths; the injured Anti-Monitor retreats and Supergirl dies.\n\nDuring a lull in the war, the villains unite under [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], who kills Earth-Two's Alexei Luthor while recruiting the Earth-One Lex Luthor to conquer the remaining Earths. The Anti-Monitor meanwhile creates a new body for himself, and tries to use an antimatter cannon to penetrate the limbo universe and destroy the five partially merged Earths. The Flash (Barry Allen) dies stopping this attempt. A furious Anti-Monitor absorbs the energy of millions of worlds and vows to travel back through time to prevent the creation of the multiverse. The [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] unites the heroes and villains by warning them about the Anti-Monitor's plan; the heroes travel back in time to stop the Anti-Monitor, while the villains travel back in time to the ancient planet [[Oa]] to prevent renegade scientist [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] from creating the technology necessary for the Anti-Monitor's plan to succeed. The villains fail, and Krona continues his experiment. The Anti-Monitor waits for Alex Luthor to reopen the portal between the positive and antimatter universes, capturing the heroes, but a magically empowered Spectre creates an energy overload which shatters space and time. The five Earths merge into a single shared universe, and the superheroes return to the present; only those present at the dawn of time remember the original realities.\n\nA cosmically empowered Anti-Monitor attacks again, transporting the new Earth to the antimatter universe and summoning a horde of shadow demons. He falls in a carefully planned counterattack, culminating in a battle with [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]] (the Earth-Two Superman) Alexander Luthor of Earth-Three and [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] of Earth-Prime, with help from [[New Gods]] adversary [[Darkseid]]. In this final battle the Anti-Monitor, reduced to a flaming head, crashes into a star and is killed by the Earth-Two Superman. As they are the only four who remember the original past, Alex sends Earth-Two Superman, Earth-Two Lois Lane, Earth-Prime Superboy and himself to a pocket \"paradise\" dimension, leaving the heroes of the remaining Earth to sort out the aftermath of this crisis.\n\n==Reception==\nDespite relatively limited marketing<ref name=\"gerber\"/> and DC being unsure if the series would be successful, ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' was a bestseller.<ref name=\"monitoringthepast\"/>\n\n[[IGN]]{{'}}s Hilary Goldstein summarized the series as \"a crucial turning point for DC Comics\" and credited it with saving the company.

They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony.

They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>ibid</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa.

Liam is the public face of the company and its flagship program Rehoboam, a sophisticated artificial intelligence, which Dolores is trying to gain access to. Liam knows little himself since it was his father and a man named Serac who built it, but as he is about to reveal Serac's name Dolores is knocked out by Martin, Liam's head of security who discovered Dolores' deception. Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her. Elsewhere, Bernard stays ahead of a manhunt for him and intends to travel to Westworld, while the Charlotte host takes control of Delos.

Liam knows little himself since it was his father and a man named Serac who built it, but as he is about to reveal Serac's name Dolores is knocked out by Martin, Liam's head of security who discovered Dolores' deception. Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her.
