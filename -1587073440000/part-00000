It is located in the southern end of the state. The state has a total land area of {{convert|16,842|km2}}. \n\n== Geography ==\n[http://abasnaija.com.ng abasnaija.com.ng]\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe state covers a landmass of about 18,050&nbsp;km\u00b2, of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between Longitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.45' East and Latitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.30' North. It is geographically located in [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Nigeria's Midwest]], bounded in the north and west by [[Edo State]], the east by [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] States, southeast by [[Bayelsa State]], and on the southern extreme is the [[Bight of Benin]] which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-lace with rivulets and streams, which form part of the [[Niger Delta|Niger River Delta]].\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State was defined out of the former [[Bendel State]] on 27 August 1991. The state was actualized following agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province.  There was yet another state request proposed as \"Niger State\" comprising the Asaba and Aboh divisions of the old Midwest region. The then Military President, Gen. [[Ibrahim Babangida]], recognized Delta state but chose \"Asaba\" a prominent town within the \"Northwestern lower Niger\" as capital city. The proposed capital was a virgin land in the heart of the two constituent divisions that constitutes the Northwestern lower Niger. Delta state was once integrated in the Mid Western state from 1963 to 1976 and later Bendel state, from 1976 to 1991. The name \"Bendel\" (Ben-Del) coined from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to reflect the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State is predominantly inhabited by the [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]];  the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], the [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] Izon and the [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Olukumi people|Olukumi]] . The population of other groups in the state are negligible. The [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]] are the most predominant people inhabiting the state and currently are more than 3 million people. The Igbo populating Delta State and Onitsha or nearby are referred to as people of the good land ([[Igbo language|Igbo]] : [[Anioma people|Anoma]]) and reside throughout the state mostly because of trade. The Itsekiri speak a language very closely related to [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] but have been culturally influenced by the [[Edo_people|Edo]] from neighbouring Edo state, as well as the Urhobo, [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] and [[Portuguese people| Portuguese]]. The Izon are a group of people related to the predominant people of neighbouring Bayelsa State while the [[Olukumi]] are becoming culturally and linguistically extinct due to acculturation and assimilation. \n\nThe vast majority of inhabitants are Christian, with very few practicing [[African Traditional Religion|Traditional Religion]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]], a member of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], was elected Governor and chief executive of Delta State in April 2015. His deputy is Barr. Kingsley Otuaro. The state has three National Senatorial Districts (South, North and Central).  In 2011 and 2013, the elected senators were [[James Manager]], [[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]] and Emmanuel Aguariavwodo who replaced Pius Ewherido who died in 2013 at National Hospital, Abuja. In 2015, Chief Ighoyeta Amori was elected Senator of Delta Central but his election was annulled and Senator Ovie [[Omo-Agege]] sworn in as Senator of Delta Central, James Manager retained his position and Chief Peter Nwaoboshi was elected Senator of Delta North. The Executive, Legislative and Judicial Chambers are housed in [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] with a government house annex in [[Warri]].\n\n===Past & Present Administrations<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://deltastate.gov.ng/former-administrations | title=Past Administrations &#124; Delta State Government}}</ref>===\n*[[Ifeanyi Okowa]] - 29 May, 2015 to date ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Emmanuel Uduaghan]] - 29 May 2007 to 29 May 2015 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[James Ibori]] - 29 May 1999 to 29 May 2007 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Walter Feghabo]] - 12 August 1998 to 29 May 1999 (Military)\n*[[John Dungs]] - 22 August 1996 to 12 August 1998 (Military)\n*[[Ibrahim Kefas]] - 26 September 1994 to 22 August 1996 (Military)\n*[[Bassey Asuquo]] - 10 December 1993 to 26 September 1994 (Military)\n*[[Abdulkadir Shehu]] - 17 November 1993 - 10 December 1993 (Military)\n*[[Luke Chijiuba Ochulor]] - 28 August 1991 - January 1992 (Military)\n*[[Felix Ibru]] - January 1992 - November 1993 ([[Social Democratic Party|SDP]])\n\n===Local government areas===\n{{see also|List of villages in Delta State}}\nDelta State consists of 25 [[Local government areas of Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (shown with 2006 population figures):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some of these sites of tourism include:\n* '''The Nana's Palace''' built by Chief [[Nana Olomu]] of Ebrohim. He was a powerful 19th century indigenous entrepreneur who traded with the British. The relationship eventually turned sour. Later, he surrendered (not without putting up a fight) and was exiled to Ghana. His personal effects are housed in this grand palace.\n* '''The River Ethiope '''which is reputed to be the deepest inland waterway in Africa (at 176&nbsp;km). Its source is at the foot of a giant silk-cotton tree at Umuaja in Ukwuani Local Government Area of the state and flows through seven Local Government Areas in the State. It is a place of worship for Olokun traditional religion and also a common site for faithfuls of the [[Igbe religion|Igbe Religious Movement]].\n* '''The Araya Bible Site '''which houses a copy of the [[Holy Bible]]. It is believed that the bible descended to this spot miraculously from heaven around August, 1914. The bible dropped on rain-soaked yam and it didn't get wet. The site now attracts thousands of Christians yearly.\n* '''Demas Nwoko Edifice '''which was built using traditional materials, designs and construction techniques of the Igbo civilization and the Benin Empire by [[Demas Nwoko]], an architect, builder and artist of international repute from Idumuje-Ugboko, in Aniocha North Local Government Area, Delta State.\n* '''The Mungo Park House''' which is now the site of the National Museum, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]. The house was constructed by the Royal Niger Company (RNC) in 1886 and was used as a colonial administrative headquarters, a military house, the colonial administrative divisional headquarters, the RNC Constabulary building,  and the seat of the Urban District Council at different times.\n* The '''[[River Niger Bridge (Onitsha)|Niger Bridge]]''' which connects Delta State (by extension, western Nigeria) to the Eastern part of Nigeria. It is a beauty to behold. It was completed in 1965 and cost \u00a35 million. It was damaged during the civil war, but later repaired.\n* '''Lander Brothers Anchorage, Asaba''' which was built in memory of early British explorers. The complex has a museum, a graveyard, and many artworks and writings. It houses a replica of one of the boats that was used by the brothers.\n* '''Falcorp Mangrove Park'''\n* '''Warri Kingdom Royal Cemetery''' which is 512 year old burial ground and serves as the resting place of past rulers of Warri kingdom.

It is located in the southern end of the state. The state has a total land area of {{convert|16,842|km2}}. \n\n== Geography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe state covers a landmass of about 18,050&nbsp;km\u00b2, of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between Longitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.45' East and Latitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.30' North. It is geographically located in [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Nigeria's Midwest]], bounded in the north and west by [[Edo State]], the east by [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] States, southeast by [[Bayelsa State]], and on the southern extreme is the [[Bight of Benin]] which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-lace with rivulets and streams, which form part of the [[Niger Delta|Niger River Delta]].\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State was defined out of the former [[Bendel State]] on 27 August 1991. The state was actualized following agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province.  There was yet another state request proposed as \"Niger State\" comprising the Asaba and Aboh divisions of the old Midwest region. The then Military President, Gen. [[Ibrahim Babangida]], recognized Delta state but chose \"Asaba\" a prominent town within the \"Northwestern lower Niger\" as capital city. The proposed capital was a virgin land in the heart of the two constituent divisions that constitutes the Northwestern lower Niger. Delta state was once integrated in the Mid Western state from 1963 to 1976 and later Bendel state, from 1976 to 1991. The name \"Bendel\" (Ben-Del) coined from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to reflect the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State is predominantly inhabited by the [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]];  the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], the [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] Izon and the [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Olukumi people|Olukumi]] . The population of other groups in the state are negligible. The [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]] are the most predominant people inhabiting the state and currently are more than 3 million people. The Igbo populating Delta State and Onitsha or nearby are referred to as people of the good land ([[Igbo language|Igbo]] : [[Anioma people|Anoma]]) and reside throughout the state mostly because of trade. The Itsekiri speak a language very closely related to [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] but have been culturally influenced by the [[Edo_people|Edo]] from neighbouring Edo state, as well as the Urhobo, [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] and [[Portuguese people| Portuguese]]. The Izon are a group of people related to the predominant people of neighbouring Bayelsa State while the [[Olukumi]] are becoming culturally and linguistically extinct due to acculturation and assimilation. \n\nThe vast majority of inhabitants are Christian, with very few practicing [[African Traditional Religion|Traditional Religion]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]], a member of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], was elected Governor and chief executive of Delta State in April 2015. His deputy is Barr. Kingsley Otuaro. The state has three National Senatorial Districts (South, North and Central).  In 2011 and 2013, the elected senators were [[James Manager]], [[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]] and Emmanuel Aguariavwodo who replaced Pius Ewherido who died in 2013 at National Hospital, Abuja. In 2015, Chief Ighoyeta Amori was elected Senator of Delta Central but his election was annulled and Senator Ovie [[Omo-Agege]] sworn in as Senator of Delta Central, James Manager retained his position and Chief Peter Nwaoboshi was elected Senator of Delta North. The Executive, Legislative and Judicial Chambers are housed in [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] with a government house annex in [[Warri]].\n\n===Past & Present Administrations<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://deltastate.gov.ng/former-administrations | title=Past Administrations &#124; Delta State Government}}</ref>===\n*[[Ifeanyi Okowa]] - 29 May, 2015 to date ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Emmanuel Uduaghan]] - 29 May 2007 to 29 May 2015 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[James Ibori]] - 29 May 1999 to 29 May 2007 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Walter Feghabo]] - 12 August 1998 to 29 May 1999 (Military)\n*[[John Dungs]] - 22 August 1996 to 12 August 1998 (Military)\n*[[Ibrahim Kefas]] - 26 September 1994 to 22 August 1996 (Military)\n*[[Bassey Asuquo]] - 10 December 1993 to 26 September 1994 (Military)\n*[[Abdulkadir Shehu]] - 17 November 1993 - 10 December 1993 (Military)\n*[[Luke Chijiuba Ochulor]] - 28 August 1991 - January 1992 (Military)\n*[[Felix Ibru]] - January 1992 - November 1993 ([[Social Democratic Party|SDP]])\n\n===Local government areas===\n{{see also|List of villages in Delta State}}\nDelta State consists of 25 [[Local government areas of Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (shown with 2006 population figures):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some of these institutions are: \n*[[Federal University of Petroleum Resources Effurun|Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun]]\n*[[Delta State University, Abraka|Delta State University]]\n*[[Delta State Polytechnic]]s (three different Polytechnics, one at Oghara, one at Ogwashi-Uku and another at Ozoro)\n*The Film and Broadcast Academy, Ozoro\n*College of Education (two different state colleges, one at [[Agbor]] and another at [[Warri]]).\n*Federal College of Education Technical, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]\n*College of Education, Mosogar\n*Delta State College of Health Technology, [[Ughelli]]\n*[[Petroleum Training Institute]], [[Effurun]]<ref>http://www.edusbaze.com/tag/www-pti-edu-ng/</ref>\n*[[Western Delta University]], [[Oghara]]\n*Novena University, Ogume-Amai\n*National Open University of Nigeria (three study centres, one at Asaba, one at [[Emevor]] and another at [[Owhrode]]).\n*Delta State School of Marine Technology, Burutu\n*Nigerian Maritime University, Okerenkoko, [[Warri]]\n*Conarina School of Maritime & Transport Technology, Oria-[[Abraka]]\n*University of Information and Communication Technology, [[Agbor]]\n*State School of Midwifery, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]\n*School of Nursing (two schools, one at [[Agbor]] and another at [[Warri]])\n*Baptist School of Nursing, [[Eku]]\n*Edwin Clark University, Kiagbodo\n*Eagle Heights University, Omadino, Warri\n*Admiralty University of Nigeria at [[Ibusa]] and [[Sapele]]\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State has some historical, cultural and socio-political tourist centers that attract visitors from around the globe. Some of these sites of tourism include:\n* '''The Nana's Palace''' built by Chief [[Nana Olomu]] of Ebrohim. He was a powerful 19th century indigenous entrepreneur who traded with the British. The relationship eventually turned sour. Later, he surrendered (not without putting up a fight) and was exiled to Ghana. His personal effects are housed in this grand palace.\n* '''The River Ethiope '''which is reputed to be the deepest inland waterway in Africa (at 176&nbsp;km). Its source is at the foot of a giant silk-cotton tree at Umuaja in Ukwuani Local Government Area of the state and flows through seven Local Government Areas in the State. It is a place of worship for Olokun traditional religion and also a common site for faithfuls of the [[Igbe religion|Igbe Religious Movement]].\n* '''The Araya Bible Site '''which houses a copy of the [[Holy Bible]]. It is believed that the bible descended to this spot miraculously from heaven around August, 1914. The bible dropped on rain-soaked yam and it didn't get wet. The site now attracts thousands of Christians yearly.\n* '''Demas Nwoko Edifice '''which was built using traditional materials, designs and construction techniques of the Igbo civilization and the Benin Empire by [[Demas Nwoko]], an architect, builder and artist of international repute from Idumuje-Ugboko, in Aniocha North Local Government Area, Delta State.\n* '''The Mungo Park House''' which is now the site of the National Museum, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]. The house was constructed by the Royal Niger Company (RNC) in 1886 and was used as a colonial administrative headquarters, a military house, the colonial administrative divisional headquarters, the RNC Constabulary building,  and the seat of the Urban District Council at different times.\n* The '''[[River Niger Bridge (Onitsha)|Niger Bridge]]''' which connects Delta State (by extension, western Nigeria) to the Eastern part of Nigeria. It is a beauty to behold. It was completed in 1965 and cost \u00a35 million. It was damaged during the civil war, but later repaired.\n* '''Lander Brothers Anchorage, Asaba''' which was built in memory of early British explorers. The complex has a museum, a graveyard, and many artworks and writings. It houses a replica of one of the boats that was used by the brothers.\n* '''Falcorp Mangrove Park'''\n* '''Warri Kingdom Royal Cemetery''' which is 512 year old burial ground and serves as the resting place of past rulers of Warri kingdom.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in the 1929 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]''. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life.

He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in the 1929 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]''. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

Youth & Community YCD Hub.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn on 1798 in the right-hand house of Xhosa chief Ngqika, King of the Rharhabe division of the Xhosa people. Throughout his life, he was opposed to his father's strategy of ceding land to the [[Cape Colony]]; as a result, in 1822, he went back into the Neutral Zone in order to establish his own chiefdom.\n\n==Sixth Xhosa War==\n{{Main|Xhosa Wars#Sixth war (1834-1836)}}\n\n[[File:Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope, ca 1835.png|thumb|right|250px|The Eastern Frontier, ca 1835]]\nThe Sixth War is known as Hintsa's War by the Xhosa. However, [[Hintsa ka Khawuta|Hintsa]] did not instigate the war and, although he gave support to the Xhosa armies which were involved, it was Chief Maqoma who was the primary leader of the Xhosa forces.\n\n===Background===\nOn the Cape's eastern border (now the Keiskamma River) insecurity persisted. Particularly as the Xhosa on the other side of the border were under considerable pressure from forces further east such as the effects of the expanding Zulu Empire. \nAlthough highly unstable, the frontier region was seeing increasing amounts of cultural diversity, with Europeans, Khoikhoi and Xhosa living and trading throughout the frontier region.\n\n===Outbreak===\nLocal Cape responses to the Xhosa cattle raids varied, but in some cases were drastic and violent. On 11 December 1834, a Cape government commando party killed a chief of high rank, incensing the Xhosa: an army of 10,000 men, led by Maqoma, swept across the frontier into the Cape Colony, pillaged and burned the homesteads and killed all who resisted. Among the worst sufferers was a colony of freed Khoikhoi who, in 1829, had been settled in the [[Kat River]] valley by the British authorities.  Refugees from the farms and villages took to the safety of Grahamstown, where women and children found refuge in the church.\n\n===British campaign===\nThe response was swift and multi-faceted. [[Boer commando]]s mobilised under [[Piet Retief]] and inflicted a defeat on the Xhosa in the Winterberg Mountains in the north. Burgher and Khoi commandos also mobilised, and British Imperial troops arrived via Algoa Bay.\n\nThe British governor, [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]] mustered the combined forces under [[Harry Smith (army)|Colonel Sir Harry Smith]], who reached Grahamstown on 6 January 1835, six days after news of the uprising had reached Cape Town. It was from Grahamstown that the retaliatory campaign was launched and directed.\n\nThe campaign inflicted a string of defeats on the Xhosa, such as at Trompetter's Drift on the Fish River, and most of the Xhosa chiefs surrendered. However Maqoma and Tyali (the other major Xhosa leader) retreated to the fastnesses of the [[Amatola Mountains]].\n\n===The treaty===\nBritish governor [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]] believed that [[Hintsa ka Khawuta]], Paramount-Chief of the [[Gcaleka]] Xhosa, commanded authority over all of the Xhosa tribes and therefore held him responsible for the initial attack on the Cape Colony, and for the looted cattle. D'Urban came to the frontier in December 1834, and led a large force across the Kei river to confront Hintsa at his residence and dictate terms to him.\n\nThe terms dictated that all the country from the Cape's prior frontier, the Keiskamma River, as far as the [[Great Kei River]] was annexed as the British \"Queen Adelaide Province\", and its inhabitants declared British subjects. A site for the seat of province's government was selected and named [[King William\u2019s Town]]. The new province was declared to be for the settlement of loyal tribes, rebel tribes who replaced their leadership, and the [[Fengu people|Fengu]] (known to the Europeans as the \"Fingo people\"), who had recently arrived fleeing from the Zulu armies and had been living under Xhosa subjection. Magistrates were appointed to administer the territory in the hope that they would gradually, with the help of missionaries, undermine tribal authority. Hostilities finally died down on 17 September 1836, after having continued for nine months.\n\n==Eighth Xhosa War==\n{{Main|Xhosa Wars#Eighth war (1850-1853)}}\n[[File:CAPE MOUNTED RIFLES IN 8TH FRONTIER WAR.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cape Mounted Riflemen]] charging the enemy at Waterkloof during the 8th Frontier War]]\n\n===Background===\nLarge numbers of Xhosa were displaced across the Keiskamma by Governor Harry Smith, and these refugees supplemented the original inhabitants there, causing overpopulation and hardship. Those Xhosa who remained in the colony were moved to towns and encouraged to adopt European  legend\n\nHarry Smith also attacked and annexed the independent [[Orange Free State]], hanging the Boer resistance leaders, and in the process alienating the Burghers of the Cape Colony. To cover the mounting expenses he then imposed exorbitant taxes on the local people of the frontier and cut the Cape's standing forces to less than five thousand men.\n\nIn June 1850 there followed an unusually cold winter, together with an extreme drought. It was at this time that Smith ordered the displacement of large numbers of Xhosa squatters from the Kat River region.\n\nThe Outbreak of War (December 1850)\nGovernor Sir Harry Smith travelled to meet with the prominent chiefs after unrest in the Xhosa nation.  When Sandile refused to attend a meeting outside Fort Cox, Governor Smith deposed him and declared him a fugitive. On 24 December, a British detachment of 650 men under Colonel Mackinnon was ambushed by Xhosa warriors in the Boomah Pass. The party was forced to retreat to Fort White, under heavy fire from the Xhosa, having sustained forty-two casualties. The very next day, during Christmas festivities in towns throughout the border region, apparently friendly Xhosa entered the towns to partake in the festivities. At a given signal though, they fell upon the settlers who had invited them into their homes and killed them. With this attack, the bulk of the Ngqika joined the war.\n\n===Initial Xhosa victories===\nWhile the Governor was still at Fort Cox, the Xhosa forces advanced on the colony, isolating him there.  The Xhosa burned British military villages along the frontier, and captured the post at Line Drift. Meanwhile, the Khoi of the Blinkwater River Valley and Kat River Settlement revolted, under the leadership of a half-Khoi, half-Xhosa chief Hermanus Matroos, and managed to capture [[Fort Armstrong (South Africa)|Fort Armstrong]]. Large numbers of the \"Kaffir Police\" \u2014 a paramilitary police force the British had established to combat cattle theft \u2014 deserted their posts and joined Xhosa war parties. For a while, it appeared that all of the Xhosa and Khoi people of the eastern Cape were taking up arms against the British.\n\nHarry Smith finally fought his way out of Fort Cox with the help of the local Cape Mounted Riflemen, but found that he had alienated most of his local allies. His policies had made enemies of the Burghers and Boer Commandos, the Fengu, and the Khoi, who formed much of the Cape's local defences. Even some of the Cape Mounted Riflemen refused to fight.{{sfn|Abbink|Peires|1989|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}}\n\n===British counter-attack (Jan 1851)===\nAfter  these initial successes, however, the Xhosa experienced a series of setbacks. Xhosa forces were repulsed in separate attacks on Fort White and Fort Hare.  Similarly, on 7 January, Hermanus and his supporters launched an offensive on the town of [[Fort Beaufort]], which was defended by a small detachment of troops and local volunteers.  The attack failed however, and Hermanus was killed. The Cape Government also eventually agreed to levy a force of local gunmen (predominantly Khoi) to hold the frontier, allowing Smith to free some imperial troops for offensive action.{{sfn|Abbink|Bruijn|Walraven|2008|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}}\n\n===British reinforcements===\nBy the end of January, the British were beginning to receive reinforcements from Cape Town and a force under Colonel Mackinnon was able to successfully drive north from King William's Town to resupply the beleaguered garrisons at Fort White, Fort Cox and Fort Hare.  With fresh men and supplies, the British expelled the remainder of Hermanus' rebel forces (now under the command of Willem Uithaalder) from Fort Armstrong and drove them west toward the Amatola Mountains. Over the coming months, increasing numbers of Imperial troops arrived, reinforcing the heavily outnumbered British and allowing Smith to lead sweeps across the frontier country.\n\nIn 1852, [[HMS Birkenhead (1845)|HMS Birkenhead]] was wrecked at [[Gansbaai]] while bringing reinforcements to the war at the request of [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet|Sir Harry Smith]]. As the ship sank, the men (mostly new recruits) stood silently in rank, while the women and children were loaded into the lifeboats. They remained in rank as the ship slipped under and over 300 died.\n\n===Final stages of the conflict===\n[[File:Ambush of British Column - Xhosa wars.jpg|thumb|right|A British column (74th Highlanders) under ambush in the Waterkloof forests.]]\nInsurgents led by Maqoma established themselves in the forested Waterkloof. From this base they managed to plunder surrounding farms and torch the homesteads. Maqoma's stronghold was situated on Mount Misery, a natural fortress on a narrow neck wedged between the Waterkloof and Harry's Kloof. The Waterkloof conflicts lasted two years. Maqoma also led an attack on Fort Fordyce and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of Sir Harry Smith.\n\nIn February 1852, the British Government decided that Sir Harry Smith's inept rule had been responsible for much of the violence, and ordered him replaced by George Cathcart, who took charge in March. For the last 6 months, Cathcart ordered scourings of the countryside for rebels. In February 1853, Sandile and the other chiefs surrendered.\n\nThe 8th frontier war was the most bitter and brutal in the series of Xhosa wars. It lasted over two years and ended in the complete subjugation of the Ciskei Xhosa.<ref name=\"History in Africa: The Memory of Maqoma\">{{cite journal | title=The Memory of Maqoma | author=Stapleton, Timothy J. | journal=History in Africa | year=1993 | volume=20 | pages=321\u2013335 | doi=10.2307/3171978| jstor=3171978 }}</ref>\n\n==Imprisonment==\nMaqoma was twice prisoner at [[Robben Island]].

Amongst the greatest of Xhosa military commanders, he played a major part in the [[Xhosa Wars#Sixth war (1834\u20131836)|Sixth and]] [[Xhosa Wars#Eight war (1850-1853)|Eighth Xhosa Wars]].<ref name=\"Maqoma biography\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/chief-maqoma | title=Chief Maqoma | publisher=South African History Online | accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn on 1798 in the right-hand house of Xhosa chief Ngqika, King of the Rharhabe division of the Xhosa people. Throughout his life, he was opposed to his father's strategy of ceding land to the [[Cape Colony]]; as a result, in 1822, he went back into the Neutral Zone in order to establish his own chiefdom.\n\n==Sixth Xhosa War==\n{{Main|Xhosa Wars#Sixth war (1834-1836)}}\n\n[[File:Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope, ca 1835.png|thumb|right|250px|The Eastern Frontier, ca 1835]]\nThe Sixth War is known as Hintsa's War by the Xhosa. However, [[Hintsa ka Khawuta|Hintsa]] did not instigate the war and, although he gave support to the Xhosa armies which were involved, it was Chief Maqoma who was the primary leader of the Xhosa forces.\n\n===Background===\nOn the Cape's eastern border (now the Keiskamma River) insecurity persisted. Particularly as the Xhosa on the other side of the border were under considerable pressure from forces further east such as the effects of the expanding Zulu Empire. \nAlthough highly unstable, the frontier region was seeing increasing amounts of cultural diversity, with Europeans, Khoikhoi and Xhosa living and trading throughout the frontier region.\n\n===Outbreak===\nLocal Cape responses to the Xhosa cattle raids varied, but in some cases were drastic and violent. On 11 December 1834, a Cape government commando party killed a chief of high rank, incensing the Xhosa: an army of 10,000 men, led by Maqoma, swept across the frontier into the Cape Colony, pillaged and burned the homesteads and killed all who resisted. Among the worst sufferers was a colony of freed Khoikhoi who, in 1829, had been settled in the [[Kat River]] valley by the British authorities.  Refugees from the farms and villages took to the safety of Grahamstown, where women and children found refuge in the church.\n\n===British campaign===\nThe response was swift and multi-faceted. [[Boer commando]]s mobilised under [[Piet Retief]] and inflicted a defeat on the Xhosa in the Winterberg Mountains in the north. Burgher and Khoi commandos also mobilised, and British Imperial troops arrived via Algoa Bay.\n\nThe British governor, [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]] mustered the combined forces under [[Harry Smith (army)|Colonel Sir Harry Smith]], who reached Grahamstown on 6 January 1835, six days after news of the uprising had reached Cape Town. It was from Grahamstown that the retaliatory campaign was launched and directed.\n\nThe campaign inflicted a string of defeats on the Xhosa, such as at Trompetter's Drift on the Fish River, and most of the Xhosa chiefs surrendered. However Maqoma and Tyali (the other major Xhosa leader) retreated to the fastnesses of the [[Amatola Mountains]].\n\n===The treaty===\nBritish governor [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]] believed that [[Hintsa ka Khawuta]], Paramount-Chief of the [[Gcaleka]] Xhosa, commanded authority over all of the Xhosa tribes and therefore held him responsible for the initial attack on the Cape Colony, and for the looted cattle. D'Urban came to the frontier in December 1834, and led a large force across the Kei river to confront Hintsa at his residence and dictate terms to him.\n\nThe terms dictated that all the country from the Cape's prior frontier, the Keiskamma River, as far as the [[Great Kei River]] was annexed as the British \"Queen Adelaide Province\", and its inhabitants declared British subjects. A site for the seat of province's government was selected and named [[King William\u2019s Town]]. The new province was declared to be for the settlement of loyal tribes, rebel tribes who replaced their leadership, and the [[Fengu people|Fengu]] (known to the Europeans as the \"Fingo people\"), who had recently arrived fleeing from the Zulu armies and had been living under Xhosa subjection. Magistrates were appointed to administer the territory in the hope that they would gradually, with the help of missionaries, undermine tribal authority. Hostilities finally died down on 17 September 1836, after having continued for nine months.\n\n==Eighth Xhosa War==\n{{Main|Xhosa Wars#Eighth war (1850-1853)}}\n[[File:CAPE MOUNTED RIFLES IN 8TH FRONTIER WAR.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cape Mounted Riflemen]] charging the enemy at Waterkloof during the 8th Frontier War]]\n\n===Background===\nLarge numbers of Xhosa were displaced across the Keiskamma by Governor Harry Smith, and these refugees supplemented the original inhabitants there, causing overpopulation and hardship. Those Xhosa who remained in the colony were moved to towns and encouraged to adopt European  legend\n\nHarry Smith also attacked and annexed the independent [[Orange Free State]], hanging the Boer resistance leaders, and in the process alienating the Burghers of the Cape Colony. To cover the mounting expenses he then imposed exorbitant taxes on the local people of the frontier and cut the Cape's standing forces to less than five thousand men.\n\nIn June 1850 there followed an unusually cold winter, together with an extreme drought. It was at this time that Smith ordered the displacement of large numbers of Xhosa squatters from the Kat River region.\n\nThe Outbreak of War (December 1850)\nGovernor Sir Harry Smith travelled to meet with the prominent chiefs after unrest in the Xhosa nation.  When Sandile refused to attend a meeting outside Fort Cox, Governor Smith deposed him and declared him a fugitive. On 24 December, a British detachment of 650 men under Colonel Mackinnon was ambushed by Xhosa warriors in the Boomah Pass. The party was forced to retreat to Fort White, under heavy fire from the Xhosa, having sustained forty-two casualties. The very next day, during Christmas festivities in towns throughout the border region, apparently friendly Xhosa entered the towns to partake in the festivities. At a given signal though, they fell upon the settlers who had invited them into their homes and killed them. With this attack, the bulk of the Ngqika joined the war.\n\n===Initial Xhosa victories===\nWhile the Governor was still at Fort Cox, the Xhosa forces advanced on the colony, isolating him there.  The Xhosa burned British military villages along the frontier, and captured the post at Line Drift. Meanwhile, the Khoi of the Blinkwater River Valley and Kat River Settlement revolted, under the leadership of a half-Khoi, half-Xhosa chief Hermanus Matroos, and managed to capture [[Fort Armstrong (South Africa)|Fort Armstrong]]. Large numbers of the \"Kaffir Police\" \u2014 a paramilitary police force the British had established to combat cattle theft \u2014 deserted their posts and joined Xhosa war parties. For a while, it appeared that all of the Xhosa and Khoi people of the eastern Cape were taking up arms against the British.\n\nHarry Smith finally fought his way out of Fort Cox with the help of the local Cape Mounted Riflemen, but found that he had alienated most of his local allies. His policies had made enemies of the Burghers and Boer Commandos, the Fengu, and the Khoi, who formed much of the Cape's local defences. Even some of the Cape Mounted Riflemen refused to fight.{{sfn|Abbink|Peires|1989|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}}\n\n===British counter-attack (Jan 1851)===\nAfter  these initial successes, however, the Xhosa experienced a series of setbacks. Xhosa forces were repulsed in separate attacks on Fort White and Fort Hare.  Similarly, on 7 January, Hermanus and his supporters launched an offensive on the town of [[Fort Beaufort]], which was defended by a small detachment of troops and local volunteers.  The attack failed however, and Hermanus was killed. The Cape Government also eventually agreed to levy a force of local gunmen (predominantly Khoi) to hold the frontier, allowing Smith to free some imperial troops for offensive action.{{sfn|Abbink|Bruijn|Walraven|2008|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}}\n\n===British reinforcements===\nBy the end of January, the British were beginning to receive reinforcements from Cape Town and a force under Colonel Mackinnon was able to successfully drive north from King William's Town to resupply the beleaguered garrisons at Fort White, Fort Cox and Fort Hare.  With fresh men and supplies, the British expelled the remainder of Hermanus' rebel forces (now under the command of Willem Uithaalder) from Fort Armstrong and drove them west toward the Amatola Mountains. Over the coming months, increasing numbers of Imperial troops arrived, reinforcing the heavily outnumbered British and allowing Smith to lead sweeps across the frontier country.\n\nIn 1852, [[HMS Birkenhead (1845)|HMS Birkenhead]] was wrecked at [[Gansbaai]] while bringing reinforcements to the war at the request of [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet|Sir Harry Smith]]. As the ship sank, the men (mostly new recruits) stood silently in rank, while the women and children were loaded into the lifeboats. They remained in rank as the ship slipped under and over 300 died.\n\n===Final stages of the conflict===\n[[File:Ambush of British Column - Xhosa wars.jpg|thumb|right|A British column (74th Highlanders) under ambush in the Waterkloof forests.]]\nInsurgents led by Maqoma established themselves in the forested Waterkloof. From this base they managed to plunder surrounding farms and torch the homesteads. Maqoma's stronghold was situated on Mount Misery, a natural fortress on a narrow neck wedged between the Waterkloof and Harry's Kloof. The Waterkloof conflicts lasted two years. Maqoma also led an attack on Fort Fordyce and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of Sir Harry Smith.\n\nIn February 1852, the British Government decided that Sir Harry Smith's inept rule had been responsible for much of the violence, and ordered him replaced by George Cathcart, who took charge in March. For the last 6 months, Cathcart ordered scourings of the countryside for rebels. In February 1853, Sandile and the other chiefs surrendered.\n\nThe 8th frontier war was the most bitter and brutal in the series of Xhosa wars. It lasted over two years and ended in the complete subjugation of the Ciskei Xhosa.<ref name=\"History in Africa: The Memory of Maqoma\">{{cite journal | title=The Memory of Maqoma | author=Stapleton, Timothy J. | journal=History in Africa | year=1993 | volume=20 | pages=321\u2013335 | doi=10.2307/3171978| jstor=3171978 }}</ref>\n\n==Imprisonment==\nMaqoma was twice prisoner at [[Robben Island]].

Originally, the program also introduced Scouts to the life skills of contacting an adult they hadn't met before, arranging a meeting and then demonstrating their skills, similar to a job or college interview. Increasingly, though, merit badges are earned in a class setting at troop meetings and summer camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Merit_Badge_Days|title=Merit Badge Day - MeritBadgeDotOrg|website=meritbadge.org}}</ref>\nEach merit badge has a pamphlet (booklet) associated with it; the pamphlet contains information on completing the requirements for the badge. Scouts must meet up with their Scoutss to receive a signed blue card in order to begin working on a merit badge. The Scout then contacts an adult who is registered as a counselor for that merit badge in order to learn which badge requirements they must complete before meeting. Once these requirements are completed, the Scout meets with the counselor to demonstrate that the Scout has completed the requirements. The counselor then 'signs off' on each requirement. After completing the merit badge, the Scout can then receive a merit badge patch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/meritbadges.asp|title=USSSP: Merit Badges|website=www.usscouts.org}}</ref>\n\nThe award of a merit badge is represented by a circular patch with an image representing the badge's topic. The patches for the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle]]-required merit badges are distinguishable by the silver ring on the outside edge. Merit badges are displayed on a [[sash]] which can be worn with the [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout uniform]] on formal occasions. Every year the [[BSA National Council|National Council]] reviews and updates a certain number of merit badges. There are over 100 merit badges (138 as of April 2020).\n\n[[Scouting]] organizations in other countries issue or have issued merit badges, including [[Scouts Canada|Canada]], [[Tanda Kecakapan Khusus|Indonesia]], [[Scout Association of Japan|Japan]], [[Federaci\u00f3n de Escultismo en Espa\u00f1a|Spain]], [[The National Scout Organization of Thailand|Thailand]], and the [[The Scout Association|United Kingdom]].

\u2018\u2019trail drives\u2019\u2019, or ''jamborees'', are events where several troops and counselors meet and focus on teaching merit badges. Larger events are held on college campuses.\n\n==Workbooks==\nInto the 1990s, a number of merit badge counselors developed worksheets as a way for Scouts to document their work. Counselors could teach to a group but still verify each Scout's progress. More recently, worksheets have given way to workbooks with added graph paper, blank maps and diagrams, logs, charts, checklists, links, and other resources as needed. Merit badge workbooks are used by counselors, summer camps, and merit badge colleges.

The patches for these historical merit badges are distinguished by a gold ring on the outside edge. All were based on merit badges that were among the original 57 issued in 1911.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2010/01/historical-merit-badges-help-boy-scouts-celebrate-scoutings-past.html |title=Historical merit badges help Boy Scouts celebrate Scouting\u2019s past |date=January 12, 2010 |work=Scouting |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115072250/http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2010/01/historical-merit-badges-help-boy-scouts-celebrate-scoutings-past.html |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/mb/mb141.asp|title=Historic Signaling Merit Badge|website=www.usscouts.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Discontinued merit badges (Boy Scouts of America)]]\n* [[History of merit badges (Boy Scouts of America)]]\n* [[Original 57 merit badges (Boy Scouts of America)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/32215/mb/library.html |title=Merit Badge Library |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |date=June 2007 |work=Boy Scout Requirements |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200429/http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/32215/mb/library.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/mb/mbbooks.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003032428/http://usscouts.org/mb/mbbooks.html|title=Current Merit Badge Pamphlet and Merit Badge Requirement Revision Dates |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |work=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]] |url-status=dead |archivedate=2000-10-03}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~scouters/mb.html |title=Merit Badges, Past and Present |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |author=Steve Henning |date=July 20, 1999 |work=Henning's Scouters' Pages }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{cite web |title=Introduction to Merit Badges |url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges.aspx |publisher=Boy Scouts of America}}\n* {{cite web |title=MeritBadge.org |url=http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page |access-date=September 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221023715/http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page |archive-date=December 21, 2009 |url-status=dead }}\n* {{cite web |title=Merit Badges |url=http://www.usscouts.org/ |publisher=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]]}}\n* {{cite web |title=IEEE emeritbadges.org |url=http://www.emeritbadges.org/ |publisher=IEEE}}\n* {{cite web |title=Merit Badge reference |url=http://www.trail2eagle.com/ |publisher=Trail To Eagle}}\n* {{dmoz|/Recreation/Scouting/Resources/Badge_Program/Boy_Scouts_of_America/|Badge Program: Boy Scouts of America}}\n* {{dmoz|/Recreation/Scouting/Collectibles/Virtual_Collections/Badges_and_Patches/|Scouting: Collectibles: Virtual Collections: Badges and Patches}}\n\n{{Scoutorg BSA}}\n{{Scouting}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Merit Badge (Boy Scouts Of America)}}\n[[Category: Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America]]\n[[Category: Scouting uniform]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|history regarding merit badge types|History of merit badges (Boy Scouts of America)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2014}}\n{{Infobox WorldScouting\n|name=Merit badges\n|image=Fish and Wildlife Management merit badge, type J front.png\n|caption=Fish and Wildlife Management merit badge\n|type=award\n|owner=[[Boy Scouts of America]]\n|f-date=1910\n|defunct =\n|website =\n}}\n'''Merit Badges''' are awards earned by members of the Boy Scouts of America, based on activities within the area of study by completing a list of periodically updated requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/meritbadges.aspx|title=Merit Badges \u2013 Boy Scouts of America|website=www.scouting.org}}</ref> The purpose of the merit badge program is to allow Scouts to examine subjects to determine if they would like to further pursue them as a career or vocation. Originally, the program also introduced Scouts to the life skills of contacting an adult they hadn't met before, arranging a meeting and then demonstrating their skills, similar to a job or college interview. Increasingly, though, merit badges are earned in a class setting at troop meetings and summer camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Merit_Badge_Days|title=Merit Badge Day - MeritBadgeDotOrg|website=meritbadge.org}}</ref>\nEach merit badge has a pamphlet (booklet) associated with it; the pamphlet contains information on completing the requirements for the badge. Scouts must meet up with their Scoutmasters to receive a signed blue card in order to begin working on a merit badge. The Scout then contacts an adult who is registered as a counselor for that merit badge in order to learn which badge requirements they must complete before meeting. Once these requirements are completed, the Scout meets with the counselor to demonstrate that the Scout has completed the requirements. The counselor then 'signs off' on each requirement. After completing the merit badge, the Scout can then receive a merit badge patch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/meritbadges.asp|title=USSSP: Merit Badges|website=www.usscouts.org}}</ref>\n\nThe award of a merit badge is represented by a circular patch with an image representing the badge's topic. The patches for the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle]]-required merit badges are distinguishable by the silver ring on the outside edge. Merit badges are displayed on a [[sash]] which can be worn with the [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout uniform]] on formal occasions. Every year the [[BSA National Council|National Council]] reviews and updates a certain number of merit badges. There are over 100 merit badges (138 as of April 2020).\n\n[[Scouting]] organizations in other countries issue or have issued merit badges, including [[Scouts Canada|Canada]], [[Tanda Kecakapan Khusus|Indonesia]], [[Scout Association of Japan|Japan]], [[Federaci\u00f3n de Escultismo en Espa\u00f1a|Spain]], [[The National Scout Organization of Thailand|Thailand]], and the [[The Scout Association|United Kingdom]].

\u2018\u2019trail drives\u2019\u2019, or ''jamborees'', are events where several troops and counselors meet and focus on teaching merit badges. Larger events are held on college campuses.\n\n==Workbooks==\nInto the 1990s, a number of merit badge counselors developed worksheets as a way for Scouts to document their work. Counselors could teach to a group but still verify each Scout's progress. More recently, worksheets have given way to workbooks with added graph paper, blank maps and diagrams, logs, charts, checklists, links, and other resources as needed. Merit badge workbooks are used by counselors, summer camps, and merit badge colleges. Workbooks have also been developed for [[Ranks in Scouts BSA|ranks]], [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]] belt loops, and [[Webelos]] activity pins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/mb/mbindex.asp|title=Merit Badge Requirements|website=www.usscouts.org}}</ref>\n\n==Historical program==\nOffered only in 2010, The Historical Merit Badge program, part of the [[Boy Scouts of America centennial]], allowed Scouts to earn the discontinued Carpentry, Pathfinding, Signalling, and Tracking (originally called Stalking) merit badges. The patches for these historical merit badges are distinguished by a gold ring on the outside edge. All were based on merit badges that were among the original 57 issued in 1911.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2010/01/historical-merit-badges-help-boy-scouts-celebrate-scoutings-past.html |title=Historical merit badges help Boy Scouts celebrate Scouting\u2019s past |date=January 12, 2010 |work=Scouting |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115072250/http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2010/01/historical-merit-badges-help-boy-scouts-celebrate-scoutings-past.html |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/mb/mb141.asp|title=Historic Signaling Merit Badge|website=www.usscouts.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Discontinued merit badges (Boy Scouts of America)]]\n* [[History of merit badges (Boy Scouts of America)]]\n* [[Original 57 merit badges (Boy Scouts of America)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/32215/mb/library.html |title=Merit Badge Library |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |date=June 2007 |work=Boy Scout Requirements |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200429/http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/32215/mb/library.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/mb/mbbooks.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003032428/http://usscouts.org/mb/mbbooks.html|title=Current Merit Badge Pamphlet and Merit Badge Requirement Revision Dates |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |work=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]] |url-status=dead |archivedate=2000-10-03}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~scouters/mb.html |title=Merit Badges, Past and Present |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |author=Steve Henning |date=July 20, 1999 |work=Henning's Scouters' Pages }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{cite web |title=Introduction to Merit Badges |url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges.aspx |publisher=Boy Scouts of America}}\n* {{cite web |title=MeritBadge.org |url=http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page |access-date=September 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221023715/http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page |archive-date=December 21, 2009 |url-status=dead }}\n* {{cite web |title=Merit Badges |url=http://www.usscouts.org/ |publisher=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]]}}\n* {{cite web |title=IEEE emeritbadges.org |url=http://www.emeritbadges.org/ |publisher=IEEE}}\n* {{cite web |title=Merit Badge reference |url=http://www.trail2eagle.com/ |publisher=Trail To Eagle}}\n* {{dmoz|/Recreation/Scouting/Resources/Badge_Program/Boy_Scouts_of_America/|Badge Program: Boy Scouts of America}}\n* {{dmoz|/Recreation/Scouting/Collectibles/Virtual_Collections/Badges_and_Patches/|Scouting: Collectibles: Virtual Collections: Badges and Patches}}\n\n{{Scoutorg BSA}}\n{{Scouting}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Merit Badge (Boy Scouts Of America)}}\n[[Category: Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America]]\n[[Category: Scouting uniform]]\n", "name_user": "2600:6c40:5c00:3183:b1fb:3d56:a036:148f", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merit_badge_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)"}
