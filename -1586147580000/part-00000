At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. The current champion is [[Charlotte Flair]], who is in her record-tying second reign.\n\nIntroduced on April 5, 2013, the title was established as the women's championship for NXT, which at the time was a [[Farm team|developmental territory]] for WWE. The inaugural champion was [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Over the years, NXT grew to become WWE's third major brand, which became official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the [[USA Network]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Paige as NXT Women's Champion WrestleMania Axxess 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural NXT Women's Champion [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], shown here with the original championship belt design]]\nIn June 2012, the [[WWE]] established [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] as their [[Farm team|developmental territory]], replacing [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW). The following year on April 5, the NXT Women's Championship was introduced during [[WrestleMania Axxess]]. On the May 30 tapings of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] June 5), WWE's [[Chief Brand Officer]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that there would be an eight-woman [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[Professional wrestling tournament|tournament]], featuring four women from NXT and four from WWE's main roster competing to be crowned the first NXT Women's Champion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=WWE NEWS: McMahon's Friday tweet - anti-smoking, Stephanie introduces NXT Women's Title (w/Pic), Cena check-in, Ross new blog, Dupree wins title|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_70982.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Namako|first=Jason|title=WWE NXT Results - 5/30/13 (#1 Contender Battle Royal)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/41777-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-13-1-contender-battle-royal|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Justin|title=James's WWE NXT results 5/29 & 6/5: Wyatts defend Tag Titles, NXT Women's Title introduced, #1 contender battle royal, Parade of released NXT wrestlers in matches|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_71102.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> During the June 20 tapings of ''NXT'' (aired July 24), [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]] defeated [[Emma (wrestler)|Emma]] in the tournament final to become the inaugural champion.<ref name=FirstChamp/>\n\nPaige successfully defended her title at [[NXT Arrival|Arrival]] against Emma, however, then-NXT [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Manager (GM) 4|General Manager]] [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] stripped Paige of the title on the April 24, 2014 episode of ''NXT'', as Paige had recently won the [[WWE Divas Championship]], and was in turn promoted to WWE's main roster. A new tournament began the following week. The finals occurred at [[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] where [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] defeated [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship. On the September 16, 2015 episode of ''NXT'', now NXT General Manager [[William Regal]] announced that [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] would defend her title against [[Sasha Banks]] in the [[main event]] at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect|TakeOver: Respect]] on October 7 in the first ever 30-minute [[Iron Man match|Iron Woman match]] in WWE history.<ref name=\"NXTSeptember16\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_87531.shtml|title=James's WWE NXT report 9/16 - Week 180: Bayley returns to Full Sail as Women's champ, big set-up for \"Takeover,\" Dusty Tag Classic continues, Adam Rose dumps on NXT, more; Overall Reax|author=James, Justin|website=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> At the event, Bayley defeated Banks to retain the championship, scoring the win with 3 falls to 2.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melok|first1=Bobby|title=NXT Women's Champion Bayley vs. Sasha Banks (30-Minute WWE Iron Man Match)|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-2015-10-07/bayley-sasha-banks-nxt-womens-title-iron-man-match-27942052|publisher=WWE|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=97087&p=3|title=WWE NXT TakeOver Respect report: Sasha Banks and Bayley go 30 minutes, the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic winners crowned, Asuka makes her NXT in ring debut (poor Dana), and more|author=Trionfo, Richard|website=PWInsider|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough NXT had been established as WWE's developmental territory, over the years it grew to establish itself as WWE's third major brand.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

The following is a list of notable characters from the series of books.\n\n==Main characters==\n[[File:Vladislav as Geralt from Witcher 3 at Igromir 2013.jpg|thumb|Geralt cosplay]]\n===Geralt of Rivia===\n{{Main article|Geralt of Rivia}}\nGeralt of Rivia (Polish: Geralt z Rivii), known also as ''Gwynnbleid'' (Old Speech: \"White Wolf\", given to him by the Dryads) or the \"Butcher of Blaviken\", is a witcher and the protagonist of the ''Witcher'' series and its adaptations. He has been described as a character embodifying \"the neo-liberal anti-politics\" spirit of the Polish popular culture of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Apor2008\">{{cite book|author=P\u00e9ter Apor|title=Past for the eyes: East European representations of communism in cinema and museums after 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO8LAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-05-0|page=198}}</ref>\n\nHe is linked to Ciri by destiny, this being the central plot of the saga.\n\n===Ciri of Cintra===\n[[File:Ciri Cosplay (The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt).jpg|thumb|Ciri cosplay]]\nCirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, known as Ciri, the Lion Cub of Cintra, Zireael and the Lady of Time and Space, is one of the main characters of the Witcher saga. She is the princess of Cintra, daughter of Pavetta and Duny (also known as the Urcheon of Erlenwald) and granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. She is also Geralt's destiny and Geralt's and Yennefer's adopted daughter, around whom much of the plot is centered. Ciri is a descendant of Lara Dorren and has the Elder blood which gives her access to powers that allow her to cross space and time. Ciri has ashen grey hair and green emerald eyes, a trait that runs in her family. \n\nCiri was trained under the watchful eyes of Geralt, Co\u00ebn, Vesemir, Lambert, Eskel, and Triss while at Kaer Morhen and became talented with a sword. Later, she ended up training as a sorceress while living with Yennefer at Ellander. After the Thanedd coup, Ciri became separated from Geralt and Yennefer, created an unstable portal, and by going through it found herself in the Korath desert.  After her time in the desert, she ended up joining a gang called the Rats, but then got herself captured by a bounty hunter by the name of Leo Bonhart and was forced to fight in an arena. She later escaped and fled to the world of Aen Elle. During her time with the Aen Elle, she was going to be forced to procreate with the King, although in the end she was able to avoid this. She later escaped from that world and after traveling through time, she was finally reunited with Geralt and Yen. She travelled with them for a few months before their untimely deaths. Her last sword named Zireael was a 200 years old gwyhyr, a very expensive and precious sword regarded as the best in the world, forged by the gnomes of Tir Tochair. It was given to her as a gift by Esterhazy, the armorer and swordsmith in the town of Fano.\n\nAt the end of the books, Ciri finds herself in the world of Camelot after Geralt and Yennefer's deaths, and meets young Galahad, a King Arthur's knight, with whom she falls in love.\n\n===Yennefer of Vengerberg===\n[[File:Yennefer of Vengerberg (by KATRIONA).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yennefer]]\nSorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg (nicknamed Yen or Yenna) ({{lang-pl|Yennefer z Vengerbergu}}) first appeared in the collection of short stories, ''[[The Last Wish (book)|The Last Wish]]'', featuring in both \"[[The Last Wish (book)#The Last Wish|The Last Wish]]\" short story and \"[[The Last Wish (book)#The Voice of Reason|The Voice of Reason]]\" [[frame story]]. She went on to appear in numerous other ''Witcher'' stories and is one of the main characters of the ''Witcher'' saga.<ref>[http://www.fantasy-fan.org/index.php/News/2009/02/01/Yennefer/ Yennefer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429103024/http://www.fantasy-fan.org/index.php/News/2009/02/01/Yennefer |date=2012-04-29 }} info on [http://www.fantasy-fan.org Fantasy Fan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131210234/http://fantasy-fan.org/ |date=2009-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nYennefer is described as possessive. She becomes one of Geralt's lovers although their relationship is difficult and full of drama. Both Geralt and Yennefer are sterile, which adds another level of tragedy to the mix. Yennefer has a hard time accepting the fact and tries various methods of restoring her fertility. Yennefer ends up becoming a mother to Ciri while teaching her and watching over her while she was at Ellander.\n\nYennefer was born on Belleteyn of the year 1173. She lived in the capital city of Aedirn, Vengerberg. She is one of the most powerful mages on the continent and is surpassed by only a handful. She is the youngest member of the Council of Sorcerers and later she became a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. During the Battle of Sodden Hill she was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was magically restored.\n\nYennefer was famous for her beauty, even though during the events of ''[[The Swallow's Tower]]'', she was 94 years old. She always dressed in black and white clothing. She used lilac and gooseberry perfumes. She had violet eyes and raven black hair.  Before becoming a sorceress, she was a hunchback, but had her deformities fixed by Tissaia de Vries while being an apprentice although Geralt is able to see the subtle clues that let him figure out the truth.\n\nAt the end of the books, Yennefer ends up dying while trying to heal Geralt, after losing all her energy.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n[[File:Kristina as Triss from Witcher 3 at Igromir 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Triss cosplay]]\n===Triss Merigold===\nTriss Merigold of Maribor, a sorceress and a friend of Geralt and Yennefer. She took care of Ciri for some time and is like an older sister to her. She was member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Triss is in love with Geralt.\n\nThe image of Triss Merigold from ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]'' appeared as [[cover girl]] in the Polish edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unfinishedman.com/the-witcher-2-triss-merigold-polish-playboy-may-2011/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114060401/https://www.unfinishedman.com/the-witcher-2-triss-merigold-polish-playboy-may-2011/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 14, 2019|title=The Witcher 2 \u2013 Triss Merigold: Polish Playboy May 2011|publisher=Unfinished Man|accessdate=January 3, 2020}}</ref> She also appeared in a live model calendar for the game in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5798977/russian-witcher-2-calendar-bares-all-in-the-name-of-marketing|title=Russian Witcher 2 Calendar Bares All in the Name of Marketing|publisher= Kotaku|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> \n\n===Dandelion (Jaskier)===\nJulian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, commonly known as Dandelion (Polish:  ''Jaskier'') is a poet, minstrel, bard, and Geralt's best friend. The Polish word ''jaskier'' actually refers to the Buttercup flower ([[Ranunculus]]). Some of his more famous ballads were about the relationship between Geralt and Yennefer. By the time of the saga he was already in his 40s though it was said that he looked like he was in his 30s and was often mistaken for an elf. He accompanies Geralt in many of the short stories and ends up joining his hansa while searching for Ciri but left it before the assault on Stygga and makes Geralt to promise he would return with Ciri at Touissant where Dandelion lives. He would later rejoin Geralt and witness his and Yennefer's death at Rivia. \n\n===King Foltest===\nKing Foltest is the king of Temeria, and involved in an incestuous affair with his own sister that produced a daughter, although both the mother and child die in childbirth. They are buried in the family crypt beneath the family castle. However, 5 years later the situation and magic of the fantasy setting cause the daughter to become an undead beast called a Striga that kills villagers and forces the royal family of Temeria to abandon their castle and let it fall in ruins. King Foltest forbids anyone to destroy the Striga and eventually hires Geralt to lift the curse of the daughter he dearly loves. Geralt is successful, and the girl returns to life as a 15 year old, but uneducated and must be taught to speak and behave as a person.\n\n===Milva===\nMaria Barring (known as Milva) is a talented female archer who was one of the few non dryads who was tolerated in Brokilon. After guiding the remains of the beaten Scoia'tael commandos during the second war she joined Geralt's quest to find Ciri. She would later reveal herself to be pregnant and would struggle between choosing an abortion or keeping the child. In the end she would later miscarry after getting wounded during the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga. During the hansa's stay at Toussaint she struck up a relationship with a baron. She would later perish providing cover fire for the rest of the hansa during the assault on Stygga.\n\n===Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach===\nCahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach (known as Cahir) was an intelligence officer in the Nilfgaardian army who would later join Geralt's hansa. Cahir was from Vicovaro and had five siblings and would end up falling in love with Ciri after he saved her during the attack on Cintra. However, Cahir was supposed to capture Ciri and bring her back to Emhyr, but she fled and he was forced to come back empty handed which lead him to getting thrown in prison. He would later get another chance to redeem himself during the coup at Thanedd but would once again fail. He would later end up joining the hansa as he wanted to protect and save Ciri. Due to him being a Nilfgaardian and more specifically the black knight who haunted Ciri's dreams, Geralt would have a hard time trusting him, but this would later change. Cahir ended up perishing in a duel against Leo Bonhart during the assault on Stygga in an attempt to buy some time for Ciri and Angoul\u00eame.\n\n===Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy===\nEmiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy (known as Regis) was a higher [[vampire]] and a member of Geralt's hansa and was well over 400 years old by the time of the books. Regis would later join the party after rescuing Geralt and Dandelion. However, due to him being a vampire Geralt was reluctant to let him join though the rest of the members had an easier time with it. Regis was often fond of telling others how wrong they were about their knowledge of vampires and would enjoy having intellectual conversations with the other members of the group. Unlike other vampires Regis did not drink blood due to him becoming addicted to it at one point when he was younger. During the hansa's stay at Toussaint he developed a relationship with a succubus. Regis was very resistant to both physical damage and temperature and could regenerate even if cut into pieces. Unfortunately for him, it did not help him during fight with Vilgefortz who melted him into a column with a powerful spell. \n\n===Angoul\u00eame===\nAngoul\u00eame was a fair hair girl who resembled Ciri. She was from a rich Cintran family but would later renounce her family and join a gang called the Nightingales. She would later end up joining Geralt's hansa after getting captured and becoming a crown witness in the investigation of the Nightingales. Geralt would later demand her release if he was to kill the Nightingales and because of this she would end up joining his hansa in return for what he did for her. Angoul\u00eame was quite fond of swearing and dreamed of opening up a bordello. Angoul\u00eame would later perish during the assault on Stygga. She died from blood loss from a wound she received while protecting Ciri.\n\n===Philippa Eilhart===\nPhilippa Eilhart was King's Vizimir's advisor and remained in Redania's court after his assassination which was something that she herself arranged. Philippa was a very powerful sorceress and was one of the few to have the ability to polymorph. She was a close ally to Dijkstra and would occasional sleep with him even though she was a [[lesbian]]. She was a member of the Chapter on the Conclave and was the leader of the Thanedd coup and the founder of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Philippa would arrange the coup in an attempt to get rid of the pro Nilfgaardian mages and strike first; however, her plans would backfire as the conclave would end up collapsing leaving the North weakened. Philippa along with the rest of the Lodge (besides Yennefer) attempted to use Ciri as a political tool in an attempt to create a state run by mages, however, in the end her plans failed. After the events at Rivia, Philippa would end up dying during a witch hunt and would later end up becoming known as Saint Philippa.\n\n===Dijkstra===\nDijkstra was the spymaster in Vizimir's court. He considered himself to be close friends with Philippa and was in love with her. Dijkstra would later help Philippa in the coup at Thanedd but became crippled after Geralt would snap his leg. Dijkstra was considered to be a tall man and didn't look like a typical spymaster. He would later end up becoming one of the key reasons why the North won the second war against Nilfgaard as he managed to secure aid from Kovir which allowed him to get mercenaries and supplies for the Northern armies, however, due to being a commoner and not a noble the leaders of the North would look down upon him. At the end of the novels he was forced to flee Redania and the North after Philippa tried to have him killed when she thought that he was getting close to finding out what happen to Vizimir.\n\n===Vilgefortz===\nVilgefortz was a member of the Chapter of the Conclave and was a very powerful sorcerer. Along with being one of the most powerful mages in the world of the ''Witcher'', he also happened to be one of the greatest fighters and displayed his skills when he beat and crippled Geralt in a duel at Thanedd. Vilgefortz was not a typical mage as he didn't decide to become one until he was already well into an adulthood and was already an experienced mercenary. Also unlike the majority of sorcerers who tended to freeze their ages when they were older so they look distinguished he happened to look like a man in his 30s and was quite handsome. He also happen to be one of the rare offspring of a mage as most of them are sterile. During the first war with Nilfgaard Vilgefortz proved to be crucial for the North winning as he led the mages during the battle of Sodden hill. He along with his fellow mages were considered heroes in the North, but he would later end up switching sides and working with Emhyr in an attempt to get his hands on Ciri so he could have the elder blood from the child he planned to put in her. Vilgefortz was later killed during the assault on Stygga at the hands of Geralt though it was no easy task as he seriously wounded Yen and Geralt and (literally) melted Regis.\n\n===Leo Bonhart===\nLeo was one of the  most famous bounty hunters on the continent during the events of the books. He was nearly seven feet tall  though he was described as being ghoulish and had fish like eyes. He was an incredibly dangerous sword fighter and he easily  defeated the gang of Rats and also claimed to have killed three Witchers and had their medallions as proof, though Yennefer questioned if he actually defeated them in a sword duel or if he killed them through other means. Leo was hired by Steffan Skellan to kill Ciri though he ended up capturing her and would use her as a pit fighter. Ciri would later escape him  and he would unsuccessfully give chase. He joined an alliance with Vilgefortz and Steffan Skellan and would later end up killing Cahir during the assault on Stygga, but he himself was later killed in a duel against Ciri.\n\n===Eredin (King of the Wild Hunt)===\nEredin is a figure that leads a horde of ghastly riders across the sky. In ''The Swallow's Tower'', he and Avallac'h lure Ciri to the tower, which led to her imprisonment in the world belonging to Aen Elle. There, the duo tried to force her to beget a child with the king of the Aen Elle elves to harness her powers. Eredin ruined the plan by killing the king. Ciri managed to escape with the help of unicorns, but not before learning that elves have massacred humans on the Aen Elle world.\n\n===Mousesack ===\nMousesack (Myszow\u00f3r in Polish, Ermion in ''[[The Witcher 3]]'' video game) is a [[druid]] from Skellige Islands and a good friend of Geralt. He helps raise Ciri before the Slaughter of Cintra.\n\n=== Queen Calanthe ===\nCalanthe is the queen of Cintra and a grandmother of Ciri. She dies during the Slaughter of Cintra.\n\n==Adaptations cast==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n* A dark grey cell indicates that the character did not appear or that the character's presence has yet to be announced.\n* A {{note label|young|Y|}} indicates a role as a younger version of character portrayed by another actor.\n* A {{note label|uncredited|U|}} indicates an uncredited role.\n* A {{note label|photo|P|}} indicates a photographic role.\n* A {{note label|cameo|C|}} indicates a cameo role.\n* A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a voice-only role.\n* An {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates an appearance through archival footage or stills.\n* An {{note label|main|M|}} indicates the actor was part of the main cast for the season.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%\"\n!

The following is a list of notable characters from the series of books.\n\n==Main characters==\n[[File:Vladislav as Geralt from Witcher 3 at Igromir 2013.jpg|thumb|Geralt cosplay]]\n===Geralt of Rivia===\n{{Main article|Geralt of Rivia}}\nGeralt of Rivia (Polish: Geralt z Rivii), known also as ''Gwynnbleid'' (Old Speech: \"White Wolf\", given to him by the Dryads) or the \"Butcher of Blaviken\", is a witcher and the protagonist of the ''Witcher'' series and its adaptations. He has been described as a character embodifying \"the neo-liberal anti-politics\" spirit of the Polish popular culture of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Apor2008\">{{cite book|author=P\u00e9ter Apor|title=Past for the eyes: East European representations of communism in cinema and museums after 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO8LAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-05-0|page=198}}</ref>\n\nHe is linked to Ciri by destiny, this being the central plot of the saga.\n\n===Ciri of Cintra===\n[[File:Ciri Cosplay (The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt).jpg|thumb|Ciri cosplay]]\nCirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, known as Ciri, the Lion Cub of Cintra, Zireael and the Lady of Time and Space, is one of the main characters of the Witcher saga. She is the princess of Cintra, daughter of Pavetta and Duny (also known as the Urcheon of Erlenwald) and granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. She is also Geralt's destiny and Geralt's and Yennefer's adopted daughter, around whom much of the plot is centered. Ciri is a descendant of Lara Dorren and has the Elder blood which gives her access to powers that allow her to cross space and time. Ciri has ashen grey hair and green emerald eyes, a trait that runs in her family. \n\nCiri was trained under the watchful eyes of Geralt, Co\u00ebn, Vesemir, Lambert, Eskel, and Triss while at Kaer Morhen and became talented with a sword. Later, she ended up training as a sorceress while living with Yennefer at Ellander. After the Thanedd coup, Ciri became separated from Geralt and Yennefer, created an unstable portal, and by going through it found herself in the Korath desert.  After her time in the desert, she ended up joining a gang called the Rats, but then got herself captured by a bounty hunter by the name of Leo Bonhart and was forced to fight in an arena. She later escaped and fled to the world of Aen Elle. During her time with the Aen Elle, she was going to be forced to procreate with the King, although in the end she was able to avoid this. She later escaped from that world and after traveling through time, she was finally reunited with Geralt and Yen. She travelled with them for a few months before their untimely deaths. Her last sword named Zireael was a 200 years old gwyhyr, a very expensive and precious sword regarded as the best in the world, forged by the gnomes of Tir Tochair. It was given to her as a gift by Esterhazy, the armorer and swordsmith in the town of Fano.\n\nAt the end of the books, Ciri finds herself in the world of Camelot after Geralt and Yennefer's deaths, and meets young Galahad, a King Arthur's knight, with whom she falls in love.\n\n===Yennefer of Vengerberg===\n[[File:Yennefer of Vengerberg (by KATRIONA).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yennefer]]\nSorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg (nicknamed Yen or Yenna) ({{lang-pl|Yennefer z Vengerbergu}}) first appeared in the collection of short stories, ''[[The Last Wish (book)|The Last Wish]]'', featuring in both \"[[The Last Wish (book)#The Last Wish|The Last Wish]]\" short story and \"[[The Last Wish (book)#The Voice of Reason|The Voice of Reason]]\" [[frame story]]. She went on to appear in numerous other ''Witcher'' stories and is one of the main characters of the ''Witcher'' saga.<ref>[http://www.fantasy-fan.org/index.php/News/2009/02/01/Yennefer/ Yennefer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429103024/http://www.fantasy-fan.org/index.php/News/2009/02/01/Yennefer |date=2012-04-29 }} info on [http://www.fantasy-fan.org Fantasy Fan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131210234/http://fantasy-fan.org/ |date=2009-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nYennefer is described as possessive. She becomes one of Geralt's lovers although their relationship is difficult and full of drama. Both Geralt and Yennefer are sterile, which adds another level of tragedy to the mix. Yennefer has a hard time accepting the fact and tries various methods of restoring her fertility. Yennefer ends up becoming a mother to Ciri while teaching her and watching over her while she was at Ellander.\n\nYennefer was born on Belleteyn of the year 1173. She lived in the capital city of Aedirn, Vengerberg. She is one of the most powerful mages on the continent and is surpassed by only a handful. She is the youngest member of the Council of Sorcerers and later she became a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. During the Battle of Sodden Hill she was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was magically restored.\n\nYennefer was famous for her beauty, even though during the events of ''[[The Swallow's Tower]]'', she was 94 years old. She always dressed in black and white clothing. She used lilac and gooseberry perfumes. She had violet eyes and raven black hair.  Before becoming a sorceress, she was a hunchback, but had her deformities fixed by Tissaia de Vries while being an apprentice although Geralt is able to see the subtle clues that let him figure out the truth.\n\nAt the end of the books, Yennefer ends up dying while trying to heal Geralt, after losing all her energy.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n[[File:Kristina as Triss from Witcher 3 at Igromir 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Triss cosplay]]\n===Triss Merigold===\nTriss Merigold of Maribor, a sorceress and a friend of Geralt and Yennefer. She took care of Ciri for some time and is like an older sister to her. She was member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Triss is in love with Geralt.\n\nThe image of Triss Merigold from ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]'' appeared as [[cover girl]] in the Polish edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unfinishedman.com/the-witcher-2-triss-merigold-polish-playboy-may-2011/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114060401/https://www.unfinishedman.com/the-witcher-2-triss-merigold-polish-playboy-may-2011/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 14, 2019|title=The Witcher 2 \u2013 Triss Merigold: Polish Playboy May 2011|publisher=Unfinished Man|accessdate=January 3, 2020}}</ref> She also appeared in a live model calendar for the game in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5798977/russian-witcher-2-calendar-bares-all-in-the-name-of-marketing|title=Russian Witcher 2 Calendar Bares All in the Name of Marketing|publisher= Kotaku|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> \n\n===Dandelion (Jaskier)===\nJulian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, commonly known as Dandelion (Polish:  ''Jaskier'') is a poet, minstrel, bard, and Geralt's best friend. The Polish word ''jaskier'' actually refers to the Buttercup flower ([[Ranunculus]]). Some of his more famous ballads were about the relationship between Geralt and Yennefer. By the time of the saga he was already in his 40s though it was said that he looked like he was in his 30s and was often mistaken for an elf. He accompanies Geralt in many of the short stories and ends up joining his hansa while searching for Ciri but left it before the assault on Stygga and makes Geralt to promise he would return with Ciri at Touissant where Dandelion lives. He would later rejoin Geralt and witness his and Yennefer's death at Rivia. \n\n===King Foltest===\nKing Foltest is the king of Temeria, and involved in an incestuous affair with his own sister that produced a daughter, although both the mother and child die in childbirth. They are buried in the family crypt beneath the family castle. However, 5 years later the situation and magic of the fantasy setting cause the daughter to become an undead beast called a Striga that kills villagers and forces the royal family of Temeria to abandon their castle and let it fall in ruins. King Foltest forbids anyone to destroy the Striga and eventually hires Geralt to lift the curse of the daughter he dearly loves. Geralt is successful, and the girl returns to life as a 15 year old, but uneducated and must be taught to speak and behave as a person.\n\n===Milva===\nMaria Barring (known as Milva) is a talented female archer who was one of the few non dryads who was tolerated in Brokilon. After guiding the remains of the beaten Scoia'tael commandos during the second war she joined Geralt's quest to find Ciri. She would later reveal herself to be pregnant and would struggle between choosing an abortion or keeping the child. In the end she would later miscarry after getting wounded during the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga. During the hansa's stay at Toussaint she struck up a relationship with a baron. She would later perish providing cover fire for the rest of the hansa during the assault on Stygga.\n\n===Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach===\nCahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach (known as Cahir) was an intelligence officer in the Nilfgaardian army who would later join Geralt's hansa. Cahir was from Vicovaro and had five siblings and would end up falling in love with Ciri after he saved her during the attack on Cintra. However, Cahir was supposed to capture Ciri and bring her back to Emhyr, but she fled and he was forced to come back empty handed which lead him to getting thrown in prison. He would later get another chance to redeem himself during the coup at Thanedd but would once again fail. He would later end up joining the hansa as he wanted to protect and save Ciri. Due to him being a Nilfgaardian and more specifically the black knight who haunted Ciri's dreams, Geralt would have a hard time trusting him, but this would later change. Cahir ended up perishing in a duel against Leo Bonhart during the assault on Stygga in an attempt to buy some time for Ciri and Angoul\u00eame.\n\n===Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy===\nEmiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy (known as Regis) was a higher [[vampire]] and a member of Geralt's hansa and was well over 400 years old by the time of the books. Regis would later join the party after rescuing Geralt and Dandelion. However, due to him being a vampire Geralt was reluctant to let him join though the rest of the members had an easier time with it. Regis was often fond of telling others how wrong they were about their knowledge of vampires and would enjoy having intellectual conversations with the other members of the group. Unlike other vampires Regis did not drink blood due to him becoming addicted to it at one point when he was younger. During the hansa's stay at Toussaint he developed a relationship with a succubus. Regis was very resistant to both physical damage and temperature and could regenerate even if cut into pieces. Unfortunately for him, it did not help him during fight with Vilgefortz who melted him into a column with a powerful spell. \n\n===Angoul\u00eame===\nAngoul\u00eame was a fair hair girl who resembled Ciri. She was from a rich Cintran family but would later renounce her family and join a gang called the Nightingales. She would later end up joining Geralt's hansa after getting captured and becoming a crown witness in the investigation of the Nightingales. Geralt would later demand her release if he was to kill the Nightingales and because of this she would end up joining his hansa in return for what he did for her. Angoul\u00eame was quite fond of swearing and dreamed of opening up a bordello. Angoul\u00eame would later perish during the assault on Stygga. She died from blood loss from a wound she received while protecting Ciri.\n\n===Philippa Eilhart===\nPhilippa Eilhart was King's Vizimir's advisor and remained in Redania's court after his assassination which was something that she herself arranged. Philippa was a very powerful sorceress and was one of the few to have the ability to polymorph. She was a close ally to Dijkstra and would occasional sleep with him even though she was a [[lesbian]]. She was a member of the Chapter on the Conclave and was the leader of the Thanedd coup and the founder of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Philippa would arrange the coup in an attempt to get rid of the pro Nilfgaardian mages and strike first; however, her plans would backfire as the conclave would end up collapsing leaving the North weakened. Philippa along with the rest of the Lodge (besides Yennefer) attempted to use Ciri as a political tool in an attempt to create a state run by mages, however, in the end her plans failed. After the events at Rivia, Philippa would end up dying during a witch hunt and would later end up becoming known as Saint Philippa.\n\n===Dijkstra===\nDijkstra was the spymaster in Vizimir's court. He considered himself to be close friends with Philippa and was in love with her. Dijkstra would later help Philippa in the coup at Thanedd but became crippled after Geralt would snap his leg. Dijkstra was considered to be a tall man and didn't look like a typical spymaster. He would later end up becoming one of the key reasons why the North won the second war against Nilfgaard as he managed to secure aid from Kovir which allowed him to get mercenaries and supplies for the Northern armies, however, due to being a commoner and not a noble the leaders of the North would look down upon him. At the end of the novels he was forced to flee Redania and the North after Philippa tried to have him killed when she thought that he was getting close to finding out what happen to Vizimir.\n\n===Vilgefortz===\nVilgefortz was a member of the Chapter of the Conclave and was a very powerful sorcerer. Along with being one of the most powerful mages in the world of the ''Witcher'', he also happened to be one of the greatest fighters and displayed his skills when he beat and crippled Geralt in a duel at Thanedd. Vilgefortz was not a typical mage as he didn't decide to become one until he was already well into an adulthood and was already an experienced mercenary. Also unlike the majority of sorcerers who tended to freeze their ages when they were older so they look distinguished he happened to look like a man in his 30s and was quite handsome. He also happen to be one of the rare offspring of a mage as most of them are sterile. During the first war with Nilfgaard Vilgefortz proved to be crucial for the North winning as he led the mages during the battle of Sodden hill. He along with his fellow mages were considered heroes in the North, but he would later end up switching sides and working with Emhyr in an attempt to get his hands on Ciri so he could have the elder blood from the child he planned to put in her. Vilgefortz was later killed during the assault on Stygga at the hands of Geralt though it was no easy task as he seriously wounded Yen and Geralt and (literally) melted Regis.\n\n===Leo Bonhart===\nLeo was one of the  most famous bounty hunters on the continent during the events of the books. He was nearly seven feet tall  though he was described as being ghoulish and had fish like eyes. He was an incredibly dangerous sword fighter and he easily  defeated the gang of Rats and also claimed to have killed three Witchers and had their medallions as proof, though Yennefer questioned if he actually defeated them in a sword duel or if he killed them through other means. Leo was hired by Steffan Skellan to kill Ciri though he ended up capturing her and would use her as a pit fighter. Ciri would later escape him  and he would unsuccessfully give chase. He joined an alliance with Vilgefortz and Steffan Skellan and would later end up killing Cahir during the assault on Stygga, but he himself was later killed in a duel against Ciri.\n\n===Eredin (King of the Wild Hunt)===\nEredin is a figure that leads a horde of ghastly riders across the sky. In ''The Swallow's Tower'', he and Avallac'h lure Ciri to the tower, which led to her imprisonment in the world belonging to Aen Elle. There, the duo tried to force her to beget a child with the king of the Aen Elle elves to harness her powers. Eredin ruined the plan by killing the king. Ciri managed to escape with the help of unicorns, but not before learning that elves have massacred humans on the Aen Elle world.\n\n===Mousesack ===\nMousesack (Myszow\u00f3r in Polish, Ermion in ''[[The Witcher 3]]'' video game) is a [[druid]] from Skellige Islands and a good friend of Geralt. He helps raise Ciri before the Slaughter of Cintra.\n\n=== Queen Calanthe ===\nCalanthe is the queen of Cintra and a grandmother of Ciri. She dies during the Slaughter of Cintra.\n\n==Adaptations cast==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n* A dark grey cell indicates that the character did not appear or that the character's presence has yet to be announced.\n* A {{note label|young|Y|}} indicates a role as a younger version of character portrayed by another actor.\n* A {{note label|uncredited|U|}} indicates an uncredited role.\n* A {{note label|photo|P|}} indicates a photographic role.\n* A {{note label|cameo|C|}} indicates a cameo role.\n* A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a voice-only role.\n* An {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates an appearance through archival footage or stills.\n* An {{note label|main|M|}} indicates the actor was part of the main cast for the season.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%\"\n!

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of [[primary producer]]s. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny [[phytoplankton]] which grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of [[primary production]]. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as [[climax forest|mature forests]], grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the [[zooplankton]] that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, zooplankton  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]].

[[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility. This element is found in a number of chemical forms in the seabird fecal material, but the most mobile and bioavailable is [[orthophosphate]], which can be [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by subterranean or superficial waters (5).<ref name=Otero2018 />\n\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 550\n | header            = Estuaries\n | header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n | image1    = Food web of the Venice lagoon.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Example food web from an [[estuary]], the [[Venice Lagoon]], involving 27 nodes or functional groups.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted.

It is sometimes known as \"The First City of Venezuela\", for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located adjacent to shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/venezuela/history.htm|title=Venezuela - An Introduction|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> \n\nEarly indigenous settlements around the area were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Maracaibo\u2019s founding date is disputed. There were failed attempts to found the city\u2014in 1529, by Captain [[Ambrosius Ehinger|Ambrosio Ehinger]], and in 1569, by Captain [[Alonso Pacheco]]. Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain [[Captain Pedro Maldonado]], the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo|title=Maracaibo {{!}} Venezuela|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.\n\nMaracaibo is served by [[La Chinita International Airport]]. The [[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] connects Maracaibo with the rest of the country. The [[La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church (Maracaibo)|La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church]] catholic church within the city.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Maracaibo is said to come from the brave ''[[cacique]]'' (Indian chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them. Legend says that when Mara fell, the Indians shouted \"''Mara kay\u00f3!''\" (Mara fell!), thus originating the city name --although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was \"Maara-iwo\" meaning \"Place where serpents abound\".\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of New Zamora of Maracaibo.svg|thumb|First version of Coat of Arms with royal elements, according to ''Discrezi\u00f3n de la laguna de la ciudad de Maracaibo'' in [[General Archive of the Indies]].|left|200px]]\n\n===Foundation===\nThe first indigenous settlements were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Around the main group were the [[A\u00f1u]] tribe who built rows of [[stilt house]]s all over the northern riviera of the Lake Maracaibo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/maracaibo.htm|title=Error|author=Irama Iglesias|work=efemeridevenezolana}}</ref> The first Europeans arrived in 1499.\n\nThe city was founded three times: the first time was during the [[Klein-Venedig]] period (1528&ndash;1546), when the [[Welser]] bankers of [[Augsburg]] received a concession over [[Venezuela Province]] from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I. of Spain]]. In August 1529, the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] made his first expedition to [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous [[Coquivacoa]]. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg ({{lang-de|Neu-N\u00fcrnberg}}) and the lake after the valiant [[cacique|chieftain]] Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession.<ref>[http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html Das Imperium der Welser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422023929/http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref> The lack of activity in the zone made [[Nikolaus Federmann]] evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to [[Santa Marta]] near the then capital of [[Venezuela Province]], [[Santa Ana de Coro]].\n\nA second attempt by Captain [[Alonso Pacheco]] in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor [[Diego de Mazariegos]]' command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. \"Nueva Zamora\" comes from Mazariego's place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of [[Lake Maracaibo]], the dominant feature of the oil-rich [[Maracaibo Basin]]. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], first become pronounced.\n\n===Pirates' attacks===\nThe Dutch corsair [[Henrik de Gerard]] plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate [[William Jackson (pirate)|William Jackson]]. In 1667, [[l'Olonnais]] with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l'Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[gemstone]]s and more than 260,000 [[pieces of eight]].\n\nIn March 1669, [[Henry Morgan]] sacked Maracaibo, which emptied when his fleet was first spied, and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the ''Magdalena'', the ''San Luis'', and the ''Soledad''. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the ''Soledad'' surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.<ref>''Harry Morgan's Way'', (AlisonPress, 1977), Dudley Pope, {{ISBN|978-1842324820}}</ref><ref>''Caribbean'', James A.Michener, Guild Publishing, 1989, ASIN: B00EFKMICY</ref>\n\nIn June 1678, [[Michel de Grammont]] French commander of six ships and 700 men captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], penetrating as far inland as [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].\n\n=== Venezuelan independence ===\n\nIn 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] and remained loyal to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]]. Maracaibo then held the seat of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\nIn 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], led by [[Francisco Tom\u00e1s Morales]], fought with the patriots, led by [[Rafael Urdaneta]], to take back control over the province in the Juana de \u00c1vila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela's struggle for independence.\n\n=== Isolation period ===\nFor about 390 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation was only possible across the lake by ferry or other marine transport.\n\nCars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product, depended on the ferry system between the city and the eastern shore with their roads to connect to the country's motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region's economy was more linked to [[Colombia]] than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.\n\nThis isolation was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city's location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called ''La Rep\u00fablica Independiente del Zulia'', which means ''The Independent Republic of Zulia'', but this has never come to be.\n\nIn January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente [[Cipriano Castro]], the German warship ''[[SMS Panther]]'' attempted to enter [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the ''[[SMS Vineta]]'', with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, the ''SMS Vineta'' bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.\n\nIn 1908, the ''Friesland'', [[HNLMS Gelderland (1898)|Gelderland]] and [[HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck (1906)|Jacob van Heemskerck]]\nwere sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the ''[[Cipriano Castro|second Castro crisis]]''.

Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general's government had decided that this \"city of independent thought\" should be more \"connected\" to the rest of the country.\n\nProposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez government on 23 January 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more conservative government.\n\nThe building of \"El Puente Sobre El Lago de Maracaibo \"General Rafael Urdaneta\"\u2014([[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] over Lake Maracaibo) named after the distinguished General [[Rafael Urdaneta|hero]] of the War of Independence was opened to public traffic in 1962. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.\n\nThis bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.\n[[File:Maracaibo city skyline july 2007.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|Panoramic view of Maracaibo City.]]\n\n=== Modern times ===\nMaracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: to the north the municipality of Maracaibo and to the south the San Francisco municipality (established in 1995). In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including [[Caracas]]).\n[[File:Ancient office Mene Grande Oil Company.jpg|thumb|right|Former headquarters of the Mene Grande Oil Company]]\nIn the political arena, the citizens of Maracaibo (and most other cities and municipalities in Zulia state) have in recent years voted for a competitive political system in where the governor is from a certain political party and the mayor or mayors are from the opposite political party.\n\nMaracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university. ''[[University of Zulia|La Universidad del Zulia]]'' (LUZ) is well renowned for its excellent law, medical and engineering schools as many other disciplines. Other universities and schools include [[Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] (URBE) and [[Universidad Rafael Urdaneta]], with one of the country's leading psychology schools.\n\nThe Diocese of Maracaibo (23 July 1965) was elevated to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maracaibo|Archdiocese]] on 30 April 1966 by [[Pope Paulus VI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmara.html#hist|title=Maracaibo (Archdiocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|author=David M.

The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:\n\n:''They perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo {{sic}} are covered.''\n\nHe also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:\n\n:''But what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress....They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters.''\n\n==Economy==\nZulia\u00b4s main income comes from oil extraction and refining, agriculture (coffee, rice, maize, cassava, cocoa, sugar cane),\nlivestock production, and mining (clay, limestone, coal and sand{{cn|date=March 2017}}).\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] prevalence worldwide is 5\u201310 cases per 100,000 persons.

In the past, the climate of the city, indeed all along the coast of Lake Maracaibo, was unhealthy due to the combination of high temperatures with high humidity.

Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in [[baseball]] by the [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]], a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the [[Liga Venezolana de B\u00e9isbol Profesional]], and is based in the [[Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande]]. The city's [[basketball]] team is [[Gaiteros del Zulia]], which plays in the [[Liga Profesional de Baloncesto]] de Venezuela. Its home is the 5.000-people ''Pedro El\u00edas Belisario Aponte'' stadium. Other teams include the [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]] and the [[Zulia FC]] in [[Football (soccer)|football]], the [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club]] and the [[Zulianos Rugby Club]].\n\nIn the [[2000 Little League World Series]], the Sierrra Maestra Little League of Maracaibo, Venezuela defeated Bellaire Little League of Bellaire, Texas in the championship game of the 54th Little League World Series.

Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how opposite the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas' leading soft drink brand is [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], while in Maracaibo it is [[Pepsi]]. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).\n\nMarabinos are extremely proud of their city, their culture, and all of Zulia. They usually claim that Venezuela wouldn't be the country it actually is without Zulia. Rivalry with inhabitants of other regions is common, specially with ''Gochos'' (people of the Trujillo, [[M\u00e9rida State|M\u00e9rida]] and T\u00e1chira state) and ''[[Caraque\u00f1o]]s'' (people of the city of [[Caracas]]).\n\nThe Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to [[Joan Corominas]], it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for \"goat\", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the furro instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs.The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s.

It is sometimes known as \"The First City of Venezuela\", for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located adjacent to shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/venezuela/history.htm|title=Venezuela - An Introduction|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> \n\nEarly indigenous settlements around the area were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Maracaibo\u2019s founding date is disputed. There were failed attempts to found the city\u2014in 1529, by Captain [[Ambrosius Ehinger|Ambrosio Ehinger]], and in 1569, by Captain [[Alonso Pacheco]]. Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain [[Captain Pedro Maldonado]], the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo|title=Maracaibo {{!}} Venezuela|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.\n\nMaracaibo is served by [[La Chinita International Airport]].

The [[La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church (Maracaibo)|La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church]] catholic church within the city.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Maracaibo is said to come from the brave ''[[cacique]]'' (Indian chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them. Legend says that when Mara fell, the Indians shouted \"''Mara kay\u00f3!''\" (Mara fell!), thus originating the city name --although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was \"Maara-iwo\" meaning \"Place where serpents abound\".\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of New Zamora of Maracaibo.svg|thumb|First version of Coat of Arms with royal elements, according to ''Discrezi\u00f3n de la laguna de la ciudad de Maracaibo'' in [[General Archive of the Indies]].|left|200px]]\n\n===Foundation===\nThe first indigenous settlements were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Around the main group were the [[A\u00f1u]] tribe who built rows of [[stilt house]]s all over the northern riviera of the Lake Maracaibo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/maracaibo.htm|title=Error|author=Irama Iglesias|work=efemeridevenezolana}}</ref> The first Europeans arrived in 1499.\n\nThe city was founded three times: the first time was during the [[Klein-Venedig]] period (1528&ndash;1546), when the [[Welser]] bankers of [[Augsburg]] received a concession over [[Venezuela Province]] from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I. of Spain]]. In August 1529, the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] made his first expedition to [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous [[Coquivacoa]]. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg ({{lang-de|Neu-N\u00fcrnberg}}) and the lake after the valiant [[cacique|chieftain]] Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession.<ref>[http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html Das Imperium der Welser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422023929/http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref> The lack of activity in the zone made [[Nikolaus Federmann]] evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to [[Santa Marta]] near the then capital of [[Venezuela Province]], [[Santa Ana de Coro]].\n\nA second attempt by Captain [[Alonso Pacheco]] in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor [[Diego de Mazariegos]]' command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. \"Nueva Zamora\" comes from Mazariego's place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of [[Lake Maracaibo]], the dominant feature of the oil-rich [[Maracaibo Basin]]. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], first become pronounced.\n\n===Pirates' attacks===\nThe Dutch corsair [[Henrik de Gerard]] plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate [[William Jackson (pirate)|William Jackson]]. In 1667, [[l'Olonnais]] with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l'Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[gemstone]]s and more than 260,000 [[pieces of eight]].\n\nIn March 1669, [[Henry Morgan]] sacked Maracaibo, which emptied when his fleet was first spied, and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the ''Magdalena'', the ''San Luis'', and the ''Soledad''. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the ''Soledad'' surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.<ref>''Harry Morgan's Way'', (AlisonPress, 1977), Dudley Pope, {{ISBN|978-1842324820}}</ref><ref>''Caribbean'', James A.Michener, Guild Publishing, 1989, ASIN: B00EFKMICY</ref>\n\nIn June 1678, [[Michel de Grammont]] French commander of six ships and 700 men captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], penetrating as far inland as [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].\n\n=== Venezuelan independence ===\n\nIn 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] and remained loyal to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]]. Maracaibo then held the seat of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\nIn 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], led by [[Francisco Tom\u00e1s Morales]], fought with the patriots, led by [[Rafael Urdaneta]], to take back control over the province in the Juana de \u00c1vila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela's struggle for independence.\n\n=== Isolation period ===\nFor about 390 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation was only possible across the lake by ferry or other marine transport.\n\nCars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product, depended on the ferry system between the city and the eastern shore with their roads to connect to the country's motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region's economy was more linked to [[Colombia]] than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.\n\nThis isolation was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city's location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called ''La Rep\u00fablica Independiente del Zulia'', which means ''The Independent Republic of Zulia'', but this has never come to be.\n\nIn January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente [[Cipriano Castro]], the German warship ''[[SMS Panther]]'' attempted to enter [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the ''[[SMS Vineta]]'', with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, the ''SMS Vineta'' bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.\n\nIn 1908, the ''Friesland'', [[HNLMS Gelderland (1898)|Gelderland]] and [[HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck (1906)|Jacob van Heemskerck]]\nwere sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the ''[[Cipriano Castro|second Castro crisis]]''. ''Friesland'' guarded the entry way to Maracaibo.<ref name=\"scheepvaartmuseum.nl :: Maritieme kalender 1908\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/knowledgebase/calendar%7C1908|publisher=Hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl|title=Maritieme kalender 1908|accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Building of the bridge ===\n[[File:Monumento a la Chinita I.JPG|thumbnail|300px|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir\u00e1]]\nThe dictatorial regime of General [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]] in the 1950s set as a goal the construction of a bridge connecting the two lake shores. Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general's government had decided that this \"city of independent thought\" should be more \"connected\" to the rest of the country.\n\nProposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez government on 23 January 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more conservative government.\n\nThe building of \"El Puente Sobre El Lago de Maracaibo \"General Rafael Urdaneta\"\u2014([[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] over Lake Maracaibo) named after the distinguished General [[Rafael Urdaneta|hero]] of the War of Independence was opened to public traffic in 1962. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.\n\nThis bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.\n[[File:Maracaibo city skyline july 2007.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|Panoramic view of Maracaibo City.]]\n\n=== Modern times ===\nMaracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: to the north the municipality of Maracaibo and to the south the San Francisco municipality (established in 1995). In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including [[Caracas]]).\n[[File:Ancient office Mene Grande Oil Company.jpg|thumb|right|Former headquarters of the Mene Grande Oil Company]]\nIn the political arena, the citizens of Maracaibo (and most other cities and municipalities in Zulia state) have in recent years voted for a competitive political system in where the governor is from a certain political party and the mayor or mayors are from the opposite political party.\n\nMaracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university. ''[[University of Zulia|La Universidad del Zulia]]'' (LUZ) is well renowned for its excellent law, medical and engineering schools as many other disciplines. Other universities and schools include [[Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] (URBE) and [[Universidad Rafael Urdaneta]], with one of the country's leading psychology schools.\n\nThe Diocese of Maracaibo (23 July 1965) was elevated to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maracaibo|Archdiocese]] on 30 April 1966 by [[Pope Paulus VI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmara.html#hist|title=Maracaibo (Archdiocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|author=David M.

The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:\n\n:''They perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo {{sic}} are covered.''\n\nHe also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:\n\n:''But what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress....They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters.''\n\n==Economy==\nZulia\u00b4s main income comes from oil extraction and refining, agriculture (coffee, rice, maize, cassava, cocoa, sugar cane),\nlivestock production, and mining (clay, limestone, coal and sand{{cn|date=March 2017}}).\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] prevalence worldwide is 5\u201310 cases per 100,000 persons. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons.<ref>\"Huntington's disease\" ''[[The Lancet]]'' 369 (9557): 218\u201328 [221]. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1. {{PMID|17240289}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Maracaibo Municipality is currently divided into 18 parishes, which are\n{{Maracaibo}}\n\n===Climate===\nMaracaibo is one of the hottest cities of [[Venezuela]].

In the past, the climate of the city, indeed all along the coast of Lake Maracaibo, was unhealthy due to the combination of high temperatures with high humidity. At the present time, control of plagues, and the effects of urban development, has largely eradicated these health problems.

Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in [[baseball]] by the [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]], a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the [[Liga Venezolana de B\u00e9isbol Profesional]], and is based in the [[Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande]]. The city's [[basketball]] team is [[Gaiteros del Zulia]], which plays in the [[Liga Profesional de Baloncesto]] de Venezuela. Its home is the 5.000-people ''Pedro El\u00edas Belisario Aponte'' stadium. Other teams include the [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]] and the [[Zulia FC]] in [[Football (soccer)|football]], the [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club]] and the [[Zulianos Rugby Club]].\n\nIn the [[2000 Little League World Series]], the Sierrra Maestra Little League of Maracaibo, Venezuela defeated Bellaire Little League of Bellaire, Texas in the championship game of the 54th Little League World Series. The Coquivocoa Little League team from Maracaibo placed third in the [[1974 Little League World Series]].\n\nRugby in Venezuela was first played in Maracaibo, thanks to the influence of the English community based on the [[Zulia State]]\n\nTeam:\n* Baseball: [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]] BBC.\n* Basketball: [[Gaiteros del Zulia]]\n* Soccer: [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]], [[Zulia FC]]\n* Rugby: [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club \"Oil Blacks\"]], [[Zulianos Rugby Club]]\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Calle Carabobo de Maracaibo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Carabobo street contains much of the city's famous colonial architecture]]\n\nCulture in Maracaibo is very indigenous and unique, is recognized in every state and city in Venezuela, and is very influential with its [[Gaita (music style)|gaitas]], desserts, style, living, and customs. Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how opposite the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas' leading soft drink brand is [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], while in Maracaibo it is [[Pepsi]]. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).\n\nMarabinos are extremely proud of their city, their culture, and all of Zulia. They usually claim that Venezuela wouldn't be the country it actually is without Zulia. Rivalry with inhabitants of other regions is common, specially with ''Gochos'' (people of the Trujillo, [[M\u00e9rida State|M\u00e9rida]] and T\u00e1chira state) and ''[[Caraque\u00f1o]]s'' (people of the city of [[Caracas]]).\n\nThe Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to [[Joan Corominas]], it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for \"goat\", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the furro instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs.The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s. Famous gaita groups include Maracaibo 15, Gran Coquivacoa, Barrio Obrero, Cardenales del \u00c9xito, Koquimba, Melody Gaita, Guaco, Estrellas del Zulia, Saladillo, and many others.\n[[File:Mural (Venezuela).JPG|thumb|1000px|center|Mural in the Libertador Avenue.]]\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers and theaters ===\n[[File:Tranv\u00eda de Maracaibo I.jpg|thumb|240px|Tram of Maracaibo.]]\n* Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo del estado Zulia (MACZUL)\n* Museo [[General Rafael Urdaneta]]\n* Museo Municipal de Artes Gr\u00e1ficas \"Balmiro Le\u00f3n\"\n* Centro de Bellas Artes de Maracaibo\n* Centro de Arte de Maracaibo \"[[L\u00eda Berm\u00fadez]]\"\n* [[Baralt Theater|Teatro Baralt]]\n\n=== Libraries ===\n* [http://www.bibliotecapublicadelzulia.org.ve Biblioteca Publica del Zulia]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Arturo Uslar Pietri\"\n* Biblioteca \"Dr. Pedro Alciro Barboza de la Torre\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Sim\u00f3n Palmar\"\n* [http://www.cevaz.org Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Lu\u00eds Guillermo Pineda Belloso\" (De car\u00e1cter p\u00fablico, biling\u00fce y circulante)]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"Pedag\u00f3gica\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"SEDINI\"\n\n== Notable natives ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}\n* [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]] - Philanthropist\n* [[Teolindo Acosta]] - baseball player\n* [[Guaco|Gustavo Aguado]] - musician, singer and leader of Guaco, Venezuela's most influential music band\n* [[Ricardo Aguirre]] - composer and singer\n* [[Daniel Alvarado]] - singer and actor\n* [[Wilson \u00c1lvarez]] - Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher\n* [[Ernesto Aparicio (baseball)|Ernesto Aparicio]] - Major League Baseball baseball player, manager, and team owner\n* [[Luis Aparicio]] - former shortstop in Major League Baseball and member of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]\n*[[:es:Pedro Aranguren|Pedro Aranguren]]- militar\n* [[Eduardo Arcila Far\u00edas]] - journalist and historian\n* [[Rafael Maria Baralt]] - diplomat, writer, philologist, historian, first Latin American to occupy a chair at the 'Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola'\n* [[Huascar Barradas]] - flutist\n*[[Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] - physician\n* [[:es:Luis Barrera Linares|Luis Barrera Linares]] - writer, academic, teacher of [[Universidad Simon Bolivar]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Bracho]] - baseball pitcher\n* [[Antonio Bri\u00f1ez]] - first manager to win a National Amateur Baseball championship to Venezuela\n* [[Mar\u00eda Calca\u00f1o]] - poet\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Casanova]] - baseball player and manager of the Venezuelan team that won the gold medal in 1959 Panamerican Games\n* [[Abel Castellano Jr.]] - jockey\n* [[Javier Castellano]]- jockey [[Eclipse Award]] 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.
