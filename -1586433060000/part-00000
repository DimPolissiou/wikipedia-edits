Don\u2019t read them..\n\n<br />\n\n== Overview ==\n\nNewspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title=''A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'' (2007)|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s\u2013early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53&nbsp;billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.<ref>Suzanne Vranica and Jack Marshall,   \"Plummeting Newspaper Ad Revenue Sparks New Wave of Changes: With global newspaper print advertising on pace for worst decline since recession, publishers cut costs and restructure\" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/plummeting-newspaper-ad-revenue-sparks-new-wave-of-changes-1476955801?cx_navSource=cx_picks&cx_tag=collabctx&cx_artPos=1#cxrecs_s ''Wall Street Journal'' Oct 20, 2016]</ref>\n\nThe decline in advertising revenues affected both the print and online media as well as all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of [[online advertising]] are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rehm|first=Margarete|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., [[homelessness|homeless people]], [[poverty|impoverished people]] and people living in remote or rural regions may [[Digital divide|not be able to access the Internet]], and thus will not be able to read online news). [[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).\n* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.\n* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.\n* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gazettes and bulletins===\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name=\"brook xxi\">[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998).

More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\n===Frequency===\n\n====Daily====\nA '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)<ref>Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays</ref> and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared,  ''Einkommende Zeitung'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtgeschichte/historisches-aus-1000-jahren/erste-tageszeitung-kam-aus-leipzig/|title=Erste Tageszeitung kam aus Leipzig|author=|date=|website=www.leipzig.de}}</ref> published by [[Timotheus Ritzsch]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.<ref>Johannes Weber, . \"Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe.\" ''German History'' 24.3 (2006): 387-412.</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"St\u00fcrmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as semi-weekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or biweekly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.\n\n===Geographical scope and distribution===\n\n====Local or regional====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area. Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks, and can be found outside their normal area, sometimes widely, sometimes from fewer sources.\n\n====National====\n{{See also|List of national newspapers}}\n[[File:Street Scene - Salta - Argentina.jpg|thumb|Newspaper stand in [[Salta]] ([[Argentina]]).]]\nMost nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a '''national newspaper'''. Some national newspapers, such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', are specialised (in these examples, on financial matters). There are many [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|national newspapers in the United Kingdom]], but only a [[List of newspapers in the United States|few in the United States]] and [[List of newspapers in Canada|Canada]]. In Canada, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' is sold throughout the country.

Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====Online====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43106436|title=The death of the local newspaper?|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=BBC|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself\u2014editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names\u2014as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising\u2014the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial\u2014or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |title=WSJ Advertising: Rates |publisher=Advertising.wsj.com |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029083017/http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n''See also [[Los Angeles Times suburban sections]].''\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Newspapers of Japan 20090831.jpg|thumb|[[Yomiuri Shimbun]], a broadsheet in Japan credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world]]\nMost modern newspapers<ref>See K.G.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layouts]] and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers\u2014the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''\u2014with circulations well above 5.5&nbsp;million. Germany's ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 3.8&nbsp;million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.24&nbsp;million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., ''The Wall Street Journal'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02&nbsp;million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010138873_apusnewspapercirculation.html|title=Newspaper circulation drop accelerates April\u2013Sept|author=Liedtke, Michael|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed [[OECD]] nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/24/45559596.pdf|title=The evolution of news and the internet|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|date=11 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2011}}\"Growth in the BIICS countries by about 35% from 2000 to 2008 very much contributed to this growth, most notably India with a 45% increase in circulation between 2000 and 2008, South Africa (34%) and China (an estimated 29%).

As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent.

For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70\u201380% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions.

The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers.

The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Decline of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[newspaper circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue\u2014the bulk of most newspapers' income\u2014has been shifting from print to [[social media]] and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.<ref>N.

The [[journalism]] organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often [[metonymy|metonymically]] called newspapers.\n\nNewspapers have traditionally been published [[printing|in print]] (usually on cheap, low-grade [[paper]] called [[newsprint]]). However, today most newspapers are also [[electronic publishing|published]] on [[website]]s as [[online newspaper]]s, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as [[newsletter|information sheets for merchants]]. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nNewspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title=''A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'' (2007)|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s\u2013early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53&nbsp;billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.<ref>Suzanne Vranica and Jack Marshall,   \"Plummeting Newspaper Ad Revenue Sparks New Wave of Changes: With global newspaper print advertising on pace for worst decline since recession, publishers cut costs and restructure\" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/plummeting-newspaper-ad-revenue-sparks-new-wave-of-changes-1476955801?cx_navSource=cx_picks&cx_tag=collabctx&cx_artPos=1#cxrecs_s ''Wall Street Journal'' Oct 20, 2016]</ref>\n\nThe decline in advertising revenues affected both the print and online media as well as all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of [[online advertising]] are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rehm|first=Margarete|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., [[homelessness|homeless people]], [[poverty|impoverished people]] and people living in remote or rural regions may [[Digital divide|not be able to access the Internet]], and thus will not be able to read online news). [[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).\n* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.\n* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.\n* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gazettes and bulletins===\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name=\"brook xxi\">[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998).

In 1783, the ''[[Pennsylvania Evening Post]]'' became the first American daily.<ref>{{cite journal|date=July 1965|title=Benjamin Towne: The Precarious Career of a Persistent Printer|journal=[[Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography]]|volume=89|issue=3|pages=316\u2013330|jstor=20089817|last1=Teeter|first1=Dwight L}}</ref>\n\nIn 1752, [[John Bushell]] published the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]'', which claims to be \"Canada's first newspaper.\" However, its official descendant, the ''Royal Gazette'', is a government publication for legal notices and proclamations rather than a proper newspaper; In 1764, the ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette]]'' was first printed 21 June 1764 and remains the oldest continuously published newspaper in North America as the ''Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph''. It is currently published as an English-language weekly from its offices at 1040 Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, suite 218, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. In 1808, the ''[[Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro]]''<ref>{{citation |title=Novo Mil\u00eanio: MNDLP - Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, de 1808 |url=http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/idioma/200009u.htm}}</ref> had its first edition, printed in devices brought from [[England]], publishing news favourable for the government of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] since it was produced by the official press service of the Portuguese crown.\n\nIn 1821, after the ending of the ban of private newspaper circulation, appears the first non-imperial printed publication, ''[[Di\u00e1rio do Rio de Janeiro]]'', though there existed already the ''[[Correio Braziliense]]'', published by Hip\u00f3lito Jos\u00e9 da Costa at the same time as the ''Gazeta'', but from [[London]] and with forcefully advocated political and critical ideas, aiming to expose the administration's flaws. The first newspaper in Peru was ''El Peruano'', established in October 1825 and still published today, but with several name changes.\n\n====Asia====\n{{Main|Media of India|Japanese newspapers|History of Chinese newspapers|l1 = Print media in India}} During the [[Tang Dynasty]] in China (618\u2013906), the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' published the government news; it was [[Woodblock printing|block-printed]] onto paper.

However, before he could begin his newspaper, he was deported back to Europe. In 1780 the first newsprint from this region, ''[[Hicky's Bengal Gazette]]'', was published by an Irishman, [[James Augustus Hicky]]. He used it as a means to criticize the British rule through journalism.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/exclusive-corrupt-system-and-media_922302.html|title = Exclusive: Corrupt system and media|last = |first = |date = 4 April 2014|work = Zee News|access-date = 3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Middle East====\n{{Main|History of Middle Eastern newspapers}}\nThe history of [[Middle East]]ern [[newspapers]] goes back to the 19th century. Many editors were not only journalists but also writers, philosophers and politicians. With unofficial journals, these intellectuals encouraged public discourse on politics in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[History of Iran|Persian]] Empires. Literary works of all genres were serialized and published in the press as well.\n\nThe first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world.<ref>Stavrianos, p. 211.</ref> The earliest was printed in 1795 by the Palais de France in [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]]. Indigenous Middle Eastern journalism started in 1828, when [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], [[Khedive]] of Egypt, ordered the local establishment of the gazette ''[[Vekayi-i Misriye]]'' (''Egyptian Affairs'').<ref>''E.

In 1814, ''[[The Times]]'' (London) acquired a printing press capable of making 1,100 impressions per hour.<ref>Philip B. Meggs, ''A History of Graphic Design'' (1998) pp 130\u2013133</ref> Soon, this press was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once. This innovation made newspapers cheaper and thus available to a larger part of the population.\n\nIn 1830, the first inexpensive \"[[penny press]]\" newspaper came to the market: Lynde M. Walter's Boston ''[[Boston Evening Transcript|Transcript]]''.<ref>David R. Spencer, ''The Yellow Journalism'' (2007) p. 22.</ref> Penny press papers cost about one sixth the price of other newspapers and appealed to a wider audience, including less educated and lower-income people.<ref name=\"bird\">Bird, S.

More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\n===Frequency===\n\n====Daily====\nA '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)<ref>Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays</ref> and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared,  ''Einkommende Zeitung'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtgeschichte/historisches-aus-1000-jahren/erste-tageszeitung-kam-aus-leipzig/|title=Erste Tageszeitung kam aus Leipzig|author=|date=|website=www.leipzig.de}}</ref> published by [[Timotheus Ritzsch]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.<ref>Johannes Weber, . \"Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe.\" ''German History'' 24.3 (2006): 387-412.</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"St\u00fcrmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as semi-weekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or biweekly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.\n\n===Geographical scope and distribution===\n\n====Local or regional====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area. Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks, and can be found outside their normal area, sometimes widely, sometimes from fewer sources.\n\n====National====\n{{See also|List of national newspapers}}\n[[File:Street Scene - Salta - Argentina.jpg|thumb|Newspaper stand in [[Salta]] ([[Argentina]]).]]\nMost nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a '''national newspaper'''. Some national newspapers, such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', are specialised (in these examples, on financial matters). There are many [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|national newspapers in the United Kingdom]], but only a [[List of newspapers in the United States|few in the United States]] and [[List of newspapers in Canada|Canada]]. In Canada, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' is sold throughout the country. In the United States, in addition to national newspapers as such, ''[[The New York Times]]'' is available throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Herszenhorn|first1=David|title=Ask a Reporter|url=https://global.nytimes.com/learning/students/ask_reporters/Herszenhorn.html|website=global.nytimes.com|accessdate=23 January 2015|date=29 August 2001|quote=As of January of this year [2001], the national editions of The Times were being printed at 19 different locations across the United States and home delivery was available in 195 markets throughout the country.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127135447/https://global.nytimes.com/learning/students/ask_reporters/Herszenhorn.html|archive-date=27 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:An old man in newsagent's shop, Paris September 2011.jpg|thumb|International newspapers on sale in [[Paris]], France]]\nThere is also a small group of newspapers which may be characterized as '''international newspapers'''. Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====Online====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43106436|title=The death of the local newspaper?|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=BBC|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself\u2014editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names\u2014as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising\u2014the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial\u2014or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |title=WSJ Advertising: Rates |publisher=Advertising.wsj.com |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029083017/http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n''See also [[Los Angeles Times suburban sections]].''\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Newspapers of Japan 20090831.jpg|thumb|[[Yomiuri Shimbun]], a broadsheet in Japan credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world]]\nMost modern newspapers<ref>See K.G.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layouts]] and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers\u2014the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''\u2014with circulations well above 5.5&nbsp;million.

In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and still falling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|title=Newspapers: Audience&nbsp;\u2013 State of the Media 2004|access-date=27 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828204802/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70\u201380% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time&nbsp;\u2013 early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321044034/http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 March 2008|title=wallstreetcosmos.com|publisher=wallstreetcosmos.com|accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref> Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Decline of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[newspaper circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue\u2014the bulk of most newspapers' income\u2014has been shifting from print to [[social media]] and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.<ref>N.

He was first elected on November 22, 2004 as a [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]], but was defeated in his [[2008 Alberta general election|2008]] re-election bid by [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] [[Heather Klimchuk]].\n\nHe has had a notable career as a churchman, educator and community activist/advocate.  He received the Queen's Jubilee award for community service in 2002.  He co-founded the Alberta Quality of Life Commission in 1993, and served for many years as the Vice-President of the Mahatma Gandhi Canadian Foundation for World Peace.\n\nAs MLA, Miller served as the Deputy Whip of the Liberal Caucus, and authored a paper on reforming Alberta's welfare system.  He was also a member of the Alberta Government's affordable housing task force, which travelled throughout Alberta in 2007 researching the issue of housing.\n\nMiller has also been an advocate for the communities of Edmonton-Glenora.  He has presented before Edmonton City Council and the Edmonton Public School Board, representing communities facing major redevelopment projects and the possibility of school closures.\n\nMiller has also served on the Conflicts of Interest Act Review Committee and the Alberta Legislature's Policy Field Committee on Managing Growth Pressures.\n\nDr. Miller graduated from Carleton University with the B.A. degree in 1963.  His graduate degrees include:  M.Div. (1966) from Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia; S.T.M (1967) from Union Theological Seminary in New York, and the Ph.D (1984) from the Divinity School of the University of Chicago.  Dr. Miller also did doctoral studies at the Free University of Amsterdam in 1969-70.\n\nFrom 1990 to the present he has been a Fellow of the Jesus Seminar, an international group of scholars focusing on the authentic words and deeds of Jesus.\n\nFrom 2004 to the present he has been an Academic Advisor for Liberal Studies in the Faculty of Extension of the University of Alberta, and has taught courses such as \"Will the real Jesus please stand up?\" and \"Symbols and Myths in Eastern Religions.\"\n\n==Election results==\n\n===2004 general election===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=center|'''[[2004 Alberta general election]] results'''<ref name=\"2004 official\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ab.ca/Public%20Website/files/Statements/31.pdf |title=Edmonton-Glenora Statement of Official Results 2004 Alberta general election | publisher=Elections Alberta | accessdate=February 2, 2012}}</ref>\n|colspan=2|'''Turnout 56.72%'''\n|colspan=\"2\" align=center|'''Swing'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Affiliation\n!

{"title_page": "Sachsensumpf", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=January 2015}}\n{{overly detailed|date=November 2018}}\n}}\n'''''Sachsensumpf''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8zaks\u0259n\u02ccz\u028ampf|lang}}, \"[[Saxony]] morass\") is the name given by [[journalists]] to a political, judicial and intelligence scandal in the German state of [[Saxony]] climaxing in 2007 when domestic intelligence dossiers about the purported implication of judicial and business figures in cases of [[child prostitution]] and illegal property deals during the early 1990s became public, raising the suspicion of parts of the state's government and judiciary being corrupted by criminal networks. \n\nAccording to the investigating authorities and the majority in the state's parliament, no substantial evidence for the existence of such criminal and corruptible networks could be found. They assert that the (now disbanded) organized crime office at the [[Landesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz Sachsen|state's domestic intelligence service]] and its main source, a [[Leipzig]] police detective, had overstated the suspected cases in an unprofessional way, and some journalists had further exaggerated the facts. The opposition and some media still had doubts about the official explanation, even after a parliamentary inquiry committee had completed its work. Former victims of child prostitution as well as journalists reporting on the case have been charged with [[libel]] (but were eventually acquitted), raising warnings by press freedom advocates.<ref>{{Cite web |author=International Press Institute |url=http://legaldb.freemedia.at/2014/09/11/on-trial-for-criminal-defamation-german-freelance-journalists-faced-existential-threat/ |title=On trial for criminal defamation, German freelance journalists faced \"existencial threat\" |date=11 September 2014}}</ref>\n \n==Background==\nThe \"Sachsensumpf\" scandal involves several criminal cases dating back to the 1990s. Whether or not they are connected with each other, is a matter of debate.\n\nOne of the cases that was believed to be connected was the child prostitution case of an illegal brothel in Western Leipzig, named \"Jasmin\", where the pimp and former boxer Michael W. Alias Martin Kugler exploited eight girls aged 13 to 19 for sexual services in 1992 and early 1993. The brothel, hidden in a flat, was raided by the police on 28 January 1993.<ref name=\"DattGin_Zeit260608\">{{Cite news |author1= Thomas Datt |author2=Arndt Ginzel |title=Die Geschichte des \"Jasmin\" |newspaper=Zeit Online |date=26 June 2008 |url=http://www.zeit.de/online/2008/27/jasmin-chronik}}</ref> The ''Landgericht'' (district court) of Leipzig convicted Kugler of [[human trafficking]], in coincidence with pimping, promotion of [[prostitution]] and sexual abuse of children and sentenced him to four years and two months in [[prison]]. The presiding judge in this trial, J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer, called the verdict \"a major concession (to the perpetrator), but only just acceptable.\"<ref name=\"SimonRein_Zeit1012\">Jana Simon, Sigrid Reinichs in the 'Zeitmagazin' ([[Die Zeit]]) Nr. 10, M\u00e4rz 2012</ref> However, none of the clients of the brothel were identified; the girls were never even asked to identify them during the whole investigation or the trial.\n\nAnother case was the attempted murder of Martin Klockzin on October 1994, then head of the legal department of the Leipzig Housing Company (Leipziger Wohnungs- und Baugesellschaft, LWB). The LWB is the successor to the former state-owned housing enterprise that administered all flats in Leipzig during an East Germany's communist era, until being privatised after Germany's reunification. The assassination attempt was believed to be linked to illegal property deals during the privatization of real estate in the post-reunification years. Three of the [[hitmen]] received life sentences, while their employers were initially not identified.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1999 and 2000, detective chief inspector Georg Wehling, head of the K26 office (responsible for organized crime) at Leipzig's criminal investigation department, re-investigated the Klockzin murder attempt, identifying the hitmen's employers who were real estate agents from Bavaria. In the course of the investigation, Wehling found that these estate agents had also blackmailed Klockzin by threatening to reveal his \"child molesting\". This aroused Wehling's suspicion that Klockzin might have been a client of the \"Jasmin\" brothel and he also re-opened that child prostitution case. Upon his re-examination, the former pimp Michael W. Claimed that his lenient sentence was part of a deal, not to \"wash his dirty linen\" in public, i.e. not to identify the brothel's clients during the trial. Moreover, he now claimed that Klockzin as well as the estate agents who had contracted his killing, had been clients of the \"Jasmin\" brothel. Consequently, inspector Wehling initiated proceedings for [[Perverting the course of justice|perversion of justice]] against judge J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer, who had presided over the trial in 1994.<ref name=\"DattGin_Zeit260608\"/>\n\n==History of the Affair==\n\nThe still unsolved affair goes back to what the former forced prostitutes said when being interviewed again by the [[police]] in 2000. They claim that the former vice president of the Leipzig's Country Court (Landgericht), who was their judge in the trial of 1994, J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer, was one of the visitors of the brothel. The women further claim that Norbert R\u00f6ger, back then public prosecutor in Leipzig, was another former visitor of the brothel. Since January 2011, he is President of the Country Court in [[Chemnitz]] (Landgericht Chemnitz).<ref>http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/smj/content/2161.php</ref> The policemen who conducted the interrogation, later denied to speak publicly about it.<ref>Sigrid Reinichs: http://www.zeit.de/2012/10/Mandy-Kinderbordell-Sachsensumpf/komplettansicht</ref>\n \nIn 2003 a department for [[organized crime]] (OK) was established in the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution ([[Landesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz Sachsen]] - LfV). This unit had ten employees and was headed by the former public prosecutor Simone Henneck (now Skroch). Certain investigations of this unit, which were internally registered under the name 'offside' (German 'Abseits'), had alleged [[mafia]] structures in Leipzig as focus. These included suspected illegal property transactions in the 1990s, [[prostitution]], [[blackmail]] and cross-links between political, judicial and criminal persons. This part was also associated with the [[assassination]] attempt on Klockzin in 1994. From 2004 to 2006 the unit assembled files of 15.600 pages.<ref>https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/der-angebliche-sachsensumpf-haltlose-geruechte-ueble-anschuldigungen-1.209508</ref>\n \nThe jurisdiction of a domestic [[intelligence agency]] investigating [[organized crime]] was controversial from the start (in [[Germany]] this is normally part of specialized police units). In July 2005 the Saxony Constitutional Court (s\u00e4chsischer Verfassungsgerichtshof) declared that the 'State Constitution Protection Act' (Landesverfassungsschutzgesetz) of that time is partly unconstitutional and thus limited the admissibility of observation of organized crime by the department.<ref>see: Vf 67-II-04 - quoted in: http://www.verfassungsgerichtshof.sachsen.de/content/911.php</ref>\n \nOn 12 August 2005 a government report was issued. It assessed the situation and concluded, that 'the aspect of a danger for the constitution and the free, basic democratic order in Germany [...] in all case complexes was given'. On the basis of this report the former Minister of the Interior, [[Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re]], decided, that the observation of [[organized crime]], including the case of complex 'offside' by the domestic intelligence agency, will continue. It has been reported that Mr de Maizi\u00e8re appreciated the work of Henneck and her department, but was not initiating a criminal investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft), nor did he inform the parliament on the available [[evidence]]. The report from August indicates, that the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (LfV) knew of alleged [[sexual abuse]] of children at the hands of known prosecutors and judges by the second quarter of 2005.<ref>http://plutokraten.blogspot.com/2009/03/sachsensumpf.html</ref><ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20071015210821/http://rbb-online.de/_/kontraste/beitrag_jsp/key=rbb_beitrag_6077948.html</ref>\n \nIn March 2006, the Data Protection Supervisor (Datenschutzbeauftragter) of the Free State of Saxony, Andreas Schurig, launched a review in how far the department for organized crime (OK) still collects data - because it only had a limited mandate to monitor organized crime. He concluded, that the documents were collected illegally and should be destroyed. The department was disbanded in 2006. On 15 May 2007 the Parliamentary Control Commission ([[:de:Parlamentarische Kontrollkommission|Parlamentarische Kontrollkommission]]) of the Saxony Parliament decided, in accordance with Albrecht Buttolo (who followed Mr de Maiziere as Minister for the Interior in November 2005), that the material is not to be deleted, but should be used to further clarify the identified issues. Also in May 2007, the first media reports surfaced on the content of the files from the disbanded department and the so-called 'offside' case complex. There the names Niemeyer and R\u00f6ger appeared as potential customers in the brothel.<ref>Sabine Beikler: http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/deutschland/korruptionsaffaere-in-sachsen-die-dunkle-seite-der-macht/980400.html</ref>\n \nIn a speech at a special meeting of the [[Landtag of the Free State of Saxony | Saxony parliament]] on 5 June 2007, the Minister for the Interior Mr Buttolo confirmed the existence of active and dangerous criminal networks in Saxony, this speech became known as the 'Mafia-Speech'.<ref>Thomas Schade, Gunnar Saft: http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/minister-buttolo-warnt-vor-mafia-1534097.html</ref> The [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany) | General Attorney's Office of Germany]] (Bundesanwaltschaft) was informed and had a look into the issue, but in June 2007 declared, that there is no [[reasonable suspicion]] for the existence of a criminal organization or network.<ref>Reiner Burger: http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/sachsen-erhebliche-maengel-im-verfassungsschutz-1463845.html</ref> The Prosecuting Attorney's Office of Dresden (Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden) began to investigate against judge J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer on the basis of [[obstruction of justice]] in the time between end of June to early July 2007. It received intelligence files from 'offside III' complex.\n \nIn early July 2007, when the so-called 'Saxony corruption affair' or 'Saxony morass' became a topic in the national media, the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, whose oversight was recently given to Reinhard Boos, assumed that the head of the department for organized crime, Simone Henneck, had tampered with the files. She made it look like that reports, which were exclusively based on the information from Detective Chief Inspector Georg Wehling, have been supported by other neutral sources. After that, an internal investigation against Henneck was initiated. Chief prosecutor Christian Avenarius, spokesman for the Prosecuting Attorney's Office of Dresden (Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden), said that the material from the police officer hardly contained any reliable facts that would make legal proceedings reasonable.<ref>Alexander Wendt: http://www.focus.de/magazin/archiv/sachsen-affaere-nichts-als-aufgepeppte-dossiers_aid_225495.html</ref>\n \nOn the 26 August 2007, two months after his 'Mafia-Speech', Albrecht Buttolo distanced himself from what he said in that speech. At the time he completely trusted the accuracy of the material, now however, under the given circumstances of significant errors in the interpretation the material, he considers the information questionable. Data collection and data analysis was put together and a check for the credibility of the information has not been made. The reports filed by the chief inspector did not stand tests by the Prosecuting Attorney's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) and the State Office for Criminal Investigations (Landeskriminalamt). Many references were false or overstated.<ref>Hubert Kemper: http://www.freiepresse.de/THEMEN/6-August-Buttolo-distanziert-sich-von-Mafia-Rede-artikel987581.php</ref><ref>http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/korruptionsaffaere-sachsens-innenminister-will-von-mafia-rede-nichts-mehr-wissen-a-498636.html</ref>\n\nAn external review committee headed by the retired judge from the Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof) Dietrich Beyer, stated in its interim report serious deficiencies at Saxony's State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, particularly with the department for organized crime (OK). Intelligence service regulations have been violated to a significant extent, the [[supervision]] of the department has been neglected by both the board of directors as well as the Ministry of the Interior (Innenministerium). Members of the unit had insufficient intelligence training for obtaining information, policemen from the mid-level service had been used. The head of the department itself had not any specialized training or further education. Source reports were not questioned on their resilience, even self-evident inconclusive information has been processed as applicable. Contrary to corresponding units in other federal states, who analyze data to advise the government and coordinate with the police authorities, the unit of Saxony tried to find suspicious circumstances at any price and individual employees acted 'grimly' and 'overeager'. The result was a 'disaster'.<ref>http://www.freiepresse.de/THEMEN/Massive-Kritik-am-Verfassungsschutz-artikel1009179.php</ref>\n \nIn a lawsuit from 2008, the two girl's who were forced into prostitution declared, that the high-level [[lawyers]] of Leipzig were their punters in the Jasmine.<ref>Thomas Datt, Arndt Ginzel: http://www.zeit.de/online/2008/27/sachsensumpf-jasmin</ref> The convicted pimp Martin Kugler testified, that his lawyer back then agreed with the [[court]] on a lenient sentence, provided that Kugler will not wash 'dirty linen'.<ref>[http://www.zeit.de/online/2007/47/sachsen-affaere Thomas Datt, Arndt Ginzel]</ref> However, this assertion was later revoked by Kugler. The Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) gave no credibility to the testimony of the women and cancelled the investigation against the lawyers; both lawyers received compensation from the state of Saxony. The investigating officers were shifted, the commissariat K26 was dissolved.

However, they complained that the government had not seriously run the enlightenment of the affair, but had even prevented it. In the process several employees were affected and were 'downright destroyed in their professional and social status'.<ref>http://www.gruene-fraktion-sachsen.de/fileadmin/user_upload/ua/Minderheitenberich_UA-Sachsensumpf_Gruene-SPD-Linke_2014-07.pdf\n</ref>\n\n== Coverage and legal consequences ==\n\nFrom the summer of 2007 J\u00fcrgen Roth reported on the 'Saxony morass' affair (suspicion of involvement in mafia-like structures from high politicians, lawyers, policemen and journalists).<ref>Markus Bernhardt: http://www.jungewelt.de/2009/06-26/054.php</ref> For his covering Roth was severely criticised by journalist Reiner Burger in a series of articles in the FAZ ([[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]). Burger demonstrated that Roth has not spoken with affected people directly, as example. In this context, Roth had to retract statements on his website about a businessman. The district court in Dresden sentenced him in early 2008 to a fine for libel. A critical comment on the situation from J\u00fcrgen Roth was published on the website 'mafialand.de'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mafialand.de/Members/roth/warum-wohl-erhaelt-der-faz-journalist-reiner-burger-eine-medaille |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103200740/http://www.mafialand.de/Members/roth/warum-wohl-erhaelt-der-faz-journalist-reiner-burger-eine-medaille |archivedate=2015-01-03 }}</ref><ref>http://www.jungewelt.de/2009/07-10/049.php</ref>\n \nThe investigative committee of the Saxony Landtag in 2009 came to no conclusive result on the Saxony morass. [[CDU/CSU | CDU]] and [[FDP]] party saw it as disproved, [[Alliance 90/The Greens | Greens]] and [[The Left (Germany) | The Left]] could find no evidence for or against it. Access to records was widely withheld from the investigative committee by the state government. The Public Prosecutor's Office will not further investigate into the 'Saxony morass', since it sees the allegations as refuted.<ref>http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland-in-kuerze-1996456.html</ref> There are, however, single politicians that see the situation very critical, and those politicians are in favour for further investigating of the affair and the criminal network in Saxony.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtVq8VhqGkmt7pE6WDiKNQ</ref>\n \nThe journalists Arndt Ginzel and Thomas Datt reported in the German 'Spiegel' and 'Zeit Online' on the case. Both were accused of libel and defamation. Amongst other things they were accused of defamatory allegations against the Saxon lawyers. In one case, they were condemned by the district court of Dresden on 13 August 2010 to a fine of 50 daily rates of 50 \u20ac / 2500 \u20ac, which the two journalists were disputing.<ref>Az. 231 Cs 900 Js 28869/08 - http://openjur.de/u/59830.html openJur 2010, 3256</ref> On 10 December 2012 the Regional Court did reverse that ruling.<ref>Az. 12 Ns 900 Js 28869/08 http://openjur.de/u/599629.html openJur 2013, 4644</ref> The presiding judge Martin Schultze-Griebler took the view, that under established practice of the higher law, media utterances are to be seen in context of the situation.<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/sachsensumpf-landgericht-spricht-arndt-ginzel-und-thomas-datt-frei-a-872082.html</ref> Finally, after the General Attorney of the Free State of Saxony has withdrawn a previously given objection, that ruling is legally valid.<ref>http://www.sz-online.de/sachsen/sachsensumpf-freispruch-rechtskraeftig-2615958.html</ref>\n\nOn the occasion of the libel trial against the women that were forced into prostitution, Jana Simon and Sigrid Reinichs of the 'Zeitmagazin' were again reporting on the topic. They especially shine a light on the situation of Mandy Kopp, who was forced into prostitution at age 16 in the brothel. In November 2008 Beatrice E., who was forced to 'work' in the brothel along with Mandy Kopp, was accused of libel as well. Both accused J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer of being a visitor to the brothel in the 90s.<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/sachsensumpf-prozess-gegen-jasmin-zwangsprostituierte-geht-weiter-a-866143.html</ref> That process was discontinued in October 2013. The Annual Report 2012/13 from [[Reporters Without Borders]] called the lawsuit against journalists in the 'Saxony morass' as one of five reasons for a slightly deteriorated assessment of press freedom in Germany (at that time 17th place among 179 countries on the global rankinglist).<ref>https://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/fileadmin/rte/docs/2013/130130_Nahaufnahme-Deutschland_layouted.pdf</ref>\n \nMartin Klockzin started a lawsuit against a report in the online edition of the 'Stern' magazin on 22 June 2007 which was released under the title 'The Saxony corruption scandal: A thriller from Leipzig's morass'. He had success against the publisher, the journalist and his own former secretary. He demanded the payment of a compensation for infringing his personality rights. The opinion of the final ruling was, that the report in the magazine was onesided in favour for the view of his former secretary. Klockzin did reject the request for an interview on the issue in the first place, however, he was not informed what exact the allegations were, which finally have been noted down in the article. The article has therefore given the impression, that Klockzin 'was a [[pedophile]], had a sexual relationship with an underage girl named Lissy, was corrupt, part of a criminal network in Leipzig, did not fulfill his duties and that he threatened his former secretary by writing her short messages whose content was, to strangle her cat and to push her car of the road with the help of three motorcyclists known to him'. It was not possible to prove these allegations and therefore he was unlawfully insulted in his honor. The Country Court awarded a monetary compensation in the amount of 75.000 Euro, which was reduced later by the Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht - OLG) to the amount of 50.000 Euro.<ref>see ruling on 17 December 2013: File Reference VI ZR 211/12 - http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=en&nr=66571&pos=0&anz=1</ref> Later the Federal High Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) basically confirmed Klockzin's right to claim a compensation, but at the same time criticized errors in the calculation of the actual amount and gave the case back to the previous court. In Germany's juristic literature this ruling is quoted as leading decision on issues of monetary compensation for violations of personal rights by statements on the Internet.\n \nThe 'Lausitzer Rundschau' published an article on 3 July 2014, titled: 'Saxony morass affair: Clear is as good as nothing'. The report was about the end of the process, citing John Lichdi of the political party 'The Greens': 'The investigation against the accused prosecutors and judges was never operated seriously and was handled to end with no decent result from the beginning.' <ref>http://www.lr-online.de/nachrichten/sachsen/Sachsensumpf-Affaere-Geklaert-ist-so-gut-wie-nichts;art1047,4658706</ref>\n \nAlso the [[newspaper]] 'Welt am Sonntag' published an article on the occasion of the final report from the investigative committee in October 2014. There it was noted, that many questions do remain unanswered. It is remarkable how hard the Saxony's judicial authorities pushed against those - especially journalists - who doubted the official explanation and still believed in the existence of criminal structures.<ref>https://www.welt.de/print/wams/politik/article132837576/Dichter-Nebel-ueber-dem-Sachsensumpf.html</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\nGunter Pirntke: 'Black Morass in Saxony: A cartel of corruption and cover-up' - 'Schwarzer Sumpf in Sachsen: Ein Kartell aus Korruption und Vertuschung' Grin Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2012, erweiterte, aktualisierte Ausgabe, {{ISBN|978-3-640-45067-1}}\n\nMandy Kopp: 'The time of silence is over' - 'Die Zeit des Schweigens ist vorbei' Berlin: Marion von Schr\u00f6der Verlag 2013, {{ISBN|978-3547711929}}\n\n==Other sources==\n*http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/sachsensumpf-wie-die-justiz-mandy-kopp-stigmatisierte-a-891227.html\n*http://www.mafialand.de/inhalt/zusammenfassung/schlagwoerter/sachsensumpf\n*http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2012-11/Sachsensumpf-Prozess-Mandy-Kopp\n*http://www.zeit.de/online/2007/47/sachsen-affaere\n*http://www.zeit.de/online/2008/27/sachsensumpf-jasmin\n*http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/medien-der-sachsen-sumpf-ist-ausgetrocknet-1547373.html\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:20th-century scandals]]\n[[Category:21st-century scandals]]\n[[Category:Political scandals in Germany]]\n[[Category:Politics of Saxony]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=January 2015}}\n{{Orphan|date=January 2015}}\n{{overly detailed|date=November 2018}}\n}}\n'''''Sachsensumpf''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8zaks\u0259n\u02ccz\u028ampf|lang}}, \"[[Saxony]] morass\") is the name given by [[journalists]] to a political, judicial and intelligence scandal in the German state of [[Saxony]] climaxing in 2007 when domestic intelligence dossiers about the purported implication of judicial and business figures in cases of [[child prostitution]] and illegal property deals during the early 1990s became public, raising the suspicion of parts of the state's government and judiciary being corrupted by criminal networks. \n\nAccording to the investigating authorities and the majority in the state's parliament, no substantial evidence for the existence of such criminal and corruptible networks could be found. They assert that the (now disbanded) organized crime office at the [[Landesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz Sachsen|state's domestic intelligence service]] and its main source, a [[Leipzig]] police detective, had overstated the suspected cases in an unprofessional way, and some journalists had further exaggerated the facts. The opposition and some media still had doubts about the official explanation, even after a parliamentary inquiry committee had completed its work. Former victims of child prostitution as well as journalists reporting on the case have been charged with [[libel]] (but were eventually acquitted), raising warnings by press freedom advocates.<ref>{{Cite web |author=International Press Institute |url=http://legaldb.freemedia.at/2014/09/11/on-trial-for-criminal-defamation-german-freelance-journalists-faced-existential-threat/ |title=On trial for criminal defamation, German freelance journalists faced \"existencial threat\" |date=11 September 2014}}</ref>\n \n==Background==\nThe \"Sachsensumpf\" scandal involves several criminal cases dating back to the 1990s. Whether or not they are connected with each other, is a matter of debate.\n\nOne of the cases that was believed to be connected was the child prostitution case of an illegal brothel in Western Leipzig, named \"Jasmin\", where the pimp and former boxer Michael W. Alias Martin Kugler exploited eight girls aged 13 to 19 for sexual services in 1992 and early 1993. The brothel, hidden in a flat, was raided by the police on 28 January 1993.<ref name=\"DattGin_Zeit260608\">{{Cite news |author1= Thomas Datt |author2=Arndt Ginzel |title=Die Geschichte des \"Jasmin\" |newspaper=Zeit Online |date=26 June 2008 |url=http://www.zeit.de/online/2008/27/jasmin-chronik}}</ref> The ''Landgericht'' (district court) of Leipzig convicted Kugler of [[human trafficking]], in coincidence with pimping, promotion of [[prostitution]] and sexual abuse of children and sentenced him to four years and two months in [[prison]]. The presiding judge in this trial, J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer, called the verdict \"a major concession (to the perpetrator), but only just acceptable.\"<ref name=\"SimonRein_Zeit1012\">Jana Simon, Sigrid Reinichs in the 'Zeitmagazin' ([[Die Zeit]]) Nr. 10, M\u00e4rz 2012</ref> However, none of the clients of the brothel were identified; the girls were never even asked to identify them during the whole investigation or the trial.\n\nAnother case was the attempted murder of Martin Klockzin on October 1994, then head of the legal department of the Leipzig Housing Company (Leipziger Wohnungs- und Baugesellschaft, LWB). The LWB is the successor to the former state-owned housing enterprise that administered all flats in Leipzig during an East Germany's communist era, until being privatised after Germany's reunification. The assassination attempt was believed to be linked to illegal property deals during the privatization of real estate in the post-reunification years. Three of the [[hitmen]] received life sentences, while their employers were initially not identified.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1999 and 2000, detective chief inspector Georg Wehling, head of the K26 office (responsible for organized crime) at Leipzig's criminal investigation department, re-investigated the Klockzin murder attempt, identifying the hitmen's employers who were real estate agents from Bavaria. In the course of the investigation, Wehling found that these estate agents had also blackmailed Klockzin by threatening to reveal his \"child molesting\". This aroused Wehling's suspicion that Klockzin might have been a client of the \"Jasmin\" brothel and he also re-opened that child prostitution case. Upon his re-examination, the former pimp Michael W. Claimed that his lenient sentence was part of a deal, not to \"wash his dirty linen\" in public, i.e. not to identify the brothel's clients during the trial. Moreover, he now claimed that Klockzin as well as the estate agents who had contracted his killing, had been clients of the \"Jasmin\" brothel. Consequently, inspector Wehling initiated proceedings for [[Perverting the course of justice|perversion of justice]] against judge J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer, who had presided over the trial in 1994.<ref name=\"DattGin_Zeit260608\"/>\n\n==History of the Affair==\n\nThe still unsolved affair goes back to what the former forced prostitutes said when being interviewed again by the [[police]] in 2000. They claim that the former vice president of the Leipzig's Country Court (Landgericht), who was their judge in the trial of 1994, J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer, was one of the visitors of the brothel. The women further claim that Norbert R\u00f6ger, back then public prosecutor in Leipzig, was another former visitor of the brothel. Since January 2011, he is President of the Country Court in [[Chemnitz]] (Landgericht Chemnitz).<ref>http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/smj/content/2161.php</ref> The policemen who conducted the interrogation, later denied to speak publicly about it.<ref>Sigrid Reinichs: http://www.zeit.de/2012/10/Mandy-Kinderbordell-Sachsensumpf/komplettansicht</ref>\n \nIn 2003 a department for [[organized crime]] (OK) was established in the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution ([[Landesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz Sachsen]] - LfV). This unit had ten employees and was headed by the former public prosecutor Simone Henneck (now Skroch). Certain investigations of this unit, which were internally registered under the name 'offside' (German 'Abseits'), had alleged [[mafia]] structures in Leipzig as focus. These included suspected illegal property transactions in the 1990s, [[prostitution]], [[blackmail]] and cross-links between political, judicial and criminal persons. This part was also associated with the [[assassination]] attempt on Klockzin in 1994. From 2004 to 2006 the unit assembled files of 15.600 pages.<ref>https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/der-angebliche-sachsensumpf-haltlose-geruechte-ueble-anschuldigungen-1.209508</ref>\n \nThe jurisdiction of a domestic [[intelligence agency]] investigating [[organized crime]] was controversial from the start (in [[Germany]] this is normally part of specialized police units). In July 2005 the Saxony Constitutional Court (s\u00e4chsischer Verfassungsgerichtshof) declared that the 'State Constitution Protection Act' (Landesverfassungsschutzgesetz) of that time is partly unconstitutional and thus limited the admissibility of observation of organized crime by the department.<ref>see: Vf 67-II-04 - quoted in: http://www.verfassungsgerichtshof.sachsen.de/content/911.php</ref>\n \nOn 12 August 2005 a government report was issued. It assessed the situation and concluded, that 'the aspect of a danger for the constitution and the free, basic democratic order in Germany [...] in all case complexes was given'. On the basis of this report the former Minister of the Interior, [[Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re]], decided, that the observation of [[organized crime]], including the case of complex 'offside' by the domestic intelligence agency, will continue. It has been reported that Mr de Maizi\u00e8re appreciated the work of Henneck and her department, but was not initiating a criminal investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft), nor did he inform the parliament on the available [[evidence]]. The report from August indicates, that the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (LfV) knew of alleged [[sexual abuse]] of children at the hands of known prosecutors and judges by the second quarter of 2005.<ref>http://plutokraten.blogspot.com/2009/03/sachsensumpf.html</ref><ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20071015210821/http://rbb-online.de/_/kontraste/beitrag_jsp/key=rbb_beitrag_6077948.html</ref>\n \nIn March 2006, the Data Protection Supervisor (Datenschutzbeauftragter) of the Free State of Saxony, Andreas Schurig, launched a review in how far the department for organized crime (OK) still collects data - because it only had a limited mandate to monitor organized crime. He concluded, that the documents were collected illegally and should be destroyed. The department was disbanded in 2006. On 15 May 2007 the Parliamentary Control Commission ([[:de:Parlamentarische Kontrollkommission|Parlamentarische Kontrollkommission]]) of the Saxony Parliament decided, in accordance with Albrecht Buttolo (who followed Mr de Maiziere as Minister for the Interior in November 2005), that the material is not to be deleted, but should be used to further clarify the identified issues. Also in May 2007, the first media reports surfaced on the content of the files from the disbanded department and the so-called 'offside' case complex. There the names Niemeyer and R\u00f6ger appeared as potential customers in the brothel.<ref>Sabine Beikler: http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/deutschland/korruptionsaffaere-in-sachsen-die-dunkle-seite-der-macht/980400.html</ref>\n \nIn a speech at a special meeting of the [[Landtag of the Free State of Saxony | Saxony parliament]] on 5 June 2007, the Minister for the Interior Mr Buttolo confirmed the existence of active and dangerous criminal networks in Saxony, this speech became known as the 'Mafia-Speech'.<ref>Thomas Schade, Gunnar Saft: http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/minister-buttolo-warnt-vor-mafia-1534097.html</ref> The [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany) | General Attorney's Office of Germany]] (Bundesanwaltschaft) was informed and had a look into the issue, but in June 2007 declared, that there is no [[reasonable suspicion]] for the existence of a criminal organization or network.<ref>Reiner Burger: http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/sachsen-erhebliche-maengel-im-verfassungsschutz-1463845.html</ref> The Prosecuting Attorney's Office of Dresden (Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden) began to investigate against judge J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer on the basis of [[obstruction of justice]] in the time between end of June to early July 2007. It received intelligence files from 'offside III' complex.\n \nIn early July 2007, when the so-called 'Saxony corruption affair' or 'Saxony morass' became a topic in the national media, the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, whose oversight was recently given to Reinhard Boos, assumed that the head of the department for organized crime, Simone Henneck, had tampered with the files. She made it look like that reports, which were exclusively based on the information from Detective Chief Inspector Georg Wehling, have been supported by other neutral sources. After that, an internal investigation against Henneck was initiated. Chief prosecutor Christian Avenarius, spokesman for the Prosecuting Attorney's Office of Dresden (Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden), said that the material from the police officer hardly contained any reliable facts that would make legal proceedings reasonable.<ref>Alexander Wendt: http://www.focus.de/magazin/archiv/sachsen-affaere-nichts-als-aufgepeppte-dossiers_aid_225495.html</ref>\n \nOn the 26 August 2007, two months after his 'Mafia-Speech', Albrecht Buttolo distanced himself from what he said in that speech. At the time he completely trusted the accuracy of the material, now however, under the given circumstances of significant errors in the interpretation the material, he considers the information questionable. Data collection and data analysis was put together and a check for the credibility of the information has not been made. The reports filed by the chief inspector did not stand tests by the Prosecuting Attorney's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) and the State Office for Criminal Investigations (Landeskriminalamt). Many references were false or overstated.<ref>Hubert Kemper: http://www.freiepresse.de/THEMEN/6-August-Buttolo-distanziert-sich-von-Mafia-Rede-artikel987581.php</ref><ref>http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/korruptionsaffaere-sachsens-innenminister-will-von-mafia-rede-nichts-mehr-wissen-a-498636.html</ref>\n\nAn external review committee headed by the retired judge from the Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof) Dietrich Beyer, stated in its interim report serious deficiencies at Saxony's State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, particularly with the department for organized crime (OK). Intelligence service regulations have been violated to a significant extent, the [[supervision]] of the department has been neglected by both the board of directors as well as the Ministry of the Interior (Innenministerium). Members of the unit had insufficient intelligence training for obtaining information, policemen from the mid-level service had been used. The head of the department itself had not any specialized training or further education. Source reports were not questioned on their resilience, even self-evident inconclusive information has been processed as applicable. Contrary to corresponding units in other federal states, who analyze data to advise the government and coordinate with the police authorities, the unit of Saxony tried to find suspicious circumstances at any price and individual employees acted 'grimly' and 'overeager'. The result was a 'disaster'.<ref>http://www.freiepresse.de/THEMEN/Massive-Kritik-am-Verfassungsschutz-artikel1009179.php</ref>\n \nIn a lawsuit from 2008, the two girl's who were forced into prostitution declared, that the high-level [[lawyers]] of Leipzig were their punters in the Jasmine.<ref>Thomas Datt, Arndt Ginzel: http://www.zeit.de/online/2008/27/sachsensumpf-jasmin</ref> The convicted pimp Martin Kugler testified, that his lawyer back then agreed with the [[court]] on a lenient sentence, provided that Kugler will not wash 'dirty linen'.<ref>[http://www.zeit.de/online/2007/47/sachsen-affaere Thomas Datt, Arndt Ginzel]</ref> However, this assertion was later revoked by Kugler. The Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) gave no credibility to the testimony of the women and cancelled the investigation against the lawyers; both lawyers received compensation from the state of Saxony. The investigating officers were shifted, the commissariat K26 was dissolved. In addition, several legal proceedings against Georg Wehling, the former head of K26 were initiated and he was suspended from duty.

Ms Skroch revered to economy, public administration and the sex trade business. There has actually been leads 'that from people within the organized crime, consciously and purposefully situations were set up to blackmail individuals, partially in conjunction with bribery and corruption'. The goal of these proceedings was to bring certain groups like staffers, public officials, politicians and other representatives of public life into 'dependencies'. Yet in March 2013, she still faced disciplinary and judicial inquiry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lvz-online.de/nachrichten/mitteldeutschland/sachsensumpf-ermittlungen-hinweise-auf-kontakte-von-ex-stasi-leuten-zur-kriminalitaet/r-mitteldeutschland-a-178439.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213014252/http://www.lvz-online.de/nachrichten/mitteldeutschland/sachsensumpf-ermittlungen-hinweise-auf-kontakte-von-ex-stasi-leuten-zur-kriminalitaet/r-mitteldeutschland-a-178439.html |archivedate=2014-12-13 }}</ref> On 2 July 2014, the political parties of SPD, Greens and the Left proclaimed their findings on the 'Saxony morass'.They stated that there was no viable evidence for the existence 'of a corrupt network'. However, they complained that the government had not seriously run the enlightenment of the affair, but had even prevented it. In the process several employees were affected and were 'downright destroyed in their professional and social status'.<ref>http://www.gruene-fraktion-sachsen.de/fileadmin/user_upload/ua/Minderheitenberich_UA-Sachsensumpf_Gruene-SPD-Linke_2014-07.pdf\n</ref>\n\n== Coverage and legal consequences ==\n\nFrom the summer of 2007 J\u00fcrgen Roth reported on the 'Saxony morass' affair (suspicion of involvement in mafia-like structures from high politicians, lawyers, policemen and journalists).<ref>Markus Bernhardt: http://www.jungewelt.de/2009/06-26/054.php</ref> For his covering Roth was severely criticised by journalist Reiner Burger in a series of articles in the FAZ ([[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]). Burger demonstrated that Roth has not spoken with affected people directly, as example. In this context, Roth had to retract statements on his website about a businessman. The district court in Dresden sentenced him in early 2008 to a fine for libel. A critical comment on the situation from J\u00fcrgen Roth was published on the website 'mafialand.de'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mafialand.de/Members/roth/warum-wohl-erhaelt-der-faz-journalist-reiner-burger-eine-medaille |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103200740/http://www.mafialand.de/Members/roth/warum-wohl-erhaelt-der-faz-journalist-reiner-burger-eine-medaille |archivedate=2015-01-03 }}</ref><ref>http://www.jungewelt.de/2009/07-10/049.php</ref>\n \nThe investigative committee of the Saxony Landtag in 2009 came to no conclusive result on the Saxony morass. [[CDU/CSU | CDU]] and [[FDP]] party saw it as disproved, [[Alliance 90/The Greens | Greens]] and [[The Left (Germany) | The Left]] could find no evidence for or against it. Access to records was widely withheld from the investigative committee by the state government. The Public Prosecutor's Office will not further investigate into the 'Saxony morass', since it sees the allegations as refuted.<ref>http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland-in-kuerze-1996456.html</ref> There are, however, single politicians that see the situation very critical, and those politicians are in favour for further investigating of the affair and the criminal network in Saxony.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtVq8VhqGkmt7pE6WDiKNQ</ref>\n \nThe journalists Arndt Ginzel and Thomas Datt reported in the German 'Spiegel' and 'Zeit Online' on the case. Both were accused of libel and defamation. Amongst other things they were accused of defamatory allegations against the Saxon lawyers. In one case, they were condemned by the district court of Dresden on 13 August 2010 to a fine of 50 daily rates of 50 \u20ac / 2500 \u20ac, which the two journalists were disputing.<ref>Az. 231 Cs 900 Js 28869/08 - http://openjur.de/u/59830.html openJur 2010, 3256</ref> On 10 December 2012 the Regional Court did reverse that ruling.<ref>Az. 12 Ns 900 Js 28869/08 http://openjur.de/u/599629.html openJur 2013, 4644</ref> The presiding judge Martin Schultze-Griebler took the view, that under established practice of the higher law, media utterances are to be seen in context of the situation.<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/sachsensumpf-landgericht-spricht-arndt-ginzel-und-thomas-datt-frei-a-872082.html</ref> Finally, after the General Attorney of the Free State of Saxony has withdrawn a previously given objection, that ruling is legally valid.<ref>http://www.sz-online.de/sachsen/sachsensumpf-freispruch-rechtskraeftig-2615958.html</ref>\n\nOn the occasion of the libel trial against the women that were forced into prostitution, Jana Simon and Sigrid Reinichs of the 'Zeitmagazin' were again reporting on the topic. They especially shine a light on the situation of Mandy Kopp, who was forced into prostitution at age 16 in the brothel. In November 2008 Beatrice E., who was forced to 'work' in the brothel along with Mandy Kopp, was accused of libel as well. Both accused J\u00fcrgen Niemeyer of being a visitor to the brothel in the 90s.<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/sachsensumpf-prozess-gegen-jasmin-zwangsprostituierte-geht-weiter-a-866143.html</ref> That process was discontinued in October 2013. The Annual Report 2012/13 from [[Reporters Without Borders]] called the lawsuit against journalists in the 'Saxony morass' as one of five reasons for a slightly deteriorated assessment of press freedom in Germany (at that time 17th place among 179 countries on the global rankinglist).<ref>https://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/fileadmin/rte/docs/2013/130130_Nahaufnahme-Deutschland_layouted.pdf</ref>\n \nMartin Klockzin started a lawsuit against a report in the online edition of the 'Stern' magazin on 22 June 2007 which was released under the title 'The Saxony corruption scandal: A thriller from Leipzig's morass'. He had success against the publisher, the journalist and his own former secretary. He demanded the payment of a compensation for infringing his personality rights. The opinion of the final ruling was, that the report in the magazine was onesided in favour for the view of his former secretary. Klockzin did reject the request for an interview on the issue in the first place, however, he was not informed what exact the allegations were, which finally have been noted down in the article. The article has therefore given the impression, that Klockzin 'was a [[pedophile]], had a sexual relationship with an underage girl named Lissy, was corrupt, part of a criminal network in Leipzig, did not fulfill his duties and that he threatened his former secretary by writing her short messages whose content was, to strangle her cat and to push her car of the road with the help of three motorcyclists known to him'. It was not possible to prove these allegations and therefore he was unlawfully insulted in his honor. The Country Court awarded a monetary compensation in the amount of 75.000 Euro, which was reduced later by the Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht - OLG) to the amount of 50.000 Euro.<ref>see ruling on 17 December 2013: File Reference VI ZR 211/12 - http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=en&nr=66571&pos=0&anz=1</ref> Later the Federal High Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) basically confirmed Klockzin's right to claim a compensation, but at the same time criticized errors in the calculation of the actual amount and gave the case back to the previous court. In Germany's juristic literature this ruling is quoted as leading decision on issues of monetary compensation for violations of personal rights by statements on the Internet.\n \nThe 'Lausitzer Rundschau' published an article on 3 July 2014, titled: 'Saxony morass affair: Clear is as good as nothing'. The report was about the end of the process, citing John Lichdi of the political party 'The Greens': 'The investigation against the accused prosecutors and judges was never operated seriously and was handled to end with no decent result from the beginning.' <ref>http://www.lr-online.de/nachrichten/sachsen/Sachsensumpf-Affaere-Geklaert-ist-so-gut-wie-nichts;art1047,4658706</ref>\n \nAlso the [[newspaper]] 'Welt am Sonntag' published an article on the occasion of the final report from the investigative committee in October 2014. There it was noted, that many questions do remain unanswered. It is remarkable how hard the Saxony's judicial authorities pushed against those - especially journalists - who doubted the official explanation and still believed in the existence of criminal structures.<ref>https://www.welt.de/print/wams/politik/article132837576/Dichter-Nebel-ueber-dem-Sachsensumpf.html</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\nGunter Pirntke: 'Black Morass in Saxony: A cartel of corruption and cover-up' - 'Schwarzer Sumpf in Sachsen: Ein Kartell aus Korruption und Vertuschung' Grin Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2012, erweiterte, aktualisierte Ausgabe, {{ISBN|978-3-640-45067-1}}\n\nMandy Kopp: 'The time of silence is over' - 'Die Zeit des Schweigens ist vorbei' Berlin: Marion von Schr\u00f6der Verlag 2013, {{ISBN|978-3547711929}}\n\n==Other sources==\n*http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/sachsensumpf-wie-die-justiz-mandy-kopp-stigmatisierte-a-891227.html\n*http://www.mafialand.de/inhalt/zusammenfassung/schlagwoerter/sachsensumpf\n*http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2012-11/Sachsensumpf-Prozess-Mandy-Kopp\n*http://www.zeit.de/online/2007/47/sachsen-affaere\n*http://www.zeit.de/online/2008/27/sachsensumpf-jasmin\n*http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/medien-der-sachsen-sumpf-ist-ausgetrocknet-1547373.html\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:20th-century scandals]]\n[[Category:21st-century scandals]]\n[[Category:Political scandals in Germany]]\n[[Category:Politics of Saxony]]\n", "name_user": "6583-GSBE", "label": "safe", "comment": "-> remove underlinked", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsensumpf"}
