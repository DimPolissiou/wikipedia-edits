Outside Japan, it is not usually distinguished from [[urolagnia]], though they are different things. [[Western World|Westerners]] who do make the distinction commonly use phrases such as \"'''bladder desperation'''\" although a number of fetishist communities in the West have also adopted the more specific [[Japanese language]] terminology. The term \"omorashi\" means to wet oneself. The word is also occasionally [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] as \"'''omorasi'''\" in the [[Kunrei-shiki]] romanization system.\n\n==Attitudes toward sexuality in omorashi media==\nMost fetish activities concerning the use of bodily waste are considered by the general public as \"[[hardcore pornography|hardcore]]\", [[taboo]], or [[edgeplay]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Taboo: Bodily Fluids|url=http://www.matthewhunt.com/website/taboo/bodilyfluids.html |website=Matthewhunt.com|accessdate=July 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210185752/http://www.matthewhunt.com/website/taboo/bodilyfluids.html |archivedate=December 10, 2007}}</ref> However, because the object of the fetish is clothed incontinence, omorashi videos do not necessarily feature direct sexual contact, though some use it as a form of [[foreplay]]. The focus on clothed (rather than overtly sexual images) makes [[garment fetishism]] a prominent feature in most omorashi erotica: commonly featured outfits include [[school uniforms]], those worn by [[suit and tie fetishism|working professionals]], and other people attempting to look dignified before succumbing to the need to [[urinate]]. \n\nFetishists who are into this kink may have specific scenarios they enjoy, such as while waiting in line for a bathroom or just doing it for fun in front of the toilet. Regardless of their personal wetting preferences, everyone who is into this kink enjoys watching someone wet themselves or have an accident in clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Exploring the World of Pee Fetishism|url=https://www.kinkly.com/exploring-the-world-of-pee-fetishism/2/15698|website=Kinkly.com|accessdate=November 3, 2019|}}</ref>\n\n==Japanese subculture==\nThere are many ways in which omorashi fetishism is practiced in Japan.\n\n===Yagai===\nOne of the variations is known as ''omorashi yagai'', which translates as \"to wet oneself outdoors (or publicly).\" A further variation includes ''yagai h\u014dny\u014d'', or \"outdoor (or public) urination\", in which the subject publicly removes their clothes to urinate. Other ''yagai h\u014dny\u014d'' practitioners operate much like [[graffiti]] artists, attempting public urination acts without being caught.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hentai dictionary: Japanese perversions, fetishes and AV slang|url=http://www.hellodamage.com/homedespot/Adictionary.htm |website=Hellodamage.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427073433/http://www.hellodamage.com/homedespot/Adictionary.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Diapers===\nAnother variation of omorashi play is ''omutsu omorashi'' (\u304a\u3080\u3064\u304a\u3082\u3089\u3057) or ''omutsu play'' (\u304a\u3080\u3064\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4), less commonly called ''oshime omorashi'' (\u304a\u3057\u3081\u304a\u3082\u3089\u3057), both of which translate as \"to wet oneself in a diaper.\" This omutsu variation is essentially the same as the standard omorashi, except that the participants are wearing a [[adult diaper|diaper]]. Diapers may be favorable for public wetting because they render it more discreet and eliminate mess, and their use is not limited specifically to those with a [[diaper fetish]]. However, omorashi fetishists specifically interested in this aspect of the subculture could be considered a Japanese variation of the diaper lover community.\n\nJapanese acceptance of adult diaper use is comparatively high, with the market for such products growing as much as 6\u201310% a year.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Adult Diapers To Outsell Baby Diapers in Japan By 2020: Report|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/11/adult-diaper-japan_n_3580553.html |work=HuffPost|date=July 11, 2013}}</ref> However, these are largely intended for and worn by the elderly, with the growth due to [[aging of Japan|Japan's aging population]], and younger people wearing these have met with some criticism. In 2012, the Japanese magazine ''SPA'' ran an article entitled \"The Ultimate Form of Slob\", which criticized the trend of young [[Japanese women]] who wear diapers to avoid public restrooms. The article included an interview with a 25-year-old woman who had been wearing diapers \"instead of going to the toilet\" for a period of six months, \"wearing [them] almost every day.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u30ba\u30dc\u30e9\u306e\u6700\u7d42\u5f62\u304b\uff1f \u30aa\u30e0\u30c4\u5973\u5b50\u306e\u751f\u614b |url=http://nikkan-spa.jp/299209 |website=nikkan-spa.jp |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110609/http://nikkan-spa.jp/299209 |archive-date=October 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Skirt omorashi ===\n{{See also|Underwear fetishism}}\n\nSome individuals find it attractive when a woman wets herself in a [[skirt]], since it allows for [[upskirt]] views of the accident. This can combine with [[uniform fetishism]], and pornography with skirted performers dressed as high school girls and office workers is common, as well as depictions of skirted women in casual dress.\n\n===Fetish films===\n{{Main|Pink film}}\n\nIn order to avoid Japan's strict censorship laws, which limited depictions of actual sex and pubic hair, erotic films (known as ''pink films'') often relied on fetish elements which could skirt such restrictions. One such film, ''[[Terrifying Girls' High School: Lynch Law Classroom]]'' in 1973, would be the first to depict an omorashi scenario to a cinematic audience.\n\nAs the [[chronology of adult videos in Japan|AV]] (adult video) genre took hold in the 1980s, videos specifically devoted to omorashi began to appear. Several notable [[AV idols]] have starred in such scenes, including Sakura Sakurada. However, perhaps because of its softcore nature, omorashi never became a clearly pornographic genre.\n\nToday, Japanese omorashi fans also enjoy [[game shows|game show-style]] pornographic videos in which contestants must compete in various urine-holding challenges.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |url=http://www.kokoro-soft.com/dnanpa/pages/RVideos.html |title=The R Videos |publisher=Kokoro-soft.com |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The Giga<ref>{{Cite web|title=\u7121\u984c\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 |trans-title=Untitled Document|url=http://www.giga-freeks.net/new/giga/html/sakuhinn_eng/category/category_omorashi.htm |website=Giga-freeks.net|accessdate=July 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124042827/http://www.giga-freeks.net/new/giga/html/sakuhinn_eng/category/category_omorashi.htm |archivedate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> video company's \"Desperation Tournament\" series is an example of this kind of contest. One such activity is a panel of contestants competing to hold their bladders, or to guess which woman has to use the restroom the most.\n\n===Periodicals===\nSince the 1990s, magazine companies catering to the Japanese [[Kink (sexual)|kink]] community have produced a number of periodicals dedicated to omorashi subculture, including most notably [[:Ja:\u4e09\u548c\u51fa\u7248|Sanwa Publishing]]'s [[:ja:\u304a\u3082\u3089\u3057\u5036\u697d\u90e8|''Omorashi Club'']] (rendered phonetically as the [[wasei-eigo]] \u304a\u3082\u3089\u3057\u5036\u697d\u90e8, or ''Omorashi Kurabu''). First published September 22, 1994, ''Omorashi Club'''s success allowed Sanwa to [[Brand extension|extend]] the brand in 2006 to include a [[DVD magazine]]. The following year, the demand for material catering specifically to ''omutsu omorashi'' [[fandom]] led to further expansion with the spin-off periodical [[:ja:\u304a\u3080\u3064\u5036\u697d\u90e8|''Diapers Club'']] (\u304a\u3080\u3064\u5036\u697d\u90e8, or ''Omutsu Kurabu''). The [[scarcity]] of earlier issues of these magazines has caused them to become [[Collectable|collector's items]].\n\n===Anime and manga===\nJapanese-produced omorashi media also include [[comic book]]s and [[cartoons]]. These range from independently produced [[d\u014djinshi]] to large, commercially-produced [[manga]]. Some focus exclusively on omorashi stories, while others include only the occasional scene. Some contain obvious sexual themes and could be considered a form of [[H manga]], while others, like ''[[Iinari! Aibure-shon]]'', are well known to be suitable for all ages, since they have only mild [[ecchi]] content such as [[panchira]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|title=Iinari!

Omutsu Joshi'', which follows the typical [[Harem (genre)|Harem]] formula but features teenage characters who wet their panties and wear diapers.\n\nWetting scenes have existed in anime as early as the popular [[Doraemon (1973 anime)|Doraemon]] and [[Devilman#The TV Series|''Devilman'']] [[Animated series|series]] of the 1970s.\n\nHowever, these did not have the erotic context which characterizes modern omorashi media, since they predated the first full-blown anime pornography, which was not available until 1984, when the advent of the first [[H anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVAs]] such as Wonder Kids' ''[[Lolita Anime]]'' were made possible by the widespread availability of [[home video]]. One example of this later erotic context is the 1994 [[H anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] ''[[Vixens]]'', which features scenes of incontinence in a setting that is overtly sexual.\n\nThere are also sites where users can upload and watch their own pictures. It can be fanart or manga. Sometimes there are GIFs involved. The most known site for such fanart is omorashi.org. Those pictures are more likely the fanart of already existing anime or game characters (SAO or Touhou), but there are some own pictures too.\n\n===Eroge===\nAn ''[[eroge]]'' ('''ero'''tic '''ga'''me) is a Japanese [[Video game|video or computer game]] that features erotic content, usually in the form of [[anime]]-style artwork. The crossover of omorashi and anime fandom has produced a number of games such as ''Water Closet: The Forbidden Chamber'' which are specifically focused on omorashi. The limited popularity of omorashi in the West has prompted a number of programmers in the scene to create [[software patches]] for these Japanese games which translate the on screen text into English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shikkin128en.googlepages.com/|title=Google page|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome eroge game designers have capitalized on the omorashi fandom's [[niche market]] by including the occasional wetting scene in their games as a selling point.

[[Vice Media]] has documented an account of an omorashi community existing in the [[United States]] since at least 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzndbm/the-women-and-men-who-get-turned-on-by-needing-to-pee|title=The Women and Men Who Get Turned on by Needing to Pee|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}</ref> Outside Japan omorashi groups sometimes refer to their shared interest as \"desperation/wetting\" fetishism, often making a distinction between content featuring males and females.

There are still communities which focus on the more tame or [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] aspects of omorashi, which are generally focused on simple wetting in fully or semi-clothed situations without the overtly sexual models and situations. However, this softcore side is more rare in English-speaking communities than the more explicitly sexual omorashi content.\n\nThough there is generally no wide acceptance of incontinence-based play, recent studies in England have shown that urinary incontinence during sexual activity is a \"common, but rarely volunteered symptom\" observed in 24% of sexually active women. Moreover, no connection could be identified with any specific abnormality of bladder function associated with these symptoms, indicating that such leakage is both normal and healthy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Z.|last2=Bhola|first2=A.|last3=Starer|first3=P.|title=Urinary incontinence during orgasm|journal=Urology|volume=31 |issue=3 |year=1988|pages=279\u2013282|doi=10.1016/0090-4295(88)90160-4 |pmid=3347980}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hilton|first=P.|title=Urinary incontinence during sexual intercourse: a common, but rarely volunteered, symptom|journal=British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=377\u2013381|year=1988|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1988.tb06609.x |pmid=3382610 }}</ref>\n\n===Western publications and media===\nBecause of the western [[Social stigma|stigma]] in numerous countries against urine, omorashi subculture has not received such diverse exposure in non-Japanese media. In some countries, governments have even [[censorship|banned]] such materials. In [[New Zealand]] for example, creating, trading, distributing (e.g., making available on one's [[Internet pornography|web page]]) anything promoting or supporting \"the use of urine or excrement in association with degrading or dehumanising conduct or sexual conduct\" is a felony punishable by up to ten years in jail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0094/latest/DLM313407.html |title=Text of the law|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censorship.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Censorship-Compliance-Amendment-Act-2005?OpenDocument |title=Description of ten-year penalty|website=Censorship.dia.govt.nz|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, urination is a common fetish in pornography; the 1915 film ''[[A Free Ride]]'', widely considered the first pornographic film made in the USA, contains scenes of urination.\n\n====Print====\nAn early example of urination and skirt-wetting appearing in a sexualized context in the west can be found in the 1928 [[erotic novel]] ''[[Story of the Eye]]''.\n\nOmorashi periodicals outside of Japan include the Australia-based, internationally distributed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wetset.net/Wet_Set_New_Magazine.htm|title=Wet Set Magazine|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}</ref> ''Wet Set Magazine''.

The focus on clothed (rather than overtly sexual images) makes [[garment fetishism]] a prominent feature in most omorashi erotica: commonly featured outfits include [[school uniforms]], those worn by [[suit and tie fetishism|working professionals]], and other people attempting to look dignified before succumbing to the need to [[urinate]]. \n\nFetishists who are into this kink may have specific scenarios they enjoy, such as while waiting in line for a bathroom or just doing it for fun in front of the toilet. Regardless of their personal wetting preferences, everyone who is into this kink enjoys watching someone wet themselves or have an accident in clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Exploring the World of Pee Fetishism|url=https://www.kinkly.com/exploring-the-world-of-pee-fetishism/2/15698|website=Kinkly.com|accessdate=November 3, 2019|}}</ref>\n\n==Japanese subculture==\nThere are many ways in which omorashi fetishism is practiced in Japan.\n\n===Yagai===\nOne of the variations is known as ''omorashi yagai'', which translates as \"to wet oneself outdoors (or publicly).\" A further variation includes ''yagai h\u014dny\u014d'', or \"outdoor (or public) urination\", in which the subject publicly removes their clothes to urinate. Other ''yagai h\u014dny\u014d'' practitioners operate much like [[graffiti]] artists, attempting public urination acts without being caught.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hentai dictionary: Japanese perversions, fetishes and AV slang|url=http://www.hellodamage.com/homedespot/Adictionary.htm |website=Hellodamage.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427073433/http://www.hellodamage.com/homedespot/Adictionary.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Diapers===\nAnother variation of omorashi play is ''omutsu omorashi'' (\u304a\u3080\u3064\u304a\u3082\u3089\u3057) or ''omutsu play'' (\u304a\u3080\u3064\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4), less commonly called ''oshime omorashi'' (\u304a\u3057\u3081\u304a\u3082\u3089\u3057), both of which translate as \"to wet oneself in a diaper.\" This omutsu variation is essentially the same as the standard omorashi, except that the participants are wearing a [[adult diaper|diaper]]. Diapers may be favorable for public wetting because they render it more discreet and eliminate mess, and their use is not limited specifically to those with a [[diaper fetish]]. However, omorashi fetishists specifically interested in this aspect of the subculture could be considered a Japanese variation of the diaper lover community.\n\nJapanese acceptance of adult diaper use is comparatively high, with the market for such products growing as much as 6\u201310% a year.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Adult Diapers To Outsell Baby Diapers in Japan By 2020: Report|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/11/adult-diaper-japan_n_3580553.html |work=HuffPost|date=July 11, 2013}}</ref> However, these are largely intended for and worn by the elderly, with the growth due to [[aging of Japan|Japan's aging population]], and younger people wearing these have met with some criticism. In 2012, the Japanese magazine ''SPA'' ran an article entitled \"The Ultimate Form of Slob\", which criticized the trend of young [[Japanese women]] who wear diapers to avoid public restrooms. The article included an interview with a 25-year-old woman who had been wearing diapers \"instead of going to the toilet\" for a period of six months, \"wearing [them] almost every day.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u30ba\u30dc\u30e9\u306e\u6700\u7d42\u5f62\u304b\uff1f \u30aa\u30e0\u30c4\u5973\u5b50\u306e\u751f\u614b |url=http://nikkan-spa.jp/299209 |website=nikkan-spa.jp |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110609/http://nikkan-spa.jp/299209 |archive-date=October 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Skirt omorashi ===\n{{See also|Underwear fetishism}}\n\nSome individuals find it attractive when a woman wets herself in a [[skirt]], since it allows for [[upskirt]] views of the accident. This can combine with [[uniform fetishism]], and pornography with skirted performers dressed as high school girls and office workers is common, as well as depictions of skirted women in casual dress.\n\n===Fetish films===\n{{Main|Pink film}}\n\nIn order to avoid Japan's strict censorship laws, which limited depictions of actual sex and pubic hair, erotic films (known as ''pink films'') often relied on fetish elements which could skirt such restrictions. One such film, ''[[Terrifying Girls' High School: Lynch Law Classroom]]'' in 1973, would be the first to depict an omorashi scenario to a cinematic audience.\n\nAs the [[chronology of adult videos in Japan|AV]] (adult video) genre took hold in the 1980s, videos specifically devoted to omorashi began to appear. Several notable [[AV idols]] have starred in such scenes, including Sakura Sakurada. However, perhaps because of its softcore nature, omorashi never became a clearly pornographic genre.\n\nToday, Japanese omorashi fans also enjoy [[game shows|game show-style]] pornographic videos in which contestants must compete in various urine-holding challenges.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |url=http://www.kokoro-soft.com/dnanpa/pages/RVideos.html |title=The R Videos |publisher=Kokoro-soft.com |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The Giga<ref>{{Cite web|title=\u7121\u984c\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 |trans-title=Untitled Document|url=http://www.giga-freeks.net/new/giga/html/sakuhinn_eng/category/category_omorashi.htm |website=Giga-freeks.net|accessdate=July 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124042827/http://www.giga-freeks.net/new/giga/html/sakuhinn_eng/category/category_omorashi.htm |archivedate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> video company's \"Desperation Tournament\" series is an example of this kind of contest. One such activity is a panel of contestants competing to hold their bladders, or to guess which woman has to use the restroom the most.\n\n===Periodicals===\nSince the 1990s, magazine companies catering to the Japanese [[Kink (sexual)|kink]] community have produced a number of periodicals dedicated to omorashi subculture, including most notably [[:Ja:\u4e09\u548c\u51fa\u7248|Sanwa Publishing]]'s [[:ja:\u304a\u3082\u3089\u3057\u5036\u697d\u90e8|''Omorashi Club'']] (rendered phonetically as the [[wasei-eigo]] \u304a\u3082\u3089\u3057\u5036\u697d\u90e8, or ''Omorashi Kurabu''). First published September 22, 1994, ''Omorashi Club'''s success allowed Sanwa to [[Brand extension|extend]] the brand in 2006 to include a [[DVD magazine]]. The following year, the demand for material catering specifically to ''omutsu omorashi'' [[fandom]] led to further expansion with the spin-off periodical [[:ja:\u304a\u3080\u3064\u5036\u697d\u90e8|''Diapers Club'']] (\u304a\u3080\u3064\u5036\u697d\u90e8, or ''Omutsu Kurabu''). The [[scarcity]] of earlier issues of these magazines has caused them to become [[Collectable|collector's items]].\n\n===Anime and manga===\nJapanese-produced omorashi media also include [[comic book]]s and [[cartoons]]. These range from independently produced [[d\u014djinshi]] to large, commercially-produced [[manga]]. Some focus exclusively on omorashi stories, while others include only the occasional scene. Some contain obvious sexual themes and could be considered a form of [[H manga]], while others, like ''[[Iinari! Aibure-shon]]'', are well known to be suitable for all ages, since they have only mild [[ecchi]] content such as [[panchira]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|title=Iinari!

Omutsu Joshi'', which follows the typical [[Harem (genre)|Harem]] formula but features teenage characters who wet their panties and wear diapers.\n\nWetting scenes have existed in anime as early as the popular [[Doraemon (1973 anime)|Doraemon]] and [[Devilman#The TV Series|''Devilman'']] [[Animated series|series]] of the 1970s.\n\nHowever, these did not have the erotic context which characterizes modern omorashi media, since they predated the first full-blown anime pornography, which was not available until 1984, when the advent of the first [[H anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVAs]] such as Wonder Kids' ''[[Lolita Anime]]'' were made possible by the widespread availability of [[home video]]. One example of this later erotic context is the 1994 [[H anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] ''[[Vixens]]'', which features scenes of incontinence in a setting that is overtly sexual.\n\nThere are also sites where users can upload and watch their own pictures. It can be fanart or manga. Sometimes there are GIFs involved. The most known site for such fanart is omorashi.org. Those pictures are more likely the fanart of already existing anime or game characters (SAO or Touhou), but there are some own pictures too.\n\n===Eroge===\nAn ''[[eroge]]'' ('''ero'''tic '''ga'''me) is a Japanese [[Video game|video or computer game]] that features erotic content, usually in the form of [[anime]]-style artwork. The crossover of omorashi and anime fandom has produced a number of games such as ''Water Closet: The Forbidden Chamber'' which are specifically focused on omorashi. The limited popularity of omorashi in the West has prompted a number of programmers in the scene to create [[software patches]] for these Japanese games which translate the on screen text into English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shikkin128en.googlepages.com/|title=Google page|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome eroge game designers have capitalized on the omorashi fandom's [[niche market]] by including the occasional wetting scene in their games as a selling point.

[[Vice Media]] has documented an account of an omorashi community existing in the [[United States]] since at least 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzndbm/the-women-and-men-who-get-turned-on-by-needing-to-pee|title=The Women and Men Who Get Turned on by Needing to Pee|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}</ref> Outside Japan omorashi groups sometimes refer to their shared interest as \"desperation/wetting\" fetishism, often making a distinction between content featuring males and females.

There are still communities which focus on the more tame or [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] aspects of omorashi, which are generally focused on simple wetting in fully or semi-clothed situations without the overtly sexual models and situations. However, this softcore side is more rare in English-speaking communities than the more explicitly sexual omorashi content.\n\nThough there is generally no wide acceptance of incontinence-based play, recent studies in England have shown that urinary incontinence during sexual activity is a \"common, but rarely volunteered symptom\" observed in 24% of sexually active women. Moreover, no connection could be identified with any specific abnormality of bladder function associated with these symptoms, indicating that such leakage is both normal and healthy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Z.|last2=Bhola|first2=A.|last3=Starer|first3=P.|title=Urinary incontinence during orgasm|journal=Urology|volume=31 |issue=3 |year=1988|pages=279\u2013282|doi=10.1016/0090-4295(88)90160-4 |pmid=3347980}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hilton|first=P.|title=Urinary incontinence during sexual intercourse: a common, but rarely volunteered, symptom|journal=British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=377\u2013381|year=1988|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1988.tb06609.x |pmid=3382610 }}</ref>\n\n===Western publications and media===\nBecause of the western [[Social stigma|stigma]] in numerous countries against urine, omorashi subculture has not received such diverse exposure in non-Japanese media. In some countries, governments have even [[censorship|banned]] such materials. In [[New Zealand]] for example, creating, trading, distributing (e.g., making available on one's [[Internet pornography|web page]]) anything promoting or supporting \"the use of urine or excrement in association with degrading or dehumanising conduct or sexual conduct\" is a felony punishable by up to ten years in jail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0094/latest/DLM313407.html |title=Text of the law|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censorship.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Censorship-Compliance-Amendment-Act-2005?OpenDocument |title=Description of ten-year penalty|website=Censorship.dia.govt.nz|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, urination is a common fetish in pornography; the 1915 film ''[[A Free Ride]]'', widely considered the first pornographic film made in the USA, contains scenes of urination.\n\n====Print====\nAn early example of urination and skirt-wetting appearing in a sexualized context in the west can be found in the 1928 [[erotic novel]] ''[[Story of the Eye]]''.\n\nOmorashi periodicals outside of Japan include the Australia-based, internationally distributed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wetset.net/Wet_Set_New_Magazine.htm|title=Wet Set Magazine|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}</ref> ''Wet Set Magazine''.

Huron is also home to Area offices for state offices.\n\n==History==\nHuron, located in east central South Dakota, is a result of railroad and land booms in the 1880s.  The early history of the town is closely linked with the [[Chicago and Northwestern Railway]].  At the direction of [[Marvin Hughitt]], general manager of the railroad, the west bank of the James River was selected as the division headquarters of the railroad.  The company gained title to {{convert|880|acre|km2}} of land at that location. Huron was named for the Huron Indians.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_lKAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of the Origin of the Place Names in Nine Northwestern States | year=1908 | pages=11}}</ref> Exactly who gave it the name was never established, apparently either Marvin Hughitt or someone in the Chicago office of the C&NW railroad company.\n\nThe original [[plat]] covered 11 blocks from 1st Street to 3rd Street and from Iowa Avenue SE to Ohio Avenue SW. Huron's first settler was John Cain, a practical printer from Troy, New York.  He learned in Chicago, from the railroad people, that they would have their chief town and operating headquarters at their James River crossing.\n\nFrom 1880 until the capital was permanently located at [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]] in 1904, Huron was in the thick of the fight for the honor of being the capital city. Campbell and Winter Parks are the only remaining properties that were once designated capital grounds. Located between the two parks, [[Victorian house]]s originally built around 1906 occupy the city block on the land originally slated for the capitol building.\n\nHuron is the home to a handful of celebrities. [[Cheryl Ladd]] replaced [[Farrah Fawcett]] of the original ''Charlie's Angels''. [[Gladys Pyle]] was the first female member of the [[South Dakota House of Representatives]] and the first Republican woman in the US Senate. [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] was the Democratic nominee for president in 1968 and served as vice president under Lyndon B. Johnson.\n*Chronology:\n**1879 \u2013 The town site was located\n**1880 \u2013 Town site surveyed and platted\n**1881 \u2013 First town government formed - a board of four trustees, a town clerk, a justice of the peace, one marshal and a surveyor\n**1882 \u2013 Alderman system of government adopted\n**1883 \u2013 Incorporated as the City of Huron - the city still operates under the original charter and seal\n**1910 \u2013 Changed from alderman to city commission form of government\n**1935 \u2013 City manager form of government adopted\n\n==Notable people==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Adolphus W.

Under the commissioner form of government the board of commissioners consists of a mayor and four commissioners, who are all elected at large for three-year terms. The commission has control over all departments of the city and can make and enforce rules and regulations which it may see fit for the organization, management, and operation of the departments of the city. Responsibilities are divided into the following areas: Public Safety Commissioner, Public Works Commissioner, Utilities Commissioner, and Finance Commissioner with each commissioner having oversight in each respective area.\n\nHuron has a federal building, field offices that is home to [[Social Security Administration]], [[Western Area Power Administration]], [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], [[General Services Administration]], [[Farm Service Agency]] and the [[USDA]]. Huron is also home to Area offices for state offices.\n\n==History==\nHuron, located in east central South Dakota, is a result of railroad and land booms in the 1880s.  The early history of the town is closely linked with the [[Chicago and Northwestern Railway]].  At the direction of [[Marvin Hughitt]], general manager of the railroad, the west bank of the James River was selected as the division headquarters of the railroad.  The company gained title to {{convert|880|acre|km2}} of land at that location. Huron was named for the Huron Indians.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_lKAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of the Origin of the Place Names in Nine Northwestern States | year=1908 | pages=11}}</ref> Exactly who gave it the name was never established, apparently either Marvin Hughitt or someone in the Chicago office of the C&NW railroad company.\n\nThe original [[plat]] covered 11 blocks from 1st Street to 3rd Street and from Iowa Avenue SE to Ohio Avenue SW. Huron's first settler was John Cain, a practical printer from Troy, New York.  He learned in Chicago, from the railroad people, that they would have their chief town and operating headquarters at their James River crossing.\n\nFrom 1880 until the capital was permanently located at [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]] in 1904, Huron was in the thick of the fight for the honor of being the capital city. Campbell and Winter Parks are the only remaining properties that were once designated capital grounds. Located between the two parks, [[Victorian house]]s originally built around 1906 occupy the city block on the land originally slated for the capitol building.\n\nHuron is the home to a handful of celebrities. [[Cheryl Ladd]] replaced [[Farrah Fawcett]] of the original ''Charlie's Angels''. [[Gladys Pyle]] was the first female member of the [[South Dakota House of Representatives]] and the first Republican woman in the US Senate. [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] was the Democratic nominee for president in 1968 and served as vice president under Lyndon B. Johnson.\n*Chronology:\n**1879 \u2013 The town site was located\n**1880 \u2013 Town site surveyed and platted\n**1881 \u2013 First town government formed - a board of four trustees, a town clerk, a justice of the peace, one marshal and a surveyor\n**1882 \u2013 Alderman system of government adopted\n**1883 \u2013 Incorporated as the City of Huron - the city still operates under the original charter and seal\n**1910 \u2013 Changed from alderman to city commission form of government\n**1935 \u2013 City manager form of government adopted\n\n==Notable people==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Adolphus W.

The film stars [[Adam Sandler]] as Howard Ratner, a Jewish jeweler and gambling addict in New York City's [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond District|Diamond District]], who must retrieve an expensive gem he purchased to pay off his debts. The film also stars<!--Please keep the starring list the same as the one listed for the film's trailer--> [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Julia Fox (actress)|Julia Fox]], and [[Eric Bogosian]]. Filming took place from September to November 2018. The [[Uncut Gems (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|original score]] was composed by [[Daniel Lopatin]].\n\n''Uncut Gems'' had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019. It entered into a [[limited release]] in the United States on December 13, 2019, before a [[wide release]] on December 25, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film received critical acclaim, with its screenplay, direction, editing, Sandler's performance and [[Darius Khondji]]'s cinematography receiving much of the praise. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2019#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2019]], with Sandler also winning the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]]. It became A24's highest-grossing film domestically with $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2010, [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jewish]] miners retrieve a rare [[Opal|black opal]] from the Welo mine in Africa. In 2012, gambling addict Howard Ratner runs KMH, a jewelry store in New York's [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond%20District|Diamond District]]. He struggles to pay off gambling debts, including the $100,000 he owes to Arno, his [[loan shark]] brother-in-law. His domestic life is split between Dinah, his estranged wife who has agreed to a divorce after [[Passover]], and his girlfriend Julia, an employee at KMH. Howard's business associate Demany recruits basketball superstar [[Kevin Garnett]] to visit KMH, and the Ethiopian opal, which Howard had ordered, coincidentally arrives while Garnett is in the store. He shows the opal to Garnett who becomes obsessed with it, insisting on holding onto it for good luck at his [[2012 NBA playoffs#(4)%20Boston%20Celtics%20vs%20(8)%20Philadelphia%2076ers|game that night]]. Howard reluctantly agrees, accepting Garnett's [[NBA Championship ring|NBA championship ring]] as collateral.   \n\nImmediately after Garnett leaves, Howard pawns the ring and places a [[Parlay (gambling)|6-way parlay]] on Garnett playing extraordinarily well in that night's game. Howard wins $600,000 but is ambushed at his daughter's school play by Arno and his bodyguards Phil and Nico. Arno reveals that he placed a stop on Howard's bet as it was made with money owed to him. Phil and Nico strip Howard naked and lock him in the trunk of his [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], forcing him to call Dinah for help. Howard tracks down Demany who is at a nightclub party hosted by [[The Weeknd]]. Demany says that Garnett still has the opal, angering Howard. Furthermore, Howard discovers Julia and The Weeknd snorting [[cocaine]] together in a bathroom, causing a fistfight between Howard and The Weeknd. Howard demands that Julia move out of his apartment. After an awkward Passover dinner, Howard asks Dinah to give him another shot, which she immediately rejects.\n\nGarnett returns the opal before the auction and offers to purchase it for $175,000, but Howard refuses, given the substantially larger appraisal. Just before the auction starts, Howard discovers the opal has been appraised for significantly less than his initial estimate of $1,000,000. He convinces his father-in-law Gooey to bid on the gem to drive up the price, but the plan backfires when Garnett fails to top Gooey's final bid. A furious Gooey gives Howard the opal before Arno, Phil, and Nico confront Howard outside the auction house and assault him. Howard returns to KMH, bloody and in tears, before Julia arrives and comforts him, reconciling in the process.\n\nHoward learns that Garnett is still willing to purchase the opal; as soon as the sale is made, Howard immediately bets the proceeds on a 3-way parlay on Garnett having a strong Game 7 performance. He tells Julia to travel by helicopter to [[Mohegan Sun]] to place the bet for him. She narrowly escapes as Arno, Phil and Nico come to KMH to collect. The thugs find Howard in his office and threaten him, but he refuses to call Julia and cancel the bet. Furious, the three attempt to pursue her, but Howard locks them in the store's [[Mantrap (access control)|mantrap]]. Howard excitedly watches the game on TV while Arno, Phil and Nico resignedly watch from the mantrap. \n\nThe Celtics win the game, winning Howard $1.2 million. An ecstatic Howard frees Arno, Phil and Nico from the mantrap, but an enraged Phil shoots Howard in the face, killing him. Arno protests and tries to escape but Phil shoots and kills him too. Julia hurriedly leaves the casino with Howard's winnings while Phil and Nico loot KMH.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Howard Ratner, a Jewish-American [[Diamond District, Manhattan|Diamond District]] jeweler who is addicted to [[gambling]]\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Demany, Howard's assistant, who recruits clients\n* [[Julia Fox (actress)|Julia Fox]] as Julia De Fiore, Howard's employee and girlfriend\n* [[Kevin Garnett]] as himself, a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] for the [[Boston Celtics]]\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as Dinah Ratner, Howard's wife\n* [[Eric Bogosian]] as Arno, Howard's brother in law and a [[loan shark]]\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Gooey, Howard's father-in-law\n* Keith Williams Richards as Phil, Arno's quick-tempered henchman\n* Jonathan Aranbayev as Eddie Ratner, Howard's older son\n* Noa Fisher as Marcel Ratner, Howard's daughter\n* [[The Weeknd|Abel Tesfaye]] as himself, a then-rising [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] star better known as The Weeknd<!--\nAbove cast is credited in this order in the film's opening credits-->\n* [[Mike Francesa]] as Gary, Howard's bookie\n* Jacob Igielski as Beni Ratner, Howard's younger son\n* Wayne Diamond as Wayne, a wealthy gambler who takes a liking to Julia\n* [[Josh Ostrovsky]] as Noah\n* Benjy Kleiner as Aaron\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as Lexus\n* Tommy Kominik as Nico\n*Louis Arias as Buddy\n* Keren Shemel as Elline Goldfarb\n* Sahar Bibiyan as Ida\n\nAdditionally, [[John Amos]], [[Ca$h Out]], Joe Iskhakov, and [[Trinidad James]] appear as themselves, with Amos appearing as Howard's neighbor and the others as acquaintances of Demany.

The film stars [[Adam Sandler]] as Howard Ratner, a Jewish jeweler and gambling addict in New York City's [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond District|Diamond District]], who must retrieve an expensive gem he purchased to pay off his debts. The film also stars<!--Please keep the starring list the same as the one listed for the film's trailer--> [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Julia Fox (actress)|Julia Fox]], and [[Eric Bogosian]]. Filming took place from September to November 2018. The [[Uncut Gems (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|original score]] was composed by [[Daniel Lopatin]].\n\n''Uncut Gems'' had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019. It entered into a [[limited release]] in the United States on December 13, 2019, before a [[wide release]] on December 25, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film received critical acclaim, with its screenplay, direction, editing, Sandler's performance and [[Darius Khondji]]'s cinematography receiving much of the praise. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2019#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2019]], with Sandler also winning the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]]. It became A24's highest-grossing film domestically with $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2010, [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jewish]] miners retrieve a rare [[Opal|black opal]] from the Welo mine in Africa. In 2012, gambling addict Howard Ratner runs KMH, a jewelry store in New York's [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond%20District|Diamond District]]. He struggles to pay off gambling debts, including the $100,000 he owes to Arno, his [[loan shark]] brother-in-law. His domestic life is split between Dinah, his estranged wife who has agreed to a divorce after [[Passover]], and his girlfriend Julia, an employee at KMH. Howard's business associate Demany recruits basketball superstar [[Kevin Garnett]] to visit KMH, and the Ethiopian opal, which Howard had ordered, coincidentally arrives while Garnett is in the store. He shows the opal to Garnett who becomes obsessed with it, insisting on holding onto it for good luck at his [[2012 NBA playoffs#(4)%20Boston%20Celtics%20vs%20(8)%20Philadelphia%2076ers|game that night]]. Howard reluctantly agrees, accepting Garnett's [[NBA Championship ring|NBA championship ring]] as collateral.   \n\nImmediately after Garnett leaves, Howard pawns the ring and places a [[Parlay (gambling)|6-way parlay]] on Garnett playing extraordinarily well in that night's game. Howard wins $600,000 but is ambushed at his daughter's school play by Arno and his bodyguards Phil and Nico. Arno reveals that he placed a stop on Howard's bet as it was made with money owed to him. Phil and Nico strip Howard naked and lock him in the trunk of his [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], forcing him to call Dinah for help. Howard tracks down Demany who is at a nightclub party hosted by [[The Weeknd]]. Demany says that Garnett still has the opal, angering Howard. Furthermore, Howard discovers Julia and The Weeknd snorting [[cocaine]] together in a bathroom, causing a fistfight between Howard and The Weeknd. Howard demands that Julia move out of his apartment. After an awkward Passover dinner, Howard asks Dinah to give him another shot, which she immediately rejects.\n\nGarnett returns the opal before the auction and offers to purchase it for $175,000, but Howard refuses, given the substantially larger appraisal. Just before the auction starts, Howard discovers the opal has been appraised for significantly less than his initial estimate of $1,000,000. He convinces his father-in-law Gooey to bid on the gem to drive up the price, but the plan backfires when Garnett fails to top Gooey's final bid. A furious Gooey gives Howard the opal before Arno, Phil, and Nico confront Howard outside the auction house and assault him. Howard returns to KMH, bloody and in tears, before Julia arrives and comforts him, reconciling in the process.\n\nHoward learns that Garnett is still willing to purchase the opal; as soon as the sale is made, Howard immediately bets the proceeds on a 3-way parlay on Garnett having a strong Game 7 performance. He tells Julia to travel by helicopter to [[Mohegan Sun]] to place the bet for him. She narrowly escapes as Arno, Phil and Nico come to KMH to collect. The thugs find Howard in his office and threaten him, but he refuses to call Julia and cancel the bet. Furious, the three attempt to pursue her, but Howard locks them in the store's [[Mantrap (access control)|mantrap]]. Howard excitedly watches the game on TV while Arno, Phil and Nico resignedly watch from the mantrap. \n\nThe Celtics win the game, winning Howard $1.2 million. An ecstatic Howard frees Arno, Phil and Nico from the mantrap, but an enraged Phil shoots Howard in the face, killing him. Arno protests and tries to escape but Phil shoots and kills him too. Julia hurriedly leaves the casino with Howard's winnings while Phil and Nico loot KMH.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Howard Ratner, a Jewish-American [[Diamond District, Manhattan|Diamond District]] jeweler who is addicted to [[gambling]]\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Demany, Howard's assistant, who recruits clients\n* [[Julia Fox (actress)|Julia Fox]] as Julia De Fiore, Howard's employee and girlfriend\n* [[Kevin Garnett]] as himself, a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] for the [[Boston Celtics]]\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as Dinah Ratner, Howard's wife\n* [[Eric Bogosian]] as Arno, Howard's brother in law and a [[loan shark]]\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Gooey, Howard's father-in-law\n* Keith Williams Richards as Phil, Arno's quick-tempered henchman\n* Jonathan Aranbayev as Eddie Ratner, Howard's older son\n* Noa Fisher as Marcel Ratner, Howard's daughter\n* [[The Weeknd|Abel Tesfaye]] as himself, a then-rising [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] star better known as The Weeknd<!--\nAbove cast is credited in this order in the film's opening credits-->\n* [[Mike Francesa]] as Gary, Howard's bookie\n* Jacob Igielski as Beni Ratner, Howard's younger son\n* Wayne Diamond as Wayne, a wealthy gambler who takes a liking to Julia\n* [[Josh Ostrovsky]] as Noah\n* Benjy Kleiner as Aaron\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as Lexus\n* Tommy Kominik as Nico\n*Louis Arias as Buddy\n* Keren Shemel as Elline Goldfarb\n* Sahar Bibiyan as Ida\n\nAdditionally, [[John Amos]], [[Ca$h Out]], Joe Iskhakov, and [[Trinidad James]] appear as themselves, with Amos appearing as Howard's neighbor and the others as acquaintances of Demany.

In 1119, on the death of [[Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VII]], the House of Flanders ceased to rule in Flanders. But in 1191, the House of Flanders recovered the title of Count of Flanders with [[Baldwin VIII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VIII]] (Baldwin V of Hainaut). The dynasty established the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]]. It also ruled briefly the County of Namur (1188-1212).

In 1119, on the death of [[Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VII]], the House of Flanders ceased to rule in Flanders. But in 1191, the House of Flanders recovered the title of Count of Flanders with [[Baldwin VIII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VIII]] (Baldwin V of Hainaut). The dynasty established the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]]. It also ruled briefly the County of Namur (1188-1212). The House of Flanders became extinct in 1280 with the death of [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders|Margaret II]].\n\nA cadet branch, the House of Boulogne, ruled over the [[County of Boulogne]]. Members of this house joined the [[First Crusade]], established the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and produced its first kings.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{Tree list}}\n*[[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin I, Count of Flanders|Baldwin I Iron Arm]], [[Count of Flanders]] (\u2020 879)\n** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II the Bald]], Count of Flanders (\u2020 918)\n***[[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf I the Great]], Count of Flanders (\u2020 965)\n**** Elftrude, born circa 932, married in 964 to [[File:Blason_ville_fr_Guines_(PDC).png|15px]] Siegfried, Count of Gu\u00eenes (\u2020 965)\n**** Hildegarde (934 \u2020 990), married in 943 to [[File:Counts of Holland Arms.svg|15px]] [[Dirk II, Count of Holland]] (930 \u2020 988)\n**** Egbert (937 \u2020 953)\n**** Liutgarde (938 \u2020 964), married in 950 to Wichmann IV, Count of Hamaland and Ghent.\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}}  [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin III, Count of Flanders|Baldwin III]], Count of Flanders (\u2020 962)\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}}  [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Arnulf II, Count of Flanders|Arnulf II]], Count of Flanders (\u2020 988)\n****** Mathilda (\u2020 995 or before)\n****** {{Tree list/final branch}}  [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders|Baldwin IV the Bearded]] (v.980 \u2020 1035), Count of Flanders (\u2020 1035)\n******* [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders|Baldwin V ''of Lille'']], Count of Flanders (\u2020 1067)\n******** [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[File:Blason fr Hainaut ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VI the Good]], (1030 -
