He is the biggest animal in the jungle and Zooter's best friend. He is able to suck improbable quantities of liquids up his trunk and spray them distances of up to half a mile or more.\n*Bungo (voiced by [[Keith Wickham]]) \u2013 A yellow bunny with brown ears who loves to make signs and put them all over the jungle. He is very good at geography, and knows the jungle better than anyone.  He is also the only wheeler that is good at jumping, being able to leap many times his own height into the air.\n\n===Supporting===\n*Taxicrab (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2013 A red crab who loves to dance and makes the greatest smoothies in the jungle. He is the only wheeler that is able to drive sideways. Despite the fact that Toadhog is often impatient, Taxicrab tolerates him the most.\n*Carla (voiced by [[Laraine Newman]]) \u2013 An orange koala who owns a grocery shop.\n*Crocker (voiced by [[Keith Wickham]]) \u2013 A green crocodile fire chief with a lisp who wears a yellow helmet with a red flashing light on top. He has some skill at gardening and knows how to make compost.\n*Miss Jolly (voiced by [[Amanda Symonds]]) \u2013 A black and white zebra school teacher. She is one of the oldest and wisest of the Wheelers. She is the only one to wear glasses.\n*The Beetlebugs \u2013 The junior Wheelers. Their speech is mostly synchronized. Their names are Bluey, Redie, Greenie, Goldie and Orangy.\n*Hippobus (voiced by [[Amanda Symonds]]) \u2013 A yellow hippopotamus school bus who usually carries the Beetlebugs to school.\n*Bobby (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) \u2013 A  toucan police chief.

His talent is digging and repairing roads with his dozer blade.\n*Lance (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) \u2013 A purple rhinoceros ambulance.\n*Toadhog (voiced by [[Ron Orbach]]) \u2013 A  grumpy, but friendly toad who likes worms and flies. He has a long, sticky tongue that can shoot out a long way to grab things. His water wheel powers the generator for all of the lights (including the traffic lights) and he has a supplementary generator that is used to power the Zipsmas lights. He loses his patience with almost everyone except Taxicrab, mainly because Taxicrab is the most tolerant of him.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Jungle Junction episodes}}\n\n===[[Christmas]] special===\nA Christmas special called \"The Night Before Zipsmas\" aired 5 December 2016 showing the wheelers getting ready for Christmas and trying to get to read the book \"The Night Before Zipsmas\".

It shows Ellyvan trying to find a gift for Zooter.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150704010833/http://disneyjunior.disney.com/jungle-junction Jungle Junction Official Site]\n* [http://www2.disney.co.uk/DisneyChannel/playhouse/junglejunction Jungle Junction] at [[Disney.co.uk]]\n* [http://www.disney.es/DisneyChannel/playhouse/junglejunction/ Jungle Junction] at [[Disney.es]]\n* {{tv.com show|jungle-junction}}\n* {{imdb episode|1443631}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before = [[Special Agent Oso]] | title = [[Playhouse Disney around the world|Playhouse Disney]] Shows |years = 2009|  after =[[Where Is Warehouse Mouse?]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Playhouse Disney}}\n{{Disney Junior}}\n\n[[Category:2000s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:2009 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2012 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American children's television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American children's television series]]\n[[Category:2009 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2012 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:American computer-animated television series]]\n[[Category:American preschool education television series]]\n[[Category:British animated television programmes featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:British children's animated fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:British computer-animated television series]]\n[[Category:British preschool education television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior shows]]\n[[Category:Television series by Disney]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about pigs]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about elephants]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about rabbits and hares]]\n[[Category:Disney animated television series]]\n[[Category:Jungles in fiction]]\n{{Navbox with collapsible groups\n| name=Cartoon Network original programming\n| title=[[Cartoon Network]] [[List of programs broadcast by Cartoon Network|original programming]]\n| listclass=hlist\n| state=autocollapse\n| nowrapitems = yes\n| selected    = {{{1|}}}\n| group1=Current\n| list1=\n* ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' (since 2011)\n* ''[[Teen Titans Go!

He is also regarded as a significant figure in the history of [[cassette culture]] and [[DIY music]]. His most popular work is ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'' (1993), produced by [[Andy Partridge]] of [[XTC]].\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===1973\u20131979===\nIn the summer of 1973, a 20-year-old Newell joined [[Colchester]] [[glam rock]] [[cover band]] '''Plod''' as their lead singer, replacing founder member [[Steve Travis|Steve Greenfield]]. Plod was signed to London-based indie label Banjul Records in early 1975, and quickly began recording tracks for an album. However, contractual irregularities and financial problems at the label prevented the album from being finished or released,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and the band broke up within a few months of being signed. In 2003, one track from the sessions (\"Neo City\") was released on a 70s glam-rock compilation CD titled ''[[Velvet Tinmine]]''. This track was credited to ''The'' Plod, and remains the only officially issued work by the band.\n\nNewell then joined '''Gypp''', a pop-oriented progressive rock band, as lead singer. Gypp also played abroad and became popular in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia area thanks to their live performances. Gypp issued one 3-song 7-inch EP in 1978, but their music was out of step with the punk-oriented trends of the UK music scene at the time and the EP received a negative review in the ''[[New Musical Express]].''  Demoralised, Newell left the band. By his own account, he then became a \"musical recluse\", staying in the studio and creating new songs but not playing live gigs for many years.\n\n===1979\u20131992===\nIn the late seventies, Newell led a four-piece rock combo called '''The Stray Trolleys'''. They recorded material in 1979 and 1980, but it was not released until after the band had broken up.\n\nIn the meantime, Newell issued his first solo single (\"Young Jobless\" b/w \"Sylvie in Toytown\") on vinyl in 1980. By the end of 1980, he was collaborating with Lawrence \"Lol\" Elliot as '''The Cleaners from Venus''', a band that mostly released their work on cassettes outside the traditional music distribution channels.\n\nBy 1983, The Cleaners from Venus had evolved into a band with a floating line-up that featured Newell as its only constant. The band still primarily issued material on cassette, got signed to the West German independent label Modell Records for one vinyl album (''Under Wartime Conditions'') and ultimately to the German leg of [[RCA]] Records which released two albums (''Going to England'', ''Town and Country'').\n\n[[Giles Smith]] joined Newell as the only other official member of Cleaners From Venus between 1986 and 1988, and in 1987, Newell returned to performing live under The Cleaners of<!-- Is \"of\" deliberate here, or just a typo for \"from\"? --> Venus banner. As well, while regularly releasing Cleaners From Venus material on cassette, through the 1980s Newell also occasionally released cassette singles and albums under his own name. On these solo releases he was usually the only musician.\n\nIn spring 1988 Newell and Nelson (Peter Nice) formed the [[Musical_ensemble#Two_parts|duo]] '''The Brotherhood of Lizards''', self-releasing the [[Mini-LP|mini-album]] ''The Brotherhood of Lizards'' that same year, followed by the album ''Lizardland'' released on [[Independent record label|independent label]] Deltic Records in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Martin |title=Lizard Tails -- Martin Looks Back |url=http://www.stevedix.de/newell/overview.html |website=Martin Newell's website |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> To support the album the duo embarked on a [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] promotional tour, cycling over 1000 miles across southern England between October 1989 and February 1990 to make local radio appearances and do local newspaper interviews, while also [[Street performance|busking]] and performing gigs. The uniqueness of this \"green tour\" caught the attention of the [[Media of the United Kingdom|mainstream media]] with the duo making half a dozen televison appearances, and interviews with them appeared in the [[NME]], [[Melody Maker]], [[The Guardian]], [[The Independent]], [[The Mail on Sunday]] and [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]].

His first non-cassette solo album, ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'', was produced by [[XTC]]'s [[Andy Partridge]], and was a critical success.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Commercially, it remains his most popular and successful album.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  It was followed by three more albums (''The Off White Album'', produced by [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]], ''The Spirit Cage'' and ''Radio Autumn Attic'') and an EP (''Songs from the Station Hotel'') that continued to explore the same subject matter as ''Englishman'', including the charms of rural or small-town English life and portraits of characters and scenes.\n\nNewell has also made live appearances with The Cleaners from Venus and The Stray Trolleys in the 1990s and beyond, and has issued several post-1993 live recordings with these bands. However, studio releases credited to these groups post-1993 are actually all CD reissues of pre-1993 material previously released only on cassette. In addition, Gypp played reunion gigs in 1996, and live Gypp material \u2013 as well as Gypp demos recorded in the late 1970s \u2013 have now been officially issued on CD.\n\nIn 2004 Newell released an album of light jazz songs, ''The Light Programme''. The album was not particularly successful commercially but his next album ''A Summer Tamarind'' returned to his usual style and was much more warmly received.\n\nIn late 2005 the British singer [[Richard Shelton (actor)|Richard Shelton]] released a jazz vocal album called ''Top Cat'' with five Newell compositions. Newell's songs have also been recorded by Miki Huber, The Jennifers, Kerry Getz, [[R. Stevie Moore]] and [[Alphaville (group)|Alphaville]].\n\n==Literary career==\nNewell is better known to some as a poet and author; he has released several volumes of poetry (often in collaboration with the illustrator [[James Dodds]]) and a memoir, ''This Little Ziggy'', about his youth and his days in Plod. In 2007 he released a volume of reminiscences, anecdotes and historical information about his beloved Wivenhoe. He is also a weekly contributor of poetry to ''[[The Sunday Express]],'' He now writes a weekly column for the East Anglian Daily Times (for which he won columnist of the year in the EDF/ East of England Media Awards in January 2010), performs annually at the [[Essex Book Festival]] and occasionally  issues spoken word recordings of his poems.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Martin Newell discography}}\n\n'''Studio albums'''\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*''Barricades and Angels'' (1980)\n*''Blow Away Your Troubles'' (1981)\n*''On Any Normal Monday'' (1982)\n*''Midnight Cleaners'' (1982)\n*''In the Golden Autumn'' (1983)\n*''[[Under Wartime Conditions]]'' (1984)\n*''Songs for a Fallow Land'' (1985)\n*''Living with Victoria Grey'' (1986)\n*''Going to England'' (1987)\n*''Town & Country'' (1988)\n*''The Brotherhood of Lizards'' (1988)\n*''Lizardland'' (1989)\n*''Number Thirteen'' (1990)\n*''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'' (1993)\n*''The Off White Album'' (1995)\n*''The Spirit Cage'' (2000)\n*''Radio Autumn Attic'' (2002)\n*''The Light Programme'' (2004)\n*''A Summer Tamarind'' (2007)\n*''English Electric'' (2011)\n*''In Chimp World'' (2011)\n*''The Late District'' (2013)\n*''Return to Bohemia'' (2014)\n*''Rose of the Lanes'' (2015)\n*''The Last Boy in the Locarno'' (2016)\n*''Star Cafe'' (2018)\n*''Life in a Time Machine'' (2018)\n*''Dolly Birds & Spies'' (2020)\n}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{main|Martin Newell bibliography}}\n\n'''Publications'''\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''I Hank Marvinned...''

The uniqueness of this temple is that this is the only temple of Shri Vishnu all over India having Shri Vishnu\u2019s name as [https://solapur.gov.in/en/gallery/barshi/ BHAGAVANT].{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe temple was built in 1245 A.D. in Hemadpanthi style. There are four entries to the temple from all the four directions, but the main entry is east-facing.\n\nThere is one GARUDKHAMB in front of Garbhagraha. The idol of main deity Shri Bhagvant is in black stone having SHANKH, CHAKRA andGADA is in the hands and picture of devotee king Ambrish below the right hand. Shri Laxmi is on the back of Bhagvant idol.

Badves carry out the work of daily rituals of the temple.

A CHABINA is taken out on every full moon day.\n\nRitual at Sri Bhagawanta Mandir:\n\nEvery morning at five Lord Bhagawanta is woken up with the Kakad arati adorations to the accompaniment of the sound of the cymbals.  Several devotees, both men and women, attend these morning devotions. They bring the offerings of sugar, fruits, milk, curds and butter.  The traditional honour of the Kakad of Bhagawant Mandir is with Sri Dattatreya Krishnath Patil. The priest is particular about continuing this convention. It was Sri Bhaurao Tatya Patil who took up the onus of Bhagawant Kakad way back, a tradition that has been passed down the generations.\n\nAt the time of Kakad arati, the Lord is first adored with ghee lamps and then the priest changes the cloak and offerings of fruits and sugar are made.  The lotus feet of the Lord are washed with warm water. Incense is waved, milk offered in silver vessels and then a pancharati performed. After this Sri Ganapati and Varun are worshipped with blowing of conch. The priest puts a blob of butter in Lord\u2019s mouth. Then He is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, sugar and honey. Lord Bhagawanta is given a bath with water showered out of His silver pail.  This water is considered equal in merit to Bhagirathi and sprinkled upon the devotees assembled. After this follows the karpur arati and hymns and praises are sung by the devotees.  After the Lord has bathed and put on new clothes, He is given an offering of khichadi. This is being taken care of by the local business community\u2014 Sri Nanasaheb Budukh and Sri Balasaheb Kokate are looking at this aspect presently.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Brahmins of town, Deshpande, Budukh, Joshi, Patil, Deshmukh etc. provide the naivedya/repast for Lord Bhagawanta. The priests bring this from the homes of the respective families.  Many are the offerings made on occasions such as Gudi Padva, Dasera, Diwali etc.\n\n==Educational institutes==\nThe city is well known in the region for its state of the art educational institutions and nearby districts and tehsils depends upon these educational facilities.\nMajor Pre Schools -\n1 Shishuvihar Barshi.\n\nMajor Primary Schools -\n\n1.

There are four entries to the temple from all the four directions, but the main entry is east-facing.\n\nThere is one GARUDKHAMB in front of Garbhagraha.

Shri Laxmi is on the back of Bhagvant idol.

A CHABINA is taken out on every full moon day.\n\nRitual at Sri Bhagawanta Mandir:\n\nEvery morning at five Lord Bhagawanta is woken up with the Kakad arati adorations to the accompaniment of the sound of the cymbals.  Several devotees, both men and women, attend these morning devotions. They bring the offerings of sugar, fruits, milk, curds and butter.  The traditional honour of the Kakad of Bhagawant Mandir is with Sri Dattatreya Krishnath Patil. The priest is particular about continuing this convention. It was Sri Bhaurao Tatya Patil who took up the onus of Bhagawant Kakad way back, a tradition that has been passed down the generations.\n\nAt the time of Kakad arati, the Lord is first adored with ghee lamps and then the priest changes the cloak and offerings of fruits and sugar are made.  The lotus feet of the Lord are washed with warm water. Incense is waved, milk offered in silver vessels and then a pancharati performed. After this Sri Ganapati and Varun are worshipped with blowing of conch. The priest puts a blob of butter in Lord\u2019s mouth. Then He is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, sugar and honey. Lord Bhagawanta is given a bath with water showered out of His silver pail.  This water is considered equal in merit to Bhagirathi and sprinkled upon the devotees assembled. After this follows the karpur arati and hymns and praises are sung by the devotees.  After the Lord has bathed and put on new clothes, He is given an offering of khichadi. This is being taken care of by the local business community\u2014 Sri Nanasaheb Budukh and Sri Balasaheb Kokate are looking at this aspect presently.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Brahmins of town, Deshpande, Budukh, Joshi, Patil, Deshmukh etc. provide the naivedya/repast for Lord Bhagawanta. The priests bring this from the homes of the respective families.  Many are the offerings made on occasions such as Gudi Padva, Dasera, Diwali etc.\n\n==Educational institutes==\nThe city is well known in the region for its state of the art educational institutions and nearby districts and tehsils depends upon these educational facilities.\nMajor Pre Schools -\n1 Shishuvihar Barshi.\n\nMajor Primary Schools -\n\n1.

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Landrieu served as [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana]] from 2004 to 2010.\n\nHe is the son of former New Orleans mayor and Secretary of the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] [[Moon Landrieu]] and the brother of former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Mary Landrieu]]. In 2007, he won a second term as lieutenant governor in the October 20, 2007 [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] by defeating two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]: [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Gary Beard|Gary J. Beard]] and singer [[Sammy Kershaw]].\n\nHe was elected Mayor of New Orleans on February 6, 2010, garnering 66 percent of the citywide vote and claiming victory in 365 of the city's 366 voting precincts. He was reelected mayor on February 1, 2014, with nearly 64 percent of the vote in a three-candidate field<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/02012014/02012014_36.html|title=Results for Election Date: 2/1/2014|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}</ref> and became the first Mayor to win both elections without a runoff and to be elected by majorities of both white and African-American voters.<ref name=\"Mayor - Biography\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nola.gov/mayor/bio/|title=Mayor - Biography}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nLandrieu was born and raised in the [[Broadmoor, New Orleans|Broadmoor neighborhood]] of New Orleans, the fifth of nine children of Maurice \"Moon\" and Verna Satterlee Landrieu. He stated in a March 2018 journalism podcast that he is of Italian, French, German, British, and African-American{{fact|date=March 2020}} heritage. After graduating from [[Jesuit High School (New Orleans)|Jesuit High School]] in 1978, he enrolled at [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, D.C. where he earned a B.A. in [[political science]] and theatre in 1982. In 1985, he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree from [[Loyola University New Orleans College of Law|Loyola University Law School]] in New Orleans.\n\nLandrieu is married to Cheryl P. Landrieu, also an attorney. The couple has five children.\n\nPrior to public service, Landrieu practiced law for 16 years and became a mediator, focusing on alternative dispute resolution. He owned International Mediation and Arbitration, where he mediated over 700 cases involving complex cases. He was also appointed special master for a major train derailment involving up to 9,000 plaintiffs. He clerked for [[Adrian G. Duplantier|Federal Court Judge Adrian Duplantier]] and [[Pascal F. Calogero Jr.|Chief Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court Pascal Calogero]]. He is a member of the Supreme Court Task Force on Alternative Dispute Resolution which was responsible for developing the pilot mediation program in [[Orleans Parish]]. Landrieu is trained in mediation and negotiation by the [[Harvard Law School]] Negotiation Project, the American Arbitration Association, and the Attorney Mediator's Institute. Landrieu has also taught alternative dispute resolution as an adjunct professor at [[Loyola University New Orleans College of Law|Loyola University]] Law School.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Legislator===\nLandrieu was elected to the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana House of Representatives]] in 1987, where he served for sixteen years in the seat previously held by his sister and before her, his father.\n\nAs a leader of the \u201cYoung Turks,\u201d Landrieu advocated a non-partisan approach to governing and pushed for fiscal reform in the early 1990s, when the state was in a precarious financial situation. Working with a diverse bipartisan group of lawmakers, he helped focus attention away from partisan fights and toward efficiency and accountability. Landrieu led this coalition, often against [[Edwin Edwards|Democratic Governor Edwin Edwards]], to restructure government instead of cutting healthcare programs and raising fees. He shepherded through the House a constitutional amendment designed to limit Louisiana's debt. Later, in partnership with [[Mike Foster (American politician)|Republican Governor Mike Foster]] in 1999, Landrieu led an effort to have the state's $4.4 billion tobacco settlement placed into a trust, allowing the Legislature to only allocate the interest earned every year. He also focused on stimulating economic growth by supporting the construction of major economic development projects in New Orleans \u2013 including the [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center|Morial Convention Center]], the [[Smoothie King Center|New Orleans Arena]], the [[The National WWII Museum|National World War II Museum]] and the biomedical district.\n\nLandrieu led the legislative effort to reform Louisiana's juvenile justice system with a focus on rehabilitation and reform as opposed to punishment and incarceration. As lieutenant governor, he continued to chair the Juvenile Justice Commission, the entity created by the legislation to implement the reforms. In January 2004, Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] endorsed the Commission's recommendations.\n\nLandrieu also led the effort by a coalition of artists, venue owners, and other interested parties who were successful in repealing the Orleans Parish \"amusement tax\", a 2% tax on gross sales at any establishment that features live music. As an attorney, Landrieu brought a case to court that resulted in the tax being ruled unconstitutional. He continued the fight by bringing the issue to the [[New Orleans City Council]], who voted to repeal the tax. As a legislator, Landrieu sponsored a bill to repeal the law that allowed the tax to exist.\n\nHe also chaired a commission that worked to consolidate New Orleans elected offices, which became a reality after [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Landrieu also vocally opposed former Ku Klux Klan wizard and then Representative David Duke, fighting Duke's divisive and often-racist legislation.\n\nLandrieu crafted legislation to fund the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium of New Orleans, a partnership between the [[Louisiana State University]] and [[Tulane University]] Health Sciences Centers. Louisiana has the nation's highest cancer mortality rate, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nOne of Landrieu's most ambitious projects as Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana has been the creation of the [[World Cultural Economic Forum]] (WCEF). The Forum, held annually in New Orleans, is directed towards promoting cultural economic development opportunities through the strategic convening of cultural ambassadors and leaders from around the world. The first WCEF took place in October 2008. He has carried on this project as mayor and has even established a formal cultural economy office at City Hall.\n\n===1994 New Orleans mayoral election===\nIn 1994 Landrieu made an unsuccessful bid for the office of [[Mayor of New Orleans]]; the office went to [[Marc Morial]], the son of another former mayor.\n\n===Lieutenant governor===\nMitch Landrieu's 2003 campaign for [[Lieutenant Governor]] was his first bid for statewide office in [[Louisiana]]. After 16 years in the State House, Landrieu was elected Lieutenant Governor in 2003. In a field of six candidates, Landrieu garnered 53 percent of the vote and won outright in the [[primary election|Louisiana open primary]], thus avoiding a general election. His principal opponents were three Republicans, former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Clyde C. Holloway]] of [[Rapides Parish]], former Lieutenant Governor [[Melinda Schwegmann]] of New Orleans, and businessman [[Kirt Bennett]] of Baton Rouge.\n\nWhen [[Hurricane Katrina|Hurricanes Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, the Lieutenant Governor was involved in the emergency response. After commanding portions of the hurricane response and recovery, Landrieu was tasked to lead the effort to rebuild the state's tourism industry.\n\nAround this time, he decided to challenge incumbent [[Ray Nagin|Mayor C. Ray Nagin]]. With voting sites scattered across the country and most residents having not yet returned home, he narrowly lost to Nagin.\n\nImmediately after the storm, Landrieu brought together industry leaders and national experts to develop a strategic plan, ''Louisiana Rebirth'', to rebuild the state's tourism industry. It was in this period of recovery that Landrieu began to clearly articulate a governing philosophy that would guide him over the next part of his career. He believed you needed to bring people together to get things done. In order to do so, there needed to be clear command, control and communication. Also, the federal, state and local governments needed to be aligned better\u2014both vertically and horizontally. This means coordinating behind the scenes, breaking down silos and building partnerships to meet the state's biggest priorities.\u200a He believed that government in many instances should steer, not row\u2014that it is a facilitator, with the ability to link public, private, not-for-profit, and faith organizations, and help each of them leverage their collective assets.\n\nIn this vein, he launched the \u201cCultural Economy\u201d initiative out of whole cloth to quantify and grow jobs in Louisiana's culture, music, food, film and art industries. He also created the first in the nation Office of Social Entrepreneurship to advance social innovation by supporting the creation and growth of the most innovative, measurable and sustainable solutions to the social problems affecting Louisiana's citizens. These were new and innovative ways to address old problems.\n\nAs Lieutenant Governor, Landrieu also chaired the Juvenile Justice Commission to reform to the state's juvenile justice system. Under his leadership, the Commission overhauled the probation and parole systems for youth offenders, established violence prevention programs, and studied the connection between domestic abuse and juvenile delinquency.<ref name=\"Mayor - Biography\" />\n\n===2006 New Orleans mayoral election===\n:{{Main|2006 New Orleans mayoral election}}\n[[File:MitchLandrieuSatchmofest4Aug07AMike.jpg|right|thumb|Landrieu in 2007]]\nIn February 2006, Landrieu officially announced he would run for mayor of New Orleans in the [[New Orleans mayoral election, 2006|April 22 election]]. Before [[Hurricane Katrina]] the incumbent [[Ray Nagin]] was widely expected to be reelected with little difficulty, but post-disaster problems and controversies had left many New Orleanians interested in new leadership.\n\nIn the election of April 22, preliminary results showed Landrieu with the second most votes, with 29% of the vote to Nagin's 38%. Nagin and Landrieu faced each other in a run off election on May 20. With unofficial results showing 53% of the vote for Nagin, Landrieu conceded defeat.\n\n===2010 New Orleans mayoral election===\n\nAlthough Landrieu had at first indicated he did not plan on it, he ultimately decided to pass on an open race for Governor or an easy re-election as Lieutenant Governor to instead run for the job he always wanted\u2014New Orleans mayor.<ref name=\"Mayor - Biography\"/> He announced in December 2009 that he would be running in the [[New Orleans mayoral election, 2010|2010 New Orleans mayoral election]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Times-Picayune archive |url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/12/mitch_landrieu_to_enter_new_or.html |title=Mitch Landrieu to enter New Orleans mayoral race, sources say |publisher=NOLA.com |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwltv.com/news/politics/Landrieu-says-hell-run-for-Mayor-of-NO-78782557.html |title=With a change of heart, Landrieu jumps into crowded mayor's race &#124; New Orleans News, Local News, Breaking News, Weather &#124; wwltv.com &#124; Political News |publisher=wwltv.com |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219030707/http://www.wwltv.com/news/politics/Landrieu-says-hell-run-for-Mayor-of-NO-78782557.html |archivedate=December 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> in a bid to succeed [[Ray Nagin]], who was term-limited.

He created a diverse and citizen-led transition committee, made up of six different task forces that engaged thousands in public meetings.

Landrieu brought sound fiscal management, balanced budgets, and ethical contracting to City Hall, leading to the City's highest-ever credit rating and over $8 billion in private development. His top priority was public safety\u2014reforming the police department and reducing the city's murder rate.<ref name=\"Mayor - Biography\"/>\n\nLandrieu immediately established clearer command and control, instituting a Deputy Mayor system and a new organizational chart for the nearly 4,000 employees and $1 billion total budget. In 2010, facing a nearly $100 million deficit, he closed the City's budget gap\u2014more than one-fifth of the total general fund\u2014by cutting out waste, reorganizing departments and the delivery of core services, reducing boards and commissions, thereby eliminating the city's longtime structural deficit. For eight straight years, he delivered a balanced budget. As a result, New Orleans\u2019 credit ratings were upgraded four times during Mayor Landrieu's tenure to its highest all-time rating. Landrieu reformed the city procurement system. He created the Office of Performance and Accountability to publicly track how well City government is keeping its promises and launched an expansive open data system making more information available to the public and press. His administration developed NOLA 311 for constituents to report quality-of-life concerns and requests. It also launched a \"One Stop Shop\" permit processing system to reduce permit times and make the city more business friendly.<ref>Myers, Ben (March 20, 2013). \"[https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2013/03/20/city-opens-one-stop-shop-for-permits-licenses/ City opens \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for permits, licenses]\".

And spending from tourism has now surpassed pre-Katrina highs. Since Landrieu took office, the ''Wall Street Journal\u2019s MarketWatch'' named New Orleans one of the \u201cmost improved cities for business.\u201d In 2012, Landrieu unveiled a 5-year-plan called Prosperity NOLA which aims to diversify the economy and add major jobs in digital technology, biosciences, and water management. New retail was booming, in many areas surpassing pre-Katrina levels.

He stated in a March 2018 journalism podcast that he is of Italian, French, German, British, and African-American{{fact|date=March 2020}} heritage. After graduating from [[Jesuit High School (New Orleans)|Jesuit High School]] in 1978, he enrolled at [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, D.C. where he earned a B.A. in [[political science]] and theatre in 1982. In 1985, he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree from [[Loyola University New Orleans College of Law|Loyola University Law School]] in New Orleans.\n\nLandrieu is married to Cheryl P. Landrieu, also an attorney. The couple has five children.\n\nPrior to public service, Landrieu practiced law for 16 years and became a mediator, focusing on alternative dispute resolution. He owned International Mediation and Arbitration, where he mediated over 700 cases involving complex cases. He was also appointed special master for a major train derailment involving up to 9,000 plaintiffs. He clerked for [[Adrian G. Duplantier|Federal Court Judge Adrian Duplantier]] and [[Pascal F. Calogero Jr.|Chief Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court Pascal Calogero]]. He is a member of the Supreme Court Task Force on Alternative Dispute Resolution which was responsible for developing the pilot mediation program in [[Orleans Parish]]. Landrieu is trained in mediation and negotiation by the [[Harvard Law School]] Negotiation Project, the American Arbitration Association, and the Attorney Mediator's Institute. Landrieu has also taught alternative dispute resolution as an adjunct professor at [[Loyola University New Orleans College of Law|Loyola University]] Law School.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Legislator===\nLandrieu was elected to the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana House of Representatives]] in 1987, where he served for sixteen years in the seat previously held by his sister and before her, his father.\n\nAs a leader of the \u201cYoung Turks,\u201d Landrieu advocated a non-partisan approach to governing and pushed for fiscal reform in the early 1990s, when the state was in a precarious financial situation. Working with a diverse bipartisan group of lawmakers, he helped focus attention away from partisan fights and toward efficiency and accountability. Landrieu led this coalition, often against [[Edwin Edwards|Democratic Governor Edwin Edwards]], to restructure government instead of cutting healthcare programs and raising fees. He shepherded through the House a constitutional amendment designed to limit Louisiana's debt. Later, in partnership with [[Mike Foster (American politician)|Republican Governor Mike Foster]] in 1999, Landrieu led an effort to have the state's $4.4 billion tobacco settlement placed into a trust, allowing the Legislature to only allocate the interest earned every year. He also focused on stimulating economic growth by supporting the construction of major economic development projects in New Orleans \u2013 including the [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center|Morial Convention Center]], the [[Smoothie King Center|New Orleans Arena]], the [[The National WWII Museum|National World War II Museum]] and the biomedical district.\n\nLandrieu led the legislative effort to reform Louisiana's juvenile justice system with a focus on rehabilitation and reform as opposed to punishment and incarceration. As lieutenant governor, he continued to chair the Juvenile Justice Commission, the entity created by the legislation to implement the reforms. In January 2004, Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] endorsed the Commission's recommendations.\n\nLandrieu also led the effort by a coalition of artists, venue owners, and other interested parties who were successful in repealing the Orleans Parish \"amusement tax\", a 2% tax on gross sales at any establishment that features live music. As an attorney, Landrieu brought a case to court that resulted in the tax being ruled unconstitutional. He continued the fight by bringing the issue to the [[New Orleans City Council]], who voted to repeal the tax. As a legislator, Landrieu sponsored a bill to repeal the law that allowed the tax to exist.\n\nHe also chaired a commission that worked to consolidate New Orleans elected offices, which became a reality after [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Landrieu also vocally opposed former Ku Klux Klan wizard and then Representative David Duke, fighting Duke's divisive and often-racist legislation.\n\nLandrieu crafted legislation to fund the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium of New Orleans, a partnership between the [[Louisiana State University]] and [[Tulane University]] Health Sciences Centers. Louisiana has the nation's highest cancer mortality rate, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nOne of Landrieu's most ambitious projects as Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana has been the creation of the [[World Cultural Economic Forum]] (WCEF). The Forum, held annually in New Orleans, is directed towards promoting cultural economic development opportunities through the strategic convening of cultural ambassadors and leaders from around the world. The first WCEF took place in October 2008. He has carried on this project as mayor and has even established a formal cultural economy office at City Hall.\n\n===1994 New Orleans mayoral election===\nIn 1994 Landrieu made an unsuccessful bid for the office of [[Mayor of New Orleans]]; the office went to [[Marc Morial]], the son of another former mayor.\n\n===Lieutenant governor===\nMitch Landrieu's 2003 campaign for [[Lieutenant Governor]] was his first bid for statewide office in [[Louisiana]]. After 16 years in the State House, Landrieu was elected Lieutenant Governor in 2003. In a field of six candidates, Landrieu garnered 53 percent of the vote and won outright in the [[primary election|Louisiana open primary]], thus avoiding a general election. His principal opponents were three Republicans, former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Clyde C. Holloway]] of [[Rapides Parish]], former Lieutenant Governor [[Melinda Schwegmann]] of New Orleans, and businessman [[Kirt Bennett]] of Baton Rouge.\n\nWhen [[Hurricane Katrina|Hurricanes Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, the Lieutenant Governor was involved in the emergency response. After commanding portions of the hurricane response and recovery, Landrieu was tasked to lead the effort to rebuild the state's tourism industry.\n\nAround this time, he decided to challenge incumbent [[Ray Nagin|Mayor C. Ray Nagin]]. With voting sites scattered across the country and most residents having not yet returned home, he narrowly lost to Nagin.\n\nImmediately after the storm, Landrieu brought together industry leaders and national experts to develop a strategic plan, ''Louisiana Rebirth'', to rebuild the state's tourism industry. It was in this period of recovery that Landrieu began to clearly articulate a governing philosophy that would guide him over the next part of his career. He believed you needed to bring people together to get things done. In order to do so, there needed to be clear command, control and communication. Also, the federal, state and local governments needed to be aligned better\u2014both vertically and horizontally. This means coordinating behind the scenes, breaking down silos and building partnerships to meet the state's biggest priorities.\u200a He believed that government in many instances should steer, not row\u2014that it is a facilitator, with the ability to link public, private, not-for-profit, and faith organizations, and help each of them leverage their collective assets.\n\nIn this vein, he launched the \u201cCultural Economy\u201d initiative out of whole cloth to quantify and grow jobs in Louisiana's culture, music, food, film and art industries. He also created the first in the nation Office of Social Entrepreneurship to advance social innovation by supporting the creation and growth of the most innovative, measurable and sustainable solutions to the social problems affecting Louisiana's citizens. These were new and innovative ways to address old problems.\n\nAs Lieutenant Governor, Landrieu also chaired the Juvenile Justice Commission to reform to the state's juvenile justice system.

For eight straight years, he delivered a balanced budget. As a result, New Orleans\u2019 credit ratings were upgraded four times during Mayor Landrieu's tenure to its highest all-time rating. Landrieu reformed the city procurement system. He created the Office of Performance and Accountability to publicly track how well City government is keeping its promises and launched an expansive open data system making more information available to the public and press.

The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared [[martial law]] and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing.

The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefited some people but seriously disaffected others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=216}} and restrictions on political participation. The students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of speech]], although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Nathan|2001}} At the height of the protests, about 1&nbsp;million people assembled in the Square.{{sfn|D.

To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4), Eight Squared (i.e. 8<sup>2</sup>=64){{sfn|China tightens information}} and 8964.<ref name=\"HKFP8964\">''[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ Bus driver in \u20188964\u2019 massacre memento suspended for 3 months] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622185220/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ |date=June 22, 2019 }}'', June 13, 2016, [[Chantal Yuen]], [[Hong Kong Free Press]].</ref>\n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}} As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a \"counterrevolutionary riot\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political storm\" and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase \"political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989\", which it uses to this day.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}}{{sfn|Day China trampled2009}}\n\nIn English, the terms Tiananmen Square Massacre, Tiananmen Square Protests or Tiananmen Square Crackdown are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence in Beijing did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square along a stretch of [[Chang'an Avenue]] only a few miles long, and especially near the [[Muxidi]] area.{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=283}} The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.{{sfn|Miles|2009}}\n\n==Background==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\nThe [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's originally diverse economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.\n\nTo run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the Communist Party in 1982, while [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], the head of government, in September 1980.\n\n===Challenges with reform===\nThe reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.\n\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.{{sfn|Naughton|2007| p=91}} The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. Party bureaucrats suddenly found themselves in charge of a burgeoning state regime over economic management and enormous incentives for [[arbitrage]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=120}} Discontent over corruption reached a fever pitch with the public, and many, particularly those in the intellectual community, began to believe that only democratic reform and rule of law could act as a panacea for the country's ills.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|Chapter 5: On the Eve of the 1989 Movement}}\n\nFollowing the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying and hoarding all over China.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but its impact was pronounced for much longer. Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}}\n\n===Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis===\nReformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=81}} Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=84}} The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=89}} Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" and the \"Lawn Salon\" (''C\u01ceod\u00ec Sh\u0101l\u00f3ng''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=137}} These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}}\n\nAt the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}} Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}}\n\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. However, both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===1986 student demonstrations===\n{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]] returned from a position at [[Princeton University]] and began a personal tour around universities in China; speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=64, 215}} The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}} In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}}\n\nInspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.{{sfn|Wang | 2006| pp=56\u201357}} While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\n\nGeneral secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987. Then the party began the \"Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign\", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.{{sfn|Spence | 1999 | p=685}} The Campaign stopped student protests and tightened the political environment, but Hu remained popular among progressives in the party, intellectuals, and students.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Protest development==\n===Death of Hu Yaobang===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ Student leaders\n!scope=\"col\"|Name\n!scope=\"col\"|Origin and affiliation\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Chai Ling]]\n|[[Shandong]]; [[Beijing Normal University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wu'erkaixi]] (\u00d6rkesh)\n|[[Xinjiang]]; [[Beijing Normal University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]]\n|Beijing; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Feng Congde]]\n|[[Sichuan]]; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Shen Tong]]\n|Beijing; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wang Youcai]]\n|[[Zhejiang]]; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Li Lu]]\n|[[Hebei]]; [[Nanjing University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Zhou Yongjun]]\n|[[China University of Political Science and Law]]\n|}\n\nWhen [[Hu Yaobang]] suddenly died of a heart attack on April 15, 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation.{{sfn|Calhoun}} Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers.{{sfn|Pan | 2008 | p=274}} In university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for a revival of Hu's legacy. Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=147}} Small spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}} At 5&nbsp;pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\nStarting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (Seven Demands) for the government:\n# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.\n# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.\n# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.\n# Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.\n# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.\n# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.\n# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}}\n\nOn the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].\n\nOn April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=149}} Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.{{sfn|Walder | Gong | 1993 | pp=1\u20132}}\n\nHu's [[state funeral]] took place on April 22. On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=152\u201353}}{{sfn|Li|2010}}\n\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall of the People, but several students pressed forward. A few were allowed to cross the police line. Three of these students ([[Zhou Yongjun]], [[Guo Haifeng]] and [[Zhang Zhiyong]]) knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}{{efn| Analyst [[Richard Baum]] described their actions as \"...a mock-ceremonial remonstrance... presenting their scrolled-up demands on hands and knees in the stylized, obsequious manner of an imperial petition.\"{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=248}} Political scientist [[Lucian Pye]] similarly described the act as \"..in line with the classic Chinese tradition of aggrieved parties wailing before the Yamen door, of publicly dramatizing their unhappiness by petitioning officialdom... [they] sincerely believed that the officials would have to respond by meeting with them.\"{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=337}}&nbsp;}} Standing beside them, a fourth student ([[Wu'erkaixi]]) made a brief, emotional speech begging for Li Peng to come out and speak with them. The larger number of students still in the Square but outside the cordon were at times emotional, shouting demands or slogans and rushing toward police. Wu'erkaixi calmed the crowd down as they waited for the Premier to emerge. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}\n\nOn April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, in a meeting of around 40 students from 21 universities, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. The Union then called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=154}}\n\nOn April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009}} Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on April 23.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}}\n\n===Turning point: April 26 Editorial===\n{{main|April 26 Editorial|l1=26 April Editorial}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|footer=General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] (left) who pushed for dialogue with students and Premier [[Li Peng]] (right) who declared martial law and backed military action\n|width1=150\n|image1=Zhao Ziyang (1985).jpg\n|alt1=Zhao Ziyang\n|width2=166\n|image2=Lipeng.jpg\n|alt2=Li Peng\n}}\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}} On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\nOn April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled \"[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]].\" The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.{{sfn|April 26 Editorial|1995}} The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]\u2014an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as \"patriotic\" under Deng's leadership.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===April 27 demonstrations===\n{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}\n[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|upright|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]\nOrganized by the Union on April 27, some 50,000\u2013100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption, anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\".{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an April 26 editorial.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}}\n\nThe stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=157}}\n\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=156}} Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on May 3\u20134. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}} The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on May 4 to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On May 4, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=159}}\n\n==Protests escalate==\n===Preparing for dialogue===\n{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}\nThe leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}}\n\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal delegation. There was some friction, however, as the Union leaders were reluctant to let the delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=161}} The movement was slowed by a change to a more deliberate approach, fractured by internal discord, and increasingly diluted by declining engagement from the student body at large. In this context, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, desired to regain momentum. They also distrusted the government's offers of 'dialogue', dismissing them as merely a ploy designed to play for time and pacify the students. To break from the moderate and incremental approach now adopted by other major student leaders, these few began calling for a return to more confrontational measures. They settled on a plan of mobilizing students for a hunger strike on that would begin May 13.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=161\u201362}} Early attempts to mobilize others to join them met with only modest success until [[Chai Ling]] made an emotional appeal on the night before the strike was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|D.

Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009 |pp=612\u201314}} By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}}\n\nInspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.<ref>''[[Amnesty International]]'', August 30, 1989. ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989'', p.19</ref>\n\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping ordered the Square to be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=164}} Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not\u2014in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}}\n\n===Mikhail Gorbachev visit===\n{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}} However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}} While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=169}} Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.{{efn|Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.}}\n\nThe students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (\"loss of [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]\"){{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=300}} for the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=170}} The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. Zhao's defense against this accusation was that privately informing world leaders that Deng was the true center of power was standard operating procedure; Li Peng had made nearly identical private statements to US president [[George H.W. Bush]] in February 1989.{{sfn|Sarotte|2012|p=165}} Nevertheless, the statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}}\n\n===Gathering momentum===\nThe hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17\u201318 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\n\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}}\n\nThe situation seemed intractable, so the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Matters came to a head on May 17, during a [[Politburo Standing Committee]] meeting at Deng's residence.{{sfn|Li|2010}} At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Li Peng, [[Yao Yilin]] and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech to the [[Asian Development Bank]] on 4 May, Zhao exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}}{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|pp=25\u201334}}{{sfn|MacFarquhar|2011|p=443}} Deng warned that \"there is no way to back down now without the situation spiraling out of control\", and so \"the decision is to move troops into Beijing to declare [[martial law]]\"{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|p=28}} as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of \"[[bourgeois liberalism]]\" advocates who were pulling the strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions.{{sfn|Miles | 1997}} For the rest of his life, Zhao Ziyang maintained that the decision was ultimately in Deng's hands: among the five PSC members present at the meeting, he and [[Hu Qili]] opposed the imposition of martial law, Li Peng and Yao Yilin firmly supported it, and [[Qiao Shi]] remained carefully neutral and noncommittal. Deng appointed the latter three to carry out the decision.{{sfn|Z. Zhao |2009|p=28\u201330}}\n\n{{quote box|width=40%|align=left|quote=Students, we came too late. We are sorry.

At the meeting, Zhao announced that he was ready to \"take leave\", citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} The elders in attendance at the meeting, [[Bo Yibo]] and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Zhao did not consider the inconclusive PSC vote to have legally binding implications on martial law;{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=x}} Yang Shangkun, in his capacity as [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], went on to mobilize the military to move into the capital.\n\nLi Peng [[Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement#May 18: meeting with Li Peng|met with students]] for the first time on May 18 in an attempt to placate public concern over the hunger strike.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}} During the talks, student leaders again demanded that the government rescind the April 26 Editorial and affirm the student movement as \"patriotic\". Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending hunger strikers to hospital. The discussions were confrontational and yielded little substantive progress or dialogue,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=41}} but gained student leaders prominent airtime on national television.{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=343}} By this point, those calling for the overthrow of the party and of Li Peng and Deng personally became prominent both in Beijing and in other cities.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=42-43}} Slogans targeted Deng personally, for instance calling him the \"power behind the throne.\"{{sfn|Wu|2011|p=May 19}}\n\n[[File:Wen Jiabao (Cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wen Jiabao]], then chief of the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|Party's General Office]], accompanied Zhao Ziyang to meet with students in the Square, surviving the political purge of the party's liberals and later serving as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] from 2003 to 2013.]]\n\nIn the early morning of 19 May, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his political [[swan song]]. He was accompanied by [[Wen Jiabao]]. Li Peng also went to the Square, but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50{{nbsp}}am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging the students to end the hunger strike.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}} He told the students that they were still young and urged them to stay healthy and not to sacrifice themselves without due concern for their futures. Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}}\n\nOn 19 May, the PSC met with military leaders and party elders. Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.\n\n===Surveillance of protesters===\nStudent leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities, traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square and the restaurants in the nearby area and where students gathered were wiretapped.<ref name=\"4-corners-tremble-and-obey\">{{Cite episode|episode-link='https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/tremble-and-obey/11174758' |series=Four Coners|title=Tremble & Obey|time=00:24:50}}</ref> This surveillance led to the identification, capture and punishment of participants of the protest.<ref name=\"surveillance-politics\">{{Cite book|first=Richard Victor Ericson|last=Kevin D.

In many cases, these were supported by the universities' own party cells. [[Jiang Zemin]], then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding' as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by [[Yan Jiaqi]], which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page.{{sfn|Wright | 1990 | pp=121\u201332}} Jiang then suspended lead editor [[Qin Benli]]. His decisive action earned trust from conservative party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.\n\nIn Hong Kong on 27 May, over 300,000 people gathered at [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] for a gathering called Democratic songs dedicated for China ({{zh|t=\u6c11\u4e3b\u6b4c\u8072\u737b\u4e2d\u83ef}}).

Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces retreated to bases outside the city.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}}{{sfn|Secretary of State's}} While the army's withdrawal was initially seen as 'turning the tide' in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization took place across the country for a final assault.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=80\u201382}}\n\nAt the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. [[Hou Dejian]] suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Meanwhile, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and consequences, and advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by 'hardliner' student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a \"well-organized and premeditated plot.\"{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===June 1\u20133===\nOn June 1, [[Li Peng]] issued a report titled \"On the True Nature of the Turmoil\", which was circulated to every member of the Politburo.{{sfn|L.

Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the Square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles.{{sfn|L.

At 10{{nbsp}}pm, the founding ceremony of the Tiananmen Democracy University was held as scheduled at the base of the [[Goddess of Democracy]]. At 10:16{{nbsp}}pm, the loudspeakers controlled by the government warned that troops may take \"any measures\" to enforce martial law. By 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, news of bloodshed to the west and south of the city began trickling into the Square, often told by witnesses drenched in blood. At midnight, the students' loudspeaker announced news that a student had been killed on West Chang'an Avenue, near the Military Museum and a somber mood settled on the Square. Li Lu, the deputy commander of the student headquarters, urged students to remain united in defending the Square through non-violent means. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed. Wuerkaixi was taken away by ambulance. By then, there were still 70,000\u201380,000 people in the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}\n\nAt about 12:15{{nbsp}}am, a [[flare]] lit up the sky and the first armored personnel vehicle appeared on the Square from the west. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of concrete at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}\n\nPressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings. At one point, Chai Ling picked up the megaphone and called on fellow students to prepare to \"defend themselves\" against the \"shameless government.\" However, she and Li Lu agreed to adhere to peaceful means and had the students' sticks, rocks and glass bottles confiscated.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (2)}}\n\nAt about 1:30{{nbsp}}am, the vanguard of the 38th Army from the XV Airborne Corps arrived at the north and south ends of the Square, respectively.{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4}} They began to seal off the Square from reinforcements of students and residents, killing more demonstrators who were trying to enter the Square.{{sfn|Miles | 2009}} Meanwhile, the 27th and 65th Armies poured out of the Great Hall of the People to the west and the 24th Army emerged from behind the History Museum to the east.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (2)}} The remaining students, numbering several thousand, were completely surrounded at the Monument of the People's Heroes in the center of the Square. At 2{{nbsp}}am, the troops fired shots over the heads of the students at the Monument. The students broadcast pleadings back toward the troops: \"We entreat you in peace, for democracy and freedom of the motherland, for strength and prosperity of the Chinese nation, please comply with the will of the people and refrain from using force against peaceful student demonstrators.\"{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4}}\n\nAt about 2:30{{nbsp}}am, several workers near the Monument emerged with a machine gun they had captured from the troops and vowed to take revenge. They were persuaded to give up the weapon by Hou Dejian. The workers also handed over an assault rifle without ammunition, which Liu Xiaobo smashed against the marble railings of the Monument.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}} Shao Jiang, a student who had witnessed the killings at Muxidi, pleaded with the older intellectuals to retreat, saying too many lives had been lost. Initially, Liu Xiaobo was reluctant, but eventually joined Zhou Duo, Gao Xin and [[Hou Dejian]] in making the case to the student leaders for a withdrawal. Chai Ling, Li Lu and Feng Congde initially rejected the idea of withdrawal.{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4}} At 3:30{{nbsp}}am, at the suggestion of two doctors in the Red Cross camp, Hou Dejian and Zhuo Tuo agreed to try to negotiate with the soldiers. They rode in an ambulance to the northeast corner of the Square and spoke with Ji Xinguo, the political commissar of the 38th Army's 336th Regiment, who relayed the request to command headquarters, which agreed to grant safe passage for the students to the southeast. The commissar told Hou, \"it would be a tremendous accomplishment, if you can persuade the students to leave the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}}\n\nAt 4{{nbsp}}am, the lights on the Square suddenly turned off, and the government's loudspeaker announced: \"Clearance of the Square begins now. We agree with the students' request to clear the Square.\"{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4}} The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'' and braced for a last stand.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}} Hou returned and informed student leaders of his agreement with the troops. At 4:30{{nbsp}}am, the lights relit and the troops began to advance on the Monument from all sides. At about 4:32{{nbsp}}am, Hou Dejian took the student's loudspeaker and recounted his meeting with the military. Many students, who learned of the talks for the first time, reacted angrily and accused him of cowardice.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}}\n\nThe soldiers stopped about ten meters from the students. The first row of troops took aim with machine guns from the prone position. Behind them soldiers [[Squatting position|squatted]] and stood with assault rifles. Mixed among them were anti-riot police with clubs. Further back were tanks and APCs.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} Feng Congde took to the loudspeaker and explained that there was no time left to hold a meeting. Instead, a voice vote would decide the collective action of the group. Although the vote's results were inconclusive, Feng said the \"gos\" had prevailed.{{sfn|D. Zhao |2001|p=206}} Within a few minutes, at about 4:35{{nbsp}}am, a squad of soldiers in camouflaged uniform charged up the Monument and shot out the students' loudspeaker.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=206}}{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} Other troops beat and kicked dozens of students at the Monument, seizing and smashing their cameras and recording equipment.

Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} At about 5:10{{nbsp}}am, the students began to leave the Monument.

The \"[[Tank Man]]\", as it became known, became one of the most iconic photographs in the 20th century. As the tank driver tried to go around him, the \"Tank Man\" moved into the tank's path. He continued to stand defiantly in front of the tanks for some time, then climbed up onto the turret of the lead tank to speak to the soldiers inside. After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people.{{sfn|Frontline: Tank Man|2006}}\n\nAlthough the fate of \"Tank Man\" following the demonstration is not known, then-paramount Chinese leader Jiang Zemin stated in 1990 that he did not think the man was killed.{{sfn|Iyer|1998}} ''Time'' later named him one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential people of the 20th century]].\n\nA stopped convoy of 37 APCs on Changan Boulevard at Muxidi was forced to abandon their vehicles after becoming stuck among an assortment of burned out buses and military vehicles.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=178\u201379}} In addition to occasional incidents of soldiers opening fire on civilians in Beijing, Western news outlets reported clashes between units of the PLA.{{sfn|Kristof:Units Clash}} Late in the afternoon 26 tanks, three armored personnel carriers and supporting infantry took up defensive positions facing East at [[Jianguomen (Beijing)|Jianguomen]] and [[Fuxingmen]] overpasses.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=189}} Shellfire was heard throughout the night and the next morning a United States Marine in the eastern part of the city reported spotting a damaged armored vehicle that had been disabled by an armor-piercing shell.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=190}} The ongoing turmoil in the capital disrupted the flow of everyday life.

A political purge followed in which officials responsible for organizing or condoning the protests were removed, and protest leaders jailed.{{sfn|Tsui|Pang}}\n\n===Protests outside Beijing===\nAfter order was restored in Beijing on June 4, protests of varying scales continued in some 80 other Chinese cities, outside the spotlight of the international press.{{sfn|Ageing rebels, bitter victims|2014}} In the British colony of Hong Kong, people again took to wearing black in solidarity with the demonstrators in Beijing. There were also protests in other countries, many adopting the use of black armbands as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn Shanghai, students marched on the streets on June 5 and erected roadblocks on major thoroughfares.

The municipal government gained recognition from the top leadership in Beijing for averting a major upheaval.\n\nIn the interior cities of Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing and Chengdu, many students continued protests after June 4, often erecting roadblocks. In Xi'an, students stopped workers from entering factories.{{sfn|L.

Zhang |2001|p=400}} About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=405}} In Wuhan the situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a [[bank run]] and resorted to panic-buying.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=408}}\n\nSimilar scenes unfolded in Nanjing. On June 7, hundreds of students staged a blockade at the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] as well as the Zhongyangmen Railway Bridge. They were persuaded to evacuate without incident later that day, though returned the next day to occupy the main railway station and the bridges.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=409}}\n\nThe atmosphere in [[Chengdu]] was more violent. On the morning of June 4, police forcibly broke up the student demonstration taking place in Tianfu Square. The resulting violence killed eight people, and injured hundreds. The most brutal attacks occurred on June 5 and 6. Witnesses estimate that 30 to 100 bodies were thrown onto a truck after a crowd broke into the Jinjiang Hotel.{{sfn|Lim|2014b}} According to Amnesty International, at least 300 people were killed in Chengdu on June 5.{{sfn|Calls for Justice |2004}}{{sfn|Massacre and aftermath|1990}} Troops in Chengdu used concussion [[grenades]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]], [[knives]] and [[electroshock weapon]] against civilians.

Chinese authorities actively suppressed discussion of casualty figures immediately after the events, and estimates rely heavily on eyewitness testimony, hospital records, and organized efforts by victims' relatives.  As a result, large discrepancies exist among various casualty estimates.

He kept a low profile until 1992.

To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to \"deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization\".

In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the separation of powers model established following the Cultural Revolution, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a [[figurehead|symbolic position]], while the real centres of power, i.e., the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.\n\nWhen President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. By 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission chairman and President were all consolidated into the same person, a practice that has been continued since.\n\nIn 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.{{sfn|MacKinnon | 1999}} After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe restrictions on society were loosened only a few years after the protests, especially after Deng's 1992 \"southern tour\".{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=195}} Privately run print media again flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially run satellite TV stations sprung up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.{{sfn|Kurlantzick | 2003 | p=50}} The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=50}} This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}} To reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to \"fight against cults\" such as [[Falun Gong]], playing sects off each other.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}}\n\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favour.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=201}} This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}}\n\n===Economic impact===\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many analysts downgraded their outlook of China's economic future.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance to the [[World Trade Organization]], which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4&nbsp;billion in 1988 to $700&nbsp;million in 1990.{{sfn|Foot|2000}} Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;{{sfn|Thakur | Burton | Srivastava | 1997 | pp=404\u201305}} China's credit rating was lowered;{{sfn|Foot|2000}} tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2&nbsp;billion to US$1.8&nbsp;billion; foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled. There was a rise in defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline.{{sfn|Kelley | Shenkar | 1993 | pp=120\u201322}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, the government sought again to centralize control over the economy,{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} though the changes were short-lived.  Sensing that conservative policies had again taken a foothold within the party, Deng, now retired from all of his official positions, launched his \"southern tour\" in 1992, visiting various cities in the country's most prosperous regions while advocating for further economic reforms.{{sfn|Wu | 2015}} Partly in response to Deng, by the mid-1990s, the country was again pursuing market liberalization on a scale even greater than those seen in the initial stages of the reform in the 1980s. Although political liberals were purged within the party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} The economic shocks caused by the events of 1989, in retrospect, had only a minor and temporary effect on China's economic growth. Indeed, with many previously aggrieved groups now regarding political opening as a lost cause, more energy was spent on economic activities. The economy would quickly regain momentum into the 1990s.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}}\n\n===Hong Kong===\n[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on the 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.\n\nThere have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. The [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.{{sfn|Kam|2016}}\n\nThe events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese.\" The events of June 4 are seen as representative of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism and is often invoked by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, especially in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|pp=152, 155}}\n\n===Impact on China's national image===\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=424}} From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to a benign global economic and military partner.{{sfn|Cabestan | 2010 |p= 194}}\n\nIn the 1990s, China attempted to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions to secure investment for continued economic reforms.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 19}} The government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993 and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} Whereas China had been a member of only 30 international organizations in 1986, it was a member of over 50 by 1997.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=198}} China also sought to diversify its external partnerships, establishing good diplomatic relations with post-Soviet Russia,{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} and welcoming Taiwanese business in lieu of Western investment.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] and established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea and others in 1992.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} While China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a net provider of aid.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\nFurthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=55}} Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of focusing on business interests. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have sometimes paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen in bilateral meetings, but the substance of discussions revolved around business and trade interests.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\n===European Union and United States arms embargo===\n{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China\u2013European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schr\u00f6der's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\n\nIn addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.{{sfn|Japan Concerned}}\n\n==Contemporary issues==\n===Censorship in China===\n{{further|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{see also|Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Specific examples of internet censorship|l1=Internet censorship of the protest}}\nThe [[Communist Party of China]] forbids discussion of the Tiananmen Square protests{{sfn|Saiget |2009}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=Made taboo not forbidden}}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems|title=One App, Two Systems|at=figure 9|access-date=September 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010221114/https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=App censors this, but that doesn't mean it's forbidden, or even that this is because the Communist Party directly}} and has taken measures to block or censor related information.

Within a year, 12% of all newspapers, 8% of publishing companies, 13% of social science periodicals and more than 150 films were banned or shut down. The government also announced it had seized 32&nbsp;million contraband books and 2.4&nbsp;million video and audio cassettes.{{sfn|Pei | 1994 | p=152}} Access to media and Internet resources on the subject are restricted or blocked by censors.{{sfn|Zetter|2009}} Banned literature and films include ''[[Summer Palace (2006 film)|Summer Palace]]'',{{sfn|Higgins | 2006}} ''[[Forbidden City (novel)|Forbidden City]]'', ''[[Collection of June Fourth Poems]]'',{{sfn|Ban on Poems}} ''[[The Critical Moment]]: Li Peng diaries'' and any writings of Zhao Ziyang or his aide [[Bao Tong]], including [[Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang|Zhao's memoirs]].

Many young people born after 1980 are unfamiliar with the events and are apathetic about politics.

One group in particular, [[Tiananmen Mothers]], seeks compensation, vindication for victims and the right to receive donations from within the mainland and abroad.{{sfn|Relatives of Dead}} Zhang Shijun, a former soldier who was involved in the military crackdown, had published an open letter to President Hu Jintao seeking to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests. He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home.{{sfn|Branigan|2009}}\n\nAlthough the Chinese government never officially acknowledged relevant accusations when it came to the incident, in April 2006 a payment was made to the mother of one of the victims, the first publicized case of the government offering redress to a Tiananmen-related victim's family. The payment was termed a \"hardship assistance\", given to Tang Deying ({{lang|zh|\u5510\u5fb7\u82f1}}) whose son Zhou Guocong ({{zh|s=\u5468\u56fd\u806a|t=\u5468\u570b\u8070}}) died at age 15 years while in police custody in [[Chengdu]] on June 6, 1989, two days after the Chinese Army dispersed the Tiananmen protesters. She was reportedly paid CNY70,000 (approximately US$10,250).

The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefited some people but seriously disaffected others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=216}} and restrictions on political participation. The students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of speech]], although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Nathan|2001}} At the height of the protests, about 1&nbsp;million people assembled in the Square.{{sfn|D.

Western countries imposed arms embargoes on China.{{sfn|Dube | 2014 }} The Chinese government made widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, suppressed [[1989 Chinese protests by region|other protests around China]], expelled foreign journalists, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press, strengthened the police and internal security forces, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests.{{sfn|Miles | 1997 | p=28}} More broadly, the suppression halted the policies of liberalization in the 1980s.

The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. June Fourth refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as June Fourth Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516d\u56db\u8fd0\u52a8 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng}}) and '89 Democracy Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0 |p=b\u0101-ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n}}) are used to describe the event in its entirety.\n\nOutside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as June Fourth Massacre ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u5c60\u6bba |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec t\u00fash\u0101}}) and June Fourth Crackdown ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u93ae\u58d3 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec zh\u00e8ny\u0101}}). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4), Eight Squared (i.e. 8<sup>2</sup>=64){{sfn|China tightens information}} and 8964.<ref name=\"HKFP8964\">''[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ Bus driver in \u20188964\u2019 massacre memento suspended for 3 months] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622185220/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ |date=June 22, 2019 }}'', June 13, 2016, [[Chantal Yuen]], [[Hong Kong Free Press]].</ref>\n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}} As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a \"counterrevolutionary riot\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political storm\" and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase \"political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989\", which it uses to this day.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}}{{sfn|Day China trampled2009}}\n\nIn English, the terms Tiananmen Square Massacre, Tiananmen Square Protests or Tiananmen Square Crackdown are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence in Beijing did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square along a stretch of [[Chang'an Avenue]] only a few miles long, and especially near the [[Muxidi]] area.{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=283}} The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.{{sfn|Miles|2009}}\n\n==Background==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\nThe [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's originally diverse economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.\n\nTo run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the Communist Party in 1982, while [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], the head of government, in September 1980.\n\n===Challenges with reform===\nThe reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.\n\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.{{sfn|Naughton|2007| p=91}} The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. Party bureaucrats suddenly found themselves in charge of a burgeoning state regime over economic management and enormous incentives for [[arbitrage]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=120}} Discontent over corruption reached a fever pitch with the public, and many, particularly those in the intellectual community, began to believe that only democratic reform and rule of law could act as a panacea for the country's ills.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|Chapter 5: On the Eve of the 1989 Movement}}\n\nFollowing the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying and hoarding all over China.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but its impact was pronounced for much longer. Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}}\n\n===Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis===\nReformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=81}} Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=84}} The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=89}} Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" and the \"Lawn Salon\" (''C\u01ceod\u00ec Sh\u0101l\u00f3ng''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=137}} These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}}\n\nAt the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}} Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}}\n\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. However, both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===1986 student demonstrations===\n{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]] returned from a position at [[Princeton University]] and began a personal tour around universities in China; speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=64, 215}} The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}} In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}}\n\nInspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.{{sfn|Wang | 2006| pp=56\u201357}} While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\n\nGeneral secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987. Then the party began the \"Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign\", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.{{sfn|Spence | 1999 | p=685}} The Campaign stopped student protests and tightened the political environment, but Hu remained popular among progressives in the party, intellectuals, and students.{{sfn|D.

Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=147}} Small spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}} At 5&nbsp;pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\nStarting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (Seven Demands) for the government:\n# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.\n# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.\n# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.\n# Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.\n# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.\n# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.\n# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}}\n\nOn the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].\n\nOn April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=149}} Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.{{sfn|Walder | Gong | 1993 | pp=1\u20132}}\n\nHu's [[state funeral]] took place on April 22. On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=152\u201353}}{{sfn|Li|2010}}\n\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall of the People, but several students pressed forward. A few were allowed to cross the police line. Three of these students ([[Zhou Yongjun]], [[Guo Haifeng]] and [[Zhang Zhiyong]]) knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}{{efn| Analyst [[Richard Baum]] described their actions as \"...a mock-ceremonial remonstrance... presenting their scrolled-up demands on hands and knees in the stylized, obsequious manner of an imperial petition.\"{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=248}} Political scientist [[Lucian Pye]] similarly described the act as \"..in line with the classic Chinese tradition of aggrieved parties wailing before the Yamen door, of publicly dramatizing their unhappiness by petitioning officialdom... [they] sincerely believed that the officials would have to respond by meeting with them.\"{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=337}}&nbsp;}} Standing beside them, a fourth student ([[Wu'erkaixi]]) made a brief, emotional speech begging for Li Peng to come out and speak with them. The larger number of students still in the Square but outside the cordon were at times emotional, shouting demands or slogans and rushing toward police. Wu'erkaixi calmed the crowd down as they waited for the Premier to emerge. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}\n\nOn April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, in a meeting of around 40 students from 21 universities, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. The Union then called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=154}}\n\nOn April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009}} Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on April 23.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}}\n\n===Turning point: April 26 Editorial===\n{{main|April 26 Editorial|l1=26 April Editorial}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|footer=General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] (left) who pushed for dialogue with students and Premier [[Li Peng]] (right) who declared martial law and backed military action\n|width1=150\n|image1=Zhao Ziyang (1985).jpg\n|alt1=Zhao Ziyang\n|width2=166\n|image2=Lipeng.jpg\n|alt2=Li Peng\n}}\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}} On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\nOn April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled \"[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]].\" The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.{{sfn|April 26 Editorial|1995}} The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]\u2014an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as \"patriotic\" under Deng's leadership.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===April 27 demonstrations===\n{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}\n[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|upright|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]\nOrganized by the Union on April 27, some 50,000\u2013100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption, anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\".{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an April 26 editorial.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}}\n\nThe stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=157}}\n\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=156}} Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on May 3\u20134. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}} The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on May 4 to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On May 4, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=159}}\n\n==Protests escalate==\n===Preparing for dialogue===\n{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}\nThe leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}}\n\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal delegation. There was some friction, however, as the Union leaders were reluctant to let the delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=161}} The movement was slowed by a change to a more deliberate approach, fractured by internal discord, and increasingly diluted by declining engagement from the student body at large. In this context, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, desired to regain momentum. They also distrusted the government's offers of 'dialogue', dismissing them as merely a ploy designed to play for time and pacify the students. To break from the moderate and incremental approach now adopted by other major student leaders, these few began calling for a return to more confrontational measures. They settled on a plan of mobilizing students for a hunger strike on that would begin May 13.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=161\u201362}} Early attempts to mobilize others to join them met with only modest success until [[Chai Ling]] made an emotional appeal on the night before the strike was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|D.

Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009 |pp=612\u201314}} By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}}\n\nInspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.<ref>''[[Amnesty International]]'', August 30, 1989. ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989'', p.19</ref>\n\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping ordered the Square to be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=164}} Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not\u2014in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}}\n\n===Mikhail Gorbachev visit===\n{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}} However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}} While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=169}} Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.{{efn|Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.}}\n\nThe students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (\"loss of [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]\"){{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=300}} for the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=170}} The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. Zhao's defense against this accusation was that privately informing world leaders that Deng was the true center of power was standard operating procedure; Li Peng had made nearly identical private statements to US president [[George H.W. Bush]] in February 1989.{{sfn|Sarotte|2012|p=165}} Nevertheless, the statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}}\n\n===Gathering momentum===\nThe hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17\u201318 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\n\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.{{sfn|D.

[[Jiang Zemin]], then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding' as he was a former student agitator before 1949.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May.

The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement.

Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the Square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles.{{sfn|L.

At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed. Wuerkaixi was taken away by ambulance. By then, there were still 70,000\u201380,000 people in the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}\n\nAt about 12:15{{nbsp}}am, a [[flare]] lit up the sky and the first armored personnel vehicle appeared on the Square from the west. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of concrete at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}\n\nPressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings. At one point, Chai Ling picked up the megaphone and called on fellow students to prepare to \"defend themselves\" against the \"shameless government.\" However, she and Li Lu agreed to adhere to peaceful means and had the students' sticks, rocks and glass bottles confiscated.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (2)}}\n\nAt about 1:30{{nbsp}}am, the vanguard of the 38th Army from the XV Airborne Corps arrived at the north and south ends of the Square, respectively.{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4}} They began to seal off the Square from reinforcements of students and residents, killing more demonstrators who were trying to enter the Square.{{sfn|Miles | 2009}} Meanwhile, the 27th and 65th Armies poured out of the Great Hall of the People to the west and the 24th Army emerged from behind the History Museum to the east.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (2)}} The remaining students, numbering several thousand, were completely surrounded at the Monument of the People's Heroes in the center of the Square. At 2{{nbsp}}am, the troops fired shots over the heads of the students at the Monument. The students broadcast pleadings back toward the troops: \"We entreat you in peace, for democracy and freedom of the motherland, for strength and prosperity of the Chinese nation, please comply with the will of the people and refrain from using force against peaceful student demonstrators.\"{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4}}\n\nAt about 2:30{{nbsp}}am, several workers near the Monument emerged with a machine gun they had captured from the troops and vowed to take revenge. They were persuaded to give up the weapon by Hou Dejian. The workers also handed over an assault rifle without ammunition, which Liu Xiaobo smashed against the marble railings of the Monument.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}} Shao Jiang, a student who had witnessed the killings at Muxidi, pleaded with the older intellectuals to retreat, saying too many lives had been lost. Initially, Liu Xiaobo was reluctant, but eventually joined Zhou Duo, Gao Xin and [[Hou Dejian]] in making the case to the student leaders for a withdrawal. Chai Ling, Li Lu and Feng Congde initially rejected the idea of withdrawal.{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4}} At 3:30{{nbsp}}am, at the suggestion of two doctors in the Red Cross camp, Hou Dejian and Zhuo Tuo agreed to try to negotiate with the soldiers. They rode in an ambulance to the northeast corner of the Square and spoke with Ji Xinguo, the political commissar of the 38th Army's 336th Regiment, who relayed the request to command headquarters, which agreed to grant safe passage for the students to the southeast. The commissar told Hou, \"it would be a tremendous accomplishment, if you can persuade the students to leave the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}}\n\nAt 4{{nbsp}}am, the lights on the Square suddenly turned off, and the government's loudspeaker announced: \"Clearance of the Square begins now. We agree with the students' request to clear the Square.\"{{sfn|Wu: Sunday June 4}} The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'' and braced for a last stand.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (3)}} Hou returned and informed student leaders of his agreement with the troops. At 4:30{{nbsp}}am, the lights relit and the troops began to advance on the Monument from all sides. At about 4:32{{nbsp}}am, Hou Dejian took the student's loudspeaker and recounted his meeting with the military. Many students, who learned of the talks for the first time, reacted angrily and accused him of cowardice.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}}\n\nThe soldiers stopped about ten meters from the students. The first row of troops took aim with machine guns from the prone position. Behind them soldiers [[Squatting position|squatted]] and stood with assault rifles. Mixed among them were anti-riot police with clubs. Further back were tanks and APCs.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} Feng Congde took to the loudspeaker and explained that there was no time left to hold a meeting. Instead, a voice vote would decide the collective action of the group. Although the vote's results were inconclusive, Feng said the \"gos\" had prevailed.{{sfn|D. Zhao |2001|p=206}} Within a few minutes, at about 4:35{{nbsp}}am, a squad of soldiers in camouflaged uniform charged up the Monument and shot out the students' loudspeaker.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=206}}{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} Other troops beat and kicked dozens of students at the Monument, seizing and smashing their cameras and recording equipment. An officer with a loudspeaker called out \"you better leave or this won't end well.\"{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}}\n\nSome of the students and professors persuaded others still sitting on the lower tiers of the Monument to get up and leave, while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets. Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} At about 5:10{{nbsp}}am, the students began to leave the Monument. They linked hands and marched through a corridor to the southeast,{{sfn|John Pomfret interview|2006}}{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} though some departed through the north.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (4)}} Those who refused to leave were beaten by soldiers and ordered to join the departing procession.

Many in the crowd were parents of the demonstrators who had been in the Square. As the crowd approached the troops, an officer sounded a warning, and the troops opened fire. The crowd scurried back down the avenue in view of journalists in the Beijing Hotel. Dozens of civilians were shot in the back as they fled.{{sfn|Thomas|2006|loc=32:23\u201334:50}} Later, the crowds surged back toward the troops, who opened fire again.

The \"[[Tank Man]]\", as it became known, became one of the most iconic photographs in the 20th century. As the tank driver tried to go around him, the \"Tank Man\" moved into the tank's path. He continued to stand defiantly in front of the tanks for some time, then climbed up onto the turret of the lead tank to speak to the soldiers inside. After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people.{{sfn|Frontline: Tank Man|2006}}\n\nAlthough the fate of \"Tank Man\" following the demonstration is not known, then-paramount Chinese leader Jiang Zemin stated in 1990 that he did not think the man was killed.{{sfn|Iyer|1998}} ''Time'' later named him one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential people of the 20th century]].\n\nA stopped convoy of 37 APCs on Changan Boulevard at Muxidi was forced to abandon their vehicles after becoming stuck among an assortment of burned out buses and military vehicles.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=178\u201379}} In addition to occasional incidents of soldiers opening fire on civilians in Beijing, Western news outlets reported clashes between units of the PLA.{{sfn|Kristof:Units Clash}} Late in the afternoon 26 tanks, three armored personnel carriers and supporting infantry took up defensive positions facing East at [[Jianguomen (Beijing)|Jianguomen]] and [[Fuxingmen]] overpasses.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=189}} Shellfire was heard throughout the night and the next morning a United States Marine in the eastern part of the city reported spotting a damaged armored vehicle that had been disabled by an armor-piercing shell.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=190}} The ongoing turmoil in the capital disrupted the flow of everyday life.

A political purge followed in which officials responsible for organizing or condoning the protests were removed, and protest leaders jailed.{{sfn|Tsui|Pang}}\n\n===Protests outside Beijing===\nAfter order was restored in Beijing on June 4, protests of varying scales continued in some 80 other Chinese cities, outside the spotlight of the international press.{{sfn|Ageing rebels, bitter victims|2014}} In the British colony of Hong Kong, people again took to wearing black in solidarity with the demonstrators in Beijing. There were also protests in other countries, many adopting the use of black armbands as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn Shanghai, students marched on the streets on June 5 and erected roadblocks on major thoroughfares.

The municipal government gained recognition from the top leadership in Beijing for averting a major upheaval.\n\nIn the interior cities of Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing and Chengdu, many students continued protests after June 4, often erecting roadblocks. In Xi'an, students stopped workers from entering factories.{{sfn|L.

Zhang |2001|p=400}} About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike.{{sfn|L.

On June 7, hundreds of students staged a blockade at the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] as well as the Zhongyangmen Railway Bridge. They were persuaded to evacuate without incident later that day, though returned the next day to occupy the main railway station and the bridges.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=409}}\n\nThe atmosphere in [[Chengdu]] was more violent. On the morning of June 4, police forcibly broke up the student demonstration taking place in Tianfu Square. The resulting violence killed eight people, and injured hundreds. The most brutal attacks occurred on June 5 and 6. Witnesses estimate that 30 to 100 bodies were thrown onto a truck after a crowd broke into the Jinjiang Hotel.{{sfn|Lim|2014b}} According to Amnesty International, at least 300 people were killed in Chengdu on June 5.{{sfn|Calls for Justice |2004}}{{sfn|Massacre and aftermath|1990}} Troops in Chengdu used concussion [[grenades]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]], [[knives]] and [[electroshock weapon]] against civilians.

Chinese authorities actively suppressed discussion of casualty figures immediately after the events, and estimates rely heavily on eyewitness testimony, hospital records, and organized efforts by victims' relatives.

[[Hu Qili]], another PSC member who opposed the martial law but abstained from voting, was also removed from the committee. He was, however, able to retain his party membership, and after \"changing his opinion\", was reassigned as deputy minister in the Ministry for Machinery and Electronics Industry. Another reform-minded Chinese leader, [[Wan Li]], was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing Capital Airport]] upon returning from his shortened trip abroad; the authorities declared his detention to be on health grounds. When Wan Li was released from his house arrest after he finally \"changed his opinion\" he, like [[Qiao Shi]], was transferred to a different position with equal rank but a mostly ceremonial role. Several Chinese ambassadors abroad claimed political asylum.{{sfn|Bernstein1989b}}\n\n[[File:Jiang Zemin1.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Jiang Zemin]], the party secretary of Shanghai, where student protests were subdued largely without violence, was promoted to succeed [[Zhao Ziyang]] as the party [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] in 1989.]]\n[[Jiang Zemin]], then Party Secretary of Shanghai, was promoted to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]]. Jiang's decisive actions in Shanghai involving the ''World Economic Herald'' and his having prevented deadly violence in the city won him support from party elders in Beijing. Having put the new leadership team in place and recognising his weakened position, Deng Xiaoping himself also bowed out of the party leadership\u2014at least officially\u2014by resigning his last leadership position as Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission]] later that year. He kept a low profile until 1992. According to diplomatic cables de-classified by Canada, the Swiss ambassador informed Canadian diplomats in confidence that over several months following the massacre, \"every member of the Politburo Standing Committee has approached him about transferring very significant amounts of money to Swiss bank accounts\".{{sfn|Phillips|2015}}\n\n[[Bao Tong]], Zhao Ziyang's aide, was the highest-ranking official to be formally charged with a crime in connection with 1989 demonstrations. He was convicted in 1992 of \"revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing\" and served seven years in prison. To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to \"deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization\". Four million people were reportedly investigated for their role in the protests. More than 30,000 Communist officers were deployed to assess 'political reliability' of more than one million government officials.{{sfn|Miles | 1997 | pp=27\u201330}} The authorities arrested tens if not hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Some were seized in broad daylight while they walked in the street; others were arrested at night. Many were jailed or sent to labor camps.

State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students. As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts. Two news anchors [[Xue Fei (host)|Xue Fei]] and [[Du Xian (news anchor)|Du Xian]], who reported this event on June 4 in the daily ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' broadcast on [[China Central Television]] were fired because they displayed sad emotions. Wu Xiaoyong, the son of former foreign minister [[Wu Xueqian]] was removed from the English Program Department of [[Chinese Radio International]], ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters. Editors and other staff at ''[[People's Daily]]'', including director [[Qian Liren]] and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper which were sympathetic towards the protesters.{{sfn|Wudunn | 1989}} Several editors were arrested.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Foreign media====\n{{main|Foreign Media and the Tiananmen Square Protests}}\nWith the imposition of martial law, the Chinese government cut off the satellite transmissions of western broadcasters such as CNN and CBS.

Many Asian countries remained silent throughout the protests; the government of India responded to the massacre by ordering the state television to offer only the absolute minimum coverage of the incident, so as not to jeopardize a thawing in relations with China, and to offer political empathy for the events.{{sfn|Mohan | 2009}} Cuba, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, among others, supported the Chinese government and denounced the protests.{{sfn|Aftermath of Crisis|1989}} Overseas Chinese students demonstrated in many cities in Europe, America, the Middle East and Asia.{{sfn|Troubles Provoke}}\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n===Political impact===\n{{see|Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}\nThe protests led to a strengthened role for the party in domestic affairs. In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the separation of powers model established following the Cultural Revolution, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a [[figurehead|symbolic position]], while the real centres of power, i.e., the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.\n\nWhen President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. By 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission chairman and President were all consolidated into the same person, a practice that has been continued since.\n\nIn 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.{{sfn|MacKinnon | 1999}} After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe restrictions on society were loosened only a few years after the protests, especially after Deng's 1992 \"southern tour\".{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=195}} Privately run print media again flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially run satellite TV stations sprung up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.{{sfn|Kurlantzick | 2003 | p=50}} The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=50}} This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}} To reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to \"fight against cults\" such as [[Falun Gong]], playing sects off each other.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}}\n\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favour.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=201}} This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}}\n\n===Economic impact===\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many analysts downgraded their outlook of China's economic future.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance to the [[World Trade Organization]], which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4&nbsp;billion in 1988 to $700&nbsp;million in 1990.{{sfn|Foot|2000}} Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;{{sfn|Thakur | Burton | Srivastava | 1997 | pp=404\u201305}} China's credit rating was lowered;{{sfn|Foot|2000}} tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2&nbsp;billion to US$1.8&nbsp;billion; foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled. There was a rise in defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline.{{sfn|Kelley | Shenkar | 1993 | pp=120\u201322}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, the government sought again to centralize control over the economy,{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} though the changes were short-lived.  Sensing that conservative policies had again taken a foothold within the party, Deng, now retired from all of his official positions, launched his \"southern tour\" in 1992, visiting various cities in the country's most prosperous regions while advocating for further economic reforms.{{sfn|Wu | 2015}} Partly in response to Deng, by the mid-1990s, the country was again pursuing market liberalization on a scale even greater than those seen in the initial stages of the reform in the 1980s. Although political liberals were purged within the party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} The economic shocks caused by the events of 1989, in retrospect, had only a minor and temporary effect on China's economic growth. Indeed, with many previously aggrieved groups now regarding political opening as a lost cause, more energy was spent on economic activities. The economy would quickly regain momentum into the 1990s.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}}\n\n===Hong Kong===\n[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on the 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.\n\nThere have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. The [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.{{sfn|Kam|2016}}\n\nThe events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese.\" The events of June 4 are seen as representative of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism and is often invoked by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, especially in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|pp=152, 155}}\n\n===Impact on China's national image===\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=424}} From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to a benign global economic and military partner.{{sfn|Cabestan | 2010 |p= 194}}\n\nIn the 1990s, China attempted to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions to secure investment for continued economic reforms.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 19}} The government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993 and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} Whereas China had been a member of only 30 international organizations in 1986, it was a member of over 50 by 1997.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=198}} China also sought to diversify its external partnerships, establishing good diplomatic relations with post-Soviet Russia,{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} and welcoming Taiwanese business in lieu of Western investment.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] and established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea and others in 1992.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} While China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a net provider of aid.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\nFurthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=55}} Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of focusing on business interests. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have sometimes paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen in bilateral meetings, but the substance of discussions revolved around business and trade interests.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\n===European Union and United States arms embargo===\n{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China\u2013European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schr\u00f6der's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\n\nIn addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]].

Textbooks have little, if any, information about the protests.{{sfn|Olesen|2009}} After the protests, officials banned controversial films and books, and shut down many newspapers. Within a year, 12% of all newspapers, 8% of publishing companies, 13% of social science periodicals and more than 150 films were banned or shut down. The government also announced it had seized 32&nbsp;million contraband books and 2.4&nbsp;million video and audio cassettes.{{sfn|Pei | 1994 | p=152}} Access to media and Internet resources on the subject are restricted or blocked by censors.{{sfn|Zetter|2009}} Banned literature and films include ''[[Summer Palace (2006 film)|Summer Palace]]'',{{sfn|Higgins | 2006}} ''[[Forbidden City (novel)|Forbidden City]]'', ''[[Collection of June Fourth Poems]]'',{{sfn|Ban on Poems}} ''[[The Critical Moment]]: Li Peng diaries'' and any writings of Zhao Ziyang or his aide [[Bao Tong]], including [[Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang|Zhao's memoirs]]. However, contraband and Internet copies of these publications can be found.{{sfn|Trying Times}}\n\nPublic memory of the Tiananmen Square protests has been suppressed by the authorities since 1989. Print media containing reference to the protests must be consistent with the government's version of events.{{sfn|Unhealed Wounds|2009}} Not only domestic but also foreign journalists are detained, harassed, or threatened, as are their Chinese colleagues and any Chinese citizens they interview.{{sfn|Greenslade|2014}} Thus Chinese citizens are typically reluctant to speak about the protests because of potential repercussions. Many young people born after 1980 are unfamiliar with the events and are apathetic about politics. Youth in China are sometimes unaware of the events, of the symbols such as [[tank man]],{{sfn|Fisher|2014}}{{sfn|Apathy}} or of the significance of the date June 4 itself.{{sfn|Young clerk let|2007}} Some older intellectuals no longer aspire for political change and instead focus on economic issues.{{sfn|Gifford|2007|pp=167\u201368}} A number of political prisoners have refused to talk to their children about their involvement out of fear of putting them at risk.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Lily |last2=Westcott |first2=Ben |title=They faced down the tanks in Tiananmen Square.

[[Zhang Xianling]] and [[Ding Zilin]], mothers of victims who lost their lives in 1989, founded the [[Tiananmen Mothers]] organization and were particularly outspoken on the humanitarian aspects of the subject.{{sfn|References Censored|2009}} The authorities mobilize security forces, including members of the [[People's Armed Police]], every year on June 4 to prevent public displays of remembrance, with especially heavy security for major anniversaries such as the [[20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|20th anniversary in 2009]] and the 25th anniversary in 2014.{{sfn|Bristow|2009}} On the 30th anniversary in 2019, renowned Chinese artist [[Ai Weiwei]] wrote that \"autocratic and totalitarian regimes fear facts because they have built their power on unjust foundations\" and said that memory is important: \"without it there is no such thing as a civilised society or nation\" because \"our past is all we have\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/china-tiananmen-square-beijing?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other|title=The west is complicit in the 30-year cover-up of Tiananmen|last=Ai|first=Weiwei|date=June 4, 2019|work=The Guardian \u2013 Australia edition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616061550/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/china-tiananmen-square-beijing?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other|archive-date=June 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/why-searching-for-the-truth-about-tiananmen-is-more-important-than-ever-20190530-p51suy.html|title=Why searching for the truth about Tiananmen is more important than ever|last=Needham|first=Kirsty|date=May 31, 2019|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929221548/https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/why-searching-for-the-truth-about-tiananmen-is-more-important-than-ever-20190530-p51suy.html|archive-date=September 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nJournalists have frequently been denied entry to the Square on anniversaries.{{sfn|Bristow|2009}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/tiananmen-square-protests-crackdown-intensifies-as-30th-anniversary-nears|title=Tiananmen Square protests: crackdown intensifies as 30th anniversary nears|last=Davidson|first=Helen|date=May 31, 2019|work=The Guardian \u2013 Australian edition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831183459/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/tiananmen-square-protests-crackdown-intensifies-as-30th-anniversary-nears|archive-date=August 31, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, the authorities are known to have detained foreign journalists and increase surveillance on prominent human rights activists during this time of year.{{sfn|Wong|2009}} Internet searches of June 4 Tiananmen Square made within China return censored results or result in temporarily severed server connections.{{sfn|References Censored|2009}} Specific web pages with select keywords are censored while other websites, such as those of overseas Chinese democracy movements, are blocked wholesale.{{sfn|Olesen|2009}}{{sfn|References Censored|2009}} In addition, the policy is much more stringent with Chinese-language sites than foreign-language ones. Social media censorship is more stringent in the weeks near anniversaries; even oblique references to the protests and seemingly unrelated terms are usually very aggressively patrolled and censored.{{sfn|Kuang|2016}} In January 2006, [[Censorship by Google|Google agreed to censor]] their mainland China site to remove information about Tiananmen and other subjects considered sensitive by the authorities.{{sfn|Google Censors Itself|2006}} Google withdrew its cooperation on censorship in January 2010.{{sfn|Wines|2010}}\n\n===Calls to reverse the verdict===\nThe party's official stance towards the incident is that the use of force was necessary to control a \"political disturbance\"{{sfn|Unhealed Wounds}} and that it ensured the stability necessary for economic prosperity.{{sfn|Relatives of Dead}} Chinese leaders, including former [[paramount leader]]s [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Hu Jintao]], reiterate this line when questioned by foreign press.{{sfn|Provocateur}}\n\nOver the years some Chinese citizens have called for a reassessment of the protests and compensation from the government to victims' families. One group in particular, [[Tiananmen Mothers]], seeks compensation, vindication for victims and the right to receive donations from within the mainland and abroad.{{sfn|Relatives of Dead}} Zhang Shijun, a former soldier who was involved in the military crackdown, had published an open letter to President Hu Jintao seeking to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests. He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home.{{sfn|Branigan|2009}}\n\nAlthough the Chinese government never officially acknowledged relevant accusations when it came to the incident, in April 2006 a payment was made to the mother of one of the victims, the first publicized case of the government offering redress to a Tiananmen-related victim's family. The payment was termed a \"hardship assistance\", given to Tang Deying ({{lang|zh|\u5510\u5fb7\u82f1}}) whose son Zhou Guocong ({{zh|s=\u5468\u56fd\u806a|t=\u5468\u570b\u8070}}) died at age 15 years while in police custody in [[Chengdu]] on June 6, 1989, two days after the Chinese Army dispersed the Tiananmen protesters. She was reportedly paid CNY70,000 (approximately US$10,250). This has been welcomed by various Chinese activists, but it was regarded by some as a measure to maintain social stability and not believed to herald a changing of the party's official position.{{sfn|China makes 1989|2006}}\n\n===Leaders voicing regret===\nBefore his death in 1998, Yang Shangkun told army doctor [[Jiang Yanyong]] that June 4 was the most serious mistake committed by the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang himself could not correct, but one that certainly will eventually be corrected.{{sfn|\u9547\u538b\u516d\u56db\u4e3b\u5c06\u3001\u515a\u5185\u6597\u4e89\u727a\u7272\u54c1\u6768\u767d\u51b0\u75c5\u901d}} Zhao Ziyang remained under house arrest until his death in 2005. Zhao's aide [[Bao Tong]] has repeatedly called on the government to reverse the verdict for the demonstrations. Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing, who read the martial law order and was later disgraced by a political scandal, expressed regret for the death of innocent civilians in 2012, a year before his death.{{sfn|Buckley}} Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] reportedly suggested reversing the government's position on Tiananmen in party meetings prior to his departure from politics in 2013, only to be rebuffed by his colleagues.{{sfn|Anderlini|2013}}\n\n===United Nations report===\nIn its 41st session, from November 3 to 21, 2008, the [[UN Committee Against Torture]] expressed concern over the lack of investigations into the reports of people \"killed, arrested or disappeared on or following the 4&nbsp;June 1989 Beijing suppression\". The Chinese government, it stated, had also failed to inform relatives of those individuals' fate, despite relatives' numerous requests. Meanwhile, those responsible for the use of excessive force had not \"faced any sanction, administrative or criminal\".{{sfn|Committee Against Torture|2008|p=8}} The Committee recommended that the Chinese government should take all of those steps, plus \"offer apologies and reparation as appropriate and prosecute those found responsible for excessive use of force, torture and other ill-treatment.\"{{sfn|Committee Against Torture|2008|p=8}}\n\nIn December 2009, the Chinese government responded to the Committee's recommendations by saying that the government had closed the case concerning the \"political turmoil in the spring and summer of 1989\".{{sfn|Committee Against Torture|2008| p=13}} It also stated that the \"practice of the past 20 years has made it clear that the timely and decisive measures taken by the Chinese Government at the time were necessary and correct.\" It claimed that the labelling of the \"incident as 'the Democracy Movement{{' \"}} is a \"distortion in the nature of the incident\".

It was granted [[orphan drug]] status by the FDA in 2016.\n\n== History ==\nPAC-1 was discovered in Professor Paul Hergenrother's laboratory at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] during a process that [[Drug discovery#Screening and design|screened]] many chemicals for anti-tumor potential. This molecule, when delivered to cancer cells, signals the cells to self-destruct by activating an \"executioner\" protein, [[procaspase-3]]. Then, the activated executioner protein begins a cascade of events that destroys the machinery of the cell. In 2011, Vanquish Oncology Inc. was founded to move PAC-1 forward to a human clinical trial. In 2013, Vanquish announced a multimillion-dollar angel investment into the company. In 2015, a phase I clinical trial of PAC-1 opened for enrollment of cancer patients, and in 2016, it was announced that PAC-1 had been granted Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of [[glioblastoma]] by the FDA, and in late 2017 a Phase 1b trial began of PAC-1 plus temozolomide for treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nIn cells, the executioner protein, caspase-3, is stored in its inactive form, procaspase-3. This way, the cell can quickly undergo apoptosis by activating the protein that is already there. This inactive form is called a [[zymogen]]. Procaspase-3 is known to be inhibited by low levels of zinc.  PAC-1 activates procaspase-3 by chelating zinc, thus relieving the zinc-mediated inhibition.  This allows procaspase-3 to be an active enzyme, and it can then cleave another molecule of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3.  Caspase-3 can further activate other molecules of procaspase-3 in the cell, causing an exponential increase in caspase-3 concentration. PAC-1 facilitates this process and causes the cell to undergo apoptosis quickly.<ref name=\"Putt\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Putt KS, Chen GW, Pearson JM, Sandhorst JS, Hoagland MS, Kwon JT, Hwang SK, Jin H, Churchwell MI, Cho MH, Doerge DR, Helferich WG, Hergenrother PJ |title=Small-molecule activation of procaspase-3 to caspase-3 as a personalized anticancer strategy l|volume=2 |issue= 10 |pages= 543\u201350|year= 2006 |pmid= 16936720  | doi=10.1038/nchembio814  | journal=Nature Chemical Biology }}\n</ref>\n\nThis direct procaspase-3 activation mode-of-action for PAC-1 has been confirmed by other laboratories: In 2013 by the Megeney lab during the course of studies on the role of caspase-3 in cardiomyocytes,<ref name=\"Putinski\">{{cite journal  | vauthors=Putinski C, Abdul-Ghani M, Stiles R, Brunette S, Dick SA, Fernando P, Megeney LA |title=Intrinsic-mediated caspase activation is essential for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy |volume=110 |issue= 43 |pages= E4079-87|year= 2013 |pmid= 24101493  | doi=10.1073/pnas.1315587110  | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pmc=3808644}}\n</ref> in 2014 by the Wu lab in an extensive study on the anticancer activity and mode-of-action of PAC-1 and derivatives,<ref name=\"Wang\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wang F, Wang L, Zhao Y, Li Y, Ping G, Xiao S, Chen K, Zhu W, Gong P, Yang J, Wu C |title=A novel small-molecule activator of procaspase-3 induces apoptosis in cancer cells and reduces tumor growth in human breast, liver and gallbladder cancer xenografts |volume=8 |issue= 8 |pages= 1640\u20131652|year= 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.molonc.2014.06.015  | journal=Molecular Oncology |pmc=5528581 }}</ref> and in 2015 by the Gandhi lab in an exploration of the potential of PAC-1 and derivative B-PAC-1 for treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL).<ref name=\"Patel\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Patel V, Balakrishnan K, Keatin MJ, Wierda WG, Gandhi V |title=Expression of executioner procaspases and their activation by a procaspase-activating compound in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells |volume=125 |issue= 7 |pages= 1126\u20131136|year= 2015 | doi=10.1182/blood-2014-01-546796  | journal=Blood |pmid=25538042 |pmc=4326772}}\n</ref>\n\nStudies with knockout cells have suggested the importance of procaspase-7 as a secondary or alternate target for PAC-1, especially in the absence of procaspase-3.

It was granted [[orphan drug]] status by the FDA in 2016.\n\n== History ==\nPAC-1 was discovered in Professor Paul Hergenrother's laboratory at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] during a process that [[Drug discovery#Screening and design|screened]] many chemicals for anti-tumor potential. This molecule, when delivered to cancer cells, signals the cells to self-destruct by activating an \"executioner\" protein, [[procaspase-3]]. Then, the activated executioner protein begins a cascade of events that destroys the machinery of the cell. In 2011, Vanquish Oncology Inc. was founded to move PAC-1 forward to a human clinical trial. In 2013, Vanquish announced a multimillion-dollar angel investment into the company. In 2015, a phase I clinical trial of PAC-1 opened for enrollment of cancer patients, and in 2016, it was announced that PAC-1 had been granted Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of [[glioblastoma]] by the FDA, and in late 2017 a Phase 1b trial began of PAC-1 plus temozolomide for treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nIn cells, the executioner protein, caspase-3, is stored in its inactive form, procaspase-3. This way, the cell can quickly undergo apoptosis by activating the protein that is already there. This inactive form is called a [[zymogen]]. Procaspase-3 is known to be inhibited by low levels of zinc.  PAC-1 activates procaspase-3 by chelating zinc, thus relieving the zinc-mediated inhibition.  This allows procaspase-3 to be an active enzyme, and it can then cleave another molecule of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3.  Caspase-3 can further activate other molecules of procaspase-3 in the cell, causing an exponential increase in caspase-3 concentration. PAC-1 facilitates this process and causes the cell to undergo apoptosis quickly.<ref name=\"Putt\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Putt KS, Chen GW, Pearson JM, Sandhorst JS, Hoagland MS, Kwon JT, Hwang SK, Jin H, Churchwell MI, Cho MH, Doerge DR, Helferich WG, Hergenrother PJ |title=Small-molecule activation of procaspase-3 to caspase-3 as a personalized anticancer strategy l|volume=2 |issue= 10 |pages= 543\u201350|year= 2006 |pmid= 16936720  | doi=10.1038/nchembio814  | journal=Nature Chemical Biology }}\n</ref>\n\nThis direct procaspase-3 activation mode-of-action for PAC-1 has been confirmed by other laboratories: In 2013 by the Megeney lab during the course of studies on the role of caspase-3 in cardiomyocytes,<ref name=\"Putinski\">{{cite journal  | vauthors=Putinski C, Abdul-Ghani M, Stiles R, Brunette S, Dick SA, Fernando P, Megeney LA |title=Intrinsic-mediated caspase activation is essential for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy |volume=110 |issue= 43 |pages= E4079-87|year= 2013 |pmid= 24101493  | doi=10.1073/pnas.1315587110  | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pmc=3808644}}\n</ref> in 2014 by the Wu lab in an extensive study on the anticancer activity and mode-of-action of PAC-1 and derivatives,<ref name=\"Wang\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wang F, Wang L, Zhao Y, Li Y, Ping G, Xiao S, Chen K, Zhu W, Gong P, Yang J, Wu C |title=A novel small-molecule activator of procaspase-3 induces apoptosis in cancer cells and reduces tumor growth in human breast, liver and gallbladder cancer xenografts |volume=8 |issue= 8 |pages= 1640\u20131652|year= 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.molonc.2014.06.015  | journal=Molecular Oncology |pmc=5528581 }}</ref> and in 2015 by the Gandhi lab in an exploration of the potential of PAC-1 and derivative B-PAC-1 for treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL).<ref name=\"Patel\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Patel V, Balakrishnan K, Keatin MJ, Wierda WG, Gandhi V |title=Expression of executioner procaspases and their activation by a procaspase-activating compound in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells |volume=125 |issue= 7 |pages= 1126\u20131136|year= 2015 | doi=10.1182/blood-2014-01-546796  | journal=Blood |pmid=25538042 |pmc=4326772}}\n</ref>\n\nStudies with knockout cells have suggested the importance of procaspase-7 as a secondary or alternate target for PAC-1, especially in the absence of procaspase-3.  For example, experiments using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) demonstrate that the double knockout of the CASP3 and CASP7 genes leads to cells that are insensitive to the proapoptotic effects of the PAC-1 class of compounds, and knocking in either CASP3 or CASP7 once again sensitizes these cells to PAC-1-type compounds.<ref name=\"Sarkar\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sarkar A, Balakrishnan K, Chen J, Patel V, Neelapu SS, McMurray JS, Gandhi V |title=Molecular evidence of Zn chelation of the procaspase activating compound B-PAC-1 in B cell lymphoma |volume=7 |issue= 3 |pages= 3461-3476|year= 2016 | doi=10.18632/oncotarget.6505  | journal=Oncotarget |pmid=26658105 |pmc=4823120}}\n</ref> Recent experiments using cancer cell lines with CRISPR deletion of CASP3 are also consistent with this result.<ref name=\"Lin\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lin A, Giuliano C, Palladino A, John K, Abramowicz C, Yuan M, Sausville E, Lukow D, Liu L, Chait A, Galluzzo Z, Tucker C, Sheltzer J |title=Off-target toxicity is a common mechanism of action of cancer drugs undergoing clinical trials |volume=11 |issue= 509 |pages= eaaw8412|year= 2019 | doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw8412  | journal=Sci Transl Med |pmid=31511426 |pmc=}}</ref>\n</ref>  The activation of procaspase-7 by PAC-1 is consistent with biochemical data, although the relative importance of the procaspase-7 target in cells with functional procaspase-3 is uncertain.\n\nA potential selectivity problem arises because procaspase-3 is present in most cells of the body.

This trial is being conducted at the University of Illinois Cancer Center in Chicago, at the [[Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center|Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center]] at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], and at Regions Hospital in St. Paul, MN. A Phase 1b trial of PAC-1 plus temozolomide opened in late 2017 at the same three sites (NCT03332355); patients with high grade glioma (glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma) after progression following standard first line therapy are eligible for this trial.\n\n== Animal trials ==\nPAC-1 is notable for the unique path it has taken to the clinic, as it is possibly the only cancer drug to first be rigorously evaluated in pet dogs with spontaneous cancer as a prelude to the human clinical trial. In 2010, a study showed PAC-1 to be safe for dogs, and a second study published later that same year reported that a PAC-1 derivative (called S-PAC-1) was well tolerated in a small phase I clinical trial of dogs with lymphoma.
