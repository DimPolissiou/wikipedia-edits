She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]], ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film, ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]], and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946); film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949); drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950); and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951), among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Silent films\n!

She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]], ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film, ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]], and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946); film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949); drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950); and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951), among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Silent films\n!

The principal islands being [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]], [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] and [[Bryher]]. The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is considered the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]], while this \"point\" is in fact some shoals southwest of this island that are {{convert|1.4|mi}} south of St Agnes.\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}</ref> recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''\u2014 [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] \"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it\".<ref name=OrkSaga /> (Chap LXXIII)\n\n<blockquote>...the three chiefs \u2013 Swein, \u00deorbj\u00f6rn and Eirik \u2013 went out on a plundering expedition. They went first to the Su\u00f0reyar [Hebrides], and all along the west to the Syllingar, where they gained a great victory in Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn on Columba's-mass [9 June], and took much booty. Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

They were styled ''Governors of Scilly'' and the Godolphins and their Osborne relatives held this position until 1834. In 1834 [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus John Smith]] acquired the lease from the Duchy for \u00a320,000.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Smith created the title ''Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly'' for himself, and many of his actions were unpopular. The lease remained in his family until it expired for most of the Isles in 1920 when ownership reverted to the Duchy of Cornwall. Today, the Dorrien-Smith estate still holds the lease for the island of [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]].\n\n* 1568\u20131608 [[Francis Godolphin (1540\u20131608)|Sir Francis Godolphin]] (1540\u20131608)\n* 1608\u20131613 [[William Godolphin (1567\u20131613)|Sir William Godolphin]] of [[Godolphin Estate|Godolphin]] (1567\u20131613)\n* 1613\u20131636 [[William Godolphin (1611\u20131636)|William Godolphin]] (1611\u20131636)\n* 1636\u20131643 [[Sidney Godolphin (poet)|Sidney Godolphin]] (1610\u20131643)\n* 1643\u20131646 [[Francis Godolphin (1605\u20131667)|Sir Francis Godolphin]] of [[Godolphin Estate|Godolphin]] (1605\u20131647)\n* 1647\u20131648 [[Anthony Buller (1613\u20131679)|Anthony Buller]] (Parliamentarian)\n* 1649\u20131651 [[John Grenville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]] (Royalist)\n* 1651\u20131660 [[Joseph Hunkin (Governor of Scilly)|Joseph Hunkin]]<ref>Per slate tablet on external wall of Old Town Church, [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly]], inscribed as follows: ''\"To the memory of Francys, the wife of Joseph Hunkyn of Gatherly in the parish of Lifton in Devon, Governour of the Iland of Silly.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time. This is reflected in the landscape, most clearly seen on Tresco where the lush [[Tresco Abbey Gardens|Abbey Gardens]] on the sheltered southern end of the island contrast with the low [[calluna|heather]] and bare rock sculpted by the wind on the exposed northern end.\n\n[[Natural England]] has designated the Isles of Scilly as [[National Character Area]] 158.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/158_Isles_of_scilly_tcm6-32162.pdf ''NCA 158: Isles of Scilly Key Facts & Data''], Naturalengland.org.uk.

The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles. Winters are, by far, the warmest in the country due to the moderating effects of the ocean, and despite being on exactly the same latitude as [[Winnipeg]] in Canada, snow and frost are extremely rare. The maximum snowfall was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |publisher=Met Office |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004028/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2014  |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 South West England |page=17}}</ref> Summers are not as warm as on the mainland.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

The principal islands being [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]], [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] and [[Bryher]]. The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is considered the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]], while it is in fact some shoals southwest of this island that are {{convert|1.4|mi}} south of St Agnes.\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.)

Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.

The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] services, operated by [[Isles of Scilly Skybus]], operate from [[Land's End Airport|Land's End]], [[Newquay Cornwall Airport|Newquay]] and [[Exeter International Airport|Exeter]].<ref name=iossb>{{cite web |url=http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |title=Skybus Timetables |publisher=Skybus |accessdate=8 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116023855/http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |archivedate=16 November 2013}}</ref>  There is currently no Sunday air transport.\n\nAt present all air and sea, passenger and freight transport between the Isles of Scilly and the mainland is owned by one company - The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company.  This is often blamed for high year-on-year fare increases.  There have been various local attempts to create competition, but as yet none have succeeded.\n\nThe scheduled [[helicopter]] service, which previously linked [[Penzance Heliport]] with St Mary's Airport and [[Tresco Heliport]], ceased at the end of October 2012. A new heliport is currently under construction in Penzance and helicopter services to Tresco and St Mary's are expected to commence in 2019 or 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://penzanceheliport.co.uk/|title=Isles of Scilly Helicopter from Penzance Heliport|website=Penzance Heliport|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nThe [[freehold (law)|freehold land]] of the islands is the property of the Duchy of Cornwall (except for [[Hugh Town]] on St Mary's, which was sold to the inhabitants in 1949).

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect [[marine salvage|salvage]] from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed \"pilot gigs\"). The [[World Pilot Gig Championships]] are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend. The event originally involved crews from the Islands and a few crews from Cornwall, but in the intervening years the number of gigs attending has increased, with crews coming from all over the South-West and as far afield as the Netherlands and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgigs.co.uk/|title=World Pilot Gig Championships&nbsp;\u2013 Isles of Scilly |author1=Rick Persich |author2=Chairman World Pilot Gigs Championships Committee |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Isles of Scilly feature what is reportedly the smallest [[association football|football]] league in the world, the [[Isles of Scilly Football League]].<ref>Smith, Rory (22 December 2016).

The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design and combat mechanics.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn a demo build unveiled to the public in January 2020, further new mechanics were also revealed, including high-difficulty Slayer Challenges, additional upgrade resources including Sentinel Crystals, and the ability to take control of some enemy units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/watch-15-minutes-of-new-doom-eternal-gameplay/|title=Watch 15 minutes of new 'DOOM Eternal' gameplay|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=2019-10-08|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors.

What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement initially formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a new arsenal of weapons and a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to Hell  to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge; the Slayer retrieves his Super Shotgun and defeats the Priest's Doom Hunter guardians before killing him.\n\nIn response to Deag Ranak\u2019s death, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a secure location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. After destroying the nest, Vega suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to a compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, the Slayer's past is revealed. The Slayer, who is identified by the name \"[[Doomguy]]\", is revealed to be from Earth. He was found on Sentinel Prime badly wounded, and ranting about his desire to kill the demons who were then unknown to the Sentinels and the Khan Maykr. The Priests had Doomguy tested in a gladiatorial arena where he bested his opponents and thereafter was inducted into the Sentinel military. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena. Despite knowing it is against Sentinel law, Slayer kills Deag Grav after defeating his guardian, the Gladiator and returns to the fortress.\n\nDespite stopping the demons' invasion of Earth, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr, who resolves to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind. However, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. More of the Slayer's past is revealed. During Hell's invasion of the Sentinels' world a rogue [[Seraph|servant]] to the Khan Maykr imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Slayer. It is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nWith the Icon of Sin on Urdak, Hayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Maykr\u2019s dimension. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and manages to teleport to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer over his actions, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer manages to kill the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin. After an intense battle, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design and combat mechanics.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn a demo build unveiled to the public in January 2020, further new mechanics were also revealed, including high-difficulty Slayer Challenges, additional upgrade resources including Sentinel Crystals, and the ability to take control of some enemy units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/watch-15-minutes-of-new-doom-eternal-gameplay/|title=Watch 15 minutes of new 'DOOM Eternal' gameplay|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=2019-10-08|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors.

What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement initially formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a new arsenal of weapons and a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to Hell  to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge; the Slayer retrieves his Super Shotgun and defeats the Priest's Doom Hunter guardians before killing him.\n\nIn response to Deag Ranak\u2019s death, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a secure location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. After destroying the nest, Vega suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to a compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, the Slayer's past is revealed. The Slayer, who is identified by the name \"[[Doomguy]]\", is revealed to be from Earth. He was found on Sentinel Prime badly wounded, and ranting about his desire to kill the demons who were then unknown to the Sentinels and the Khan Maykr. The Priests had Doomguy tested in a gladiatorial arena where he bested his opponents and thereafter was inducted into the Sentinel military. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena. Despite knowing it is against Sentinel law, Slayer kills Deag Grav after defeating his guardian, the Gladiator and returns to the fortress.\n\nDespite stopping the demons' invasion of Earth, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr, who resolves to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind. However, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. More of the Slayer's past is revealed. During Hell's invasion of the Sentinels' world a rogue [[Seraph|servant]] to the Khan Maykr imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Slayer. It is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nWith the Icon of Sin on Urdak, Hayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Maykr\u2019s dimension. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and manages to teleport to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer over his actions, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer manages to kill the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin. After an intense battle, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.
