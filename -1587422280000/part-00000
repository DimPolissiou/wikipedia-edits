{"title_page": "The Pioneer Style in Utah", "text_new": "'''The''' '''Pioneer Style in Utah''' was a popular style of architecture most utilized during the years 1847 to 1890. The pioneers of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]], also referred to as Mormons, trekked west into the Utah Territory to seek refuge from religious persecution in the mid-Western and Eastern United States. Because the Latter-day Saints were some of the earliest and significant settlers in the Utah area, the foundational architecture in Utah is largely influenced by these early settlers. Architecture in Utah is highly religious, consisting of temples and church meetinghouses, and European-influenced due to the origins of many of the settlers. Members of the Church valued the institution of education, an idea they carried with them from the Northern States, which resulted in many schools being established for their children. Entertainment was another highly appreciated and valued aspect among the early members of the Church which resulted in the establishment of many theatres and music halls.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Alexander|first=Thomas G.|url=https://lib.byu.edu|title=Utah, the Right Place|publisher=Gibbs Smith|year=1995|isbn=0879056908|location=Salt Lake City|pages=104-105}}</ref> \n\nThese are some examples of the influences behind many buildings and their purposes in the Utah's early years.

Many of these newcomers were European immigrants resulting in the Pioneer styles being based on early Greek, Roman, and English architecture.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://preservationutah.org/images/stories/education/archlessonplans/Architectural%20Styles%20in%20Utah%20-%20Background%20for%20Teachers.pdf|title=Architectural Styles in Utah|last=|first=|date=|website=Preservation utah|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref>  \n\n== Historical Context ==\n\n=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ===\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was founded on April 6th, 1830 by the Prophet [[Joseph Smith]] under the direction of God. The members grew rapidly as did the persecution of the newly restored Church. The members were persecuted in and driven out of New York, Ohio, Missouri, and eventually Illinois. After the Prophet Joseph Smith was murdered at the Carthage Jail in Illinois, the members were forced to migrate to the west. The [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon Pioneers]] consisted of 80,000 Latter-day Saints migrating west to the Salt Lake Valley from the mid-1840's to the 1860's. The Salt Lake Valley was Mexican territory upon their arrival, but it was quickly ceded to American in the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] in 1848.  \n\n=== Settling in Utah ===\nA priority of the Church of Jesus Christ at this time was for all of the members to live together in one community in order to strengthen the Church. Many of Church converts in other parts of the world, such as England and Scandinavia, were encouraged to immigrate to the U. S. and dwell among the members in Utah, which many did. Once the Pioneers settled in Utah, they at once began constructing the Salt Lake Temple and the Tabernacle at Temple Square. For the individual homes, the architectural style was fashioned after the Pioneer Style which was prominent during Colonial America. The styles include a symmetrical, rectangular shape with few curves and ornamentation. The modest aspects of the Pioneer Style were even more modest in Utah\u2019s humble living conditions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Influence of Non-Mormons ===\nThe majority of the population in Utah were Latter-day Saints, but overtime more and more people came to Utah who were not members of the Church of Jesus Christ. The members referred to these people as Gentiles. Because unity and community were dominating concepts and practices during the early days of the Church, association with the Gentiles was not encouraged. Nevertheless, the Gentiles became successful in the coal mining industries and investing in the [[ZCMI]]. So much so that they became incredibly wealthy and built extravagant homes. The members of the Church were discouraged from participating in the mining industry or spending their money on materialistic endeavors, so many of the mansions built in Utah are a result of the non-members. There was also an influx in immigration (mostly from Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and Japan) to Utah as a result of the newly finished [[Golden spike|railroads]] in the 1860's.<ref name=\":2\" /> Often time these immigrants joined the Latter-day Saint Church, but this was not the norm. Many immigrants were devoutly Catholic or Lutheran bringing with them architectural styles associated with Catholic or Lutheran churches. \n\n== Temples ==\n[[File:St. George Temple 1914.jpg|thumb|St. George Temple in Utah, 1914.]]\nTemples are a significant aspect of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints even today. Church members value temples mainly because of the sacred space it provides for necessary temple ordinances to be performed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2011/09/why-is-the-temple-important?lang=eng|title=Why is the temple important?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> While the Salt Lake City temple was being built, the Saints established and utilized an Endowment House where they could perform these sacred ordinances, such as sealings and endowments, that would traditionally be done in the temple.

This temple was designed by [[Truman O. Angell|Truman O. Agnell]] and was completed in 1877. The architecture of this temple was constructed in a manner that resembled the architecture of the [[Nauvoo Temple]], a temple that the members were forced to abandon three decades earlier. \n\n=== Salt Lake City Temple ===\n[[File:Temple Square, Salt Lake City, 1899 retouched.jpg|thumb|Temple Square, Salt Lake City, 1899]]\nThe [[Salt Lake Temple]] was the first temple that the saints started to build in Utah, though the St. George Temple was the first completed and operational temple in Utah. The construction of the Salt Lake temple took over 40 years to complete, as opposed to the six years it took to build the St. George Temple. The temple follows several types of architecture. One main style is the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, which can be seen in the pointed arches and elongated windows of the Temple. The Temple also has [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] elements. The foundation is made out of limestone and the exterior walls are made out of quartz which are sturdy and precious materials. One aspect that differentiates this temple from others is that there are special rooms for the First Presidency of the Church to meet, one specific room being the [[Holy of Holies (LDS Church)|Holy of Holies]]. To many, this temple is seen as an all-encompassing representation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Because of its elaborate and intricate design, it stands as a popular tourist attraction for many when they come to visit [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City, Utah.  \n[[File:Manti Temple 1914.jpg|thumb|Manti Temple in Utah, 1914.]]\n\n=== Manti Temple ===\nThe [[Manti Utah Temple|Manti Temple]] was the third temple to be dedicated in Utah. It was dedicated on May 17, 1888. Like the Salt Lake Temple, this Temple also contains some Gothic elements, but is a classic example of the Pioneer style. The temple is modeled after two earlier temples, the [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo temple]] and [[Kirtland Temple|Kirtland temple]], which the early saints built before they trekked across the plains to Utah. This temple was built on the Manti Stone Quarry, which is know known as Temple Hill. It exterior is built from a cream color limestone from the quarry. Several unique aspects of this temple is that, in the towers there are self-supported spiral staircases that span 5 levels. Also, this is one of few temples that does not have an [[Angel Moroni]] on the spiral.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/manti-utah-temple/|title=Manti Utah Temple {{!}} ChurchofJesusChristTemples.org|website=churchofjesuschristtemples.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> \n\n== Religious Architecture ==\nIn addition to temples, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints needed other, more common buildings devoted to daily or weekly religious matters. These church buildings consisted of what Latter-day Saint members refer to as meetinghouses, which were plain in design and material, where weekly church services were held with a small number of people. Members also established  stake centers where larger groups of members could congregate and worship, though less frequently. The design of these church buildings varied based on the religious purpose. The more religiously esteemed or valued a church building was, the more funding and attention to the architectural design it received.   \n\n=== 1847-1860 ===\nWhen the church was first organized, people normally met in  one room of a house or the upstairs of a building. However, once the church had gathered in Utah, one room buildings were built and used as meeting houses, but also served other, often secular purposes. As years went, on more established designs including columns and steeples began to be included in the development of meetinghouses. The use of columns and steeples was a style that was known as \"eclectic or of vernacular 'high style.'\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/EoM/id/3913|title=Meetinghouse|website=contentdm.lib.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> This style was a simple, yet effective architectural style in providing religious enlightenment with the steeple symbolizing the connection between heaven and earth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://werdsmith.com/p/0R2AbZFhY|title=History of the Church Steeple|last=Taylor|first=Justin|date=|website=werdsmith.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 1860-1890 ===\nAs the church grew and more financially acquit in Utah, more meetinghouses were built with features recognized by members today.

In many situations, plural wives would live together in one home rather than spread out individually. Consequently, homes would be built in a way that had designated quarters or divisions to give each wife a private section. Living situations among the wives were determined based on income, number of wives, and how well the wives got along.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bennion|first=Lowell C.|url=https://lib.byu.edu|title=Polygamy in Lorenzo Snow's Brigham City: An Architectural Tour|publisher=Western Regional Architecture Program, College of Architecture and Planning, University of Utah|year=2005|isbn=|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=}}</ref> \n\n== Theatres, Schools, and other Institutions ==\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints emphasized and valued entertainment in ways such as theatre and music. Eventually, the Salt Lake Theatre was established and stood as an excellent theatre to all who visited.

Architecturally, the Tabernacle served as a middle ground between the extravagance of the temples and the plainness of the meetinghouses. This building was built under the direction of President Brigham Young. The tabernacle has a unique style which consists of an expansive dome cover, allowing sound to reverberate well throughout the building.

Its economy was heavily [[Plantation economy|plantation-based]], centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants, penal labor, and African slaves. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line|settlement]] of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and by 1776 its delegates signed the [[Declaration of Independence (U.S.)|Declaration of Independence]]. Many of its citizens subsequently played [[Maryland in the American Revolution|key political and military roles in the war]]. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAlthough then a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]], Maryland [[Border states (American Civil War)|remained in the Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], its strategic location giving it [[Maryland in the American Civil War|a significant role in the conflict]]. After the war, Maryland took part in the [[Industrial Revolution]], driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe. Since the Second World War, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states. {{as of|2015}}, Maryland had the [[List of U.S. states by income|highest median household income]] of any state, owing in large part to its close proximity to [[Washington, D.C.]] and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, services, higher education, and biotechnology.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://proximityone.com/stmhi0910.htm\n|title=State Median Household Income Patterns: 1990\u20132010\n|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau\n|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref> The state's central role in U.S. history is reflected by its hosting of some of the [[List of U.S. National Historic Landmarks by state|highest numbers of historic landmarks]] per capita.\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{See also|List of islands of Maryland|List of rivers of Maryland}}\n[[File:MDGeoReg.PNG|thumb|left|upright=2.05|text-top|Physical regions of Maryland]]\n\nMaryland has an area of {{convert|12,406.68|sqmi|km2}} and is comparable in overall area with [[Belgium]] [{{convert|11787|mi2}}].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html\n|title=Belgium\n|accessdate=May 15, 2008\n|date=May 15, 2008\n|website=CIA World Factbook\n|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency\n|quote=Area\u2014comparative: about the size of Maryland\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710084134/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html\n|archivedate=July 10, 2016\n|df=mdy\n}}</ref> It is the 42nd largest and 9th smallest state and is closest in size to the state of [[Hawaii]] [{{convert|10930.98|mi2}}], the next smaller state.

It ranges from sandy [[dunes]] dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large [[Taxodium|bald cypress]] near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Region]], and [[pine]] groves in the [[List of mountains in Maryland|Maryland mountains]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Deep Creek Lake Maryland Panoramic View.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Western Maryland is known for its heavily forested mountains.

The mid-portion of this border is interrupted by [[District of Columbia]], which sits on land that was originally part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties and including the town of [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown, Maryland]]. This land was ceded to the United States Federal Government in 1790 to form the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. (The [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] gave land south of the Potomac, including the town of [[Alexandria, Virginia]], however Virginia retroceded its portion in 1846). The [[Chesapeake Bay]] nearly bisects the state and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the ''[[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]]''.\n[[File:Patapsco fg01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Typical freshwater river above the tidal zone.

So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the \"Bay State\", a nickname that has been used by [[Massachusetts]] for decades.\n\nThe highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of {{convert|3360|ft|m}}, is [[Backbone Mountain|Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain]], in the southwest corner of [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], near the border with West Virginia, and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River.

In 1902 the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.\n\nThe [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.\n[[File:Rubble_of_the_Great_Baltimore_Fire.jpg|thumb|Ruin left by the [[Great Baltimore Fire]]]]\nWith the nation's [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry into World War I]] in 1917, new military bases such as [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]], the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] were established. Existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.\n\nAfter Georgia congressman [[William D. Upshaw]] criticized Maryland openly in 1923 for not passing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, ''Baltimore Sun'' editor Hamilton Owens coined the \"Free State\" nickname for Maryland in that context, which was popularized by [[H.

The biggest operations were [[Bethlehem Steel]]'s Fairfield Yard, which built [[Liberty ship]]s; and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft manufacturer.\n\n====1950\u2013present====\n\nMaryland experienced population growth following World War II. Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington DC and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state. Agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities, some of them carefully planned such as [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], [[St. Charles, Maryland|St. Charles]], and [[Montgomery Village, Maryland|Montgomery Village]]. Concurrently the [[Interstate Highway System]] was built throughout the state, most notably [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], and the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]], altering travel patterns. In 1952 the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], which replaced a nearby [[ferry]] service.<ref name=\"baybridge.com-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|title=William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bay Bridge\u2014History|publisher=baybridge.com|accessdate=February 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701104741/http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|archive-date=July 1, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMaryland's regions experienced economic changes following WWII. Heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore. In Maryland's four westernmost counties, industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs declined. On the lower [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in the 1990s.\n\nIn an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s with [[Charles Center]] and the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]]. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility, and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{See also|List of counties in Maryland|List of incorporated places in Maryland|List of census-designated places in Maryland}}\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 319728\n|1800= 341548\n|1810= 380546\n|1820= 407350\n|1830= 447040\n|1840= 470019\n|1850= 583034\n|1860= 687049\n|1870= 780894\n|1880= 934943\n|1890= 1042390\n|1900= 1188044\n|1910= 1295346\n|1920= 1449661\n|1930= 1631526\n|1940= 1821244\n|1950= 2343001\n|1960= 3100689\n|1970= 3922399\n|1980= 4216975\n|1990= 4781468\n|2000= 5296486\n|2010= 5773552\n|estimate= 6045680\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=Resident Population Data\u20142010 Census|publisher=2010.census.gov|accessdate=December 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118011236/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|archivedate=November 18, 2011|df=mdy}}</ref><br>2018 estimate<ref name=\"PopEstUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/md,US/PST045218|title=QuickFacts Maryland; United States|format=|website=2018 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 7, 2019|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Map of maryland counties.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[List of counties in Maryland|Maryland's counties]]]]\n\nThe [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Maryland was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, a 4.71% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]] and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year.

Data is sourced from the [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/ 2014 ACS 5-year Estimate] report published by the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]].]]\n\nMaryland's economy benefits from the state's close proximity to the federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]] with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], [[United States Cyber Command]], and the [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service]]. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, [[White-collar worker|white collar]] technical and administrative workers comprise 25 percent of Maryland's [[labor force]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the [[Washington Metro Area]] where the federal government office employment is relatively high.\n\nManufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at [[Sparrows Point]], still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and [[merger]]s. During World War II the Glenn Martin Company (now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.\n\nMining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.\n\n===Baltimore port===\n\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the [[Port of Baltimore]] and its related [[railroad|rail]] and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center. New Orleans, LA.

The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] is a {{convert|14|mi|km}} [[canal]] on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |place=Philadelphia, PA |url=http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/ChesapeakeDelawareCanal.aspx |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\n\nMaryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial [[List of freshwater fishes of Maryland|fishing]], centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], [[oysters]], [[striped bass]], and [[menhaden]]. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a [[birdwatching|tourism sector of sportsmen]].\n\n[[File:CarrollCountyMD.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is an important part of the state's economy.]]\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]] zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[sweet corn]], [[tomato]]es, [[muskmelon]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peas]] (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a [[tobacco]] [[cash crop]] zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated [[chicken]]-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] is home to [[Perdue Farms]]. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.\n\n===Biotechnology===\n\nMaryland is a major center for [[life sciences]] research and development.

Its economy was heavily [[Plantation economy|plantation-based]], centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants, penal labor, and African slaves. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line|settlement]] of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and by 1776 its delegates signed the [[Declaration of Independence (U.S.)|Declaration of Independence]]. Many of its citizens subsequently played [[Maryland in the American Revolution|key political and military roles in the war]]. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAlthough then a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]], Maryland [[Border states (American Civil War)|remained in the Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], its strategic location giving it [[Maryland in the American Civil War|a significant role in the conflict]]. After the war, Maryland took part in the [[Industrial Revolution]], driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe. Since the Second World War, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states. {{as of|2015}}, Maryland had the [[List of U.S. states by income|highest median household income]] of any state, owing in large part to its close proximity to [[Washington, D.C.]] and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, services, higher education, and biotechnology.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://proximityone.com/stmhi0910.htm\n|title=State Median Household Income Patterns: 1990\u20132010\n|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau\n|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref> The state's central role in U.S. history is reflected by its hosting of some of the [[List of U.S. National Historic Landmarks by state|highest numbers of historic landmarks]] per capita.\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{See also|List of islands of Maryland|List of rivers of Maryland}}\n[[File:MDGeoReg.PNG|thumb|left|upright=2.05|text-top|Physical regions of Maryland]]\n\nMaryland has an area of {{convert|12,406.68|sqmi|km2}} and is comparable in overall area with [[Belgium]] [{{convert|11787|mi2}}].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html\n|title=Belgium\n|accessdate=May 15, 2008\n|date=May 15, 2008\n|website=CIA World Factbook\n|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency\n|quote=Area\u2014comparative: about the size of Maryland\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710084134/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html\n|archivedate=July 10, 2016\n|df=mdy\n}}</ref> It is the 42nd largest and 9th smallest state and is closest in size to the state of [[Hawaii]] [{{convert|10930.98|mi2}}], the next smaller state.

It ranges from sandy [[dunes]] dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large [[Taxodium|bald cypress]] near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Region]], and [[pine]] groves in the [[List of mountains in Maryland|Maryland mountains]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Deep Creek Lake Maryland Panoramic View.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Western Maryland is known for its heavily forested mountains.

The mid-portion of this border is interrupted by [[District of Columbia]], which sits on land that was originally part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties and including the town of [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown, Maryland]]. This land was ceded to the United States Federal Government in 1790 to form the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. (The [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] gave land south of the Potomac, including the town of [[Alexandria, Virginia]], however Virginia retroceded its portion in 1846). The [[Chesapeake Bay]] nearly bisects the state and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the ''[[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]]''.\n[[File:Patapsco fg01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Typical freshwater river above the tidal zone.

So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the \"Bay State\", a nickname that has been used by [[Massachusetts]] for decades.\n\nThe highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of {{convert|3360|ft|m}}, is [[Backbone Mountain|Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain]], in the southwest corner of [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], near the border with West Virginia, and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River.

Results from the annual Bowhunter Survey and the Hunter Mail survey have identified bobcat sightings in 14 of Maryland's 23 counties. Currently, bobcats have dual legal classification in Maryland.

In 1902 the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.\n\nThe [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.\n[[File:Rubble_of_the_Great_Baltimore_Fire.jpg|thumb|Ruin left by the [[Great Baltimore Fire]]]]\nWith the nation's [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry into World War I]] in 1917, new military bases such as [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]], the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] were established. Existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.\n\nAfter Georgia congressman [[William D. Upshaw]] criticized Maryland openly in 1923 for not passing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, ''Baltimore Sun'' editor Hamilton Owens coined the \"Free State\" nickname for Maryland in that context, which was popularized by [[H.

The biggest operations were [[Bethlehem Steel]]'s Fairfield Yard, which built [[Liberty ship]]s; and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft manufacturer.\n\n====1950\u2013present====\n\nMaryland experienced population growth following World War II. Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington DC and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state. Agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities, some of them carefully planned such as [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], [[St. Charles, Maryland|St. Charles]], and [[Montgomery Village, Maryland|Montgomery Village]]. Concurrently the [[Interstate Highway System]] was built throughout the state, most notably [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], and the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]], altering travel patterns. In 1952 the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], which replaced a nearby [[ferry]] service.<ref name=\"baybridge.com-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|title=William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bay Bridge\u2014History|publisher=baybridge.com|accessdate=February 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701104741/http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|archive-date=July 1, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMaryland's regions experienced economic changes following WWII. Heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore. In Maryland's four westernmost counties, industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs declined. On the lower [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in the 1990s.\n\nIn an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s with [[Charles Center]] and the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]]. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility, and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{See also|List of counties in Maryland|List of incorporated places in Maryland|List of census-designated places in Maryland}}\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 319728\n|1800= 341548\n|1810= 380546\n|1820= 407350\n|1830= 447040\n|1840= 470019\n|1850= 583034\n|1860= 687049\n|1870= 780894\n|1880= 934943\n|1890= 1042390\n|1900= 1188044\n|1910= 1295346\n|1920= 1449661\n|1930= 1631526\n|1940= 1821244\n|1950= 2343001\n|1960= 3100689\n|1970= 3922399\n|1980= 4216975\n|1990= 4781468\n|2000= 5296486\n|2010= 5773552\n|estimate= 6045680\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=Resident Population Data\u20142010 Census|publisher=2010.census.gov|accessdate=December 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118011236/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|archivedate=November 18, 2011|df=mdy}}</ref><br>2018 estimate<ref name=\"PopEstUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/md,US/PST045218|title=QuickFacts Maryland; United States|format=|website=2018 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 7, 2019|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Map of maryland counties.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[List of counties in Maryland|Maryland's counties]]]]\n\nThe [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Maryland was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, a 4.71% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]] and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year.

Data is sourced from the [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/ 2014 ACS 5-year Estimate] report published by the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]].]]\n\nMaryland's economy benefits from the state's close proximity to the federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]] with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], [[United States Cyber Command]], and the [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service]]. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, [[White-collar worker|white collar]] technical and administrative workers comprise 25 percent of Maryland's [[labor force]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the [[Washington Metro Area]] where the federal government office employment is relatively high.\n\nManufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at [[Sparrows Point]], still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and [[merger]]s. During World War II the Glenn Martin Company (now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.\n\nMining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.\n\n===Baltimore port===\n\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the [[Port of Baltimore]] and its related [[railroad|rail]] and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center. New Orleans, LA.

The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] is a {{convert|14|mi|km}} [[canal]] on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |place=Philadelphia, PA |url=http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/ChesapeakeDelawareCanal.aspx |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\n\nMaryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial [[List of freshwater fishes of Maryland|fishing]], centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], [[oysters]], [[striped bass]], and [[menhaden]]. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a [[birdwatching|tourism sector of sportsmen]].\n\n[[File:CarrollCountyMD.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is an important part of the state's economy.]]\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]] zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[sweet corn]], [[tomato]]es, [[muskmelon]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peas]] (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a [[tobacco]] [[cash crop]] zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated [[chicken]]-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] is home to [[Perdue Farms]]. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.\n\n===Biotechnology===\n\nMaryland is a major center for [[life sciences]] research and development.

He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] (present day Constanta), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Almost all churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].\n\nFrom about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.\n\nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a \"[[Scythian]]\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).<ref>''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|chapter-url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.</ref> He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].<ref name=Amory>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref>{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}} Even for the \"Scythian monk\" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a \"[[Gallia|Gaul]]\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}}\n\nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"[[Bessi]]an\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Thracians|Thracian]] stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130\u2013131}}\n\n==Works and translations==\nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.\n\nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:\n\n:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:\n::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesi\u00e6 Univers\u00e6''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four \u0153cumenical councils from Nic\u00e6a (325) to Chalcedon (451).\n::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called \"Canons of the Apostles\" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).\n::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of [[Pope Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.\n\n:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384\u2013498).\n\n==Anno Domini==\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.\n\nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek [[Septuagint]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000.</ref>\n\n==Easter tables==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 525, Dionysius prepared a table of 95 future dates of [[Easter]] (AD 532-626) and a set of rules (\"argumenta\") explaining their calculation ([[computus]]).<ref>Declercq (2000) 99</ref> This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian table gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 1999, 793\u2013794.</ref> Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations.<ref>Jones (1943) 70 </ref> Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before [[Bede]]. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  \n\nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that it did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&ndash;19).}}\n\nUltimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.</ref> must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.</ref> where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,<ref>L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.</ref> [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]\u2019s lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.\n\nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.<ref>L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49\u201351.</ref>\n   \nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table thanks its strong structure to his distant predecessor [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], who invented the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, which is an application of the [[Metonic cycle]] in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Declercq (2000) 65-66</ref> Its lunar cycle is the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle proposed by [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] and adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in the first half of the fifth century.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> The Metonic structure of this so called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of [[Epact|epacts]].<ref>Zuidhoek (2017) 87</ref>\n\nThe [[Epact|epact]], since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nvlla'',<ref>Declercq (2000) 102</ref> also meaning ''nothing''. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].\n\nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years,<ref>Declercq (2000) 140</ref> otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact{{cn|date=January 2019}}.\n\nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of [[Bede]]'s ''The Reckoning of Time'' was published (by AD 771),<ref>Declercq (2000) 163</ref> the Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.\n\nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&nbsp;1 and 1&nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,<ref>Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.</ref> deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].<ref>Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.</ref> Having read Suslyga's work,<ref>Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W. Burke-Gaffney.</ref> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] noted that Christ was born during the reign of King [[Herod the Great]] ([[Matthew 2:1|2:1]]\u2013[[Matthew 2:18|18]]), whose death he placed in 4&nbsp;BC. Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]</ref> John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.<ref name=\"j\">John P.

Both 37&nbsp;BC minus 34 and 40&nbsp;BC minus 37 yield 4 or 3&nbsp;BC. See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.</ref>\n\nAlthough Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:\n\n<blockquote>It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.</blockquote>\n\nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:\n\n<blockquote>All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.</blockquote>                  \n\nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]].<ref name=Neugebauer>{{citation |last=Neugebauer |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Neugebauer |title=Ethiopic Astronomy and Computus |year=2016 |origyear=1979 |edition=2nd |publisher=Red Sea Press |pages=93, 95\u2013100 |isbn=978-1-56902-440-9}}, The pages of this 2nd edition have numbers that are six less than the same pages in the 1st (Austrian) edition.</ref> Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ab urbe condita]]\n* [[Lunisolar calendar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, \"Calendars and chronology\", ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 1999), 659\u2013937.\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 2003, a corrected reprinting of the 1999 original edition).\n* Georges Declercq (2000) Anno Domini (The Origins of the Christian Era): Turnhout ({{ISBN|9782503510507}})\n* Declercq, G.

He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] (present day Constanta), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Almost all churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].\n\nFrom about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.\n\nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a \"[[Scythian]]\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).<ref>''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|chapter-url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.</ref> He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].<ref name=Amory>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref>{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}} Even for the \"Scythian monk\" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a \"[[Gallia|Gaul]]\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}}\n\nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"[[Bessi]]an\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Thracians|Thracian]] stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130\u2013131}}\n\n==Works and translations==\nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.\n\nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:\n\n:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:\n::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesi\u00e6 Univers\u00e6''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four \u0153cumenical councils from Nic\u00e6a (325) to Chalcedon (451).\n::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called \"Canons of the Apostles\" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).\n::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of [[Pope Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.\n\n:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384\u2013498).\n\n==Anno Domini==\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.\n\nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek [[Septuagint]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000.</ref>\n\n==Easter tables==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 525, Dionysius prepared a table of 95 future dates of [[Easter]] (AD 532-626) and a set of rules (\"argumenta\") explaining their calculation ([[computus]]).<ref>Declercq (2000) 99</ref> This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian table gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 1999, 793\u2013794.</ref> Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before [[Bede]]. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  \n\nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that it did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&ndash;19).}}\n\nUltimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.</ref> must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.</ref> where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,<ref>L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.</ref> [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]\u2019s lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.\n\nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.<ref>L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49\u201351.</ref>\n   \nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table thanks its strong structure to his distant predecessor [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], who invented the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, which is an application of the [[Metonic cycle]] in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Declercq (2000) 65-66</ref> Its lunar cycle is the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle proposed by [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] and adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in the first half of the fifth century.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> The Metonic structure of this so called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of [[Epact|epacts]].<ref>Zuidhoek (2017) 87</ref>\n\nThe [[Epact|epact]], since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nvlla'',<ref>Declercq (2000) 102</ref> also meaning ''nothing''. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].\n\nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years,<ref>Declercq (2000) 140</ref> otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact{{cn|date=January 2019}}.\n\nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of [[Bede]]'s ''The Reckoning of Time'' was published (by AD 771),<ref>Declercq (2000) 163</ref> the Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.\n\nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&nbsp;1 and 1&nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,<ref>Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.</ref> deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].<ref>Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.</ref> Having read Suslyga's work,<ref>Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W.

Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]</ref> John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.<ref name=\"j\">John P.

See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.</ref>\n\nAlthough Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:\n\n<blockquote>It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.</blockquote>\n\nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:\n\n<blockquote>All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.</blockquote>                  \n\nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]].<ref name=Neugebauer>{{citation |last=Neugebauer |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Neugebauer |title=Ethiopic Astronomy and Computus |year=2016 |origyear=1979 |edition=2nd |publisher=Red Sea Press |pages=93, 95\u2013100 |isbn=978-1-56902-440-9}}, The pages of this 2nd edition have numbers that are six less than the same pages in the 1st (Austrian) edition.</ref> Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ab urbe condita]]\n* [[Lunisolar calendar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, \"Calendars and chronology\", ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 1999), 659\u2013937.\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 2003, a corrected reprinting of the 1999 original edition).\n* Georges Declercq (2000) Anno Domini (The Origins of the Christian Era): Turnhout ({{ISBN|9782503510507}})\n* Declercq, G.

Milt Joyce, owner of the Oriental Saloon and chairman of [[Cochise County, Arizona]] supervisors was also seen as a header of the Ten Percent Ring. The Tombstone Epitaph was started by [[John Clum]] in 1880. <ref>The Tombstone Epitaph, December 25, 1881.</ref> The newspaper outlined the corruption charges of Johnny Behan the Cochise County [[sheriff]]. <ref>James Covington Hancock Papers, Arizona Historical Society, Tucson.</ref> <ref>Wyatt Earp: A Vigilante Life, Andrew C. Isenberg page 241</ref> When Johnny Behan was the Cochise County sheriff one of his duties was collecting prostitution, gambling, liquor, and theater taxes. As part of his pay, he received 10% of all proceeds collected. There was much talk in the town about the [[Graft (politics)|graft]] [[political corruption]] of the sheriff. For this many saw Behan as the head of the Ten Percent Ring and a friend of the outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys]]. Others accused of members of the ring was Artemus Fay, owner of the Tombstone's first newspaper, the ''Tombstone Nugget'' and Harry Wood a writer for the ''Nugget'' and an under-sheriff of Behan. Behan so focuseded on taxes, that he was very soft on crime. Soon after Behan became sheriff, [[Virgil Earp]] was appointed Tombstone city marshal and had is brothers [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Morgan Earp]] become special deputy policemen. Behan and the Earps were at conflict as Behan supported the outlaw [[Ike Clanton|Clanton]] and [[Frank McLaury|McLaury]] families.<ref>{{cite book|last=Urban|first=William|title=Wyatt Earp: The O.K.

The Atlantic World was created by the discovery of a new land by Europeans, and Atlantic History is the study of that world.<ref>Bailyn, Bernard. 2005. Atlantic History : Concept and Contours. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2005 </ref>  It is premised on the idea that, following the rise of sustained [[Europe]]an contact with the [[New World]] in the 16th century, the continents that bordered the [[Atlantic Ocean]]\u2014the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], and [[Africa]]\u2014constituted a [[regional system]] or common sphere of economic and cultural exchange that can be studied as a totality.<ref>Karen Ordahl Kupperman, ''The Atlantic in World History'' (2012)</ref> \n\nIts theme is the complex interaction between Europe (especially [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[France]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]]) and the [[Colonial America|New World colonies]]. It encompasses a wide range of demographic, social, economic, political, legal, military, intellectual and religious topics treated in comparative fashion by looking at both sides of the Atlantic. Religious revivals characterized Britain and Germany, as well as the [[First Great Awakening]] in the American colonies. Migration and race/slavery have been important topics.<ref name=\"O'Reilly, 2004\">O'Reilly, (2004)</ref>\n\nResearchers of Atlantic history typically focus on the interconnections and exchanges between these regions and the civilizations they harbored. In particular, they argue that the boundaries between [[nation states]] which traditionally determined the limits of older historiography should not be applied to such transnational phenomena as [[slavery]], [[colonialism]], [[missionary]] activity and [[economic expansion]]. [[Environmental history]] and the study of [[historical demography]] also play an important role, as many key questions in the field revolve around the ecological and epidemiological impact of the [[Columbian exchange]].\n\n[[Robert Roswell Palmer|Robert R. Palmer]], an American historian of the French Revolution, pioneered the concept in the 1950s with a wide-ranging comparative history of how numerous nations experienced what he called ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760\u20131800'' (1959 and 1964).<ref>Edoardo Tortarolo, \"Eighteenth-century Atlantic history old and new,\" ''History of European Ideas'' (2008) 34#4, pp. 369\u2013374.</ref> Since the 1980s Atlantic history has emerged as an increasingly popular alternative to the older discipline of imperial history, although it could be argued that the field is simply a refinement and reorientation of traditional [[historiography]] dealing with the interaction between early modern Europeans and native peoples in the Atlantic sphere.  The organization of Atlantic History as a recognized area of historiography began in the 1980s under the impetus of American historians [[Bernard Bailyn]] of Harvard University and [[Jack P. Greene]] of Johns Hopkins University, among others. The post-World War II integration of the European Union and the continuing importance of [[NATO]] played an indirect role in stimulating interest throughout the 1990s.<ref name=\"O'Reilly, 2004\" />\n\n==Development of the field==\nBernard Bailyn's Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World promoted social and demographic studies, and especially regarding demographic flows of population into colonial America. As a leading advocate of the history of the Atlantic world, Bailyn has organized an annual international seminar at Harvard designed to promote scholarship in this field.<ref>[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~atlantic/index.html  See] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024191317/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~atlantic/index.html |date=October 24, 2008 }}</ref>  Bailyn's ''Atlantic History: Concepts and Contours'' (2005) explores the borders and contents of the emerging field, which emphasizes cosmopolitan and multicultural elements that have tended to be neglected or considered in isolation by traditional historiography dealing with the Americas. Bailyn's reflections stem in part from his seminar at Harvard since the mid-1980s.\n\nOther important scholars are Jack Greene directed a program at Johns Hopkins in Atlantic History from 1972 to 1992 that has now expanded to global concerns. [[Karen Ordahl Kupperman]] established the Atlantic Workshop at New York University in 1997.\n\nOther scholars in the field include [[Ida Altman]], Kenneth J. Andrien, [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], Trevor Burnard, [[Jorge Canizares-Esguerra]], [[Nicholas Canny]], [[Philip D. Curtin]], Laurent Dubois, [[John Huxtable Elliott|J.H. Elliott]], David Eltis, Alison Games, Eliga H. Gould, [[Anthony Grafton]], [[Joseph C. Miller]], [[Philip D. Morgan]], [[Anthony Pagden]], Jennifer L. Anderson, [[John Thornton (historian)|John Thornton]], [[James D. Tracy]], [[Carla G. Pestana]], [[Isaac Land]], Richard S. Dunn, and Ned C. Landsman.\n\n==Perspectives==\nAlison Games (2006) explores the convergence of the multiple strands of scholarly interest that have generated the new field of Atlantic history, which takes as its geographic unit of analysis the Atlantic Ocean and the four continents that surround it. She argues Atlantic history is best approached as a slice of world history. The Atlantic, moreover, is a region that has logic as a unit of historical analysis only within a limited chronology. An Atlantic perspective can help historians understand changes within the region that a more limited geographic framework might obscure. Attempts to write a Braudelian<ref>A reference to  the great classic, ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'' (2 vol 1949) by Fernand Braudel (1902\u20131985).</ref> Atlantic history, one that includes and connects the entire region, remain elusive, driven in part by methodological impediments, by the real disjunction that characterized the Atlantic's historical and geographic components, by the disciplinary divisions that discourage historians from speaking to and writing for each other, and by the challenge of finding a vantage point that is not rooted in any single place.<ref name=\"Games 2006\">Games (2006)</ref>\n\n==Colonial studies==\nOne impetus for Atlantic studies began in the 1960s with the historians of slavery who started tracking the flows of slaves from Africa to the New World.<ref>Philip Curtin 91998)</ref> A second source came from historians of colonial America. Many were trained in early modern European history and were familiar with the historiography regarding England and the British Empire., which had been introduced a century before by [[George Louis Beer]] and [[Charles McLean Andrews]]. Colonialists have long been open to interdisciplinary perspectives, such as comparative approaches.  In addition there was a frustration involved in writing about very few people in a small remote colony. Atlantic history opens the horizon to large forces at work over great distances.<ref name=\"Games 2006\" />\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSome critics have complained that Atlantic history is little more than imperial history under another name.<ref>{{cite book|author=Philip D. Morgan, ed.|title=Atlantic History: A Critical Appraisal|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801890352|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801890352/page/35 35]|isbn=9780195320336}}</ref> It has been argued that it is too expansive in claiming to subsume both of the American continents, Africa, and Europe, without seriously engaging with them.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nancy L.

Steele (2009) argues that Atlantic history will tend to draw students beyond their national myths, while offering historical support for such 21st century policies as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the [[Organization of American States]], [[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), the New Europe, Christendom, and even the [[United Nations]].  He concludes, \"The early modern Atlantic can even be read as a natural antechamber for American\u2010led globalization of capitalism and serve as an historical challenge to the coalescing New Europe. No wonder that the academic reception of the new Atlantic history has been enthusiastic in the United States, and less so in Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, where histories of national Atlantic empires continue to thrive.\"<ref>Ian K.

The Atlantic World was created by the discovery of a new land by Europeans, and Atlantic History is the study of that world.<ref>Bailyn, Bernard. 2005. Atlantic History : Concept and Contours. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2005 </ref>  It is premised on the idea that, following the rise of sustained [[Europe]]an contact with the [[New World]] in the 16th century, the continents that bordered the [[Atlantic Ocean]]\u2014the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], and [[Africa]]\u2014constituted a [[regional system]] or common sphere of economic and cultural exchange that can be studied as a totality.<ref>Karen Ordahl Kupperman, ''The Atlantic in World History'' (2012)</ref> \n\nIts theme is the complex interaction between Europe (especially [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[France]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]]) and the [[Colonial America|New World colonies]]. It encompasses a wide range of demographic, social, economic, political, legal, military, intellectual and religious topics treated in comparative fashion by looking at both sides of the Atlantic. Religious revivals characterized Britain and Germany, as well as the [[First Great Awakening]] in the American colonies. Migration and race/slavery have been important topics.<ref name=\"O'Reilly, 2004\">O'Reilly, (2004)</ref>\n\nResearchers of Atlantic history typically focus on the interconnections and exchanges between these regions and the civilizations they harbored. In particular, they argue that the boundaries between [[nation states]] which traditionally determined the limits of older historiography should not be applied to such transnational phenomena as [[slavery]], [[colonialism]], [[missionary]] activity and [[economic expansion]]. [[Environmental history]] and the study of [[historical demography]] also play an important role, as many key questions in the field revolve around the ecological and epidemiological impact of the [[Columbian exchange]].\n\n[[Robert Roswell Palmer|Robert R. Palmer]], an American historian of the French Revolution, pioneered the concept in the 1950s with a wide-ranging comparative history of how numerous nations experienced what he called ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760\u20131800'' (1959 and 1964).<ref>Edoardo Tortarolo, \"Eighteenth-century Atlantic history old and new,\" ''History of European Ideas'' (2008) 34#4, pp. 369\u2013374.</ref> Since the 1980s Atlantic history has emerged as an increasingly popular alternative to the older discipline of imperial history, although it could be argued that the field is simply a refinement and reorientation of traditional [[historiography]] dealing with the interaction between early modern Europeans and native peoples in the Atlantic sphere.  The organization of Atlantic History as a recognized area of historiography began in the 1980s under the impetus of American historians [[Bernard Bailyn]] of Harvard University and [[Jack P. Greene]] of Johns Hopkins University, among others. The post-World War II integration of the European Union and the continuing importance of [[NATO]] played an indirect role in stimulating interest throughout the 1990s.<ref name=\"O'Reilly, 2004\" />\n\n==Development of the field==\nBernard Bailyn's Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World promoted social and demographic studies, and especially regarding demographic flows of population into colonial America. As a leading advocate of the history of the Atlantic world, Bailyn has organized an annual international seminar at Harvard designed to promote scholarship in this field.<ref>[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~atlantic/index.html  See] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024191317/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~atlantic/index.html |date=October 24, 2008 }}</ref>  Bailyn's ''Atlantic History: Concepts and Contours'' (2005) explores the borders and contents of the emerging field, which emphasizes cosmopolitan and multicultural elements that have tended to be neglected or considered in isolation by traditional historiography dealing with the Americas. Bailyn's reflections stem in part from his seminar at Harvard since the mid-1980s.\n\nOther important scholars are Jack Greene directed a program at Johns Hopkins in Atlantic History from 1972 to 1992 that has now expanded to global concerns. [[Karen Ordahl Kupperman]] established the Atlantic Workshop at New York University in 1997.\n\nOther scholars in the field include [[Ida Altman]], Kenneth J. Andrien, [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], Trevor Burnard, [[Jorge Canizares-Esguerra]], [[Nicholas Canny]], [[Philip D. Curtin]], Laurent Dubois, [[John Huxtable Elliott|J.H. Elliott]], David Eltis, Alison Games, Eliga H. Gould, [[Anthony Grafton]], [[Joseph C. Miller]], [[Philip D. Morgan]], [[Anthony Pagden]], Jennifer L. Anderson, [[John Thornton (historian)|John Thornton]], [[James D. Tracy]], [[Carla G. Pestana]], [[Isaac Land]], Richard S. Dunn, and Ned C. Landsman.\n\n==Perspectives==\nAlison Games (2006) explores the convergence of the multiple strands of scholarly interest that have generated the new field of Atlantic history, which takes as its geographic unit of analysis the Atlantic Ocean and the four continents that surround it. She argues Atlantic history is best approached as a slice of world history. The Atlantic, moreover, is a region that has logic as a unit of historical analysis only within a limited chronology. An Atlantic perspective can help historians understand changes within the region that a more limited geographic framework might obscure. Attempts to write a Braudelian<ref>A reference to  the great classic, ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'' (2 vol 1949) by Fernand Braudel (1902\u20131985).</ref> Atlantic history, one that includes and connects the entire region, remain elusive, driven in part by methodological impediments, by the real disjunction that characterized the Atlantic's historical and geographic components, by the disciplinary divisions that discourage historians from speaking to and writing for each other, and by the challenge of finding a vantage point that is not rooted in any single place.<ref name=\"Games 2006\">Games (2006)</ref>\n\n==Colonial studies==\nOne impetus for Atlantic studies began in the 1960s with the historians of slavery who started tracking the flows of slaves from Africa to the New World.<ref>Philip Curtin 91998)</ref> A second source came from historians of colonial America. Many were trained in early modern European history and were familiar with the historiography regarding England and the British Empire., which had been introduced a century before by [[George Louis Beer]] and [[Charles McLean Andrews]]. Colonialists have long been open to interdisciplinary perspectives, such as comparative approaches.  In addition there was a frustration involved in writing about very few people in a small remote colony. Atlantic history opens the horizon to large forces at work over great distances.<ref name=\"Games 2006\" />\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSome critics have complained that Atlantic history is little more than imperial history under another name.<ref>{{cite book|author=Philip D.

It is one of two active [[Fleet Air Arm]] bases (the other being [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose)]] and is currently home to the Royal Navy [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat HMA2]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters as well as the Royal Navy's [[Commando Helicopter Force]] [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin]] HCi3/3A/4 and [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters.\n\nThe site consists of {{convert|1000|acre|sqmi km2|1|abbr=on}} of airfield sites plus ranges and minor estates. Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton is a large multi-role air station with an annual budget of some \u00a361 million. The airfield is also home to the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] and the station hosts an annual Air Day in July.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1938, the potential of the land at Yeovilton for use as an airfield was spotted by [[Westland Aircraft]]'s chief test pilot [[Harald Penrose]] and an offer was made to buy the land. The owners, however{{spaced ndash}}the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] of the [[Church of England]]{{spaced ndash}}refused to sell it. In 1939, the Admiralty Air Division commandeered {{convert|417|acre|ha}} of the land and work began on the construction of the site. The runways being completed in 1941 despite problems with poor drainage. A main runway of {{convert|3645|ft|abbr=on|0}} and three subsidiary runways each of {{convert|3000|ft|abbr=on|0}} had been constructed.<ref name=\"berryman\">{{cite book |title=Somerset airfields in the Second World War |last=Berryman |first=David |year=2006 |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury |isbn=1-85306-864-0 |pages=194\u2013219 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ground Crew Working on Fleet Air Arm Aircraft at Rnas Yeovilton, September 1943 TR1275.jpg|thumb|A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|alt=A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|left]]\n[[750 Naval Air Squadron]] was formed at [[RNAS Ford]] on 24 May 1939 from the Royal Navy Observer School, but after Ford was bombed early in the war, it moved to RNAS Yeovilton.<ref name=NN>{{cite web|url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2002/0202/0002022601.asp|title=50 Years Not Out for 750 Squadron|publisher=[[Navy News]]|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> They were joined by [[751 Naval Air Squadron|751]] and [[752 Naval Air Squadron|752]] Squadrons with the Naval Air Fighter School soon following. In addition Westland Aircraft developed a repair facility at the site.  From July 1940, the site was subjected to [[Luftwaffe]] bombing on several occasions. [[794 Naval Air Squadron]] was the first to be formed at the base and served to train other squadrons to practise aerial gunnery, and part of one of the runways was marked up as a flight deck to practise landing on an aircraft carrier. [[827 Naval Air Squadron]] was also stationed at Yeovilton operating [[Fairey Albacore]]s and later [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]]s starting in May 1943, becoming the first squadron to receive Barracudas in any substantial number.<ref name=\"berryman\"/> Several units which were preparing for embarkation were also stationed at the site during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Because of pressure on space at the airfield, satellite sites were set up at [[RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II)|Charlton Horethorne]] and [[Henstridge Airfield|Henstridge]] in 1942. A centre for Air Direction Radar was also established at Speckington Manor on the edge of the airfield.<ref name=\"berryman\"/>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Yeovilton became one of the main demobilization centres for the Royal Navy, with many of the men helping to refurbish the runways while they stayed at the base. In 1952, Yeovilton became the shore base for the fleets all-weather fighters. The runways were further extended by [[Taylor Woodrow]] in 1952 and 1957 to cope with jet aircraft. In May 1953, it became the headquarters of Flag Officer Flying Training.<ref name=\"helis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/database/?menu=2&tpais=UK&tbase=27&titulo=UK%20RNAS%20Yeovilton |title=RNAS Yeovilton |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=Helis.com }}</ref>\n\n[[File:899 Shar Yeovilton.jpg|thumb|[[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|BAe Sea Harrier FRS1]] of 899 Naval Air Squadron at Yeovilton Naval Air Station in 1982.]]\nDuring the 1960s, further development work was undertaken, with the School of Fighter Direction returning to the site and the [[De Havilland Venom|Sea Venoms]] being replaced by the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]s then in turn by the [[McDonnell-Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantom FG1]] as a carrier-borne fighter.

It is one of two active [[Fleet Air Arm]] bases (the other being [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose)]] and is currently home to the Royal Navy [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat HMA2]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters as well as the Royal Navy's [[Commando Helicopter Force]] [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin]] HCi3/3A/4 and [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters.\n\nThe site consists of {{convert|1000|acre|sqmi km2|1|abbr=on}} of airfield sites plus ranges and minor estates. Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton is a large multi-role air station with an annual budget of some \u00a361 million. The airfield is also home to the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] and the station hosts an annual Air Day in July.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1938, the potential of the land at Yeovilton for use as an airfield was spotted by [[Westland Aircraft]]'s chief test pilot [[Harald Penrose]] and an offer was made to buy the land. The owners, however{{spaced ndash}}the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] of the [[Church of England]]{{spaced ndash}}refused to sell it. In 1939, the Admiralty Air Division commandeered {{convert|417|acre|ha}} of the land and work began on the construction of the site. The runways being completed in 1941 despite problems with poor drainage. A main runway of {{convert|3645|ft|abbr=on|0}} and three subsidiary runways each of {{convert|3000|ft|abbr=on|0}} had been constructed.<ref name=\"berryman\">{{cite book |title=Somerset airfields in the Second World War |last=Berryman |first=David |year=2006 |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury |isbn=1-85306-864-0 |pages=194\u2013219 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ground Crew Working on Fleet Air Arm Aircraft at Rnas Yeovilton, September 1943 TR1275.jpg|thumb|A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|alt=A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|left]]\n[[750 Naval Air Squadron]] was formed at [[RNAS Ford]] on 24 May 1939 from the Royal Navy Observer School, but after Ford was bombed early in the war, it moved to RNAS Yeovilton.<ref name=NN>{{cite web|url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2002/0202/0002022601.asp|title=50 Years Not Out for 750 Squadron|publisher=[[Navy News]]|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> They were joined by [[751 Naval Air Squadron|751]] and [[752 Naval Air Squadron|752]] Squadrons with the Naval Air Fighter School soon following. In addition Westland Aircraft developed a repair facility at the site.  From July 1940, the site was subjected to [[Luftwaffe]] bombing on several occasions. [[794 Naval Air Squadron]] was the first to be formed at the base and served to train other squadrons to practise aerial gunnery, and part of one of the runways was marked up as a flight deck to practise landing on an aircraft carrier. [[827 Naval Air Squadron]] was also stationed at Yeovilton operating [[Fairey Albacore]]s and later [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]]s starting in May 1943, becoming the first squadron to receive Barracudas in any substantial number.<ref name=\"berryman\"/> Several units which were preparing for embarkation were also stationed at the site during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Because of pressure on space at the airfield, satellite sites were set up at [[RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II)|Charlton Horethorne]] and [[Henstridge Airfield|Henstridge]] in 1942. A centre for Air Direction Radar was also established at Speckington Manor on the edge of the airfield.<ref name=\"berryman\"/>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Yeovilton became one of the main demobilization centres for the Royal Navy, with many of the men helping to refurbish the runways while they stayed at the base. In 1952, Yeovilton became the shore base for the fleets all-weather fighters. The runways were further extended by [[Taylor Woodrow]] in 1952 and 1957 to cope with jet aircraft. In May 1953, it became the headquarters of Flag Officer Flying Training.<ref name=\"helis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/database/?menu=2&tpais=UK&tbase=27&titulo=UK%20RNAS%20Yeovilton |title=RNAS Yeovilton |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=Helis.com }}</ref>\n\n[[File:899 Shar Yeovilton.jpg|thumb|[[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|BAe Sea Harrier FRS1]] of 899 Naval Air Squadron at Yeovilton Naval Air Station in 1982.]]\nDuring the 1960s, further development work was undertaken, with the School of Fighter Direction returning to the site and the [[De Havilland Venom|Sea Venoms]] being replaced by the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]s then in turn by the [[McDonnell-Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantom FG1]] as a carrier-borne fighter.

It is also the location for the RN Fighter Controller School, training surface based aircraft controllers.\n\nThe Commando Helicopter Force has now returned to prioritising its main amphibious role in support of [[Royal Navy]]/[[Royal Marines]] operations after focusing on more than a decade of service in land-locked [[Operation Herrick|Afghanistan]] and prior to that in [[Operation Telic|Iraq]].\n\nDuring periods of busy flying training, pressure on the RNAS Yeovilton circuit is relieved by the use of nearby [[RNAS Merryfield]].\n\n[[727 Naval Air Squadron]] operate the [[Grob G 115|Grob Tutor T1]] in the grading and elementary flying training role.\n\n==Air Day==\nThe station holds an annual air show when the airfield is open to the public. It includes both a flying and static aircraft display. The air day traditionally ends with the [[Commando Helicopter Force]] role demonstration, which sees a mixture of aircraft and land forces demonstrate a land assault delivered from the air.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2018/july/09/180709-yeovilton-air-day|title=A spectacular Air Show at RNAS Yeovilton {{!}} Royal Navy|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Units==\nFlying and notable non-flying units based at RNAS Yeovilton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/where-we-are/air-stations/rnas-yeovilton|title=RNAS Yeovilton|website=Royal Navy|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/aviation/27829.aspx|title=1 Regiment Army Air Corps|website=The British Army|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/reme/41434.aspx|title=7 Aviation Support Battalion|website=The British Army|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Royal Navy ===\n'''[[Fleet Air Arm]]''' \n* Wildcat Maritime Force\n** [[815 Naval Air Squadron]] \u2013 [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat HMA2]]\n** [[825 Naval Air Squadron]] \u2013 Wildcat HMA2\n* [[727 Naval Air Squadron]] \u2013 [[Grob G 115|Tutor T1]] \n* Royal Naval Reserve Air Branch\n* Royal Navy School of Fighter Control\n*Royal Navy School of Aircraft Control\n*[[Underwater Escape Training Unit]]\n*[[Black Cats (Royal Navy)|Royal Navy Black Cats]] Display Team\n\n'''[[Joint Helicopter Command]]''' / '''Fleet Air Arm'''\n* [[Commando Helicopter Force]] (Fleet Air Arm / [[Royal Marines]])\n** [[845 Naval Air Squadron]] \u2013 [[AgustaWestland AW101|Commando Merlin HC4/4A]]\n**[[846 Naval Air Squadron]] \u2013 Commando Merlin HC4/HC3i\n**[[847 Naval Air Squadron]] \u2013 Commando Wildcat AH1\n\n=== British Army ===\n'''[[Joint Helicopter Command]]''' '''/ [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]]'''\n*Aviation Reconnaissance Force\n**[[1 Regiment Army Air Corps|1 Regiment]]\n***[[No. 652 Squadron AAC|652 Squadron]] \u2013 Wildcat AH1\n***[[No. 659 Squadron AAC|659 Squadron]] \u2013 Wildcat AH1\n***[[No. 661 Squadron AAC|661 Squadron]] \u2013 Wildcat AH1\n'''[[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]]'''\n* 7 Aviation Support Battalion\n** 73 Aviation Company (Wildcat Support)\n\n==Future==\n===Merlin Life Sustainment Programme (MLSP)===\n\nThe Merlin HC3/3A fleet is currently undergoing an upgrade to HC4 and HC4A to ensure the aircraft are fully capable of deploying in an maritime/amphibious role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://des.mod.uk/merlin-mk4-delivery/|title=https://des.mod.uk/merlin-mk4-delivery/|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The differences between the current HC3 and (former Denmark-bound) HC3A will be almost eliminated in the HC4/4A upgrade (known as the MLSP).
