Do not \"correct\" it.}} nomenclature''' (\"two-name naming system\") or '''binary nomenclature''', is a formal system of naming [[species]] of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use [[Latin grammar|Latin grammatical forms]], although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a '''binomial name''' (which may be shortened to just \"binomial\"), a '''binomen''', '''{{not a typo|binominal|reason=This is the alternative name in the ICZN. Do not \"correct\" it.}} name''' or a '''scientific name'''; more informally it is also called a '''Latin name'''.\n\nThe first part of the name \u2013 the ''[[generic name (biology)|generic name]]'' \u2013 identifies the [[genus]] to which the species belongs, while the second part \u2013 the '''specific name''' or '''specific epithet''' \u2013 identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ''[[Homo]]'' and within this genus to the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' is probably the most widely known binomial.<ref>{{cite book | author=Busby III, Arthur |display-authors=etal | title=A Guide to Rocks and Fossils | page=103 | date=1997}}</ref> The ''formal'' introduction of this system of naming species is credited to [[Carl Linnaeus]], effectively beginning with his work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.<ref name=\"Knapp\" /> But [[Gaspard Bauhin]], in as early as 1622, had introduced in his book ''Pinax theatri botanici'' (English, ''Illustrated exposition of plants'') many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bauhin|first1=Gaspard|title=Pinax theatri botanici|url=http://edb.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/exhibit-e/b07/b07cont.html|publisher=Kyoto University Library|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') for animals and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp''). Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.\n\nIn modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist [[Thomas Drummond (botanist)|Thomas Drummond]]) is now written as ''[[Phlox drummondii]]''.\n\nIn scientific works, the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authority|authority]] for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified.\n*In [[zoology]]\n** \"''[[Patella vulgata]]'' Linnaeus, 1758\". The name \"Linnaeus\" tells the reader who it was that first published a description and name for this species of limpet; 1758 is the date of the publication in which the original description can be found (in this case the 10th edition of the book ''[[Systema Naturae]]'').\n**\"''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)\". The original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information.\n*In [[botany]]\n**\"''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation used in botany for \"Linnaeus\".\n**\"''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.)

This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed.

The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]] includes both nomenclature and classification.

However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include:\n* Latin, either [[Latin|classical]] or [[New Latin|medieval]]. Thus, both parts of the binomial name ''Homo sapiens'' are Latin words, meaning \"wise\" (''sapiens'') \"human/man\" (''Homo'').\n* [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]]. The genus ''[[Rhododendron]]'' was named by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, itself derived from ''rhodon'', \"rose\", and ''dendron'', \"tree\".<ref>{{OEtymD|rhododendron}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|r(odo/dendron|\u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, {{LSJ|r(o/don|\u1fe5\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd}}, {{LSJ|de/ndreon|\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|ref}}.</ref> Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form.

It can have one of a number of forms:\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The [[house sparrow]] has the binomial name ''Passer domesticus''. Here ''domesticus'' (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The [[Nandina|sacred bamboo]] is ''Nandina domestic<u>a</u>''<ref>{{Harvnb|Hyam|Pankhurst|1995|p=334}}</ref> rather than ''Nandina domestic<u>us</u>'', since ''Nandina'' is feminine whereas ''Passer'' is masculine. The tropical fruit [[Lansium parasiticum|langsat]] is a product of the plant ''Lansium parasitic<u>um</u>'', since ''Lansium'' is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' (as in the previous example of ''domesticus''); ''-is'', ''-is'', ''-e'' (e.g. ''tristis'', meaning \"sad\"); and ''-or'', ''-or'', ''-us'' (e.g. ''minor'', meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see [[Latin declension#Adjectives|Latin declension: Adjectives]].\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is ''Panthera leo''. Grammatically the noun is said to be in [[apposition]] to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, ''Panthera'' is feminine and ''leo'' is masculine.\n[[File:Talauma hodgsonii.jpg|thumb|''Magnolia hodgsonii'']]\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the [[Latin declension|declension]] of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ''-ii'' or ''-i'' in the singular and ''-orum'' in the plural, and for feminine nouns ''-ae'' in the singular and ''-arum'' in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the [[Tibetan antelope]] (''Pantholops hodgsonii''), the shrub ''[[Magnolia hodgsonii]]'', or the [[olive-backed pipit]] (''Anthus hodgsoni''). The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The ''-ii'' or ''-i'' endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, ''hodgsonae'' would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example ''Anthus hodgsoni'' was named by [[Charles Wallace Richmond]], in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'', meaning \"of the [[Chalumna River]]\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', where ''coli'' means \"of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]\". This formation is common in parasites, as in ''[[Xenos vesparum]]'', where ''vesparum'' means \"of the wasps\", since ''Xenos vesparum'' is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of ''hodgsonii'' above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\n==Codes==\n\nFrom the early 19th century<!--Strickland code was 1841--> onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names.<!--CITATION--> In the course of time these became [[nomenclature codes]]. The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') governs the naming of animals,<ref name=ICZN>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}</ref> the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp'') that of plants (including [[cyanobacteria]]), and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (''ICNB'') that of [[bacteria]] (including [[Archaea]]). [[Virus]] names are governed by the ''[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'' (''ICTV''), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:\n* \"Binomial nomenclature\" is the correct term for botany,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 23</ref> although it is also used by zoologists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Diane |year=2003 |title=Guide to reference and information sources in the zoological sciences |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=978-1-56308-977-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoreference0000schm }}, [//books.google.com/books?id=EqJrbvJU4uwC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref> Since 1953, \"binomi<u>n</u>al nomenclature\" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina).<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 2, Article 5</ref>\n* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the \"generic name\". In the zoological code (''ICZN''), the second part of the name is a \"specific name\". In the botanical code (''ICNafp''), it is a \"specific epithet\". Together, these two parts are referred to as a \"species name\" or \"binomen\" in the zoological code; or \"species name\", \"binomial\", or \"binary combination\" in the botanical code. \"Species name\" is the only term common to the two codes.\n* The ''ICNafp'', the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a [[tautonym]]), whereas the ''ICZN'', the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomial ''Bison bison''; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.\n* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In [[botany]] the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published ''[[Species Plantarum]]''). In [[zoology]] the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th Edition, and also [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Clerck's]] ''Aranei Svecici'').

(There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names [[clade]]s. This is called the ''[[PhyloCode]]''.)\n\n===Differences in handling personal names===\nAs noted above, there are some differences between the codes in the way in which binomials can be formed; for example the ''ICZN'' allows both parts to be the same, while the ''ICNafp'' does not. Another difference is in the way in which personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ''ICNafp'' sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not \"er\") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding \"-ius\" (for a man) or \"-ia\" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning \"of that person or persons\"). This produces specific epithets like ''lecardii'' for Lecard (male), ''wilsoniae'' for Wilson (female), and ''brauniarum'' for the Braun sisters.<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Recommendation 60C</ref> By contrast the ''ICZN'' does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to added directly to the personal name.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 3.1.2</ref> This explains the difference between the names of  the plant ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' and the bird ''Anthus hodgsoni''. Furthermore, the ''ICNafp'' requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 60.12</ref> whereas the ''ICZN'' is more protective of the form used by the original author.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 32.3</ref>\n\n== Writing binomial names ==\nBy tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=\"howto\">{{Citation |title=How to Write Scientific Names of Organisms |journal=Competition Science Vision |url = http://www.journal.au.edu/au_techno/2001/oct2001/howto.pdf |access-date=20 June 2011 |postscript=. }}</ref> Generally, the binomial should be printed in a [[font|font style]] different from that used in the normal text; for example, \"''Several more ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were discovered''.\" When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, <u>Homo sapiens</u>.<ref name=\"tan\">{{citation |url=http://www.cdtl.nus.edu.sg/success/sl43.htm |title=Understanding and Learning Scientific Names of Species |author1=Hugh T.W.

The somewhat informal use of taxa names with qualifying abbreviations is referred to as [[open nomenclature]] and it is not subject to strict usage codes.\n\nIn some contexts the dagger symbol (\"\u2020\") may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct.\n\n=== {{anchor|Authority}} Authority ===\n{{main|Author citation (zoology)|Author citation (botany)}}\n\nIn scholarly texts, at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the \"authority\"&nbsp;\u2013 a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name. The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ''ICZN'' the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. The ''ICZN'' recommends that the \"original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.\"{{sfn|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |1999|loc=Recommendation 51a}} For names governed by the ''ICNafp'' the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The [[International Plant Names Index]] maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.\n\nWhen the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ''ICNafp'' also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ''ICNafp'', the original name is then called the [[basionym]]. Some examples:\n*(Plant) ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation for \"Linnaeus\"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.\n*(Plant) ''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell ''Scilla italica''; that is the basionym. [[Werner Hugo Paul Rothmaler|Rothmaler]] later transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''.\n*(Animal) ''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)&nbsp;\u2013 the original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; unlike the ''ICNafp'', the ''ICZN'' does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.\n\n==Other ranks==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\n{{main|Biological nomenclature|Trinomial nomenclature|Infraspecific name (botany)}}\n\nBinomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, ''Passer domesticus'', belongs to the family [[Passeridae]]. Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.\n\nRanks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ''ICZN'' and the ''ICNafp''. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the [[olive-backed pipit]] is ''Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii''. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a \"connecting term\" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is ''Sambucus nigra'' subsp. ''canadensis''; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' f. ''albiflorum''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Botanical name]]\n* [[Hybrid name (botany)]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]\n* [[List of zoologists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[Scientific terminology]]\n* [[Species description]]\n* [[Undescribed taxon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes }}\n*{{Citation |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ''online'' |edition=4th |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |isbn=978-0-85301-006-7 |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 }}\n*{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.\n\nIn modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist [[Thomas Drummond (botanist)|Thomas Drummond]]) is now written as ''[[Phlox drummondii]]''.\n\nIn scientific works, the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authority|authority]] for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified.\n*In [[zoology]]\n** \"''[[Patella vulgata]]'' Linnaeus, 1758\".

The original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus.

This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed. Above the rank of genus, binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent; for example, a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another, unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family, or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus. The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]] includes both nomenclature and classification.

However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include:\n* Latin, either [[Latin|classical]] or [[New Latin|medieval]]. Thus, both parts of the binomial name ''Homo sapiens'' are Latin words, meaning \"wise\" (''sapiens'') \"human/man\" (''Homo'').\n* [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]]. The genus ''[[Rhododendron]]'' was named by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, itself derived from ''rhodon'', \"rose\", and ''dendron'', \"tree\".<ref>{{OEtymD|rhododendron}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|r(odo/dendron|\u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, {{LSJ|r(o/don|\u1fe5\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd}}, {{LSJ|de/ndreon|\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|ref}}.</ref> Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form.

The second part of the name ''[[Erythroxylum coca]]'' is derived from ''kuka'', the name of the plant in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]].<ref>{{Ref Bertonio}}</ref><ref>{{Ref Laime}}</ref> Since many dinosaur fossils were found in Mongolia, their names often use [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] words, e.g. ''[[Tarchia]]'' from ''tarkhi'', meaning \"brain\", or ''[[Saichania]]'' meaning \"beautiful one\".\n* Names of people (often naturalists or biologists).

It can have one of a number of forms:\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The [[house sparrow]] has the binomial name ''Passer domesticus''. Here ''domesticus'' (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The [[Nandina|sacred bamboo]] is ''Nandina domestic<u>a</u>''<ref>{{Harvnb|Hyam|Pankhurst|1995|p=334}}</ref> rather than ''Nandina domestic<u>us</u>'', since ''Nandina'' is feminine whereas ''Passer'' is masculine. The tropical fruit [[Lansium parasiticum|langsat]] is a product of the plant ''Lansium parasitic<u>um</u>'', since ''Lansium'' is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' (as in the previous example of ''domesticus''); ''-is'', ''-is'', ''-e'' (e.g. ''tristis'', meaning \"sad\"); and ''-or'', ''-or'', ''-us'' (e.g. ''minor'', meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see [[Latin declension#Adjectives|Latin declension: Adjectives]].\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is ''Panthera leo''. Grammatically the noun is said to be in [[apposition]] to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, ''Panthera'' is feminine and ''leo'' is masculine.\n[[File:Talauma hodgsonii.jpg|thumb|''Magnolia hodgsonii'']]\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the [[Latin declension|declension]] of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ''-ii'' or ''-i'' in the singular and ''-orum'' in the plural, and for feminine nouns ''-ae'' in the singular and ''-arum'' in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the [[Tibetan antelope]] (''Pantholops hodgsonii''), the shrub ''[[Magnolia hodgsonii]]'', or the [[olive-backed pipit]] (''Anthus hodgsoni''). The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The ''-ii'' or ''-i'' endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, ''hodgsonae'' would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example ''Anthus hodgsoni'' was named by [[Charles Wallace Richmond]], in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'', meaning \"of the [[Chalumna River]]\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', where ''coli'' means \"of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]\". This formation is common in parasites, as in ''[[Xenos vesparum]]'', where ''vesparum'' means \"of the wasps\", since ''Xenos vesparum'' is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of ''hodgsonii'' above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\n==Codes==\n\nFrom the early 19th century<!--Strickland code was 1841--> onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names.<!--CITATION--> In the course of time these became [[nomenclature codes]]. The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') governs the naming of animals,<ref name=ICZN>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}</ref> the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp'') that of plants (including [[cyanobacteria]]), and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (''ICNB'') that of [[bacteria]] (including [[Archaea]]). [[Virus]] names are governed by the ''[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'' (''ICTV''), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:\n* \"Binomial nomenclature\" is the correct term for botany,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 23</ref> although it is also used by zoologists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Diane |year=2003 |title=Guide to reference and information sources in the zoological sciences |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=978-1-56308-977-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoreference0000schm }}, [//books.google.com/books?id=EqJrbvJU4uwC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref> Since 1953, \"binomi<u>n</u>al nomenclature\" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina).<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 2, Article 5</ref>\n* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the \"generic name\". In the zoological code (''ICZN''), the second part of the name is a \"specific name\". In the botanical code (''ICNafp''), it is a \"specific epithet\". Together, these two parts are referred to as a \"species name\" or \"binomen\" in the zoological code; or \"species name\", \"binomial\", or \"binary combination\" in the botanical code. \"Species name\" is the only term common to the two codes.\n* The ''ICNafp'', the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a [[tautonym]]), whereas the ''ICZN'', the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomial ''Bison bison''; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.\n* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In [[botany]] the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published ''[[Species Plantarum]]''). In [[zoology]] the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th Edition, and also [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Clerck's]] ''Aranei Svecici''). [[Bacteriology]] started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sneath |first=P.H.A. |year=2003 |publisher=International Union of Microbiological Societies |url=http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |accessdate=20 June 2013 |title=A short history of the Bacteriological Code |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070542/http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of terminology for the names of species in the ICZN and ICNafp\n!

(There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names [[clade]]s. This is called the ''[[PhyloCode]]''.)\n\n===Differences in handling personal names===\nAs noted above, there are some differences between the codes in the way in which binomials can be formed; for example the ''ICZN'' allows both parts to be the same, while the ''ICNafp'' does not. Another difference is in the way in which personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ''ICNafp'' sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not \"er\") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding \"-ius\" (for a man) or \"-ia\" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning \"of that person or persons\"). This produces specific epithets like ''lecardii'' for Lecard (male), ''wilsoniae'' for Wilson (female), and ''brauniarum'' for the Braun sisters.<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Recommendation 60C</ref> By contrast the ''ICZN'' does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to added directly to the personal name.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 3.1.2</ref> This explains the difference between the names of  the plant ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' and the bird ''Anthus hodgsoni''. Furthermore, the ''ICNafp'' requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 60.12</ref> whereas the ''ICZN'' is more protective of the form used by the original author.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 32.3</ref>\n\n== Writing binomial names ==\nBy tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=\"howto\">{{Citation |title=How to Write Scientific Names of Organisms |journal=Competition Science Vision |url = http://www.journal.au.edu/au_techno/2001/oct2001/howto.pdf |access-date=20 June 2011 |postscript=. }}</ref> Generally, the binomial should be printed in a [[font|font style]] different from that used in the normal text; for example, \"''Several more ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were discovered''.\" When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, <u>Homo sapiens</u>.<ref name=\"tan\">{{citation |url=http://www.cdtl.nus.edu.sg/success/sl43.htm |title=Understanding and Learning Scientific Names of Species |author1=Hugh T.W.

A capital was also used when the name is formed by two nouns in apposition, e.g. ''Panthera Leo'' or ''Centaurea Cyanus''.<ref name=JohnsonSmith1972p23>{{Harvnb|Johnson|Smith|1972|p=23}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2019}}</ref>{{NoteTag|The modern notation was resisted by some, partly because writing names like ''Centaurea cyanus'' can suggest that ''cyanus'' is an adjective which should agree with ''Centaurea'', i.e. that the name should be ''Centaurea cyana'', whereas ''Cyanus'' is derived from the Greek name for the cornflower.<ref>{{Citation |last=Gilbert-Carter |first=H. |year=1955 |title=Glossary of the British Flora |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |oclc=559413416 |page = xix }}</ref>}}\n\nWhen used with a common name, the scientific name often follows in parentheses, although this varies with publication.<ref name=\"parenth\">{{citation |url = http://www.gse.mq.edu.au/resources/guide/format.htm |title=Writing Guide: Language, Words and Format |location = Sydney, NSW |publisher=Macquarie University |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140234/http://www.gse.mq.edu.au/resources/guide/format.htm |archive-date = 29 June 2011 }}</ref> For example, \"The house sparrow (''Passer domesticus'') is decreasing in Europe.\"\n\nThe binomial name should generally be written in full.

The somewhat informal use of taxa names with qualifying abbreviations is referred to as [[open nomenclature]] and it is not subject to strict usage codes.\n\nIn some contexts the dagger symbol (\"\u2020\") may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct.\n\n=== {{anchor|Authority}} Authority ===\n{{main|Author citation (zoology)|Author citation (botany)}}\n\nIn scholarly texts, at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the \"authority\"&nbsp;\u2013 a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name. The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ''ICZN'' the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. The ''ICZN'' recommends that the \"original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.\"{{sfn|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |1999|loc=Recommendation 51a}} For names governed by the ''ICNafp'' the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The [[International Plant Names Index]] maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.\n\nWhen the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ''ICNafp'' also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ''ICNafp'', the original name is then called the [[basionym]]. Some examples:\n*(Plant) ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation for \"Linnaeus\"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.\n*(Plant) ''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell ''Scilla italica''; that is the basionym. [[Werner Hugo Paul Rothmaler|Rothmaler]] later transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''.\n*(Animal) ''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)&nbsp;\u2013 the original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; unlike the ''ICNafp'', the ''ICZN'' does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.\n\n==Other ranks==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\n{{main|Biological nomenclature|Trinomial nomenclature|Infraspecific name (botany)}}\n\nBinomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, ''Passer domesticus'', belongs to the family [[Passeridae]]. Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.\n\nRanks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ''ICZN'' and the ''ICNafp''. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the [[olive-backed pipit]] is ''Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii''. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a \"connecting term\" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is ''Sambucus nigra'' subsp. ''canadensis''; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' f. ''albiflorum''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Botanical name]]\n* [[Hybrid name (botany)]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]\n* [[List of zoologists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[Scientific terminology]]\n* [[Species description]]\n* [[Undescribed taxon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes }}\n*{{Citation |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ''online'' |edition=4th |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |isbn=978-0-85301-006-7 |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 }}\n*{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.
