The film stars [[Claude Rains]], Bill Carter, and Maya Brent.<ref name=\"afi\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Fred Steele (Umberto Orsini) and Eve Barnett (Maya Brent) work together at an astronomical station on a bucolic island. Steele has just had his request for a transfer approved, and he and Eve look forward to leaving the island and getting married. However, their budding romance is quickly put on hold as the station's scientists learn they must deal with a rogue planet&mdash;\"The Outsider\"\u2014that has entered the [[solar system]], and which is on a collision course with Earth. The brilliant but cantankerous Professor Benson (Claude Rains), living in an adjacent greenhouse with his dog Gideon, predicts that the Outsider will not strike the Earth but will simply make a close pass\u2014a prediction that no other scientist will endorse.  Meanwhile, a military base on [[Mars]] encounters the stray planet on its approach to Earth, and Commander Robert Cole and his wife Cathy quickly travel to the island outpost from Mars to help with the effort.\n\nThe base scientists are elated when the Outsider passes the earth at a distance of 95,000 miles, just as Benson predicted. But Benson himself is stunned when the Outsider takes up an orbit round Earth. He concludes that the Outsider must be controlled by an alien intelligence, and he calls upon the world's scientific governing council to destroy it without delay.\n\nAgainst Benson's wishes, an expedition is launched to make a close study of the new planet. As the exploratory spacecraft approach, a number of disc-shaped alien spaceships emerge from beneath the planet's surface, destroying the Earth vessels.\n\nThe phantom planet begins spiraling inward toward the Earth, creating hurricanes and storms, and the beginning of the end appears to be near. Professor Benson discovers that the alien ships are computer-controlled, and he devises a way to seize control of them from the Outsider. Benson is given the opportunity to join an expedition to the Outsider, to learn something of its underground base. Meanwhile, a plan is hatched to launch an all-out attack against the planet, in the hope that a massive nuclear strike will break the planet apart.\n\nBenson's expedition discovers a race of [[humanoid]] creatures dead at the controls of their planet-spaceship, as the automated systems continue their work without purpose. But the expedition has overrun its allotted time, and the order is given to begin the attack. It is a race against time as the members of the expedition try to get back to the ship before the [[nuclear warheads]] strike. Cathy is mortally wounded in the attempt to flee the Outsider. Benson refuses to leave, insisting that life without scientific knowledge is not worth living. He sees a way to communicate with the Outsider and program it to leave, but it is too late. The warheads reach their target, and the Outsider is successfully destroyed.

Steele has just had his request for a transfer approved, and he and Eve look forward to leaving the island and getting married. However, their budding romance is quickly put on hold as the station's scientists learn they must deal with a rogue planet&mdash;\"The Outsider\"\u2014that has entered the [[solar system]], and which is on a collision course with Earth. The brilliant but cantankerous Professor Benson (Claude Rains), living in an adjacent greenhouse with his dog Gideon, predicts that the Outsider will not strike the Earth but will simply make a close pass\u2014a prediction that no other scientist will endorse.  Meanwhile, a military base on [[Mars]] encounters the stray planet on its approach to Earth, and Commander Robert Cole and his wife Cathy quickly travel to the island outpost from Mars to help with the effort.\n\nThe base scientists are elated when the Outsider passes the earth at a distance of 95,000 miles, just as Benson predicted. But Benson himself is stunned when the Outsider takes up an orbit round Earth. He concludes that the Outsider must be controlled by an alien intelligence, and he calls upon the world's scientific governing council to destroy it without delay.\n\nAgainst Benson's wishes, an expedition is launched to make a close study of the new planet. As the exploratory spacecraft approach, a number of disc-shaped alien spaceships emerge from beneath the planet's surface, destroying the Earth vessels.\n\nThe phantom planet begins spiraling inward toward the Earth, creating hurricanes and storms, and the beginning of the end appears to be near. Professor Benson discovers that the alien ships are computer-controlled, and he devises a way to seize control of them from the Outsider. Benson is given the opportunity to join an expedition to the Outsider, to learn something of its underground base. Meanwhile, a plan is hatched to launch an all-out attack against the planet, in the hope that a massive nuclear strike will break the planet apart.\n\nBenson's expedition discovers a race of [[humanoid]] creatures dead at the controls of their planet-spaceship, as the automated systems continue their work without purpose. But the expedition has overrun its allotted time, and the order is given to begin the attack. It is a race against time as the members of the expedition try to get back to the ship before the [[nuclear warheads]] strike. Cathy is mortally wounded in the attempt to flee the Outsider. Benson refuses to leave, insisting that life without scientific knowledge is not worth living. He sees a way to communicate with the Outsider and program it to leave, but it is too late. The warheads reach their target, and the Outsider is successfully destroyed.  As the exploratory ship returns to Earth, Commander Cole speaks Benson's epitaph: \"Poor Benson\u2014if they'd opened up his chest, they would only find a formula where his heart should have been\".

She was named after the [[Bougainville campaign]], a prolonged action against Japanese forces entrenched in the island of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] in the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]]. The ship was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] in May 1944, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in June, and served as a replenishment carrier in support of the [[invasion of Iwo Jima]] and the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. She was decommissioned in November 1946, when she was [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]]. Ultimately, she was sold for [[Ship breaking|scrapping]] in August 1960.\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:Inboard and outboard profiles of a Casablanca-class escort carrier, 1946.png|thumb|left|A profile of the design of {{USS|Takanis Bay|CVE-89|2}}, which was shared with all ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers.]]\n{{main|Casablanca-class escort carrier}}\n''Bougainville'' was a ''Casablanca''-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of [[aircraft carrier]]s ever built,{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}} and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her [[sister ship]]s, she was {{cvt|512|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[Waterline length|length]] {{cvt|490|ft|abbr=on}} at the waterline, she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|65|ft|2|in|abbr=on}}, at her widest point, this was {{cvt|108|ft|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{cvt|20|ft|9|in|abbr=on}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|8188|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]], {{cvt|10902|LT}} with a [[Full-load displacement|full load]]. She had a {{cvt|257|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Hangar#Hangars aboard ships|hangar deck]] and a {{cvt|477|ft|abbr=on}} long [[flight deck]]. She was powered with two [[Uniflow steam engine|Uniflow reciprocating steam engines]], which drove two shafts, providing {{cvt|9000|shp|lk=on}}, thus enabling her to make {{Casablanca class speed}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{cvt|10240|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{cvt|15|kn}}. Her compact size necessitated the installation of an [[aircraft catapult]] at her bow, and there were two [[Elevator#Elevators for aircraft|aircraft elevators]] to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}}{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}\n\nOne [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}}/38]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[dual-purpose gun]] was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} anti-aircraft guns]] in single mounts, as well as 12 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} cannon]]s, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}} By the end of the war, ''Casablanca''-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to [[kamikaze]] attacks. Although ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. The carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Because ''Bougainville'' only operated in a replenishment capability, she usually operated with about 60 aircraft on board, the maximum carrying capacity at which take-offs would still be possible.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=10}}\n\n==Construction==\nHer construction was awarded to [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipbuilding Company]], [[Vancouver, Washington]] under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name ''Didrickson Bay'', as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska.{{sfn|Maksel|2012}} She was renamed ''Bougainville'', as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent ''Casablanca''-class carriers after naval or land engagements.{{sfn|Stubblebine|2011}} The escort carrier was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 3 March 1944, MC hull 1137, the forty-sixth of a series of fifty ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 16 May 1944; [[Ship sponsor|sponsored]] by Mrs. Sally A. Monfort; transferred to the [[United States Navy]] and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 18 June 1944, with [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Charles Alonzo Bond in command.{{sfn|Kaiser Vancouver|2010}}{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\n==Service history==\n===World War II===\nUpon being commissioned, ''Bougainville'' got underway, on 7 July, on a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]. Upon arriving, she was assigned to the Carrier Transport Squadron of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. The carrier departed on 25 July with a load of aircraft, bound for the West Pacific. Transiting via [[Pearl Harbor]], she headed to [[Majuro]], in the [[Marshall Islands]]. She returned to the West Coast on 23 August, and following a seventeen-day period at port, she left on 9 September for another transport mission. She steamed to [[Finschhafen]], [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], before proceeding to [[Manus Island]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]], where she unloaded her aircraft. There, she took on an air group returning to Pearl Harbor, arriving at [[Oahu]] in mid-October.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\nAfter unloading her cargo, she took on a complement of sixty-four fighter aircraft, all bound for the [[Mariana Islands]]. After arriving at [[Saipan]], her crew went to [[general quarters]] for the first time on 3 November in response to Japanese aircraft. Departing on 4 November, she headed to [[Guam]], before returning to Pearl Harbor. In the closing months of 1944, ''Bougainville'' made another transport mission from Pearl Harbor to the Marianas, making a stop at [[Eniwetok]]. Upon completing her mission, she departed in mid-December for the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 22 December. There, she underwent another stay of availability, until 7 January 1945, when she headed back into the Pacific.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\nShe stopped at Pearl Harbor on 13 January, where she commenced flight training and gunnery exercises. Upon the completion of these activities, she departed Hawaiian waters on 30 January, arriving back at Eniwetok a week later. There, on 8 February, she was assigned to become a replenishment carrier as a part of Task Group 50.8.4, the mobile replenishment group supporting the frontline [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]]. She served alongside three other escort carriers, {{USS|Admiralty Islands|CVE-99|2}}, {{USS|Attu|CVE-102|2}}, and {{USS|Windham Bay|CVE-92|2}}.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=329}} Replenishment escort carriers such as ''Bougainville'' enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses, and to stay at sea for longer durations of time.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}} She departed Eniwetok to commence her replenishment duties on 9 February.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\nFor the next four months, ''Bougainville'' operated in a replenishment capability, supplying the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]'s [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] with supplies, replacement aircraft, and munitions. She first supported [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Marc Mitscher]]'s carriers as they conducted operations in support of the [[Invasion of Iwo Jima|landings]] on [[Iwo Jima]]. Upon the conclusion of said campaign, she providing aircraft to replace losses sustained in raids against the Japanese mainland, and she also provided support throughout the first six weeks of the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. During the Okinawa campaign, she had the task of providing replacement aircraft for both the escort carriers and the fleet carriers.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=351}} Throughout her service as a replenishment carrier, she received supplies and additional aircraft from bases located within Eniwetok, Guam, and [[Ulithi]] in the [[Caroline Islands]].{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\n[[File:USS Bougainville (CVE-100) at sea, circa 1945 (NH 89182).jpg|thumb|left|''Bougainville'' at sea, circa 1945.]]\nOn 5 June, ''Bougainville'', along with the ships of Task Group 38.1 and Task Group 30.8, was trapped in the path of [[1945 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Connie|Typhoon Connie]], which was proceeding northwards, and on a course to the east of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]. [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.]], which had already led the Third Fleet into the deadly [[Typhoon Cobra]] in December 1944, now managed to lead the Third Fleet yet again into another deadly storm. At the peak of the storm, ''Windham Bay'' experienced estimated winds of {{cvt|127|knots}} and waves towering some {{cvt|75|ft}} high. As Task Group 50.8 emerged from the typhoon, ''Bougainville'' had suffered considerable damage, in both her hull, and her aircraft contingent. Twenty-seven planes on ''Bougainville'' had been lost or wrecked, and most of her remaining planes, located in her hangar deck, were inaccessible, because both of her aircraft elevators had been jammed. In addition, her flight deck supports had been damaged, and she suffered much additional superficial damage.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=402}}{{sfn|DANFS II|2017}}\n\nIn mid-June, ''Bougainville'' was released from her replenishment duties, when she undertook a transport mission to bases located within the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], before returning to Guam. After completing her mission, she steamed eastward, pausing at Pearl Harbor, before arriving back at San Diego, where she lay in port until early August for repairs and replenishment. On 9 August, she left San Diego, bound yet again for the West Pacific. En route, her crew received news of the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on 15 August. After stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam, she was anchored off of the island of [[Roi-Namur]] when the formal signing of the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] was occurring on 2 September. There, she loaded inoperational aircraft, before heading back to Oahu. At Pearl Harbor, she took on a load of aircraft and passengers, departing port on 12 September, stopping at [[Apra Harbor]], Guam, where she disembarked some passengers and took on additional aircraft. Continuing westwards, she anchored at [[Nakagusuku Bay]] on 27 September, before leaving harbor the following day to evade [[1945 Pacific Typhoon season#Typhoon Jean|Typhoon Jean]], which appeared to heading for the [[Okinawa Islands]].{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\n''Bougainville'' returned to port on 3 October, where she took on two [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] observation squadrons, VMO-3 and VMO-6, which were headed to China for occupation duty. On 10 October, she arrived at the [[Taku Forts]], where she disembarked VMO-3, which was attached to the [[3rd Marine Regiment|3rd Marines]]. Proceeding southwards, she arrived at [[Qingdao]] on 11 October, and on 12 October, VMO-6, which was attached to the [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marines]], disembarked. After a layover of four days at Qingdao, she steamed for Okinawa on 16 October. She entered Nakagusuku Bay on 19 October, where she took on a load of inoperational aircraft and passengers. Steaming eastwards, she made a brief layover at Pearl Harbor, arriving back at the West Coast by the end of October.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\nAfter a long stay in port, ''Bougainville'' once again departed on 28 November, heading to Eniwetok, via Pearl Harbor. She returned to San Diego on 12 January 1946, whereupon she steamed northwards, arriving at [[Tacoma, Washington]] in late-January. There, inactivation work was conducted, and she was placed in reserve on 29 July. She was decommissioned on 30 November, and [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]], as part of its Tacoma Group. Whilst in reserve, she was reclassified as a utility aircraft carrier ('''CVU-100''') on 12 June 1955. She was further reclassified as an aircraft ferry ('''AKV-35''') on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] on 1 April 1960, and she was sold on 9 September to the Cole Export Corp. Delivered on 7 November, she was ultimately [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in Japan later that year. ''Bougainville'' received two [[battle star]]s for her World War II service.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal bar|World War

forty-sixth of fifty {{sclass-|Casablanca|escort carrier}} built for the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was named after the [[Bougainville campaign]], a prolonged action against Japanese forces entrenched in the island of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] in the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]]. The ship was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] in May 1944, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in June, and served as a replenishment carrier in support of the [[invasion of Iwo Jima]] and the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. She was decommissioned in November 1946, when she was [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]]. Ultimately, she was sold for [[Ship breaking|scrapping]] in August 1960.\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:Inboard and outboard profiles of a Casablanca-class escort carrier, 1946.png|thumb|left|A profile of the design of {{USS|Takanis Bay|CVE-89|2}}, which was shared with all ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers.]]\n{{main|Casablanca-class escort carrier}}\n''Bougainville'' was a ''Casablanca''-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of [[aircraft carrier]]s ever built,{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}} and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her [[sister ship]]s, she was {{cvt|512|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[Waterline length|length]] {{cvt|490|ft|abbr=on}} at the waterline, she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|65|ft|2|in|abbr=on}}, at her widest point, this was {{cvt|108|ft|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{cvt|20|ft|9|in|abbr=on}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|8188|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]], {{cvt|10902|LT}} with a [[Full-load displacement|full load]]. She had a {{cvt|257|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Hangar#Hangars aboard ships|hangar deck]] and a {{cvt|477|ft|abbr=on}} long [[flight deck]]. She was powered with two [[Uniflow steam engine|Uniflow reciprocating steam engines]], which drove two shafts, providing {{cvt|9000|shp|lk=on}}, thus enabling her to make {{Casablanca class speed}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{cvt|10240|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{cvt|15|kn}}. Her compact size necessitated the installation of an [[aircraft catapult]] at her bow, and there were two [[Elevator#Elevators for aircraft|aircraft elevators]] to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}}{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}\n\nOne [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}}/38]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[dual-purpose gun]] was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} anti-aircraft guns]] in single mounts, as well as 12 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} cannon]]s, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}} By the end of the war, ''Casablanca''-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to [[kamikaze]] attacks. Although ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. The carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Because ''Bougainville'' only operated in a replenishment capability, she usually operated with about 60 aircraft on board, the maximum carrying capacity at which take-offs would still be possible.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=10}}\n\n==Construction==\nHer construction was awarded to [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipbuilding Company]], [[Vancouver, Washington]] under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name ''Didrickson Bay'', as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska.{{sfn|Maksel|2012}} She was renamed ''Bougainville'', as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent ''Casablanca''-class carriers after naval or land engagements.{{sfn|Stubblebine|2011}} The escort carrier was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 3 March 1944, MC hull 1137, the forty-sixth of a series of fifty ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 16 May 1944; [[Ship sponsor|sponsored]] by Mrs. Sally A. Monfort; transferred to the [[United States Navy]] and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 18 June 1944, with [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Charles Alonzo Bond in command.{{sfn|Kaiser Vancouver|2010}}{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\n==Service history==\n===World War II===\nUpon being commissioned, ''Bougainville'' got underway, on 7 July, on a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]. Upon arriving, she was assigned to the Carrier Transport Squadron of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. The carrier departed on 25 July with a load of aircraft, bound for the West Pacific. Transiting via [[Pearl Harbor]], she headed to [[Majuro]], in the [[Marshall Islands]]. She returned to the West Coast on 23 August, and following a seventeen-day period at port, she left on 9 September for another transport mission. She steamed to [[Finschhafen]], [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], before proceeding to [[Manus Island]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]], where she unloaded her aircraft. There, she took on an air group returning to Pearl Harbor, arriving at [[Oahu]] in mid-October.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\nAfter unloading her cargo, she took on a complement of sixty-four fighter aircraft, all bound for the [[Mariana Islands]]. After arriving at [[Saipan]], her crew went to [[general quarters]] for the first time on 3 November in response to Japanese aircraft. Departing on 4 November, she headed to [[Guam]], before returning to Pearl Harbor. In the closing months of 1944, ''Bougainville'' made another transport mission from Pearl Harbor to the Marianas, making a stop at [[Eniwetok]]. Upon completing her mission, she departed in mid-December for the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 22 December. There, she underwent another stay of availability, until 7 January 1945, when she headed back into the Pacific.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\nShe stopped at Pearl Harbor on 13 January, where she commenced flight training and gunnery exercises. Upon the completion of these activities, she departed Hawaiian waters on 30 January, arriving back at Eniwetok a week later. There, on 8 February, she was assigned to become a replenishment carrier as a part of Task Group 50.8.4, the mobile replenishment group supporting the frontline [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]]. She served alongside three other escort carriers, {{USS|Admiralty Islands|CVE-99|2}}, {{USS|Attu|CVE-102|2}}, and {{USS|Windham Bay|CVE-92|2}}.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=329}} Replenishment escort carriers such as ''Bougainville'' enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses, and to stay at sea for longer durations of time.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}} She departed Eniwetok to commence her replenishment duties on 9 February.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\nFor the next four months, ''Bougainville'' operated in a replenishment capability, supplying the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]'s [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] with supplies, replacement aircraft, and munitions. She first supported [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Marc Mitscher]]'s carriers as they conducted operations in support of the [[Invasion of Iwo Jima|landings]] on [[Iwo Jima]]. Upon the conclusion of said campaign, she providing aircraft to replace losses sustained in raids against the Japanese mainland, and she also provided support throughout the first six weeks of the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. During the Okinawa campaign, she had the task of providing replacement aircraft for both the escort carriers and the fleet carriers.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=351}} Throughout her service as a replenishment carrier, she received supplies and additional aircraft from bases located within Eniwetok, Guam, and [[Ulithi]] in the [[Caroline Islands]].{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\n[[File:USS Bougainville (CVE-100) at sea, circa 1945 (NH 89182).jpg|thumb|left|''Bougainville'' at sea, circa 1945.]]\nOn 5 June, ''Bougainville'', along with the ships of Task Group 38.1 and Task Group 30.8, was trapped in the path of [[1945 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Connie|Typhoon Connie]], which was proceeding northwards, and on a course to the east of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]. [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.]], which had already led the Third Fleet into the deadly [[Typhoon Cobra]] in December 1944, now managed to lead the Third Fleet yet again into another deadly storm. At the peak of the storm, ''Windham Bay'' experienced estimated winds of {{cvt|127|knots}} and waves towering some {{cvt|75|ft}} high. As Task Group 50.8 emerged from the typhoon, ''Bougainville'' had suffered considerable damage, in both her hull, and her aircraft contingent. Twenty-seven planes on ''Bougainville'' had been lost or wrecked, and most of her remaining planes, located in her hangar deck, were inaccessible, because both of her aircraft elevators had been jammed. In addition, her flight deck supports had been damaged, and she suffered much additional superficial damage.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=402}}{{sfn|DANFS II|2017}}\n\nIn mid-June, ''Bougainville'' was released from her replenishment duties, when she undertook a transport mission to bases located within the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], before returning to Guam. After completing her mission, she steamed eastward, pausing at Pearl Harbor, before arriving back at San Diego, where she lay in port until early August for repairs and replenishment. On 9 August, she left San Diego, bound yet again for the West Pacific. En route, her crew received news of the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on 15 August. After stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam, she was anchored off of the island of [[Roi-Namur]] when the formal signing of the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] was occurring on 2 September. There, she loaded inoperational aircraft, before heading back to Oahu. At Pearl Harbor, she took on a load of aircraft and passengers, departing port on 12 September, stopping at [[Apra Harbor]], Guam, where she disembarked some passengers and took on additional aircraft. Continuing westwards, she anchored at [[Nakagusuku Bay]] on 27 September, before leaving harbor the following day to evade [[1945 Pacific Typhoon season#Typhoon Jean|Typhoon Jean]], which appeared to heading for the [[Okinawa Islands]].{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\n''Bougainville'' returned to port on 3 October, where she took on two [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] observation squadrons, VMO-3 and VMO-6, which were headed to China for occupation duty. On 10 October, she arrived at the [[Taku Forts]], where she disembarked VMO-3, which was attached to the [[3rd Marine Regiment|3rd Marines]]. Proceeding southwards, she arrived at [[Qingdao]] on 11 October, and on 12 October, VMO-6, which was attached to the [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marines]], disembarked. After a layover of four days at Qingdao, she steamed for Okinawa on 16 October. She entered Nakagusuku Bay on 19 October, where she took on a load of inoperational aircraft and passengers. Steaming eastwards, she made a brief layover at Pearl Harbor, arriving back at the West Coast by the end of October.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\nAfter a long stay in port, ''Bougainville'' once again departed on 28 November, heading to Eniwetok, via Pearl Harbor. She returned to San Diego on 12 January 1946, whereupon she steamed northwards, arriving at [[Tacoma, Washington]] in late-January. There, inactivation work was conducted, and she was placed in reserve on 29 July. She was decommissioned on 30 November, and [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]], as part of its Tacoma Group. Whilst in reserve, she was reclassified as a utility aircraft carrier ('''CVU-100''') on 12 June 1955. She was further reclassified as an aircraft ferry ('''AKV-35''') on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] on 1 April 1960, and she was sold on 9 September to the Cole Export Corp. Delivered on 7 November, she was ultimately [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in Japan later that year. ''Bougainville'' received two [[battle star]]s for her World War II service.{{sfn|DANFS I|2017}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal bar|World War II}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Online sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite DANFS | last = | first = | url = https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/b/bougainville-i.html| title = Bougainville I (CVE-100)| publisher = Naval History and Heritage Command | date = 1 May 2017| accessdate = 31 December 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191231065807/https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/b/bougainville-i.html|archive-date=2019-12-31| ref = {{sfnRef|DANFS I|2017}}}}{{PD-notice}}\n* {{cite DANFS | last = | first = | url = https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/p/pacific-typhoon-june-1945/extract-from-third-fleet-report.html#| title = Pacific Typhoon: June 1945 \u2013 Extract from Third Fleet Report, 14 July 1945| publisher = Naval History and Heritage Command | date = 2 April 2015| accessdate = 1 January 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190531060013/https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/p/pacific-typhoon-june-1945/extract-from-third-fleet-report.html|archive-date=2019-05-03| ref = {{sfnRef|DANFS II|2017}}}}{{PD-notice}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://shipbuildinghistory.com/shipyards/emergencylarge/kvancouver.htm| title = Kaiser Vancouver, Vancouver WA| publisher =  www.ShipbuildingHistory.com| date = 27 November 2010| accessdate = 14 June 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190616103407/http://shipbuildinghistory.com/shipyards/emergencylarge/kvancouver.htm|archive-date=2019-06-19|ref = {{sfnRef|Kaiser Vancouver|2010}}}}\n* {{cite web | url = https://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/us_esc2.htm| title= World Aircraft Carriers List: US Escort Carriers, S4 Hulls| publisher= Hazegray.org | date= 14 December 1998| accessdate= 1 July 2019| ref= {{sfnRef|Hazegray|1998}}}}\n* {{cite web | last = Maksel| first = Rebecca| url = https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/how-do-you-name-an-aircraft-carrier-22717003/| title= How Do You Name an Aircraft Carrier?| publisher= [[Air & Space/Smithsonian]] | date= 14 August 2012| accessdate= 23 December 2019| ref= {{sfnRef|Maksel|2012}}}}\n* {{cite web | last = Stubblebine| first = Daniel| url = https://ww2db.com/ship_spec.php?ship_id=776| title= Escort Carrier Makin Island (CVE-93)| publisher= ww2db.com | date= June 2011| accessdate= 23 December 2019| ref= {{sfnRef|Stubblebine|2011}}}}\n{{refend}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation|last= Chesneau|first= Robert|last2= Gardiner|first2 = Robert|title= Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922\u20131946|year= 1980 |publisher= Naval Institute Press |location= [[London]], [[England]]|isbn= 9780870219139}}\n* {{citation|last= Y'Blood|first= William|title= The Little Giants: U.S. Escort Carriers Against Japan|year= 2014 |publisher= Naval Institute Press |location= [[Annapolis]], Maryland|type = [[E-book]]|isbn= 9781612512471}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|USS Bougainville (CVE-100)}}\n* {{navsource|03/100|USS Bougainville (CVE-100)}}\n\n{{Casablanca class escort carrier}}\n{{Kaiser Vancouver Shipyard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bougainville (CVE-100)}}\n[[Category:Casablanca-class escort carriers]]\n[[Category:World War II escort aircraft carriers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington]]\n", "name_user": "Stikkyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "a", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bougainville_(CVE-100)"}

The music was composed by [[Anirudh Ravichander]] with editing done by [[Vivek Harshan]] and cinematography by [[Tirru]]. The film was released on 10 January 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nKaali, an elderly man, takes up the job of a boys' [[hostel]] warden at a college in [[Ooty]]. He notices that the hostel is dominated by a group of unruly final-year students, who are led by Michael, the [[spoiled child|spoiled]] son of a local leader named Gnanam. Kaali puts a stop to Michael's antics, which leads to enmity between the two. Kaali also forms a close bond with a [[Non-residential Indian|NRI]] hostelite named Anwar, who is in a relationship with Anu, the daughter of Mangalam, a [[Energy medicine|pranic]] healer. Kaali convinces Mangalam to accept her daughter's relationship with Anwar, and they end up falling in love.\n\nMichael, who lusts for Anu, is angered on hearing of her relationship with Anwar. He attempts to harass them, only to be stopped by Kaali, who ensures the suspension of Michael and his friends, with Anwar recording and sharing the humiliation of Michael and his gang. This video is noticed far away in [[Uttar Pradesh]] by a local goon named Jithu, the son of a powerful politician called Singaaram alias Singaar Singh. Singaar, on seeing Anwar in the video as well as in a photo with his mother on [[Facebook]], sends his men to Ooty to kill Anwar, for unknown reasons. At the same time, Michael, humiliated at his suspension, sends his men to beat up (but not kill) Kaali. Michael's plan backfires as he and his men are caught in the fight between Kaali and Singaar's men. Kaali subdues Singaar's men, earning Michael's and Gnanam's respect, following which Anwar learns about his past.\n\nAnwar is the son of Maalik, who was Kaali's best friend. It is also revealed that Kaali's real name is Petta Velan alias Petta and that he was a well-respected man in his village in [[Madurai district]]. 20 years ago, Maalik was in love with Poongodi, who conceived with him out of wedlock. When Petta heard of this, he and his wife Saraswathy alias Saro managed to convince Poongodi's father Rajapandi to get Poongodi married to Maalik, even though Rajapandi and Petta were sworn enemies. Unfortunately, Rajapandi's two sons, Devaaram and Singaar, vehemently opposed the alliance as well as the transfer of property to Poongodi. They then [[patricide|killed their father]]. Petta, on hearing about Rajapandi's murder, killed Devaaram during Rajapandi's funeral and chased Singaar out of the village. As revenge for Devaaram's killing and his forced exile, Singaar orchestrates a bomb blast during Poongodi's [[seemantham]], killing Maalik, Saro, and Petta and Saro's son Chinna. Petta, after finding Poongodi still alive, took her to safety. Poongodi later gave birth to a boy, who is revealed to be Anwar, and both of them left for [[Australia]] as refugees to escape from Singaar. On hearing this story, Petta and Anwar, along with Michael's henchmen, leave for Uttar Pradesh to finish off Singaar to prevent further damage.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, Petta and Anwar confront Jithu, who is determined to kill them both after learning that his father and Petta are enemies. The duo manage to escape Jithu. Later, Petta meets Jithu privately and tells him that he is none other than his son Chinna, who did not die in the bomb blast, but was adopted by Singaar after finding him still alive in the wreckage of the blast. When Jithu confronts Singaar regarding his parentage, the latter sends his men to kill Jithu, who is rescued by Petta. Along with Anwar and Michael's henchmen, Petta and Jithu then barge into Singaar's mansion and kill him and his henchmen.\n\nFollowing Singaar's death, Petta has a surprise in store for Jithu. He tells him the tale  of [[Rama]] and how he defeated [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]], who had the ability to steal half the power of his opponents when they stood before him. Petta tells him that he did the same to Singaar by stealing half of his power, which was Jithu. Petta tells him the truth: he double-crossed Jithu and Jithu is not his son.

The film was produced by [[Kalanithi Maran]] under the banner [[Sun Pictures]]. The film stars [[Rajinikanth]] in the title role. While [[Vijay Sethupathi]], [[Simran (actress)|Simran]], [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]], [[M. Sasikumar|Sasikumar]], [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]], [[Bobby Simha]], [[Sananth]], [[Megha Akash]], and [[Malavika Mohanan]] in supporting roles. The music was composed by [[Anirudh Ravichander]] with editing done by [[Vivek Harshan]] and cinematography by [[Tirru]]. The film was released on 10 January 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nKaali, an elderly man, takes up the job of a boys' [[hostel]] warden at a college in [[Ooty]]. He notices that the hostel is dominated by a group of unruly final-year students, who are led by Michael, the [[spoiled child|spoiled]] son of a local leader named Gnanam. Kaali puts a stop to Michael's antics, which leads to enmity between the two. Kaali also forms a close bond with a [[Non-residential Indian|NRI]] hostelite named Anwar, who is in a relationship with Anu, the daughter of Mangalam, a [[Energy medicine|pranic]] healer. Kaali convinces Mangalam to accept her daughter's relationship with Anwar, and they end up falling in love.\n\nMichael, who lusts for Anu, is angered on hearing of her relationship with Anwar. He attempts to harass them, only to be stopped by Kaali, who ensures the suspension of Michael and his friends, with Anwar recording and sharing the humiliation of Michael and his gang. This video is noticed far away in [[Uttar Pradesh]] by a local goon named Jithu, the son of a powerful politician called Singaaram alias Singaar Singh. Singaar, on seeing Anwar in the video as well as in a photo with his mother on [[Facebook]], sends his men to Ooty to kill Anwar, for unknown reasons. At the same time, Michael, humiliated at his suspension, sends his men to beat up (but not kill) Kaali. Michael's plan backfires as he and his men are caught in the fight between Kaali and Singaar's men. Kaali subdues Singaar's men, earning Michael's and Gnanam's respect, following which Anwar learns about his past.\n\nAnwar is the son of Maalik, who was Kaali's best friend. It is also revealed that Kaali's real name is Petta Velan alias Petta and that he was a well-respected man in his village in [[Madurai district]]. 20 years ago, Maalik was in love with Poongodi, who concieved with him out of wedlock. When Petta heard of this, he and his wife Saraswathy alias Saro managed to convince Poongodi's father Rajapandi to get Poongodi married to Maalik, even though Rajapandi and Petta were sworn enemies. Unfortunately, Rajapandi's two sons, Devaaram and Singaar, vehemently opposed the alliance as well as the transfer of property to Poongodi. They then [[patricide|killed their father]]. Petta, on hearing about Rajapandi's murder, killed Devaaram during Rajapandi's funeral and chased Singaar out of the village. As revenge for Devaaram's killing and his forced exile, Singaar orchestrates a bomb blast during Poongodi's [[seemantham]], killing Maalik, Saro, and Petta and Saro's son Chinna. Petta, after finding Poongodi still alive, took her to safety. Poongodi later gave birth to a boy, who is revealed to be Anwar, and both of them left for [[Australia]] as refugees to escape from Singaar. On hearing this story, Petta and Anwar, along with Michael's henchmen, leave for Uttar Pradesh to finish off Singaar to prevent further damage.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, Petta and Anwar confront Jithu, who is determined to kill them both after learning that his father and Petta are enemies. The duo manage to escape Jithu. Later, Petta meets Jithu privately and tells him that he is none other than his son Chinna, who did not die in the bomb blast, but was adopted by Singaar after finding him still alive in the wreckage of the blast. When Jithu confronts Singaar regarding his parentage, the latter sends his men to kill Jithu, who is rescued by Petta. Along with Anwar and Michael's henchmen, Petta and Jithu then barge into Singaar's mansion and kill him and his henchmen.\n\nFollowing Singaar's death, Petta has a surprise in store for Jithu. He tells him the tale  of [[Rama]] and how he defeated [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]], who had the ability to steal half the power of his opponents when they stood before him. Petta tells him that he did the same to Singaar by stealing half of his power, which was Jithu. Petta tells him the truth: he double-crossed Jithu and Jithu is not his son. The real Chinna had died in the bomb blast 20 years ago and the men sent to kill Jithu were Petta's own and not Singaar's. Petta debates whether to kill or spare Jithu. He dances for a while to the song ''Raman Aandalum'' from ''[[Mullum Malarum]]'' and then points the gun at Jithu. The screen goes black and a gunshot is heard, implying that Petta killed Jithu.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin|}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Petta Velan (Kaali), an elderly man who gets hired as a hostel warden<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch: 'Marana Mass', first single from Rajini's 'Petta', reveals his name to be Kaali |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/watch-marana-mass-first-single-rajinis-petta-reveals-his-name-be-kaali-92674 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=3 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as Jithu, a local goon who Petta convinces is his son Chinna<ref>{{cite news |title=Meet Jithu, Vijay Sethupathi's character from Rajinikanth's 'Petta' |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/meet-jithu-vijay-sethupathis-character-rajinikanths-petta-92759 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] as Mangalam,a pranic healer ( Kaali's love interest and Anu's mother) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/petta-quick-review-rajinikanth-5531342/|title=Petta quick review: Thank you Karthik Subbaraj for bringing back the old Rajinikanth|date=10 January 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Saraswathy (Saro), Petta's wife<ref>{{cite news |title=Meet Saro, Trisha's character in Rajini's next 'Petta' |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/meet-saro-trishas-character-rajini-s-next-petta-93027 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=9 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[M.
