Most types of services fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), and [[medical therapy|clinical therapy]]. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: [[neuropsychology]], [[speech-language pathology]], [[audiology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]]. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a [[clinic]] because the patient has a [[disability]] or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.\n\nMost telerehabilitation is highly visual. As of 2014, the most commonly used mediums are [[webcam]]s, [[videoconferencing]], [[phone line]]s, [[videophone]]s and webpages containing rich Internet applications. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. It is most widely used for [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]]; fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as [[wheelchair]]s, [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]] or [[artificial limb]]s; and in speech-language pathology. [[Rich internet applications]] for neuropsychological rehabilitation (aka [[cognitive rehabilitation]]) of cognitive impairment (from many etiologies) were first introduced in 2001. This endeavor has expanded as a [[teletherapy]] application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children. [[Tele-audiology]] (hearing assessments) is a growing application. Currently, telerehabilitation in the practice of occupational therapy and physical therapy is limited, perhaps because these two disciplines are more \"hands on\".\n\nTwo important areas of telerehabilitation research are (1) demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to in-person assessment and therapy, and (2) building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice. Ground-breaking research in [[telehaptics]] (the sense of touch) and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice, in the future.\n\nIn the United States, the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]]'s (NIDRR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|title=OSERS|website=www.ed.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011114426/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|archive-date=2003-10-11}}</ref> supports research and the development of telerehabilitation. NIDRR's grantees include the \"Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center\" (RERC) at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC. Other federal funders of research are the [[Veterans Health Administration]], the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense.<ref>{{cite web| last = Hiers| first = Mary | name-list-format = vanc | title = Everything You Need to Know About Telemedicine| url = http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-telemedicine-m0525/| accessdate = 10 July 2014 }}</ref> Outside the United States, excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe.\n\nOnly a few health insurers in the United States, and about half of Medicaid programs,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2003.09.008 |pmid=15241772 |title=Medicaid payment for telerehabilitation |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=1188\u201391 |year=2004 |last1=Palsbo |first1=Susan E }}</ref> [[reimburse]] for telerehabilitation services.

Examples include:\n\nTelemedicine for trauma triage: using telemedicine, trauma specialists can interact with personnel on the scene of a mass casualty or disaster situation, via the internet using mobile devices, to determine the severity of injuries. They can provide clinical assessments and determine whether those injured must be evacuated for necessary care. Remote trauma specialists can provide the same quality of clinical assessment and plan of care as a trauma specialist located physically with the patient.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Collins | first = Hilton | name-list-format = vanc | title = Advanced First Responder and Medical Capabilities Could Save Lives | journal = Emergency Management | date = 28 August 2008 | url = http://www.emergencymgmt.com/disaster/Advanced-First-Responder-and.html}}</ref>\n\nTelemedicine for [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) rounds: Telemedicine is also being used in some trauma ICUs to reduce the spread of infections. Rounds are usually conducted at hospitals across the country by a team of approximately ten or more people to include attending physicians, fellows, residents and other clinicians. This group usually moves from bed to bed in a unit discussing each patient. This aids in the transition of care for patients from the night shift to the morning shift, but also serves as an educational experience for new residents to the team. A new approach features the team conducting rounds from a conference room using a video-conferencing system. The trauma attending, residents, fellows, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are able to watch a live video stream from the patient's bedside. They can see the vital signs on the monitor, view the settings on the respiratory ventilator, and/or view the patient's wounds. Video-conferencing allows the remote viewers two-way communication with clinicians at the bedside.<ref>{{cite web | title = Advanced technologies and wireless telecommunications enhance care and medical training at the Ryder Trauma Center in Miami | publisher = Virtual Medical Worlds | date = 4 December 2008 | url = http://www.hoise.com/vmw/09/articles/vmw/LV-VM-01-09-10.html | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nTelemedicine for trauma education: some trauma centers are delivering trauma education lectures to hospitals and health care providers worldwide using video conferencing technology.

[[Willem Einthoven]], the inventor of the ECG, actually did tests with transmission of ECG via telephone lines. This was because the hospital did not allow him to move patients outside the hospital to his laboratory for testing of his new device. In 1906 Einthoven came up with a way to transmit the data from the hospital directly to his lab.<ref>[http://www.medetel.lu/download/2009/parallel_sessions/presentation/day1/telecardiology_and_tele-ecg_network.pdf Telecardiology].</ref>\nSee above reference-General health care delivery. Remotely treating ventricular fibrillation Medphone Corporation, 1989\n\n==== Teletransmission of ECG using methods indigenous to Asia ====\nOne of the oldest known telecardiology systems for teletransmissions of ECGs was established in Gwalior, India in 1975 at GR Medical college by Ajai Shanker, S. Makhija, P.K. Mantri using an indigenous technique for the first time in India.\n\nThis system enabled wireless transmission of ECG from the moving ICU van or the patients home to the central station in ICU of the department of Medicine. Transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise. Transmission was also done through telephone lines. The ECG output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ECG into high frequency sound. At the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ECG with a good gain accuracy. The ECG was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz with 1500&nbsp;Hz at baseline.\n\nThis system was also used to monitor patients with pacemakers in remote areas. The central control unit at the ICU was able to correctly interpret arrhythmia. This technique helped medical aid reach in remote areas.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shanker A, Makhija S, Mantri PK | title = Teletransmission of ECG Waveform: An Ingenious Low Priced Technique | journal = Indian Heart Journal | year = 1982 | volume = 34 | number = 6}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Stethoscope#Electronic|electronic stethoscopes]] can be used as recording devices, which is helpful for purposes of telecardiology. There are many examples of successful telecardiology services worldwide.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]] three pilot projects in telemedicine was initiated by the Ministry of IT & Telecom, Government of Pakistan (MoIT) through the Electronic Government Directorate in collaboration with Oratier Technologies (a pioneer company within Pakistan dealing with healthcare and HMIS) and PakDataCom (a bandwidth provider). Three hub stations through were linked via the Pak Sat-I communications satellite, and four districts were linked with another hub. A 312 Kb link was also established with remote sites and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth was provided at each hub. Three hubs were established: the Mayo Hospital (the largest hospital in Asia), JPMC Karachi and Holy Family Rawalpindi. These 12 remote sites were connected and on average of 1,500 patients being treated per month per hub. The project was still running smoothly after two years.<ref name=\"83a\">{{cite web|url=http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704102514/http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu  |archive-date=2011-07-04 |url-status=dead |title=Electronic Government Directorate &#124; Pakistan telemedicine |accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Telepsychiatry ===\n{{main|Telepsychiatry}}\n\nTelepsychiatry, another aspect of telemedicine, also utilizes [[videoconferencing]] for patients residing in underserved areas to access psychiatric services.

The most typical implementation are two computers connected via the Internet. The computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes. Sometimes the receiving computer will have a printer so that images can be printed for convenience.\n\nThe teleradiology process begins at the image sending station. The radiographic image and a modem or other connection are required for this first step. The image is scanned and then sent via the network connection to the receiving computer.\n\nToday's high-speed broadband based Internet enables the use of new technologies for teleradiology: the image reviewer can now have access to distant servers in order to view an exam. Therefore, they do not need particular workstations to view the images; a standard [[personal computer]] (PC) and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) connection is enough to reach keosys central server.

A critical limiting factor is the speed, [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and reliability of the communication system between the surgeon and the patient, though trans-Atlantic surgeries have been demonstrated.\n\n===Other specialist care delivery===\nTelemedicine can facilitate specialty care delivered by [[primary care physician]]s according to a controlled study of the treatment of [[hepatitis C]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arora S, Thornton K, Murata G, Deming P, Kalishman S, Dion D, Parish B, Burke T, Pak W, Dunkelberg J, Kistin M, Brown J, Jenkusky S, Komaromy M, Qualls C | display-authors = 6 | title = Outcomes of treatment for hepatitis C virus infection by primary care providers | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 364 | issue = 23 | pages = 2199\u2013207 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21631316 | pmc = 3820419 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1009370 }}</ref> Various specialties are contributing to telemedicine, in varying degrees.\n\n== Major developments ==\n\n=== In policy ===\nTelehealth is a modern form of health care delivery.

Typically, states with restrictive licensure laws also have several exceptions (varying from state to state) that may release an out-of-state practitioner from the additional burden of obtaining such a license. A number of states require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license.\n\nIf a practitioner serves several states, obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and time-consuming proposition. Even if the practitioner never practices medicine face-to-face with a patient in another state, he/she still must meet a variety of other individual state requirements, including paying substantial licensure fees, passing additional oral and written examinations, and traveling for interviews.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. passed the Ryan Haight Act which required face-to-face or valid telemedicine consultations prior to receiving a prescription.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/health/Ryan-Haight-Act-will.html|title=Ryan Haight Act will Require Tighter Restrictions on Internet Pharmacies|website=www.govtech.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[:Category:Medical licensing boards in the United States|State medical licensing boards]] have sometimes opposed telemedicine; for example, in 2012 electronic consultations were illegal in Idaho, and an Idaho-licensed general practitioner was punished by the board for prescribing an antibiotic, triggering reviews of her licensure and board certifications across the country.<ref name=\":0b\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/aug/22/telemedicine-sanction-in-idaho-clouds-doctors/|title=Telemedicine sanction in Idaho clouds doctor's future|website=Spokesman.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2015 the state legislature legalized electronic consultations.<ref name=\":0b\" />\n\nIn 2015, Teladoc filed suit against the [[Texas Medical Board]] over a rule that required in-person consultations initially; the judge refused to dismiss the case, noting that antitrust laws apply to state medical boards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151214/NEWS/151219924|title=Teladoc case against Texas Medical Board will move forward, judge rules|website=Modern Healthcare|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Major implications and impacts ==\nTelehealth allows multiple, varying disciplines to merge and deliver a potentially more uniform level of care, using technology.

Patients who are home-bound and would otherwise require an ambulance to move them to a clinic are also a consideration.\n\n== Limitations and restrictions ==\nWhile many branches of medicine have wanted to fully embrace telehealth for a long time, there are certain risks and barriers which bar the full amalgamation of telehealth into [[best practice]]. For a start, it is dubious as to whether a practitioner can fully leave the \"hands-on\" experience behind.<ref name=\":15\" /> Although it is predicted that telehealth will replace many consultations and other health interactions, it cannot yet fully replace a physical examination, this is particularly so in [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] or [[mental health]].<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe benefits posed by telehealth challenge the normative means of healthcare delivery set in both legislation and practice. Therefore, the growing prominence of telehealth is starting to underscore the need for updated regulations, guidelines and legislation which reflect the current and future trends of healthcare practices.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> Telehealth enables timely and flexible care to patients wherever they may be; although this is a benefit, it also poses threats to [[privacy]], [[safety]][[Medical license|, medical licensing]] and [[reimbursement]]. When a clinician and patient are in different locations, it is difficult to determine which laws apply to the context.<ref name=\"pmid24820794\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keck CS, Doarn CR | title = Telehealth technology applications in speech-language pathology | journal = Telemedicine Journal and E-health | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 653\u20139 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24820794 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2013.0295 }}</ref> Once healthcare crosses borders different state bodies are involved in order to regulate and maintain the level of care that is warranted to the patient or telehealth consumer. As it stands, telehealth is complex with many grey areas when put into practice especially as it crosses borders. This effectively limits the potential benefits of telehealth.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAn example of these limitations include the current American reimbursement infrastructure, where [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will reimburse for telehealth services only when a patient is living in an area where specialists are in shortage, or in particular rural counties. The area is defined by whether it is a medical facility as opposed to a patient's' home. The site that the practitioner is in, however, is unrestricted. Medicare will only reimburse live video (synchronous) type services, not store-and-forward, mhealth or remote patient monitoring (if it does not involve live-video). Some insurers currently will reimburse telehealth, but not all yet. So providers and patients must go to the extra effort of finding the correct insurers before continuing. Again in America, states generally tend to require that clinicians are licensed to practice in the surgery' state, therefore they can only provide their service if licensed in an area that they do not live in themselves.<ref name=\":0b\" />\n\nMore specific and widely reaching laws, legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology. They will have to be fully agreed upon, for example, will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too, or could there be a limited use telehealth licence? Would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions, or only some? Who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help \u2013 would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times? Which state, city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred? <ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":19\">Paul DL.

Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional, and an increased risk that [[protected health information]] may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hjelm NM | title = Benefits and drawbacks of telemedicine | journal = Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 60\u201370 | date = 1 March 2005 | pmid = 15829049 | doi = 10.1258/1357633053499886 }}</ref> There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually decrease time efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions; for example, it has been estimated that a [[teledermatology]] consultation can take up to thirty minutes, whereas fifteen minutes is typical for a traditional consultation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rrh.org.au/publishedarticles/article_print_1581.pdf | title = Barriers to the up-take of telemedicine in Australia \u2013 a view from providers | work = The University of Queensland, School of Medicine | author = JJ Moffatt | date = February 2011}}</ref> Additionally, potentially poor quality of transmitted records, such as images or patient progress reports, and decreased access to relevant clinical information are quality assurance risks that can compromise the quality and continuity of patient care for the reporting doctor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Strehle EM, Shabde N | title = One hundred years of telemedicine: does this new technology have a place in paediatrics? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 91 | issue = 12 | pages = 956\u20139 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17119071 | pmc = 2082971 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2006.099622 }}</ref> Other obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine include unclear legal regulation for some telemedical practices and difficulty claiming reimbursement from insurers or government programs in some fields.<ref name=\"Angaran\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Angaran DM | title = Telemedicine and telepharmacy: current status and future implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 56 | issue = 14 | pages = 1405\u201326 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10428449 | doi = 10.1093/ajhp/56.14.1405 }}</ref>\n\nAnother disadvantage of telemedicine is the inability to start treatment immediately. For example, a patient suffering from a bacterial infection might be given an [[antibiotic]] [[hypodermic injection]] in the clinic, and observed for any reaction, before that antibiotic is prescribed in pill form.\n\nWe must also be wary of equitability. Many families and individuals in the United States do not have internet access in their homes. Not to mention they may lack the necessary equipment to access telehealth services, such as a laptop, tablet, or smart phone.\n\n== Ethical issues ==\n{{see also|Informed consent|Medical ethics}}\n\n''[[Informed consent]]'' is another issue \u2013 should the patient give informed consent to receive online care before it starts? Or will it be implied if it is care that can only practically be given over distance? When telehealth includes the possibility for technical problems such as transmission errors or security breaches or storage which impact on ability to communicate, it may be wise to obtain informed consent in person first, as well as having backup options for when technical issues occur. In person, a patient can see who is involved in their care (namely themselves and their clinician in a consult), but online there will be other involved such as the technology providers, therefore consent may need to involve disclosure of anyone involved in the transmission of the information and the security that will keep their information private, and any legal malpractice cases may need to involve all of those involved as opposed to what would usually just be the practitioner.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref name=\":20\" />\n\n== The state of the market ==\nThe rate of adoption of telehealth services in any jurisdiction is frequently influenced by factors such as the adequacy and cost of existing conventional [[health care|health services]] in meeting [[patient|patient needs]]; the policies of governments and/or insurers with respect to coverage and payment for telehealth services; and medical licensing requirements that may inhibit or deter the provision of telehealth second opinions or primary consultations by physicians.\n\nProjections for the growth of the telehealth market are optimistic, and much of this optimism is predicated upon the increasing demand for remote medical care.   According to a recent survey, nearly three-quarters of U.S. consumers say they would use telehealth.<ref name=\"healthdata\">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/telemedicine-38701-1.html|title=Survey: Consumers Keen on Telemedicine|access-date=2010-04-26}}</ref>  At present, several major companies along with a bevvy of startups are working to develop a leading presence in the field.\n\nIn the UK, the Government's Care Services minister, Paul Burstow, has stated that telehealth and telecare would be extended over the next five years (2012\u20132017) to reach three million people.\n\n===Companies===\nIn the United States, telemedicine companies are collaborating with health insurers and other telemedicine providers to expand marketshare and patient access to telemedicine consultations.

Through a series of studies, there is growing support in the literature showing that remote videoconference-based administration of many standard neuropsychological tests results in test findings that are similar to traditional in-person evaluations, thereby establishing the basis for the reliability and validity of teleneuropsychological assessment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wadsworth HE, Dhima K, Womack KB, Hart J, Weiner MF, Hynan LS, Cullum CM | title = Validity of Teleneuropsychological Assessment in Older Patients with Cognitive Disorders | journal = Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 1040\u20131045 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 29329363 | doi = 10.1093/arclin/acx140 | pmc = 6887729 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wadsworth HE, Galusha-Glasscock JM, Womack KB, Quiceno M, Weiner MF, Hynan LS, Shore J, Cullum CM | display-authors = 6 | title = Remote Neuropsychological Assessment in Rural American Indians with and without Cognitive Impairment | journal = Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 420\u20135 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27246957 | pmc = 4954610 | doi = 10.1093/arclin/acw030 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Galusha-Glasscock JM, Horton DK, Weiner MF, Cullum CM | title = Video Teleconference Administration of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status | journal = Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 8\u201311 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26446834 | pmc = 4718188 | doi = 10.1093/arclin/acv058 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parikh M, Grosch MC, Graham LL, Hynan LS, Weiner M, Shore JH, Cullum CM | title = Consumer acceptability of brief videoconference-based neuropsychological assessment in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment | journal = The Clinical Neuropsychologist | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 808\u201317 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23607729 | pmc = 3692573 | doi = 10.1080/13854046.2013.791723 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grosch MC, Gottlieb MC, Cullum CM | title = Initial practice recommendations for teleneuropsychology | journal = The Clinical Neuropsychologist | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 1119\u201333 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21951075 | doi = 10.1080/13854046.2011.609840 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Munro Cullum C, Hynan LS, Grosch M, Parikh M, Weiner MF | title = Teleneuropsychology: evidence for video teleconference-based neuropsychological assessment | journal = Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society | volume = 20 | issue = 10 | pages = 1028\u201333 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25343269 | pmc = 4410096 | doi = 10.1017/S1355617714000873 }}</ref>\n\n=== Telerehabilitation ===\n{{main|Telerehabilitation}}\n\n'''Telerehabilitation''' (or ''e-rehabilitation''<ref name=\"dl-2005\">{{cite book | year = 2005 | title = E-health care information systems: an introduction for students and professionals | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | isbn = 978-0-7879-6618-8 | page = 219}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url = http://ijahsp.nova.edu/articles/vol2num4/pierce-keaton.htm | title = An E-rehabilitation Team Helps Caregivers Deal with Stroke | publisher = Ijahsp.nova.edu | accessdate = 26 March 2011 | journal = The Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | issn = 1540-580X | author1 = Lisa Keaton | author2 = Linda L.

Most types of services fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), and [[medical therapy|clinical therapy]]. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: [[neuropsychology]], [[speech-language pathology]], [[audiology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]]. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a [[clinic]] because the patient has a [[disability]] or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.\n\nMost telerehabilitation is highly visual. As of 2014, the most commonly used mediums are [[webcam]]s, [[videoconferencing]], [[phone line]]s, [[videophone]]s and webpages containing rich Internet applications. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. It is most widely used for [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]]; fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as [[wheelchair]]s, [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]] or [[artificial limb]]s; and in speech-language pathology. [[Rich internet applications]] for neuropsychological rehabilitation (aka [[cognitive rehabilitation]]) of cognitive impairment (from many etiologies) were first introduced in 2001. This endeavor has expanded as a [[teletherapy]] application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children. [[Tele-audiology]] (hearing assessments) is a growing application. Currently, telerehabilitation in the practice of occupational therapy and physical therapy is limited, perhaps because these two disciplines are more \"hands on\".\n\nTwo important areas of telerehabilitation research are (1) demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to in-person assessment and therapy, and (2) building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice. Ground-breaking research in [[telehaptics]] (the sense of touch) and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice, in the future.\n\nIn the United States, the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]]'s (NIDRR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|title=OSERS|website=www.ed.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011114426/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|archive-date=2003-10-11}}</ref> supports research and the development of telerehabilitation. NIDRR's grantees include the \"Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center\" (RERC) at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC. Other federal funders of research are the [[Veterans Health Administration]], the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense.<ref>{{cite web| last = Hiers| first = Mary | name-list-format = vanc | title = Everything You Need to Know About Telemedicine| url = http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-telemedicine-m0525/| accessdate = 10 July 2014 }}</ref> Outside the United States, excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe.\n\nOnly a few health insurers in the United States, and about half of Medicaid programs,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2003.09.008 |pmid=15241772 |title=Medicaid payment for telerehabilitation |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=1188\u201391 |year=2004 |last1=Palsbo |first1=Susan E }}</ref> [[reimburse]] for telerehabilitation services.

Examples include:\n\nTelemedicine for trauma triage: using telemedicine, trauma specialists can interact with personnel on the scene of a mass casualty or disaster situation, via the internet using mobile devices, to determine the severity of injuries. They can provide clinical assessments and determine whether those injured must be evacuated for necessary care. Remote trauma specialists can provide the same quality of clinical assessment and plan of care as a trauma specialist located physically with the patient.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Collins | first = Hilton | name-list-format = vanc | title = Advanced First Responder and Medical Capabilities Could Save Lives | journal = Emergency Management | date = 28 August 2008 | url = http://www.emergencymgmt.com/disaster/Advanced-First-Responder-and.html}}</ref>\n\nTelemedicine for [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) rounds: Telemedicine is also being used in some trauma ICUs to reduce the spread of infections. Rounds are usually conducted at hospitals across the country by a team of approximately ten or more people to include attending physicians, fellows, residents and other clinicians. This group usually moves from bed to bed in a unit discussing each patient. This aids in the transition of care for patients from the night shift to the morning shift, but also serves as an educational experience for new residents to the team. A new approach features the team conducting rounds from a conference room using a video-conferencing system. The trauma attending, residents, fellows, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are able to watch a live video stream from the patient's bedside. They can see the vital signs on the monitor, view the settings on the respiratory ventilator, and/or view the patient's wounds. Video-conferencing allows the remote viewers two-way communication with clinicians at the bedside.<ref>{{cite web | title = Advanced technologies and wireless telecommunications enhance care and medical training at the Ryder Trauma Center in Miami | publisher = Virtual Medical Worlds | date = 4 December 2008 | url = http://www.hoise.com/vmw/09/articles/vmw/LV-VM-01-09-10.html | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nTelemedicine for trauma education: some trauma centers are delivering trauma education lectures to hospitals and health care providers worldwide using video conferencing technology.

This capability allows the attending to view the residents in real time. The remote surgeon has the capability to control the camera (pan, tilt and zoom) to get the best angle of the procedure while at the same time providing expertise in order to provide the best possible care to the patient.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gonzalez | first = Diana | name-list-format = vanc | title = UM Doctors Use Telemedicine to Continue Care In Iraq | publisher =  | date = 10 November 2011 | url = http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/UM-Doctors-Use-Tele-133650778.html | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Telecardiology ===\nECGs, or [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiographs]], can be transmitted using telephone and wireless. [[Willem Einthoven]], the inventor of the ECG, actually did tests with transmission of ECG via telephone lines. This was because the hospital did not allow him to move patients outside the hospital to his laboratory for testing of his new device. In 1906 Einthoven came up with a way to transmit the data from the hospital directly to his lab.<ref>[http://www.medetel.lu/download/2009/parallel_sessions/presentation/day1/telecardiology_and_tele-ecg_network.pdf Telecardiology].</ref>\nSee above reference-General health care delivery. Remotely treating ventricular fibrillation Medphone Corporation, 1989\n\n==== Teletransmission of ECG using methods indigenous to Asia ====\nOne of the oldest known telecardiology systems for teletransmissions of ECGs was established in Gwalior, India in 1975 at GR Medical college by Ajai Shanker, S. Makhija, P.K. Mantri using an indigenous technique for the first time in India.\n\nThis system enabled wireless transmission of ECG from the moving ICU van or the patients home to the central station in ICU of the department of Medicine. Transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise. Transmission was also done through telephone lines. The ECG output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ECG into high frequency sound. At the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ECG with a good gain accuracy. The ECG was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz with 1500&nbsp;Hz at baseline.\n\nThis system was also used to monitor patients with pacemakers in remote areas. The central control unit at the ICU was able to correctly interpret arrhythmia. This technique helped medical aid reach in remote areas.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shanker A, Makhija S, Mantri PK | title = Teletransmission of ECG Waveform: An Ingenious Low Priced Technique | journal = Indian Heart Journal | year = 1982 | volume = 34 | number = 6}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Stethoscope#Electronic|electronic stethoscopes]] can be used as recording devices, which is helpful for purposes of telecardiology. There are many examples of successful telecardiology services worldwide.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]] three pilot projects in telemedicine was initiated by the Ministry of IT & Telecom, Government of Pakistan (MoIT) through the Electronic Government Directorate in collaboration with Oratier Technologies (a pioneer company within Pakistan dealing with healthcare and HMIS) and PakDataCom (a bandwidth provider). Three hub stations through were linked via the Pak Sat-I communications satellite, and four districts were linked with another hub. A 312 Kb link was also established with remote sites and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth was provided at each hub. Three hubs were established: the Mayo Hospital (the largest hospital in Asia), JPMC Karachi and Holy Family Rawalpindi. These 12 remote sites were connected and on average of 1,500 patients being treated per month per hub. The project was still running smoothly after two years.<ref name=\"83a\">{{cite web|url=http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704102514/http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu  |archive-date=2011-07-04 |url-status=dead |title=Electronic Government Directorate &#124; Pakistan telemedicine |accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Telepsychiatry ===\n{{main|Telepsychiatry}}\n\nTelepsychiatry, another aspect of telemedicine, also utilizes [[videoconferencing]] for patients residing in underserved areas to access psychiatric services. It offers wide range of services to the patients and providers, such as consultation between the psychiatrists, educational clinical programs, diagnosis and assessment, medication therapy management, and routine follow-up meetings.<ref>{{cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Jan | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/fashion/therapists-are-seeing-patients-online.html?_r=1 | title = When Your Therapist Is Only a Click Away | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 25 September 2011 | page = ST1}}</ref> Most telepsychiatry is undertaken in real time (synchronous) although in recent years research at UC Davis has developed and validated the process of asynchronous telepsychiatry.<ref>{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8_5hCF2q6I|accessdate = 2015-11-14|title= Telepsychiatry Research by Peter Yellowlees}}</ref> Recent reviews of the literature by Hilty et al. in 2013, and by Yellowlees et al. in 2015 confirmed that telepsychiatry is as effective as in-person psychiatric consultations for diagnostic assessment, is at least as good for the treatment of disorders such as depression and post traumatic stress disorder, and may be better than in-person treatment in some groups of patients, notably children, veterans and individuals with agoraphobia.\n\nAs of 2011, the following are some of the model programs and projects which are deploying telepsychiatry in rural areas in the United States:\n# [[University of Colorado Denver#University of Colorado Health Sciences Center|University of Colorado Health Sciences Center]] (UCHSC) supports two programs for American Indian and Alaskan Native populations\n::a.

In the United States, Skype, Gchat, Yahoo, and MSN are not permitted to conduct video-conferencing services unless these companies sign a Business Associate Agreement stating that their employees are HIPAA trained. For this reason, most companies provide their own specialized videotelephony services. Violating HIPAA in the United States can result in penalties of hundreds of thousands of dollars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hipaajournal.com/what-are-the-penalties-for-hipaa-violations-7096/|title=What are the Penalties for HIPAA Violations?|date=2015-06-24|work=HIPAA Journal|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\nThe momentum of telemental health and telepsychiatry is growing.

The most typical implementation are two computers connected via the Internet. The computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes. Sometimes the receiving computer will have a printer so that images can be printed for convenience.\n\nThe teleradiology process begins at the image sending station. The radiographic image and a modem or other connection are required for this first step. The image is scanned and then sent via the network connection to the receiving computer.\n\nToday's high-speed broadband based Internet enables the use of new technologies for teleradiology: the image reviewer can now have access to distant servers in order to view an exam. Therefore, they do not need particular workstations to view the images; a standard [[personal computer]] (PC) and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) connection is enough to reach keosys central server.

It is a form of [[telepresence]]. Remote surgery combines elements of [[robot]]ics, cutting edge [[telecommunication|communication technology]] such as high-speed data connections, [[telehaptics|haptics]] and elements of [[management information system]]s. While the field of [[robotic surgery]] is fairly well established, most of these robots are controlled by surgeons at the location of the surgery.\n\nRemote surgery is essentially advanced [[telecommuting]] for surgeons, where the physical distance between the surgeon and the patient is immaterial. It promises to allow the expertise of specialized surgeons to be available to patients worldwide, without the need for patients to travel beyond their local hospital.<ref>[http://www.intersurgtech.com/media.html IST's Media Collection], Interface Surgical Technologies website. Retrieved 21 August 2011.</ref>\n\n[[Remote surgery]] or telesurgery is performance of surgical procedures where the surgeon is not physically in the same location as the patient, using a robotic [[teleoperator]] system controlled by the surgeon. The remote operator may give tactile feedback to the user. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics and high-speed data connections. A critical limiting factor is the speed, [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and reliability of the communication system between the surgeon and the patient, though trans-Atlantic surgeries have been demonstrated.\n\n===Other specialist care delivery===\nTelemedicine can facilitate specialty care delivered by [[primary care physician]]s according to a controlled study of the treatment of [[hepatitis C]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arora S, Thornton K, Murata G, Deming P, Kalishman S, Dion D, Parish B, Burke T, Pak W, Dunkelberg J, Kistin M, Brown J, Jenkusky S, Komaromy M, Qualls C | display-authors = 6 | title = Outcomes of treatment for hepatitis C virus infection by primary care providers | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 364 | issue = 23 | pages = 2199\u2013207 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21631316 | pmc = 3820419 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1009370 }}</ref> Various specialties are contributing to telemedicine, in varying degrees.\n\n== Major developments ==\n\n=== In policy ===\nTelehealth is a modern form of health care delivery.

Typically, states with restrictive licensure laws also have several exceptions (varying from state to state) that may release an out-of-state practitioner from the additional burden of obtaining such a license. A number of states require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license.\n\nIf a practitioner serves several states, obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and time-consuming proposition. Even if the practitioner never practices medicine face-to-face with a patient in another state, he/she still must meet a variety of other individual state requirements, including paying substantial licensure fees, passing additional oral and written examinations, and traveling for interviews.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. passed the Ryan Haight Act which required face-to-face or valid telemedicine consultations prior to receiving a prescription.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/health/Ryan-Haight-Act-will.html|title=Ryan Haight Act will Require Tighter Restrictions on Internet Pharmacies|website=www.govtech.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[:Category:Medical licensing boards in the United States|State medical licensing boards]] have sometimes opposed telemedicine; for example, in 2012 electronic consultations were illegal in Idaho, and an Idaho-licensed general practitioner was punished by the board for prescribing an antibiotic, triggering reviews of her licensure and board certifications across the country.<ref name=\":0b\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/aug/22/telemedicine-sanction-in-idaho-clouds-doctors/|title=Telemedicine sanction in Idaho clouds doctor's future|website=Spokesman.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2015 the state legislature legalized electronic consultations.<ref name=\":0b\" />\n\nIn 2015, Teladoc filed suit against the [[Texas Medical Board]] over a rule that required in-person consultations initially; the judge refused to dismiss the case, noting that antitrust laws apply to state medical boards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151214/NEWS/151219924|title=Teladoc case against Texas Medical Board will move forward, judge rules|website=Modern Healthcare|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Major implications and impacts ==\nTelehealth allows multiple, varying disciplines to merge and deliver a potentially more uniform level of care, using technology.

This is particularly an issue where [[MRSA]] is a concern. Additionally, some patients who feel uncomfortable in a doctors office may do better remotely. For example, [[white coat syndrome]] may be avoided. Patients who are home-bound and would otherwise require an ambulance to move them to a clinic are also a consideration.\n\n== Limitations and restrictions ==\nWhile many branches of medicine have wanted to fully embrace telehealth for a long time, there are certain risks and barriers which bar the full amalgamation of telehealth into [[best practice]]. For a start, it is dubious as to whether a practitioner can fully leave the \"hands-on\" experience behind.<ref name=\":15\" /> Although it is predicted that telehealth will replace many consultations and other health interactions, it cannot yet fully replace a physical examination, this is particularly so in [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] or [[mental health]].<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe benefits posed by telehealth challenge the normative means of healthcare delivery set in both legislation and practice. Therefore, the growing prominence of telehealth is starting to underscore the need for updated regulations, guidelines and legislation which reflect the current and future trends of healthcare practices.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> Telehealth enables timely and flexible care to patients wherever they may be; although this is a benefit, it also poses threats to [[privacy]], [[safety]][[Medical license|, medical licensing]] and [[reimbursement]]. When a clinician and patient are in different locations, it is difficult to determine which laws apply to the context.<ref name=\"pmid24820794\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keck CS, Doarn CR | title = Telehealth technology applications in speech-language pathology | journal = Telemedicine Journal and E-health | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 653\u20139 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24820794 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2013.0295 }}</ref> Once healthcare crosses borders different state bodies are involved in order to regulate and maintain the level of care that is warranted to the patient or telehealth consumer. As it stands, telehealth is complex with many grey areas when put into practice especially as it crosses borders. This effectively limits the potential benefits of telehealth.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAn example of these limitations include the current American reimbursement infrastructure, where [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will reimburse for telehealth services only when a patient is living in an area where specialists are in shortage, or in particular rural counties. The area is defined by whether it is a medical facility as opposed to a patient's' home. The site that the practitioner is in, however, is unrestricted. Medicare will only reimburse live video (synchronous) type services, not store-and-forward, mhealth or remote patient monitoring (if it does not involve live-video). Some insurers currently will reimburse telehealth, but not all yet. So providers and patients must go to the extra effort of finding the correct insurers before continuing. Again in America, states generally tend to require that clinicians are licensed to practice in the surgery' state, therefore they can only provide their service if licensed in an area that they do not live in themselves.<ref name=\":0b\" />\n\nMore specific and widely reaching laws, legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology. They will have to be fully agreed upon, for example, will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too, or could there be a limited use telehealth licence? Would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions, or only some? Who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help \u2013 would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times? Which state, city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred? <ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":19\">Paul DL. Collaborative activities in virtual settings: A knowledge management perspective of telemedicine. J Manage Inf Syst 2006;22(4):143-176.</ref>\n\nA major legal action prompt in telehealth thus far has been issues surrounding online prescribing and whether an appropriate clinician-patient relationship can be established online to make prescribing safe, making this an area that requires particular scrutiny.<ref name=\":14\" /> It may be required that the practitioner and patient involved must meet in person at least once before online prescribing can occur, or that at least a live-video conference must occur, not just impersonal questionnaires or surveys to determine need.<ref name=\":20\">{{cite book | vauthors = Cascella LM | title = Virtual Risk: An Overview of Telehealth From a Risk Management Perspective | date = 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe downsides of telemedicine include the cost of telecommunication and data management equipment and of technical training for medical personnel who will employ it. Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional, and an increased risk that [[protected health information]] may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hjelm NM | title = Benefits and drawbacks of telemedicine | journal = Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 60\u201370 | date = 1 March 2005 | pmid = 15829049 | doi = 10.1258/1357633053499886 }}</ref> There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually decrease time efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions; for example, it has been estimated that a [[teledermatology]] consultation can take up to thirty minutes, whereas fifteen minutes is typical for a traditional consultation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rrh.org.au/publishedarticles/article_print_1581.pdf | title = Barriers to the up-take of telemedicine in Australia \u2013 a view from providers | work = The University of Queensland, School of Medicine | author = JJ Moffatt | date = February 2011}}</ref> Additionally, potentially poor quality of transmitted records, such as images or patient progress reports, and decreased access to relevant clinical information are quality assurance risks that can compromise the quality and continuity of patient care for the reporting doctor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Strehle EM, Shabde N | title = One hundred years of telemedicine: does this new technology have a place in paediatrics? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 91 | issue = 12 | pages = 956\u20139 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17119071 | pmc = 2082971 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2006.099622 }}</ref> Other obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine include unclear legal regulation for some telemedical practices and difficulty claiming reimbursement from insurers or government programs in some fields.<ref name=\"Angaran\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Angaran DM | title = Telemedicine and telepharmacy: current status and future implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 56 | issue = 14 | pages = 1405\u201326 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10428449 | doi = 10.1093/ajhp/56.14.1405 }}</ref>\n\nAnother disadvantage of telemedicine is the inability to start treatment immediately. For example, a patient suffering from a bacterial infection might be given an [[antibiotic]] [[hypodermic injection]] in the clinic, and observed for any reaction, before that antibiotic is prescribed in pill form.\n\nWe must also be wary of equitability. Many families and individuals in the United States do not have internet access in their homes. Not to mention they may lack the necessary equipment to access telehealth services, such as a laptop, tablet, or smart phone.\n\n== Ethical issues ==\n{{see also|Informed consent|Medical ethics}}\n\n''[[Informed consent]]'' is another issue \u2013 should the patient give informed consent to receive online care before it starts? Or will it be implied if it is care that can only practically be given over distance? When telehealth includes the possibility for technical problems such as transmission errors or security breaches or storage which impact on ability to communicate, it may be wise to obtain informed consent in person first, as well as having backup options for when technical issues occur. In person, a patient can see who is involved in their care (namely themselves and their clinician in a consult), but online there will be other involved such as the technology providers, therefore consent may need to involve disclosure of anyone involved in the transmission of the information and the security that will keep their information private, and any legal malpractice cases may need to involve all of those involved as opposed to what would usually just be the practitioner.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref name=\":20\" />\n\n== The state of the market ==\nThe rate of adoption of telehealth services in any jurisdiction is frequently influenced by factors such as the adequacy and cost of existing conventional [[health care|health services]] in meeting [[patient|patient needs]]; the policies of governments and/or insurers with respect to coverage and payment for telehealth services; and medical licensing requirements that may inhibit or deter the provision of telehealth second opinions or primary consultations by physicians.\n\nProjections for the growth of the telehealth market are optimistic, and much of this optimism is predicated upon the increasing demand for remote medical care.   According to a recent survey, nearly three-quarters of U.S. consumers say they would use telehealth.<ref name=\"healthdata\">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/telemedicine-38701-1.html|title=Survey: Consumers Keen on Telemedicine|access-date=2010-04-26}}</ref>  At present, several major companies along with a bevvy of startups are working to develop a leading presence in the field.\n\nIn the UK, the Government's Care Services minister, Paul Burstow, has stated that telehealth and telecare would be extended over the next five years (2012\u20132017) to reach three million people.\n\n===Companies===\nIn the United States, telemedicine companies are collaborating with health insurers and other telemedicine providers to expand marketshare and patient access to telemedicine consultations.
