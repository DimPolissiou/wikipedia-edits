He played for several clubs throughout his career, including [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] (1988\u20131994), [[UC Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] (2002\u201303) and [[Piacenza Calcio|Piacenza]] (2003). He achieved notable success with Torino early in his career, after achieving [[1990\u201391 Serie A|Serie A]] promotion by winning the [[1989\u201390 Serie B]] title with the club. He later won the [[Mitropa Cup]] in 1991, the [[Coppa Italia]] in 1993, and he helped his team to the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup]] final, after helping his team to qualify for the tournament by leading them to a third place in Serie A in 1991. In the [[1992 UEFA Cup Final]], they were defeated by [[Ajax F.C.|Ajax]] on aggregate.<ref name=\"L'alfabeto di Sandro Cois\"/>\n\nCois is perhaps best known for his spell at [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] (1994\u20132002) in the mid-late 90s where he won over the fans with his tireless running and tenacious play, becoming important to the side as the less glamorous foil to playmakers like [[Rui Costa]] and [[Domenico Morfeo]]. With the club he won two [[Coppa Italia]] trophies in 1996 and 2001, and a [[Supercoppa Italiana]] in 1996, also helping Fiorentina to two third-place finishes in [[Serie A]] in [[1995\u201396 Serie A|1996]] and [[1998\u201399 Serie A|1999]].<ref name=\"L'alfabeto di Sandro Cois\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/11/08/fiorentina-linea-verde.html|title=FIORENTINA LINEA VERDE|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|date=8 November 1994|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nIt was during his period with Fiorentina in the late 90s that Cois broke into the [[Italy national football team]]. He was a participant at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], although he never became a regular in the side, winning just 3 caps between 1998 and 1999, one of which was in an unofficial match against the [[FIFA]] World Stars, also failing to make an appearance at the 1998 World Cup.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1013/teams/team=43954.html 1998 FIFA World Cup: Italy Squad] ''[[FIFA]]''.

These include the [[False-consensus effect|false consensus effect]], [[Actor\u2013observer asymmetry|actor-observer bias]], [[bias blind spot]], and [[fundamental attribution error]], among others.\n\nThe term, as it is used in [[psychology]] today, was coined by [[social psychologist]] [[Lee Ross]] and his colleagues in the 1990s.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\">Griffin, D., & Ross, L.

They argue that these assumptions are supported by a long line of thinking in social psychology, along with several empirical studies. According to their model, people:\n* Believe that they see the world objectively and without bias.\n* Expect that others will come to the same conclusions, so long as they are exposed to the same information and interpret it in a rational manner.\n* Assume that others who do not share the same views must be ignorant, irrational, or biased.<ref name=\":1\">Ross, L., & Ward, A.

Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref>\n\n== History of the concept ==\nNa\u00efve realism follows from a [[Subjectivism|subjectivist]] tradition in modern [[social psychology]], which traces its roots back to one of the field's founders, a German-American psychologist named [[Kurt Lewin]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.68.3.404|title=Actual versus assumed differences in construal: 'Naive realism' in intergroup perception and conflict|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=68|issue=3|pages=404\u2013417|year=1995|last1=Robinson|first1=Robert J.|last2=Keltner|first2=Dacher|last3=Ward|first3=Andrew|last4=Ross|first4=Lee|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8546fcb2d5a8caa4803c81a7811c8d9994b3b33b}}</ref> Lewin's ideas were strongly informed by [[Gestalt psychology]], a 20th-century school of thought which focused on examining psychological phenomena in context, as parts of a whole.<ref>Gestalt psychology.&nbsp;(2015). In&nbsp;''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/science/Gestalt-psychology</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s through the 1940s, Lewin developed an approach for studying human behavior which he called [[Field theory (psychology)|field theory]].<ref>\"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000409.html \"Field Theory]\".&nbsp;International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 1968.

For example, [[Jean Piaget]], a [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]], argued that children view the world through an [[Egocentric bias|egocentric]] lens, and they have trouble separating their own beliefs from the beliefs of others.<ref>Piaget, J. (1926) ''The Language and Thought of the Child''. New York: Harcourt, Brace.</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, early pioneers in [[social psychology]] applied the [[Subjectivism|subjectivist]] view to the field of [[social perception]]. In 1948, psychologists David Kretch and Richard Krutchfield argued that people perceive and interpret the world according to their \"own needs, own connotations, own personality, own previously formed cognitive patterns\".<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\">Molouki, S., & Pronin, E.

S.}}</ref>\n\nSocial psychologist [[:de:Gustav Ichheiser|Gustav Ichheiser]] expanded on this idea, noting how biases in [[person perception]] lead to misunderstandings in [[social relation]]s. According to Ichheiser, \"We tend to resolve our perplexity arising out of the experience that other people see the world differently than we see it ourselves by declaring that these others, in consequence of some basic intellectual and moral defect, are unable to see things 'as they really are' and to react to them 'in a normal way'. We thus imply, of course, that things are in fact as we see them, and that our ways are the normal ways.\"<ref>Ichheiser, G.

''American Journal of Sociology'', Supplement to the September issue, pp. 1\u201372.</ref>\n\n[[Solomon Asch]], a prominent [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] who was also brought up in the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] tradition, argued that people disagree because they base their judgments on different [[construals]], or ways of looking at various issues.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00224545.1940.9921487|title=Studies in the Principles of Judgments and Attitudes: II.

E.}}</ref> However, they are under the illusion that their judgments about the social world are objective. \"This attitude, which has been aptly described as naive realism, sees no problem in the fact of perception or knowledge of the surroundings. Things are what they appear to be; they have just the qualities that they reveal to sight and touch,\" he wrote in his textbook ''Social Psychology'' in 1952. \"This attitude, does not, however, describe the actual conditions of our knowledge of the surroundings.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Social Psychology|last = Asch|first = Solomon|publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc.|year = 1952|isbn = |location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages = 46\u201347}}</ref>\n\n== Experimental evidence ==\n\n=== \"They saw a game\" ===\nIn a seminal study in [[social psychology]], which was published in a paper in 1954, students from [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] watched a video of a heated football game between the two schools.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = They saw a game; a case study|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|pages = 129\u2013134|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/h0057880|pmid = 13128974|first = Albert H.|last = Hastorf|first2 = Hadley|last2 = Cantril|year = 1954|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6352fef59f72ce488afe481a6989011a7616d9e0}}</ref> Though they looked at the same footage, fans from both schools perceived the game very differently. The Princeton students \"saw\" the Dartmouth team make twice as many infractions as their own team, and they also saw the team make twice as many infractions compared to what the Dartmouth students saw. Dartmouth students viewed the game as being evenly-matched in violence, in which both sides were to blame. This study revealed that two groups perceived an event [[Subjectivity|subjectively]]. Each team believed they saw the event objectively and that the other side's [[perception]] of the event was blinded by [[bias]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== False consensus effect ===\nA 1977 study conducted by [[Lee Ross|Ross]] and colleagues provided early evidence for a [[cognitive bias]] called the [[False-consensus effect|false consensus effect]], which is the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others share the same views.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The \"false consensus effect\": An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|pages = 279\u2013301|volume = 13|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(77)90049-x|first = Lee|last = Ross|first2 = David|last2 = Greene|first3 = Pamela|last3 = House|year = 1977}}</ref> This bias has been cited as supporting the first two tenets of na\u00efve realism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> In the study, students were asked whether they would wear a sandwich-board sign, which said \"Eat At Joe's\" on it, around campus. Then they were asked to indicate whether they thought other students were likely to wear the sign, and what they thought about students who were either willing to wear it or not. The researchers found that students who agreed to wear the sign thought that the majority of students would wear the sign, and they thought that refusing to wear the sign was more revealing of their peers' personal attributes. Conversely, students who declined to wear the sign thought that most other students would also refuse, and that accepting the invitation was more revealing of certain personality traits.\n\n=== Hostile media effect ===\nA phenomenon referred to as the [[hostile media effect]] demonstrates that partisans can view neutral events [[Subjectivity|subjectively]] according to their own needs and values, and make the assumption that those who interpret the event differently are biased. For a study in 1985, pro-Israeli and pro-Arab students were asked to watch real news coverage on the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], a massive killing of Palestinian refugees (Vallone, Lee Ross and Lepper, 1985).<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title = The hostile media phenomenon: Biased perception and perceptions of media bias in coverage of the Beirut massacre|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 577\u2013585|volume = 49|issue = 3|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.49.3.577|pmid = 4045697|first = Robert P.|last = Vallone|first2 = Lee|last2 = Ross|first3 = Mark R.|last3 = Lepper|year = 1985|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c0478a2bbf2c9ced2fcfaa894c9a464fd586d95}}</ref> Researchers found that partisans from both sides perceived the coverage as being biased in favor of the opposite viewpoint, and believed that the people in charge of the news program held the ideological views of the opposite side.\n\n=== \"Musical tapping\" study ===\nMore empirical evidence for na\u00efve realism came from psychologist Elizabeth Newton's \"musical tapping study\" in 1990. For the study, participants were designated either as \"tappers\" or as \"listeners\". The tappers were told to tap out the rhythm of a well-known song, while the \"listeners\" were asked to try to identify the song. While tappers expected that listeners would guess the tune around 50 percent of the time, the listeners were able to identify it only around 2.5 percent of the time. This provided support for a failure in [[perspective-taking]] on the side of the tappers, and an overestimation of the extent to which others would share in \"hearing\" the song as it was tapped.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Wall Street Game ===\nIn 2004, [[Lee Ross|Ross]], Liberman, and Samuels asked dorm resident advisors to nominate students to participate in a study, and to indicate whether those students were likely to cooperate or defect in the first round of the classic decision-making game called the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma]]. The game was introduced to subjects in one of two ways: it was either referred to as the \"Wall Street Game\" or as the \"Community Game\". The researchers found that students in the \"Community Game\" condition were twice as likely to cooperate, and that it did not seem to make a difference whether students were previously categorized as \"cooperators\" versus \"defectors\". This experiment demonstrated that the game's label exerted more power on how the students played the game than the subjects' personality traits. Furthermore, the study showed that the dorm advisors did not make sufficient allowances for [[Subjectivity|subjective]] interpretations of the game.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Consequences ==\nNa\u00efve realism causes people to exaggerate differences between themselves and others. Psychologists believe that it can spark and exacerbate conflict, as well as create barriers to [[negotiation]] through several different mechanisms.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Bias blind spot ===\nOne consequence of na\u00efve realism is referred to as the [[bias blind spot]], which is the ability to recognize [[Cognitive bias|cognitive]] and [[motivation]]al biases in others while failing to recognize the impact of bias on the self. In a study conducted by Pronin, Lin, and Ross (2002), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] students completed a questionnaire about various biases in social judgment.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Bias Blind Spot: Perceptions of Bias in Self Versus Others|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2002|pages = 369\u2013381|volume = 28|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0146167202286008|first = Emily|last = Pronin|first2 = Daniel Y.|last2 = Lin|first3 = Lee|last3 = Ross|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ec43fd940dcc9fc7fef2a3d6c4eeaba2fff0455}}</ref> They indicated how susceptible they thought they were to these biases compared to the average student. The researchers found that the participants consistently believed that they were less likely to be biased than their peers. In a follow-up study, students answered questions about their personal attributes (e.g. how considerate they were) compared to those of other students. The majority of students saw themselves as falling above average on most traits, which provided support for a [[cognitive bias]] known as the [[better-than-average effect]]. Next, the students learned that 70 to 80 percent of people fall prey to this bias. When asked about the accuracy of their self-assessments, 63 percent of the students argued that their ratings had been objective, while 13 percent of students indicated they thought their ratings had been too modest.<ref>Moskowitz, G.B.&nbsp;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22naive%20realism%22&f=false Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others]''.

The individual either has been exposed to a different set of information, is lazy or unable to come to a rational conclusion, or is under a distorting influence such as bias or self-interest.<ref name=\":1\" /> This gives rise to a phenomenon called false polarization, which involves interpreting others' views as more extreme than they really are, and leads to a perception of greater [[Intergroup bias|intergroup]] differences (see Fig. 1).<ref name=\":3\" /> People assume that they perceive the issue objectively, carefully considering it from multiple views, while the other side processes information in [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down fashion]].<ref name=\":4\">Pronin, E., Puccio, C.

Wilson (Eds.).&nbsp;''Barriers to Conflict Resolution''. New York: WW Norton & Co.</ref> One group of participants was told that the proposal was made by American President [[Ronald Reagan]], while others thought the proposal came from Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The researchers found that 90 percent of the participants who thought the proposal was from Reagan supported it, while only 44 percent in the Gorbachev group indicated their support. This provided support for a phenomenon called [[reactive devaluation]], which involves dismissing a concession from an adversary on the assumption that the concession is either motivated by self-interest or less valuable.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Psychology|Philosophy}}\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n* [[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution theory]]\n* [[Na\u00efve cynicism]]\n* [[Depressive realism]]\n* [[Egocentric bias]]\n* [[False-consensus effect]] \n* [[Bias blind spot]]\n* [[Curse of knowledge]]\n* [[Hindsight bias]]\n* [[Hostile media effect]]\n* [[Attitude polarization]]\n* [[Reactive devaluation]]\n* [[Fundamental attribution error]]\n* [[Empathy gap]]\n* [[Confirmation bias]]\n* [[Theory of mind]]\n* [[False-belief task]]\n* [[Spotlight effect]]\n* [[Actor-observer asymmetry|Actor-observer bias]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Ross, L., & Ward, A.

They argue that these assumptions are supported by a long line of thinking in social psychology, along with several empirical studies. According to their model, people:\n* Believe that they see the world objectively and without bias.\n* Expect that others will come to the same conclusions, so long as they are exposed to the same information and interpret it in a rational manner.\n* Assume that others who do not share the same views must be ignorant, irrational, or biased.<ref name=\":1\">Ross, L., & Ward, A.

In&nbsp;''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/science/Gestalt-psychology</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s through the 1940s, Lewin developed an approach for studying human behavior which he called [[Field theory (psychology)|field theory]].<ref>\"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000409.html \"Field Theory]\".&nbsp;International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 1968.

For example, [[Jean Piaget]], a [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]], argued that children view the world through an [[Egocentric bias|egocentric]] lens, and they have trouble separating their own beliefs from the beliefs of others.<ref>Piaget, J. (1926) ''The Language and Thought of the Child''. New York: Harcourt, Brace.</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, early pioneers in [[social psychology]] applied the [[Subjectivism|subjectivist]] view to the field of [[social perception]]. In 1948, psychologists David Kretch and Richard Krutchfield argued that people perceive and interpret the world according to their \"own needs, own connotations, own personality, own previously formed cognitive patterns\".<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\">Molouki, S., & Pronin, E.

S.}}</ref>\n\nSocial psychologist [[:de:Gustav Ichheiser|Gustav Ichheiser]] expanded on this idea, noting how biases in [[person perception]] lead to misunderstandings in [[social relation]]s. According to Ichheiser, \"We tend to resolve our perplexity arising out of the experience that other people see the world differently than we see it ourselves by declaring that these others, in consequence of some basic intellectual and moral defect, are unable to see things 'as they really are' and to react to them 'in a normal way'. We thus imply, of course, that things are in fact as we see them, and that our ways are the normal ways.\"<ref>Ichheiser, G.

''American Journal of Sociology'', Supplement to the September issue, pp. 1\u201372.</ref>\n\n[[Solomon Asch]], a prominent [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] who was also brought up in the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] tradition, argued that people disagree because they base their judgments on different [[construals]], or ways of looking at various issues.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00224545.1940.9921487|title=Studies in the Principles of Judgments and Attitudes: II.

E.}}</ref> However, they are under the illusion that their judgments about the social world are objective. \"This attitude, which has been aptly described as naive realism, sees no problem in the fact of perception or knowledge of the surroundings. Things are what they appear to be; they have just the qualities that they reveal to sight and touch,\" he wrote in his textbook ''Social Psychology'' in 1952. \"This attitude, does not, however, describe the actual conditions of our knowledge of the surroundings.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Social Psychology|last = Asch|first = Solomon|publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc.|year = 1952|isbn = |location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages = 46\u201347}}</ref>\n\n== Experimental evidence ==\n\n=== \"They saw a game\" ===\nIn a seminal study in [[social psychology]], which was published in a paper in 1954, students from [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] watched a video of a heated football game between the two schools.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = They saw a game; a case study|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|pages = 129\u2013134|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/h0057880|pmid = 13128974|first = Albert H.|last = Hastorf|first2 = Hadley|last2 = Cantril|year = 1954|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6352fef59f72ce488afe481a6989011a7616d9e0}}</ref> Though they looked at the same footage, fans from both schools perceived the game very differently. The Princeton students \"saw\" the Dartmouth team make twice as many infractions as their own team, and they also saw the team make twice as many infractions compared to what the Dartmouth students saw. Dartmouth students viewed the game as being evenly-matched in violence, in which both sides were to blame. This study revealed that two groups perceived an event [[Subjectivity|subjectively]]. Each team believed they saw the event objectively and that the other side's [[perception]] of the event was blinded by [[bias]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== False consensus effect ===\nA 1977 study conducted by [[Lee Ross|Ross]] and colleagues provided early evidence for a [[cognitive bias]] called the [[False-consensus effect|false consensus effect]], which is the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others share the same views.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The \"false consensus effect\": An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|pages = 279\u2013301|volume = 13|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(77)90049-x|first = Lee|last = Ross|first2 = David|last2 = Greene|first3 = Pamela|last3 = House|year = 1977}}</ref> This bias has been cited as supporting the first two tenets of na\u00efve realism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> In the study, students were asked whether they would wear a sandwich-board sign, which said \"Eat At Joe's\" on it, around campus. Then they were asked to indicate whether they thought other students were likely to wear the sign, and what they thought about students who were either willing to wear it or not. The researchers found that students who agreed to wear the sign thought that the majority of students would wear the sign, and they thought that refusing to wear the sign was more revealing of their peers' personal attributes. Conversely, students who declined to wear the sign thought that most other students would also refuse, and that accepting the invitation was more revealing of certain personality traits.\n\n=== Hostile media effect ===\nA phenomenon referred to as the [[hostile media effect]] demonstrates that partisans can view neutral events [[Subjectivity|subjectively]] according to their own needs and values, and make the assumption that those who interpret the event differently are biased. For a study in 1985, pro-Israeli and pro-Arab students were asked to watch real news coverage on the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], a massive killing of Palestinian refugees (Vallone, Lee Ross and Lepper, 1985).<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title = The hostile media phenomenon: Biased perception and perceptions of media bias in coverage of the Beirut massacre|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 577\u2013585|volume = 49|issue = 3|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.49.3.577|pmid = 4045697|first = Robert P.|last = Vallone|first2 = Lee|last2 = Ross|first3 = Mark R.|last3 = Lepper|year = 1985|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c0478a2bbf2c9ced2fcfaa894c9a464fd586d95}}</ref> Researchers found that partisans from both sides perceived the coverage as being biased in favor of the opposite viewpoint, and believed that the people in charge of the news program held the ideological views of the opposite side.\n\n=== \"Musical tapping\" study ===\nMore empirical evidence for na\u00efve realism came from psychologist Elizabeth Newton's \"musical tapping study\" in 1990. For the study, participants were designated either as \"tappers\" or as \"listeners\". The tappers were told to tap out the rhythm of a well-known song, while the \"listeners\" were asked to try to identify the song. While tappers expected that listeners would guess the tune around 50 percent of the time, the listeners were able to identify it only around 2.5 percent of the time. This provided support for a failure in [[perspective-taking]] on the side of the tappers, and an overestimation of the extent to which others would share in \"hearing\" the song as it was tapped.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Wall Street Game ===\nIn 2004, [[Lee Ross|Ross]], Liberman, and Samuels asked dorm resident advisors to nominate students to participate in a study, and to indicate whether those students were likely to cooperate or defect in the first round of the classic decision-making game called the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma]]. The game was introduced to subjects in one of two ways: it was either referred to as the \"Wall Street Game\" or as the \"Community Game\". The researchers found that students in the \"Community Game\" condition were twice as likely to cooperate, and that it did not seem to make a difference whether students were previously categorized as \"cooperators\" versus \"defectors\". This experiment demonstrated that the game's label exerted more power on how the students played the game than the subjects' personality traits. Furthermore, the study showed that the dorm advisors did not make sufficient allowances for [[Subjectivity|subjective]] interpretations of the game.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Consequences ==\nNa\u00efve realism causes people to exaggerate differences between themselves and others. Psychologists believe that it can spark and exacerbate conflict, as well as create barriers to [[negotiation]] through several different mechanisms.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Bias blind spot ===\nOne consequence of na\u00efve realism is referred to as the [[bias blind spot]], which is the ability to recognize [[Cognitive bias|cognitive]] and [[motivation]]al biases in others while failing to recognize the impact of bias on the self. In a study conducted by Pronin, Lin, and Ross (2002), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] students completed a questionnaire about various biases in social judgment.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Bias Blind Spot: Perceptions of Bias in Self Versus Others|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2002|pages = 369\u2013381|volume = 28|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0146167202286008|first = Emily|last = Pronin|first2 = Daniel Y.|last2 = Lin|first3 = Lee|last3 = Ross|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ec43fd940dcc9fc7fef2a3d6c4eeaba2fff0455}}</ref> They indicated how susceptible they thought they were to these biases compared to the average student. The researchers found that the participants consistently believed that they were less likely to be biased than their peers. In a follow-up study, students answered questions about their personal attributes (e.g. how considerate they were) compared to those of other students. The majority of students saw themselves as falling above average on most traits, which provided support for a [[cognitive bias]] known as the [[better-than-average effect]]. Next, the students learned that 70 to 80 percent of people fall prey to this bias. When asked about the accuracy of their self-assessments, 63 percent of the students argued that their ratings had been objective, while 13 percent of students indicated they thought their ratings had been too modest.<ref>Moskowitz, G.B.&nbsp;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22naive%20realism%22&f=false Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others]''.

The individual either has been exposed to a different set of information, is lazy or unable to come to a rational conclusion, or is under a distorting influence such as bias or self-interest.<ref name=\":1\" /> This gives rise to a phenomenon called false polarization, which involves interpreting others' views as more extreme than they really are, and leads to a perception of greater [[Intergroup bias|intergroup]] differences (see Fig. 1).<ref name=\":3\" /> People assume that they perceive the issue objectively, carefully considering it from multiple views, while the other side processes information in [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down fashion]].<ref name=\":4\">Pronin, E., Puccio, C.

Wilson (Eds.).&nbsp;''Barriers to Conflict Resolution''. New York: WW Norton & Co.</ref> One group of participants was told that the proposal was made by American President [[Ronald Reagan]], while others thought the proposal came from Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The researchers found that 90 percent of the participants who thought the proposal was from Reagan supported it, while only 44 percent in the Gorbachev group indicated their support. This provided support for a phenomenon called [[reactive devaluation]], which involves dismissing a concession from an adversary on the assumption that the concession is either motivated by self-interest or less valuable.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Psychology|Philosophy}}\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n* [[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution theory]]\n* [[Na\u00efve cynicism]]\n* [[Depressive realism]]\n* [[Egocentric bias]]\n* [[False-consensus effect]] \n* [[Bias blind spot]]\n* [[Curse of knowledge]]\n* [[Hindsight bias]]\n* [[Hostile media effect]]\n* [[Attitude polarization]]\n* [[Reactive devaluation]]\n* [[Fundamental attribution error]]\n* [[Empathy gap]]\n* [[Confirmation bias]]\n* [[Theory of mind]]\n* [[False-belief task]]\n* [[Spotlight effect]]\n* [[Actor-observer asymmetry|Actor-observer bias]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Ross, L., & Ward, A.

He knew [[Jor-El]], Superman's father, when Jor-El was an aspiring scientist. When the space program was abolished after the destruction of the inhabited moon Wegthor (engineered by renegade scientist [[Jax-Ur]]), Zod attempted to take over Krypton. Zod created an army of robotic duplicates of himself, all bearing a resemblance to [[Bizarro]]. He was sentenced to exile in the [[Phantom Zone]] for 40 years for his crimes. Zod was eventually released by [[Superman]] when his term of imprisonment was up. However, he attempted to conquer Earth with the superpowers his Kryptonian body acquired under the yellow sun (the source of Superman's own super-powers). With Zod's threat now obvious, Superman was forced to oppose him and ultimately returned him to the Zone.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=118}}</ref>\n\nDuring the remaining years before the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Zod and other Zone inmates such as Jax-Ur, Faora Hu-Ul and others, escaped from the Phantom Zone and battled Superman and Supergirl numerous times, always being defeated in the end and returned to the Zone.\n\n===Modern Age===\n\n====Interim Zods: 1985\u20132005====\nAfter DC's continuity altering crossover special ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985), DC editorial maintained for a number of years that no Kryptonians were to be depicted in comics aside from Superman, to reinforce his status as the last Kryptonian. This meant that characters like [[Supergirl]] and [[Power Girl]] were reimagined and Superman's Kryptonian canine [[Krypto]] became an ordinary house pet. However, writers of DC Comics still attempted to get around the no-Kryptonians rule by introducing \"new\" versions of Zod. Many of these were Zods of alternate universes. None persisted in DC continuity. After publishing its sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005), DC reintroduced the real General Zod in its 2006-2008 storyline ''[[Last Son (comics)|Superman: Last Son]]''. For this, it brought on board writer [[Richard Donner]], director of ''Superman'', the film which introduced Zod to the moviegoing public.\n\n[[File:GeneralZodRtK.jpg|upright|thumb|General Zod in ''The Adventures of Superman'' #589 (April 2001). Art by Duncan Rouleau and Marlo Alquiza.]]\nThe first Zod to be introduced following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' was the Zod of a so-called \"pocket universe\" resembling the universe in which the comics took place; this allowed for a \"Kryptonian\" Zod to be introduced while maintaining Superman's status as the last of his race in the universe proper. This Zod came from a Krypton in a pocket universe, the universe itself having been created by the [[Time Trapper]]. Zod (along with companions [[Quex-Ul]] and [[Faora|Zaora]]) devastated the Earth of that universe following the death of its Superboy, despite the best efforts of a [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]] created by that world's heroic [[Lex Luthor]]. Eventually, the survivors of this world managed to contact the Superman of the main universe to help them, and he was able to take away the powers of the three super-criminals with only Gold Kryptonite (since he was not from that universe, the Kryptonite of that reality would have no effect on him).\n\nHowever, the three vowed to some day regain their powers and return to Superman's world to kill him. Acknowledging that he could neither afford to leave them on the now-dead pocket Earth to let them die on their own nor imprison them on his world, Superman was forced to execute them with Green [[Kryptonite]].<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #22 (October 1988)</ref>\n\nA second incarnation of General Zod was introduced in the 2001 storyline \"Return to Krypton\"; this Zod was portrayed as that of an alternate reality that was created by the character [[Brainiac 13]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #589 (April 2001)</ref> He was the head of the Kryptonian military in the alternate reality. Like the Pre-''Crisis'' version, Zod held the Kryptonian equivalent of [[fascist]] beliefs. He sent aliens to the bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] and planned a military coup. Zod was defeated by Superman and the Jor-El of Zod's alternate reality Krypton.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #776 (April 2001)</ref>\n\nThe third attempt to bring Zod to Modern Age comics was the \"Russian\" Zod, a Zod of human origin whose origin story was connected to Superman's. This General Zod (born '''Avruiskin''') is a [[Russians|Russian]] who was affected before his birth by [[Kryptonite]] [[radiation]], since he was the son of two [[cosmonaut]]s whose ship was too close to Kal-El's rocketship. This Zod is unnaturally weak under a yellow sun, but superpowered under a red sun (the opposite of Superman). After his parents died from radiation, he grew up in a [[KGB]] laboratory under the name \"Zed\".<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> Apparently spoken to by the spirit of the Pocket Universe Zod, Russian Zod created a suit of red armor which filtered the sunlight, and declared himself ruler of the fictional former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] state of [[Pokolistan]]. After several inconclusive encounters with Superman, he revealed his long-range plan to turn the sun red and take Superman's place. This was temporarily successful until [[Lex Luthor]] rescued Superman, gave him a blast of yellow solar radiation to regain his powers, and worked to restore the sun. Superman returned to battle Zod, but refused to kill him. When the sun turned yellow again the now-vulnerable Zod struck Superman with all his power at super-speed, but was killed due to Superman's invulnerability.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nThe final Zod before the character was finally reintroduced, the Zod of an alternate Phantom Zone appeared in the twelve-issue ''[[Superman: For Tomorrow|For Tomorrow]]'' storyline, written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and penciled by [[Jim Lee]].<ref>''Superman'' #204\u2013215</ref> This Zod lives alone in an alternate Phantom Zone and resents Superman for tampering with it.<ref>''Superman'' #206</ref> By his own account he comes from the same Krypton as Superman and was exiled to the Phantom Zone by Superman's father, Jor-El. This Zod wears large, spiked black armor and when unmasked, is a bald, white-bearded old man. This incarnation also uses a variation of \"Kneel before Zod\". He appeared in Metropia, a version of the Phantom Zone created by Superman to resemble a living world (including apparently-living beings). However, whether or not this was the real Zod of the pre-[[Infinite Crisis]] DC Universe, he has been superseded by the present storyline (which features a new Zod, freed from the Phantom Zone).<ref>''Superman'' #214</ref>\n\n====General Zod returns: 2006\u20132011====\nGeneral Zod appeared in the ''[[Superman: Last Son]]'' storyline (written by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Richard Donner]], the director of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' and most of ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|Superman II]]''). In a similar story to that of ''Superman II'', Zod, [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], and [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]] escape from the Phantom Zone and come to Earth to try to turn it into a \"New Krypton\".<ref>''Action Comics'' #844</ref> This incarnation is the first Post-Crisis Zod who came from Superman's Krypton, and not from an alternate reality.<ref>''Action Comics'' #845</ref>\n\n[[Image:General Zod Countdown 30.png|upright|left|thumb|General Zod leads an ill-fated insurrection in ''Countdown'' #30 (October 2007). Art by Gary Frank and Jon Sibal.]]\nThe backstory for the three Kryptonians was recounted in ''Action Comics Annual'' #10 (April 2007),<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' #10</ref> and Zod's origin was revealed in ''Countdown'' #30 (October 2007).<ref>''Countdown'' #30</ref> Prior to the destruction of Krypton, Zod, his wife [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], and accomplice [[Non (comics)|Non]] rebelled against their planet's oppressive government, but soon became lawless would-be tyrants who lusted for power. After an ill-fated insurrection led by Zod, the government sentenced the trio to death. However, Superman's father Jor-El pleaded for the government to mitigate their sentence to imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, accepted on the condition that he would assume responsibility as their jailer. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and Ursa were able to have a child who was born immune to the Phantom Zone's effects, ultimately facilitating their escape, and named him Lor-Zod. On Earth, the boy was discovered by Superman and his wife Lois Lane, who adopted him as their own son and named him [[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]]. For the duration of 2007's \"Last Son\" storyline in ''Action Comics'', Chris Kent is depicted as an adopted son of Superman and his wife Lois across DC titles.\n\nAlongside Zod, Ursa and Non, 25 other Kryptonian criminals also escape the Zone and defeat a number of Earth's heroes, beginning their quest to conquer the planet. Zod ambushes Superman in revenge for Jor-El's actions and traps him in the Phantom Zone, which he later escapes with the help of the heroic Phantom Zone prisoner [[Mon-El]]. With assistance from his traditional enemies [[Lex Luthor]], [[Metallo]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and [[Bizarro]], Superman takes on Zod's army. Out of nearly thirty Kryptonians, Superman's temporary allies successfully kill several, driving the rest back into the Phantom Zone alongside Zod and Ursa, who take Chris Kent with them.<ref>''Action Comics'' #846</ref>\n\n[[Image:GeneralZod.png|upright|thumb|General Zod in ''Action Comics'' #845 (January 2007). Art by [[Adam Kubert]].]]\nIn the later \"[[Superman: New Krypton|New Krypton]]\" arc storyline however, Zod is freed from the Phantom Zone once again by Supergirl's mother [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura]]. The \"bottled city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]\" is transformed into a populated Kryptonian planet (\"New Krypton\"), and Zod is appointed the leader of its army. In the \"World of New Krypton\" ''Action Comics'' storyline, when Superman decides to see what life is like on New Krypton, he is drafted into the Military Guild under General Zod. Zod and Superman maintain a mistrustful professional relationship. Despite their past, neither seems prepared to behave with marked aggression toward the other. Later, during a Kryptonian ceremony, Zod is shot by the Kryptonian Ral-Dar (who is working with Lois's father [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Sam Lane]]), leading Zod to appoint Superman as temporary General until his recovery. The two are involved in a Kryptonian political plot, but ultimately apprehend the planet's traitor and see a reform of New Krypton's Council.\n\nPeace is short-lived, however, due to an attack by the alien [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], who had been responsible for the bottling of Kandor in the first place. In \"Last Stand of New Krypton\", New Krypton comes under attack by Brainiac, and Zod engineers a plan to defeat him; Zod is driven by an urge to avenge his prior defeat at the hands of the Coluan Brainiac, when Kandor was bottled from Old Krypton. The storyline ends with the planet's destruction, leading Zod to declare war on Earth, sparking the \"War of the Supermen\" storyline. After a fierce conflict between Superman and Zod in defence of Earth, Zod is pushed back into the Phantom Zone by his son, Chris Kent, who had freed himself from the Phantom Zone and became active as an adult superhero on planet Earth.<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #4 (July 2010)</ref>\n\n====The New 52: 2011\u20132016====\nIn 2011, DC chose to revamp its continuity, rebooting many characters while retaining the histories for some others, as part of its [[The New 52]] publishing event. Following this, Zod is hinted at several times. A character resembling Zod made a cameo in ''Action Comics'' #5 (March 2012), as a prisoner in the Phantom Zone; in ''Action Comics'' #13 (December 2012) a ghost in the Phantom Zone says \"Kneel before...\" multiple times while attacking Superman, a reference to Zod's iconic saying. Zod makes his first full appearance in ''Action Comics'' #23.2: ''General Zod'' (September 2013), written by Greg Pak, with art by Ken Lashley.<ref name=\"Action Comics Villains\">{{cite web|title=First look: DC's Action Comics Villains month - Zod, Lex Luthor and more plus Michael Alan Nelson talks Cyborg Superman|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2013/06/first-look-dcs-action-comics-villains-month---zod-lex-luthor-and-more-plus-michael-alan-nelson-talks.html|last=Hayer|first=Chris E|date=June 4, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605174228/http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2013/06/first-look-dcs-action-comics-villains-month---zod-lex-luthor-and-more-plus-michael-alan-nelson-talks.html|archivedate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA new origin for Zod was introduced. Zod was born to scientist parents. When he was a young boy, Zod and his parents traveled to Krypton's wilderness in order to discover new creatures. Their ship was attacked by creatures, leaving the family stranded in the jungle. While his parents were killed by the animals, Zod managed to survive for one year until Jor-El and his older brother Zor-El saved him. After reaching adulthood, Zod became one of Krypton's best soldiers, attaining the rank of general. Zod developed a hatred towards an alien species called the Char and secretly ordered the creation of a Char-looking creature, unleashing it on Krypton's population, so he could justify a war against the Char. Jor-El discovered the deception and turned Zod over to the authorities. The council found Zod guilty of treason and banished him and his closest followers, Faora and Non, to the Phantom Zone.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Greg Pak|Pak, Greg]]|Title = [[Action Comics]]|Volume = 2|Issue = 23.2|Date = September 2013|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nMany years later, a mysterious event caused the Phantom Zone to weaken, allowing some of its prisoners to escape into normal space. Zod traveled to Earth, landing in the Sahara Desert. There, Zod's Kryptonian powers began to manifest for the first time, brutally slaughtering a group of travelers. Zod was soon attacked by the Justice League of America until Superman and Wonder Woman arrived, the latter restraining him with her magic lasso. Zod recognized Superman as Kal-El, the son of Jor-El. Superman decided to keep Zod in the Fortress of Solitude's alien zoo. While there, he reveals to Superman that Faora also traveled to Earth with him, and vows to track her down.\n\n[[File:General Zod SS vol 5 17.png|thumb|upright|General Zod as he appears in the DC Universe. Cover of ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5, #17 (July 2017). Art by Tony Daniel and Sandu Florea.]]\n====DC Universe====\nIn June 2016, the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles, in which General Zod continues to appear within DC titles. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the ''Rebirth'' branding, opting to include everything under a larger ''DC Universe'' banner and naming.  As part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, General Zod is once again imprisoned within the Phantom Zone. Zod was trapped within the boundaries of the Black Vault, a secret facility hidden in the [[Laptev Sea]]. [[Amanda Waller]] sent the [[Suicide Squad]] to steal the contents of the Black Vault and bring them back to her; however, in unlocking the previously hermetically sealed area, they unwittingly allowed Zod to tear open the now unstable link between Earth and the Phantom Zone and once again break free.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]]|Artist=[[Jim Lee]]|Title = [[Suicide Squad]]|Volume = 5|Issue = 2|Date = September 2016|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> She attempts to 'recruit' Zod by implanting a kryptonite explosive in his head, but he finally proves too dangerous, forcing Rick Flagg to sacrifice himself to force Zod back into the Zone. Zod later escapes and establishes himself as a dictator on another planet with his family, nearly killing Hal Jordan when the Green Lantern Corps discover his presence on the planet before both sides are forced to withdraw and recuperate.\n\n==Other versions==\n* The General Zod of [[Earth-15]] is this world's Superman, here as a semi-retired champion of this peaceful Earth.<ref>''Countdown'' #24</ref> This version is later killed by the psychotic [[Superboy-Prime|Superman Prime]], who was angry because Zod was \"not a manic\", as well as killing Zod's wife and unborn child. <ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #30</ref>\n* The Zod of ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files]]'' was not a general of any kind. He was recast as a sociopathic 11-year-old, who created a deadly synthetic virus on Krypton for no reason other than fun. Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone because of his actions (the  first child ever sent to the Zone) until American scientists breached the Zone and discovered him. Taken in by the government and named \"Clark Kent\", Zod would fool most of his adult superiors by playing the role of a scared child until he grew up and became the adult \"Super-Man\".<ref>''JSA: The Libert Files'' #2</ref> In the sequel series '''[[JSA: The Liberty Files#The Unholy Three|JSA: The Unholy Three]]''', Super-Man is sent into Eastern Europe with the Bat and [[Rex Tyler|the Clock]]. He fought [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and Steelwolf, while investigating his sole weakness: a nuclear device the [[Russians]] had created. Finding his information, he incapacitated or killed several agents and headed into Russia to destroy the device. However, he was ultimately killed before he could finish the job. <ref>'''JSA: The Unholy Three'''</ref>\n* Zod appears in ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'' in which he is called '''Zod-El''', brother to Jor-El and thus Superman's uncle. Zod-El was a Kryptonian soldier who waged a six-month civil war against the Science Council, and the one responsible for Krypton's destruction by striking a deal with the Krypton's neighbor Dheronians. After Tyrell's defeat and absorbing energy from a yellow star, Zod went to Earth to deal with Superman. He is later depowered by [[Lex Luthor|the Luthors]] after Alexander shot him with a radiation beam, but not before killing him and thus driving his wife Lex to hate Superman.\n* Zod appears in the prequel to the ''[[Injustice 2]]'' video game. When Batman and the Insurgency rescue the Teen Titans from their imprisonment by Superman in the Phantom Zone, Zod uses the opportunity to escape the prison and murders [[Tim Drake]] in the process. An enraged Batman activates his Endgame protocol and combats Zod with a heavily armored suit. He takes Zod down with kryptonite infused fear gas, which Batman himself swore he'd never use given to what it did to Superman in this reality. He gets the upper hand on Zod with the kryptonite gas making it appear like Superman is defeating him, but when it wears off, Ra's Al Ghul (knowing Zod's kryptonian purist ideals wouldn't match with his own) sends Amazo to combat the general. Amazo kills Zod by twisting his head off.<ref>''Injustice 2'' #39</ref> His heart is then surgically removed by the retired Doctor Mid-Nite Charles McNider and placed inside Superboy's body so he can live outside the Phantom Zone.\n\n===DC Animated Universe===\n* While not appearing in the [[DC animated universe]] television shows, General Zod (depicted as an [[Argo City|Argosian]] mad criminal) appears in ''[[Superman Adventures]]'' #21<ref name=\"Superman Adventures #21\">''Superman Adventures'' #21</ref> and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' #34 where he teams with Jax-Ur and [[Mala (Kryptonian)|Mala]].<ref>''Justice League Unlimited'' #34</ref>\n* A version of Zod appears in the 2013 digital-first series ''Justice League Beyond 2.0'', taking place in the [[DC Animated Universe]], specifically in the futuristic setting of the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' animated series. In this series, Zod is revealed to be the son of [[Jax-Ur]], marking the first appearance of General Zod in the continuity of the [[Bruce Timm]]'s ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', albeit a younger, innocent version of the megalomaniacal General who, in fact, helps the new [[Justice League]]. He is later revealed to be the son of [[Justice Lords|Justice Lord]] Superman and Wonder Woman.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike all Kryptonians under a yellow sun, General Zod possesses high-level superhuman strength, speed and endurance sufficient to stand against Superman and other Kryptonians; super hearing; x-ray vision; telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; super-breath and freeze-breath; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing and flight. Due to his background as a Kryptonian general, Zod possesses a detailed knowledge of military tactics, battle strategy, and is a relatively competent military leader. Because he was trained in fighting arts long before receiving his abilities, he typically has an edge over Superman's brawling skills, over-reliance on superhuman strength, and basic knowledge of advanced human and Kryptonian hand-to-hand combat. However, Zod's powers are often inferior to those of Superman, due to the latter being exposed to the yellow sun over the course of his entire life, while Zod typically only gets exposed for a short period of time before being defeated and returned to the Phantom Zone. This greater power combined with his superior control and experience with it gives Superman an edge over Zod's superior fighting skills. Additionally, similar to Superman, his strength is inferior to the likes of Doomsday and his speed is inferior to Speedsters such as the Flash. Like all Kryptonians, he is vulnerable to Kryptonite and red solar radiation; his durability does not provide protection from mind control and magic; and his strength and durability both have limits in that he cannot survive an atomic explosion without nearly fatal injuries and there are weights he cannot lift due to natural bodily limitation even under the empowering environment of a yellow sun as well as normal limits of adult Kryptonian superhuman strength.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Animation====\n* General Zod appears in the 1988 animated series ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' episode \"The Hunter\", voiced by [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]. This version is imprisoned in the Phantom Zone with two Kryptonian women ([[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Faora]]) whereas most portrayals of the conspiracy show the Zod trio composed of two men and one woman. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and his followers create The Hunter (a creature which can transmute itself into any substance that it touches) and send it to Earth. After the Hunter's fight with [[Superman]], Zod introduces it to Kryptonite where the Hunter ends up seeking a piece of Kryptonite that is in [[Lex Luthor]]'s possession. During the fight with the Hunter, Superman plays dead by going into a suspended animation thanks to a device he gave to [[Lois Lane]]. After being awoken from his suspended animation, Superman destroys the Hunter and uses the Phantom Zone Projector to ensure that Zod stays in the Phantom Zone.\n* General Zod does not appear in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', but an amalgamation of him and [[Jax-Ur]] appears, called '''General Jax-Ur'''. He first appeared in the episode 'Blasts From the Past', where he was voiced by Ron Perlman. He was portrayed as similar to General Zod; a military genius who had attempted to overthrow the Science Council. His co-conspirator, and possible lover, is a beautiful Kryptonian female with long white hair named Mala (based on Ursa and Faora but named for a male Kryptonian from the comics). His proper title is High General Jax-Ur. During Jax-Ur and Mala's last appearance on Superman: The Animated Series, Jax-Ur reveals to Superman that a rift into the Phantom Zone had been torn open, releasing them into space. They were saved by nearby voyagers and soon took control over their planet. Upon seizing control of the planet, they had the inhabitants rebuild everything so that it was very reminiscent of Krypton, even going so far as to make the inhabitants wear clothes similar to that of Kryptonians. After meeting with a rebel, Superman found out that Jax-Ur and Mala intended to invade Earth. After Superman battled in space with the pair, Jax-Ur and Mala were sucked into a black hole.\n* The Silver Age version of Zod makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' episode \"Phantoms\". He is one of the many Phantom Zone prisoners attacking the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], his son '''Drax-Zod''' appears in this episode.\n* General Zod appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode \"Field Trip\", voiced by [[Jason J. Lewis]]. As Superman gives Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl a tour of the Fortress of Solitude and are shown the Phantom Zone Projector, General Zod, Faora, and Quex-Ul are released and Superman is accidentally sent to the Phantom Zone. Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl attempt to use a Green Kryptonite fragment on them only for it to be too small for them. Under the yellow sun, General Zod and his two followers gain superpowers and end up in a fight with Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl. As Blue Beetle and Stargirl hold off the Kryptonian villains, Firestorm uses Martin Stein's guidance to learn how to transmutate anything to Kryptonite. Testing on the ice, Firestorm transmutates it to Green Kryptonite which weakens General Zod and his two followers. Afterwards, Superman is freed from the Phantom Zone and General Zod and his followers are thrown into the Phantom Zone.\n* General Zod appears in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' episode \"SuperRabbit\" where he is modeled after [[Daffy Duck]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]). Here, he is Faora's boyfriend, but is inattentive and neglectful of her, as well as immature. Zod, Faora, and the robot Thunkian are first prosecuted for their crimes on Krypton by Jor-El and sentenced to the Phantom Zone, swearing revenge. After escaping several years later, they travel to Metropolis and battle SuperRabbit, defeating him and forcing him to retreat. Zod then becomes the city's ruler and renames himself King Zod, ordering a massive statue of himself built. SuperRabbit returns and convinces Faora and Thunkian to stop helping Zod by pointing out how much he mistreats them. Zod and SuperRabbit have a massive battle throughout the city where Zod is eventually knocked out by having his own statue knocked onto him.

Thirty-three years later, after the destruction of Krypton, Zod arrives on the planet Earth and extorts its people into handing over Kal-El (now going by the name [[Clark Kent]]) by threatening Earth's destruction. He reveals his plan to terraform Earth and repopulate the world with genetically-engineered Kryptonians, which will kill all of Earth's indigenous life in the process. Clark Kent (now dubbed \"Superman\"), with the help of the [[United States Armed Forces|United States Military]], thwarts his plan by creating a singularity that sucks all Kryptonians (save for Zod and Superman) back into the Phantom Zone. Zod then engages Superman in a lengthy, catastrophic fight throughout Metropolis and despite holding an upper hand throughout most of it, Superman ultimately subdues Zod. Furious, the General prepares to murder a trapped family and claims he will never stop, forcing Superman to reluctantly snap Zod's neck to save the family, killing him.\n* In ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', LexCorp has possession of Zod's corpse, ostensibly to study Kryptonian anatomy and origins. Lex Luthor discovers Kryptonians' vulnerability to kryptonite and uses this knowledge and Zod's fingerprints to access the ancient Kryptonian scout ship.

Anderson]], {{ISBN|0-06-134074-X}}), General Zod (also known as Commissioner Dru-Zod) is the son of Cor-Zod (former head of the Kryptonian Council). Initially a middle-level bureaucrat, he takes advantage of a major planetary cataclysm and the apparent decapitation of the government to seize absolute power as a military despot. He is ultimately overthrown by a resistance movement led by scientist [[Jor-El]] and his brother, civic leader [[Zor-El]]. They had formerly worked with Zod until his ambitions and misuse of Jor-El's Rao Beam and the Phantom Zone showed them his true nature and turned them against him. He and his two henchmen are banished forever to the Phantom Zone. The reactionary Council, however, decide to make sure Zod can never be released and, in doing so, snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. What the comet, pressures building up within Krypton and Rao's increasing instability fail to accomplish, is ironically achieved by the actions of Krypton's Council out of an irrational fear that Jor-El might free Zod and his minions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Superman enemies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{gcdb|type=character|search=General+Zod|title=General Zod}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=4089|title=General Zod}}\n*[http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/general_zod&p=1 DCComics.com - Origin of General Zod]\n*{{DCdatabase|Zod}}\n*[http://www.generalzod.net GeneralZod.net] - a humor website featuring General Zod\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120229212636/http://alankistler.squarespace.com/journal/2009/4/2/kistlers-history-of-general-zod.html  Alan Kistler's Profile On: ZOD!] - Comic book historian Alan Kistler does an in-depth article reviewing the long history of Zod from 1961 all the way to 2005, going into detail on the various incarnations and changes in the character.

He knew [[Jor-El]], Superman's father, when Jor-El was an aspiring scientist. When the space program was abolished after the destruction of the inhabited moon Wegthor (engineered by renegade scientist [[Jax-Ur]]), Zod attempted to take over Krypton. Zod created an army of robotic duplicates of himself, all bearing a resemblance to [[Bizarro]]. He was sentenced to exile in the [[Phantom Zone]] for 40 years for his crimes. Zod was eventually released by [[Superman]] when his term of imprisonment was up. However, he attempted to conquer Earth with the superpowers his Kryptonian body acquired under the yellow sun (the source of Superman's own super-powers). With Zod's threat now obvious, Superman was forced to oppose him and ultimately returned him to the Zone.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=118}}</ref>\n\nDuring the remaining years before the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Zod and other Zone inmates such as Jax-Ur, Faora Hu-Ul and others, escaped from the Phantom Zone and battled Superman and Supergirl numerous times, always being defeated in the end and returned to the Zone.\n\n===Modern Age===\n\n====Interim Zods: 1985\u20132005====\nAfter DC's continuity altering crossover special ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985), DC editorial maintained for a number of years that no Kryptonians were to be depicted in comics aside from Superman, to reinforce his status as the last Kryptonian. This meant that characters like [[Supergirl]] and [[Power Girl]] were reimagined and Superman's Kryptonian canine [[Krypto]] became an ordinary house pet. However, writers of DC Comics still attempted to get around the no-Kryptonians rule by introducing \"new\" versions of Zod. Many of these were Zods of alternate universes. None persisted in DC continuity. After publishing its sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005), DC reintroduced the real General Zod in its 2006-2008 storyline ''[[Last Son (comics)|Superman: Last Son]]''. For this, it brought on board writer [[Richard Donner]], director of ''Superman'', the film which introduced Zod to the moviegoing public.\n\n[[File:GeneralZodRtK.jpg|upright|thumb|General Zod in ''The Adventures of Superman'' #589 (April 2001). Art by Duncan Rouleau and Marlo Alquiza.]]\nThe first Zod to be introduced following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' was the Zod of a so-called \"pocket universe\" resembling the universe in which the comics took place; this allowed for a \"Kryptonian\" Zod to be introduced while maintaining Superman's status as the last of his race in the universe proper. This Zod came from a Krypton in a pocket universe, the universe itself having been created by the [[Time Trapper]]. Zod (along with companions [[Quex-Ul]] and [[Faora|Zaora]]) devastated the Earth of that universe following the death of its Superboy, despite the best efforts of a [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]] created by that world's heroic [[Lex Luthor]]. Eventually, the survivors of this world managed to contact the Superman of the main universe to help them, and he was able to take away the powers of the three super-criminals with only Gold Kryptonite (since he was not from that universe, the Kryptonite of that reality would have no effect on him).\n\nHowever, the three vowed to some day regain their powers and return to Superman's world to kill him. Acknowledging that he could neither afford to leave them on the now-dead pocket Earth to let them die on their own nor imprison them on his world, Superman was forced to execute them with Green [[Kryptonite]].<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #22 (October 1988)</ref>\n\nA second incarnation of General Zod was introduced in the 2001 storyline \"Return to Krypton\"; this Zod was portrayed as that of an alternate reality that was created by the character [[Brainiac 13]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #589 (April 2001)</ref> He was the head of the Kryptonian military in the alternate reality. Like the Pre-''Crisis'' version, Zod held the Kryptonian equivalent of [[fascist]] beliefs. He sent aliens to the bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] and planned a military coup. Zod was defeated by Superman and the Jor-El of Zod's alternate reality Krypton.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #776 (April 2001)</ref>\n\nThe third attempt to bring Zod to Modern Age comics was the \"Russian\" Zod, a Zod of human origin whose origin story was connected to Superman's. This General Zod (born '''Avruiskin''') is a [[Russians|Russian]] who was affected before his birth by [[Kryptonite]] [[radiation]], since he was the son of two [[cosmonaut]]s whose ship was too close to Kal-El's rocketship. This Zod is unnaturally weak under a yellow sun, but superpowered under a red sun (the opposite of Superman). After his parents died from radiation, he grew up in a [[KGB]] laboratory under the name \"Zed\".<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> Apparently spoken to by the spirit of the Pocket Universe Zod, Russian Zod created a suit of red armor which filtered the sunlight, and declared himself ruler of the fictional former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] state of [[Pokolistan]]. After several inconclusive encounters with Superman, he revealed his long-range plan to turn the sun red and take Superman's place. This was temporarily successful until [[Lex Luthor]] rescued Superman, gave him a blast of yellow solar radiation to regain his powers, and worked to restore the sun. Superman returned to battle Zod, but refused to kill him. When the sun turned yellow again the now-vulnerable Zod struck Superman with all his power at super-speed, but was killed due to Superman's invulnerability.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nThe final Zod before the character was finally reintroduced, the Zod of an alternate Phantom Zone appeared in the twelve-issue ''[[Superman: For Tomorrow|For Tomorrow]]'' storyline, written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and penciled by [[Jim Lee]].<ref>''Superman'' #204\u2013215</ref> This Zod lives alone in an alternate Phantom Zone and resents Superman for tampering with it.<ref>''Superman'' #206</ref> By his own account he comes from the same Krypton as Superman and was exiled to the Phantom Zone by Superman's father, Jor-El. This Zod wears large, spiked black armor and when unmasked, is a bald, white-bearded old man. This incarnation also uses a variation of \"Kneel before Zod\". He appeared in Metropia, a version of the Phantom Zone created by Superman to resemble a living world (including apparently-living beings). However, whether or not this was the real Zod of the pre-[[Infinite Crisis]] DC Universe, he has been superseded by the present storyline (which features a new Zod, freed from the Phantom Zone).<ref>''Superman'' #214</ref>\n\n====General Zod returns: 2006\u20132011====\nGeneral Zod appeared in the ''[[Superman: Last Son]]'' storyline (written by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Richard Donner]], the director of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' and most of ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|Superman II]]''). In a similar story to that of ''Superman II'', Zod, [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], and [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]] escape from the Phantom Zone and come to Earth to try to turn it into a \"New Krypton\".<ref>''Action Comics'' #844</ref> This incarnation is the first Post-Crisis Zod who came from Superman's Krypton, and not from an alternate reality.<ref>''Action Comics'' #845</ref>\n\n[[Image:General Zod Countdown 30.png|upright|left|thumb|General Zod leads an ill-fated insurrection in ''Countdown'' #30 (October 2007).

After an ill-fated insurrection led by Zod, the government sentenced the trio to death. However, Superman's father Jor-El pleaded for the government to mitigate their sentence to imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, accepted on the condition that he would assume responsibility as their jailer. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and Ursa were able to have a child who was born immune to the Phantom Zone's effects, ultimately facilitating their escape, and named him Lor-Zod. On Earth, the boy was discovered by Superman and his wife Lois Lane, who adopted him as their own son and named him [[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]]. For the duration of 2007's \"Last Son\" storyline in ''Action Comics'', Chris Kent is depicted as an adopted son of Superman and his wife Lois across DC titles.\n\nAlongside Zod, Ursa and Non, 25 other Kryptonian criminals also escape the Zone and defeat a number of Earth's heroes, beginning their quest to conquer the planet. Zod ambushes Superman in revenge for Jor-El's actions and traps him in the Phantom Zone, which he later escapes with the help of the heroic Phantom Zone prisoner [[Mon-El]]. With assistance from his traditional enemies [[Lex Luthor]], [[Metallo]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and [[Bizarro]], Superman takes on Zod's army. Out of nearly thirty Kryptonians, Superman's temporary allies successfully kill several, driving the rest back into the Phantom Zone alongside Zod and Ursa, who take Chris Kent with them.<ref>''Action Comics'' #846</ref>\n\n[[Image:GeneralZod.png|upright|thumb|General Zod in ''Action Comics'' #845 (January 2007). Art by [[Adam Kubert]].]]\nIn the later \"[[Superman: New Krypton|New Krypton]]\" arc storyline however, Zod is freed from the Phantom Zone once again by Supergirl's mother [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura]]. The \"bottled city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]\" is transformed into a populated Kryptonian planet (\"New Krypton\"), and Zod is appointed the leader of its army. In the \"World of New Krypton\" ''Action Comics'' storyline, when Superman decides to see what life is like on New Krypton, he is drafted into the Military Guild under General Zod. Zod and Superman maintain a mistrustful professional relationship. Despite their past, neither seems prepared to behave with marked aggression toward the other. Later, during a Kryptonian ceremony, Zod is shot by the Kryptonian Ral-Dar (who is working with Lois's father [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Sam Lane]]), leading Zod to appoint Superman as temporary General until his recovery. The two are involved in a Kryptonian political plot, but ultimately apprehend the planet's traitor and see a reform of New Krypton's Council.\n\nPeace is short-lived, however, due to an attack by the alien [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], who had been responsible for the bottling of Kandor in the first place. In \"Last Stand of New Krypton\", New Krypton comes under attack by Brainiac, and Zod engineers a plan to defeat him; Zod is driven by an urge to avenge his prior defeat at the hands of the Coluan Brainiac, when Kandor was bottled from Old Krypton. The storyline ends with the planet's destruction, leading Zod to declare war on Earth, sparking the \"War of the Supermen\" storyline. After a fierce conflict between Superman and Zod in defence of Earth, Zod is pushed back into the Phantom Zone by his son, Chris Kent, who had freed himself from the Phantom Zone and became active as an adult superhero on planet Earth.<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #4 (July 2010)</ref>\n\n====The New 52: 2011\u20132016====\nIn 2011, DC chose to revamp its continuity, rebooting many characters while retaining the histories for some others, as part of its [[The New 52]] publishing event. Following this, Zod is hinted at several times. A character resembling Zod made a cameo in ''Action Comics'' #5 (March 2012), as a prisoner in the Phantom Zone; in ''Action Comics'' #13 (December 2012) a ghost in the Phantom Zone says \"Kneel before...\" multiple times while attacking Superman, a reference to Zod's iconic saying. Zod makes his first full appearance in ''Action Comics'' #23.2: ''General Zod'' (September 2013), written by Greg Pak, with art by Ken Lashley.<ref name=\"Action Comics Villains\">{{cite web|title=First look: DC's Action Comics Villains month - Zod, Lex Luthor and more plus Michael Alan Nelson talks Cyborg Superman|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2013/06/first-look-dcs-action-comics-villains-month---zod-lex-luthor-and-more-plus-michael-alan-nelson-talks.html|last=Hayer|first=Chris E|date=June 4, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605174228/http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2013/06/first-look-dcs-action-comics-villains-month---zod-lex-luthor-and-more-plus-michael-alan-nelson-talks.html|archivedate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA new origin for Zod was introduced. Zod was born to scientist parents. When he was a young boy, Zod and his parents traveled to Krypton's wilderness in order to discover new creatures. Their ship was attacked by creatures, leaving the family stranded in the jungle. While his parents were killed by the animals, Zod managed to survive for one year until Jor-El and his older brother Zor-El saved him. After reaching adulthood, Zod became one of Krypton's best soldiers, attaining the rank of general. Zod developed a hatred towards an alien species called the Char and secretly ordered the creation of a Char-looking creature, unleashing it on Krypton's population, so he could justify a war against the Char. Jor-El discovered the deception and turned Zod over to the authorities. The council found Zod guilty of treason and banished him and his closest followers, Faora and Non, to the Phantom Zone.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Greg Pak|Pak, Greg]]|Title = [[Action Comics]]|Volume = 2|Issue = 23.2|Date = September 2013|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nMany years later, a mysterious event caused the Phantom Zone to weaken, allowing some of its prisoners to escape into normal space. Zod traveled to Earth, landing in the Sahara Desert. There, Zod's Kryptonian powers began to manifest for the first time, brutally slaughtering a group of travelers. Zod was soon attacked by the Justice League of America until Superman and Wonder Woman arrived, the latter restraining him with her magic lasso. Zod recognized Superman as Kal-El, the son of Jor-El. Superman decided to keep Zod in the Fortress of Solitude's alien zoo. While there, he reveals to Superman that Faora also traveled to Earth with him, and vows to track her down.\n\n[[File:General Zod SS vol 5 17.png|thumb|upright|General Zod as he appears in the DC Universe. Cover of ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5, #17 (July 2017). Art by Tony Daniel and Sandu Florea.]]\n====DC Universe====\nIn June 2016, the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles, in which General Zod continues to appear within DC titles. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the ''Rebirth'' branding, opting to include everything under a larger ''DC Universe'' banner and naming.  As part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, General Zod is once again imprisoned within the Phantom Zone. Zod was trapped within the boundaries of the Black Vault, a secret facility hidden in the [[Laptev Sea]]. [[Amanda Waller]] sent the [[Suicide Squad]] to steal the contents of the Black Vault and bring them back to her; however, in unlocking the previously hermetically sealed area, they unwittingly allowed Zod to tear open the now unstable link between Earth and the Phantom Zone and once again break free.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]]|Artist=[[Jim Lee]]|Title = [[Suicide Squad]]|Volume = 5|Issue = 2|Date = September 2016|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> She attempts to 'recruit' Zod by implanting a kryptonite explosive in his head, but he finally proves too dangerous, forcing Rick Flagg to sacrifice himself to force Zod back into the Zone. Zod later escapes and establishes himself as a dictator on another planet with his family, nearly killing Hal Jordan when the Green Lantern Corps discover his presence on the planet before both sides are forced to withdraw and recuperate.\n\n==Other versions==\n* The General Zod of [[Earth-15]] is this world's Superman, here as a semi-retired champion of this peaceful Earth.<ref>''Countdown'' #24</ref> This version is later killed by the psychotic [[Superboy-Prime|Superman Prime]], who was angry because Zod was \"not a manic\", as well as killing Zod's wife and unborn child. <ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #30</ref>\n* The Zod of ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files]]'' was not a general of any kind. He was recast as a sociopathic 11-year-old, who created a deadly synthetic virus on Krypton for no reason other than fun. Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone because of his actions (the  first child ever sent to the Zone) until American scientists breached the Zone and discovered him. Taken in by the government and named \"Clark Kent\", Zod would fool most of his adult superiors by playing the role of a scared child until he grew up and became the adult \"Super-Man\".<ref>''JSA: The Libert Files'' #2</ref> In the sequel series '''[[JSA: The Liberty Files#The Unholy Three|JSA: The Unholy Three]]''', Super-Man is sent into Eastern Europe with the Bat and [[Rex Tyler|the Clock]]. He fought [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and Steelwolf, while investigating his sole weakness: a nuclear device the [[Russians]] had created. Finding his information, he incapacitated or killed several agents and headed into Russia to destroy the device. However, he was ultimately killed before he could finish the job. <ref>'''JSA: The Unholy Three'''</ref>\n* Zod appears in ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'' in which he is called '''Zod-El''', brother to Jor-El and thus Superman's uncle. Zod-El was a Kryptonian soldier who waged a six-month civil war against the Science Council, and the one responsible for Krypton's destruction by striking a deal with the Krypton's neighbor Dheronians. After Tyrell's defeat and absorbing energy from a yellow star, Zod went to Earth to deal with Superman. He is later depowered by [[Lex Luthor|the Luthors]] after Alexander shot him with a radiation beam, but not before killing him and thus driving his wife Lex to hate Superman.\n* Zod appears in the prequel to the ''[[Injustice 2]]'' video game. When Batman and the Insurgency rescue the Teen Titans from their imprisonment by Superman in the Phantom Zone, Zod uses the opportunity to escape the prison and murders [[Tim Drake]] in the process. An enraged Batman activates his Endgame protocol and combats Zod with a heavily armored suit. He takes Zod down with kryptonite infused fear gas, which Batman himself swore he'd never use given to what it did to Superman in this reality. He gets the upper hand on Zod with the kryptonite gas making it appear like Superman is defeating him, but when it wears off, Ra's Al Ghul (knowing Zod's kryptonian purist ideals wouldn't match with his own) sends Amazo to combat the general. Amazo kills Zod by twisting his head off.<ref>''Injustice 2'' #39</ref> His heart is then surgically removed by the retired Doctor Mid-Nite Charles McNider and placed inside Superboy's body so he can live outside the Phantom Zone.\n\n===DC Animated Universe===\n* While not appearing in the [[DC animated universe]] television shows, General Zod (depicted as an [[Argo City|Argosian]] mad criminal) appears in ''[[Superman Adventures]]'' #21<ref name=\"Superman Adventures #21\">''Superman Adventures'' #21</ref> and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' #34 where he teams with Jax-Ur and [[Mala (Kryptonian)|Mala]].<ref>''Justice League Unlimited'' #34</ref>\n* A version of Zod appears in the 2013 digital-first series ''Justice League Beyond 2.0'', taking place in the [[DC Animated Universe]], specifically in the futuristic setting of the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' animated series. In this series, Zod is revealed to be the son of [[Jax-Ur]], marking the first appearance of General Zod in the continuity of the [[Bruce Timm]]'s ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', albeit a younger, innocent version of the megalomaniacal General who, in fact, helps the new [[Justice League]]. He is later revealed to be the son of [[Justice Lords|Justice Lord]] Superman and Wonder Woman.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike all Kryptonians under a yellow sun, General Zod possesses high-level superhuman strength, speed and endurance sufficient to stand against Superman and other Kryptonians; super hearing; x-ray vision; telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; super-breath and freeze-breath; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing and flight. Due to his background as a Kryptonian general, Zod possesses a detailed knowledge of military tactics, battle strategy, and is a relatively competent military leader. Because he was trained in fighting arts long before receiving his abilities, he typically has an edge over Superman's brawling skills, over-reliance on superhuman strength, and basic knowledge of advanced human and Kryptonian hand-to-hand combat. However, Zod's powers are often inferior to those of Superman, due to the latter being exposed to the yellow sun over the course of his entire life, while Zod typically only gets exposed for a short period of time before being defeated and returned to the Phantom Zone. This greater power combined with his superior control and experience with it gives Superman an edge over Zod's superior fighting skills. Additionally, similar to Superman, his strength is inferior to the likes of Doomsday and his speed is inferior to Speedsters such as the Flash. Like all Kryptonians, he is vulnerable to Kryptonite and red solar radiation; his durability does not provide protection from mind control and magic; and his strength and durability both have limits in that he cannot survive an atomic explosion without nearly fatal injuries and there are weights he cannot lift due to natural bodily limitation even under the empowering environment of a yellow sun as well as normal limits of adult Kryptonian superhuman strength.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Animation====\n* General Zod appears in the 1988 animated series ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' episode \"The Hunter\", voiced by [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]. This version is imprisoned in the Phantom Zone with two Kryptonian women ([[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Faora]]) whereas most portrayals of the conspiracy show the Zod trio composed of two men and one woman. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and his followers create The Hunter (a creature which can transmute itself into any substance that it touches) and send it to Earth. After the Hunter's fight with [[Superman]], Zod introduces it to Kryptonite where the Hunter ends up seeking a piece of Kryptonite that is in [[Lex Luthor]]'s possession. During the fight with the Hunter, Superman plays dead by going into a suspended animation thanks to a device he gave to [[Lois Lane]]. After being awoken from his suspended animation, Superman destroys the Hunter and uses the Phantom Zone Projector to ensure that Zod stays in the Phantom Zone.\n* General Zod does not appear in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', but an amalgamation of him and [[Jax-Ur]] appears, called '''General Jax-Ur'''. He first appeared in the episode 'Blasts From the Past', where he was voiced by Ron Perlman. He was portrayed as similar to General Zod; a military genius who had attempted to overthrow the Science Council. His co-conspirator, and possible lover, is a beautiful Kryptonian female with long white hair named Mala (based on Ursa and Faora but named for a male Kryptonian from the comics). His proper title is High General Jax-Ur. During Jax-Ur and Mala's last appearance on Superman: The Animated Series, Jax-Ur reveals to Superman that a rift into the Phantom Zone had been torn open, releasing them into space. They were saved by nearby voyagers and soon took control over their planet. Upon seizing control of the planet, they had the inhabitants rebuild everything so that it was very reminiscent of Krypton, even going so far as to make the inhabitants wear clothes similar to that of Kryptonians. After meeting with a rebel, Superman found out that Jax-Ur and Mala intended to invade Earth. After Superman battled in space with the pair, Jax-Ur and Mala were sucked into a black hole.\n* The Silver Age version of Zod makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' episode \"Phantoms\". He is one of the many Phantom Zone prisoners attacking the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], his son '''Drax-Zod''' appears in this episode.\n* General Zod appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode \"Field Trip\", voiced by [[Jason J. Lewis]]. As Superman gives Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl a tour of the Fortress of Solitude and are shown the Phantom Zone Projector, General Zod, Faora, and Quex-Ul are released and Superman is accidentally sent to the Phantom Zone. Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl attempt to use a Green Kryptonite fragment on them only for it to be too small for them. Under the yellow sun, General Zod and his two followers gain superpowers and end up in a fight with Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl. As Blue Beetle and Stargirl hold off the Kryptonian villains, Firestorm uses Martin Stein's guidance to learn how to transmutate anything to Kryptonite. Testing on the ice, Firestorm transmutates it to Green Kryptonite which weakens General Zod and his two followers. Afterwards, Superman is freed from the Phantom Zone and General Zod and his followers are thrown into the Phantom Zone.\n* General Zod appears in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' episode \"SuperRabbit\" where he is modeled after [[Daffy Duck]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]). Here, he is Faora's boyfriend, but is inattentive and neglectful of her, as well as immature. Zod, Faora, and the robot Thunkian are first prosecuted for their crimes on Krypton by Jor-El and sentenced to the Phantom Zone, swearing revenge. After escaping several years later, they travel to Metropolis and battle SuperRabbit, defeating him and forcing him to retreat. Zod then becomes the city's ruler and renames himself King Zod, ordering a massive statue of himself built. SuperRabbit returns and convinces Faora and Thunkian to stop helping Zod by pointing out how much he mistreats them. Zod and SuperRabbit have a massive battle throughout the city where Zod is eventually knocked out by having his own statue knocked onto him. Zod and his followers are then sent back to the Phantom Zone. The entire adventure was actually a false story [[Bugs Bunny]] was telling Daffy Duck; the naive Daffy believes every word of it.\n* General Zod appears in ''[[DC_Super_Hero_Girls_(TV_series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' episode \"\"#DCSuperHeroBoys\" (voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]]).  Here, he is based on his film appearance from [[Superman: The Movie]] and [[Superman II]].  A rift is opened to the Phantom Zone and he is released, along with Ursa and Zod.  Zod and crew battle the DC Super Hero Girls and the \"Invicibros\" (a team consisting of [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], [[Aqualad]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]], and [[Green Arrow]]) in Metropolis.\n\n====Live-action====\n[[File:CamBlueZod.jpg|thumb|right|165px|[[Callum Blue]] as Major Zod in ''[[Smallville]]''.|alt=Zod in the TV program ''Smallville'', wearing a black athletic shirt, camouflage pants and Kryptonian dog-tags]]\n* Zod appears in the television series ''[[Smallville]]''. References to the character start in the [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth season]] premiere, in which Zod's Kryptonian disciples Aethyr and Nam-Ek search for [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] (a.k.a. Kal-El). The season finale concludes with [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], a humanoid Kryptonian [[artificial intelligence]], turning [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] into a superpowered vessel for General Zod, who was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone as a powerless disembodied wraith. In the [[Smallville (season 6)|sixth season]] premiere, Clark sends Zod's spirit once again in the Phantom Zone. [[Smallville (season 8)|Season eight]] introduces a version of [[Doomsday (DC Comics)|Doomsday]] named Davis Bloome (portrayed by [[Sam Witwer]]), a creature with hybrid DNA of Zod, Faora and several aggressive Kryptonian lifeforms. The season finale concludes with the Kryptonian Orb bringing to life a version of Zod (portrayed by an uncredited Sam Witwer). Witwer's contract gave him the option to return in Season 9 as Zod in the event the show was renewed. Though he considered his time on the show enjoyable and was flattered by the offer to stay on, he ultimately passed on the role as he felt it would be difficult for both the characters and audience to accept.<ref>https://www.cbr.com/smallvilles-a-tale-of-two-zods/amp/</ref>\n:* [[Smallville (season 9)|Season nine]] introduces the character as a younger version of Zod known as Major Zod (portrayed by [[Callum Blue]]); he and other Kryptonian soldiers from the Kryptonian city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] are resurrected on Earth as powerless [[cloning|clones]]. Despite Clark's attempts to help the Kandorians live in peace and prevent him from becoming evil, Major Zod's powers are eventually restored and he reactivates the powers of the Kandorian soldiers to earn their loyalty. He ultimately chooses to fulfill the destiny of the original Zod by embarking on a plan to rule Earth. In the season finale, Clark turns the Kandorian soldiers on Zod by exposing his murder of Faora and uses the Book of Rao to send the Kandorians to \"New Krypton\", another plane of existence. In the [[Smallville (season 10)|tenth season]] episode \"Dominion\", it is revealed that the Kandorians sent Major Zod to the Phantom Zone as punishment, where he and the original Zod's wraith united as one with memories of both. He lured Clark and [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] into the Phantom Zone, but they managed to escape and destroy the exit, sealing Zod and his minions inside forever.\n* General Zod appears in the season 2 finale of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Mark Gibbon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/cw-casts-mark-gibbon-as-general-zod-on-supergirl/|title=General Zod Joins Supergirl, Played By Smallville & Man Of Steel Alum|last=Couto|first=Anthony|date=|website=CBR.com|access-date=}}</ref> Under a [[Kryptonite|Silver Kryptonite]]-induced hallucination, Superman believes [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] is General Zod, his worst enemy, leading to a massive battle between the two until he is defeated and cured of the Silver Kryptonite. In the episode \"For Good\", Winn mentions that General Zod was killed by Superman, while Mon-El mentioned that [[Legion of Super-Heroes|The Legion]] battled him in the future, therefore implying that Zod will be resurrected at some point later.\n* A time-traveling General Dru-Zod appears in ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]'', portrayed by [[Colin Salmon]]. This version of the character is the son of Lyta-Zod and Seg-El, who is the father and grandfather to Jor-El and Kal-El respectively. Therefore, Zod and Jor-El are half-brothers, and Zod would be Kal-El's uncle, as in the ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'' canon.\n\n===Film===\n[[File:GeneralZodForPresident20084.jpg|thumb|General Zod ([[Terence Stamp]], center), [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]] ([[Jack O'Halloran]], left) and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] ([[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], right) in ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980)|alt=General Zod, Non (both bearded) and Ursa in the film ''Superman II'']]\n* General Zod appears in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' (1978) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980), portrayed by actor [[Terence Stamp]]. He is eventually defeated when Superman lures Zod and his henchmen to the Fortress of Solitude and tricks them into a chamber designed to remove Kryptonian powers. This portrayal is rated #58 on ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's \"100 Greatest Villains of All Time\" list.<ref>''Wizard'' #177</ref> Zod is notably the only other villain to appear in the film series originating from the comics beyond [[Lex Luthor]].\n* During the early development of ''[[Superman Returns]]'', film director [[Brett Ratner]] wanted Zod to appear. He wanted English actor [[Jude Law]] for the role, but Law turned down the role when [[Bryan Singer]] entered to direct the project after Ratner's departure to direct ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.<ref>http://www.slashfilm.com/jude-law-superman-story/</ref> As a result, Zod was omitted from the final script.<ref>http://screenrant.com/bryan-singer-superman-returns-criticism-darseid-sequel/</ref>\n\n[[File:Michael Shannon as Zod.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Shannon]] as General Zod in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013)]]\n* In the alternate world of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', Zod (voiced by [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]]) causes the destruction of Krypton by drilling the planet for its core in order to have the energy needed for his war machine and stops Jor-El from implanting his genetic code onto the egg created by Lara. Knowing the planet is about to blow up, Zod touches it to implant his genetic code, leading that world's version of Superman to grow up to look and behave more like Zod. Growing up, Superman is under the impression that his father was a good man due to having limited knowledge about Krypton. After being told about Zod, Superman calls his father a madman.\n* General Zod appears in the [[Zack Snyder]] film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), played by [[Michael Shannon]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Gregg | last=Kilday | title=Michael Shannon Set to Play Villain General Zod in 'Superman: Man of Steel' | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=April 10, 2011 | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/michael-shannon-set-play-villain-176799 | accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> This version is from Kandor and is the head of Krypton's Military Guild, who becomes so dissatisfied with the Law Council's decisions that he initiates a rebellion, for which he and his forces (called \"The Sword of Rao\") are captured and sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]], only to escape due to the destruction of Krypton also resulting in the destruction of their prison. Thirty-three years later, after the destruction of Krypton, Zod arrives on the planet Earth and extorts its people into handing over Kal-El (now going by the name [[Clark Kent]]) by threatening Earth's destruction. He reveals his plan to terraform Earth and repopulate the world with genetically-engineered Kryptonians, which will kill all of Earth's indigenous life in the process. Clark Kent (now dubbed \"Superman\"), with the help of the [[United States Armed Forces|United States Military]], thwarts his plan by creating a singularity that sucks all Kryptonians (save for Zod and Superman) back into the Phantom Zone. Zod then engages Superman in a lengthy, catastrophic fight throughout Metropolis and despite holding an upper hand throughout most of it, Superman ultimately subdues Zod. Furious, the General prepares to murder a trapped family and claims he will never stop, forcing Superman to reluctantly snap Zod's neck to save the family, killing him.\n* In ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', LexCorp has possession of Zod's corpse, ostensibly to study Kryptonian anatomy and origins. Lex Luthor discovers Kryptonians' vulnerability to kryptonite and uses this knowledge and Zod's fingerprints to access the ancient Kryptonian scout ship.  Using Zod's body and his own blood, Luthor creates a \"[[Doomsday (comics)|Kryptonian Deformity]]\". \n* General Zod appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''. He makes a brief cameo on CNN News in a clip showing Superman fighting him and then projecting him up into the Phantom Zone. However, he is not present in the Phantom Zone scenes afterwards.\n\n===Video games===\n* The 1988 ''[[Superman (Kemco game)|Superman]]'' [[Nintendo|NES]] game has Zod, Ursa, and Non as the final bosses whom Superman must defeat in order to win the game.

He appears as an enforcer of Lord Vortech and is the boss of the [[Ghostbusters]] world.\n* General Zod is mentioned by [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' when she compares Superman's tyrannical methods to his. Superman later responds that Krypton would be alive if Jor-El were more like Zod to which Supergirl asks if Superman is the son of Jor-El or Zod.

Anderson]], {{ISBN|0-06-134074-X}}), General Zod (also known as Commissioner Dru-Zod) is the son of Cor-Zod (former head of the Kryptonian Council). Initially a middle-level bureaucrat, he takes advantage of a major planetary cataclysm and the apparent decapitation of the government to seize absolute power as a military despot. He is ultimately overthrown by a resistance movement led by scientist [[Jor-El]] and his brother, civic leader [[Zor-El]]. They had formerly worked with Zod until his ambitions and misuse of Jor-El's Rao Beam and the Phantom Zone showed them his true nature and turned them against him. He and his two henchmen are banished forever to the Phantom Zone. The reactionary Council, however, decide to make sure Zod can never be released and, in doing so, snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. What the comet, pressures building up within Krypton and Rao's increasing instability fail to accomplish, is ironically achieved by the actions of Krypton's Council out of an irrational fear that Jor-El might free Zod and his minions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Superman enemies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{gcdb|type=character|search=General+Zod|title=General Zod}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=4089|title=General Zod}}\n*[http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/general_zod&p=1 DCComics.com - Origin of General Zod]\n*{{DCdatabase|Zod}}\n*[http://www.generalzod.net GeneralZod.net] - a humor website featuring General Zod\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120229212636/http://alankistler.squarespace.com/journal/2009/4/2/kistlers-history-of-general-zod.html  Alan Kistler's Profile On: ZOD!] - Comic book historian Alan Kistler does an in-depth article reviewing the long history of Zod from 1961 all the way to 2005, going into detail on the various incarnations and changes in the character.
