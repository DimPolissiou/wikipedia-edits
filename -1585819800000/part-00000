A famous non-local theory is the [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]].\n\n== Motivation ==\nAs per its [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation]], quantum mechanics is non-deterministic, meaning that it generally does not predict the outcome of any measurement with certainty. Instead, it indicates what the probabilities of the outcomes are, with the indeterminism of observable quantities constrained by the [[uncertainty principle]]. The question arises whether there might be some deeper reality hidden beneath quantum mechanics, to be described by a more fundamental theory that can always predict the outcome of each measurement with certainty: if the exact properties of every subatomic particle were known the entire system could be modeled exactly using deterministic physics similar to classical physics.\n\nIn other words, it is conceivable that quantum mechanics is an incomplete description of nature. The designation of variables as underlying \"hidden\" variables depends on the level of physical description (so, for example, \"if a gas is described in terms of temperature, pressure, and volume, then the velocities of the individual atoms in the gas would be hidden variables\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Marjorie Senechal|Senechal M]], Cronin J |year=2001 |title=Social influences on quantum mechanics?-I |journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=15\u201317 |doi=10.1007/BF03024596 }}</ref>). Physicists supporting De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory maintain that underlying the observed probabilistic nature of the universe is a deterministic objective foundation/property\u2014the hidden variable. Others, however, believe that there is no deeper deterministic reality in quantum mechanics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nA lack of a kind of [[Philosophical realism|realism]] (understood here as asserting independent existence and evolution of physical quantities, such as position or momentum, without the process of measurement) is crucial in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]. Realistic interpretations (which were already incorporated, to an extent, into the physics of Feynman<ref>Individual diagrams are often split into several parts, which may occur beyond observation; only the diagram as a whole describes an observed event.</ref>), on the other hand, assume that particles have certain trajectories. Under such view, these trajectories will [[Almost all|almost always]] be continuous, which follows both from the finitude of the perceived speed of light (\"leaps\" should rather be precluded) and, more importantly, from the principle of least action, as [[Path integral formulation#Quantum action principle|deduced in quantum physics]] by Dirac. But continuous movement, in accordance with the [[Continuous function#Definition in terms of limits of functions|mathematical definition]], implies deterministic movement for a range of time arguments;<ref>For every subset of points within a range, a value for every argument from the subset will be determined by the points in the neighbourhood. Thus, as a whole, the evolution in time can be described (for a specific time interval) as a function, e.g. a linear one or an arc. See [[Continuous function#Definition in terms of limits of functions]]</ref> and thus realism is, under modern physics, one more reason for seeking (at least certain limited) determinism and thus a hidden-variable theory (especially that such theory exists: see [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory|De Broglie\u2013Bohm interpretation]]).\n\nAlthough determinism was initially a major motivation for physicists looking for hidden-variable theories, non-deterministic theories trying to explain what the supposed reality underlying the quantum mechanics formalism looks like are also considered hidden-variable theories; for example [[Edward Nelson]]'s [[Stochastic interpretation|stochastic mechanics]].\n\n== \"God does not play dice\" ==\nIn June 1926, [[Max Born]] published a paper, \"Zur Quantenmechanik der Sto\u00dfvorg\u00e4nge\" (\"Quantum Mechanics of Collision Phenomena\") in the scientific journal ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'', in which he was the first to clearly enunciate the probabilistic interpretation of the quantum [[wavefunction|wave function]], which had been introduced by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] earlier in the year. Born concluded the paper as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Here the whole problem of determinism comes up. From the standpoint of our quantum mechanics there is no quantity which in any individual case causally fixes the consequence of the collision; but also experimentally we have so far no reason to believe that there are some inner properties of the atom which conditions a definite outcome for the collision. Ought we to hope later to discover such properties ... and determine them in individual cases? Or ought we to believe that the agreement of theory and experiment\u2014as to the impossibility of prescribing conditions for a causal evolution\u2014is a pre-established harmony founded on the nonexistence of such conditions? I myself am inclined to give up determinism in the world of atoms. But that is a philosophical question for which physical arguments alone are not decisive.</blockquote>\n\nBorn's interpretation of the wave function was criticized by Schr\u00f6dinger, who had previously attempted to interpret it in real physical terms, but [[Albert Einstein]]'s response became one of the earliest and most famous assertions that quantum mechanics is incomplete:\n\n<blockquote>Quantum mechanics is very worthy of regard. But an inner voice tells me that this is not yet the right track. The theory yields much, but it hardly brings us closer to the Old One's secrets. I, in any case, am convinced that ''He'' does not play dice.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Born\u2013Einstein letters: correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born from 1916\u20131955, with commentaries by Max Born|year=1971|publisher=Macmillan|page=91}}</ref><ref>[https://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/legacy/unified.php Cache of the Einstein section of the American Museum of Natural History]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Niels Bohr]] reportedly replied to Einstein's later expression of this sentiment by advising him to \"stop telling God what to do.\"<ref>This is a common paraphrasing.  Bohr recollected his reply to Einstein at the 1927 [[Solvay Congress]] in his essay \"Discussion with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics\", in ''Albert Einstein, Philosopher\u2013Scientist'', ed. Paul Arthur Shilpp, Harper, 1949, p. 211: \"...in spite of all divergencies of approach and opinion, a most humorous spirit animated the discussions.  On his side, Einstein mockingly asked us whether we could really believe that the providential authorities took recourse to dice-playing (\"''ob der liebe Gott w\u00fcrfelt''\"), to which I replied by pointing at the great caution, already called for by ancient thinkers, in ascribing attributes to Providence in everyday language.\"  Werner Heisenberg, who also attended the congress, recalled the exchange in ''Encounters with Einstein'', Princeton University Press, 1983, p. 117,: \"But he [Einstein] still stood by his watchword, which he clothed in the words: 'God does not play at dice.'  To which Bohr could only answer: 'But still, it cannot be for us to tell God, how he is to run the world.'\"</ref>\n\n== Early attempts at hidden-variable theories ==\n\nShortly after making his famous \"God does not play dice\" comment, Einstein attempted to formulate a deterministic counter proposal to quantum mechanics, presenting a paper at a meeting of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin, on 5 May 1927, titled \"Bestimmt Schr\u00f6dinger's Wellenmechanik die Bewegung eines Systems vollst\u00e4ndig oder nur im Sinne der Statistik?\" (\"Does Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics determine the motion of a system completely or only in the statistical sense?\").<ref>[http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000034338 Albert Einstein Archives] reel 2, item 100</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1355219896000159/1-s2.0-S1355219896000159-main.pdf?_tid=06ae7b37-6825-472b-8be3-f515851ab7f8&acdnat=1544206721_2e803b8f2bcddf0b2244b9437c009c33|title=Einstein\u2019s 1927 Unpublished Hidden-Variable Theory: Its Background,Context and Significance|website=ac.els-cdn.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  However, as the paper was being prepared for publication in the academy's journal, Einstein decided to withdraw it, possibly because he discovered that, contrary to his intention, it implied [[separable state|non-separability]] of [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] systems, which he regarded as absurd.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baggott |first=Jim |year=2011 |title=The Quantum Story: A History in 40 Moments |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=116\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[Solvay Conference#Fifth Conference|Fifth Solvay Congress]], held in Belgium in October 1927 and attended by all the major theoretical physicists of the era, [[Louis de Broglie]] presented [[Pilot wave theory|his own version of a deterministic hidden-variable theory]], apparently unaware of Einstein's aborted attempt earlier in the year. In his theory, every particle had an associated, hidden \"pilot wave\" which served to guide its trajectory through space. The theory was subject to criticism at the Congress, particularly by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], which de Broglie did not adequately answer. De Broglie abandoned the theory shortly thereafter.\n\n== Declaration of completeness of quantum mechanics, and the Bohr\u2013Einstein debates ==\n{{Main|Bohr\u2013Einstein debates}}\nAlso at the Fifth Solvay Congress, Max Born and [[Werner Heisenberg]] made a presentation summarizing the recent tremendous theoretical development of quantum mechanics. At the conclusion of the presentation, they declared:\n\n<blockquote>[W]hile we consider ... a quantum mechanical treatment of the electromagnetic field ... as not yet finished, we consider quantum mechanics to be a closed theory, whose fundamental physical and mathematical assumptions are no longer susceptible of any modification....\n\nOn the question of the 'validity of the law of causality' we have this opinion: as long as one takes into account only experiments that lie in the domain of our currently acquired physical and quantum mechanical experience, the assumption of indeterminism in principle, here taken as fundamental, agrees with experience.<ref>Max Born and Werner Heisenberg, \"Quantum mechanics\", proceedings of the Fifth Solvay Congress.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough there is no record of Einstein responding to Born and Heisenberg during the technical sessions of the Fifth Solvay Congress, he did challenge the completeness of quantum mechanics during informal discussions over meals, presenting a [[thought experiment]] intended to demonstrate that quantum mechanics could not be entirely correct. He did likewise during the Sixth Solvay Congress held in 1930. Both times, [[Niels Bohr]] is generally considered to have successfully defended quantum mechanics by discovering errors in Einstein's arguments.\n\n== EPR paradox ==\n{{Main|EPR paradox}}\n\nThe debates between Bohr and Einstein essentially concluded in 1935, when Einstein finally expressed what is widely considered his best argument against the completeness of quantum mechanics. [[EPR paradox|Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen]] had proposed their definition of a \"complete\" description as one that uniquely determines the values of all its measurable properties.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=A. |last=Einstein |first2=B. |last2=Podolsky |first3=N. |last3=Rosen |year=1935 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue= |pages=777\u2013780 |doi=10.1103/physrev.47.777 |bibcode=1935PhRv...47..777E }}</ref> Einstein later summarized their argument as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Consider a mechanical system consisting of two partial systems ''A'' and ''B'' which interact with each other only during a limited time. Let the ''\u03c8'' function [i.e., [[wavefunction]]] before their interaction be given. Then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation will furnish the ''\u03c8'' function after the interaction has taken place. Let us now determine the physical state of the partial system ''A'' as completely as possible by measurements. Then quantum mechanics allows us to determine the ''\u03c8'' function of the partial system ''B'' from the measurements made, and from the ''\u03c8'' function of the total system. This determination, however, gives a result which depends upon which of the physical quantities (observables) of ''A'' have been measured (for instance, coordinates or momenta). Since there can be only one physical state of ''B'' after the interaction which cannot reasonably be considered to depend on the particular measurement we perform on the system ''A'' separated from ''B'' it may be concluded that the ''\u03c8'' function is not unambiguously coordinated to the physical state. This coordination of several ''\u03c8'' functions to the same physical state of system ''B'' shows again that the ''\u03c8'' function cannot be interpreted as a (complete) description of a physical state of a single system.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Einstein A |year=1936 |title=Physics and Reality |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=221}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBohr answered Einstein's challenge as follows:\n\n<blockquote>[The argument of] Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen contains an ambiguity as regards the meaning of the expression \"without in any way disturbing a system.\" ... [E]ven at this stage [i.e., the measurement of, for example, a particle that is part of an [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] pair], there is essentially the question of an influence on the very conditions which define the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior of the system. Since these conditions constitute an inherent element of the description of any phenomenon to which the term \"physical reality\" can be properly attached, we see that the argumentation of the mentioned authors does not justify their conclusion that quantum-mechanical description is essentially incomplete.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Bohr N |year=1935 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? |journal=Physical Review |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=700 |url=http://prola.aps.org/pdf/PR/v48/i8/p696_1 |doi=10.1103/physrev.48.696|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48..696B }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBohr is here choosing to define a \"physical reality\" as limited to a phenomenon that is immediately observable by an arbitrarily chosen and explicitly specified technique, using his own special definition of the term 'phenomenon'.

If, on the other hand, statistical correlations resulting from [[quantum entanglement]] could not be explained by local hidden variables, the Bell inequality would be violated. Another [[no-go theorem]] concerning hidden-variable theories is the [[Kochen\u2013Specker theorem]].\n\nPhysicists such as [[Alain Aspect]] and Paul Kwiat have performed [[Bell test experiments|experiments]] that have found violations of these inequalities up to 242 standard deviations<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kwiat P.

This rules out local hidden-variable theories, but does not rule out non-local ones. Theoretically, there could be [[Bell test loopholes|experimental problems]] that affect the validity of the experimental findings.\n\n[[Gerard 't Hooft]] has disputed the validity of Bell's theorem on the basis of the [[superdeterminism]] loophole and proposed some ideas to construct local deterministic models.<ref>G 't Hooft, ''The Free-Will Postulate in Quantum Mechanics'' [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701097]; ''Entangled quantum states in a local deterministic theory'' [https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3408]</ref>\n\n== Bohm's hidden-variable theory ==\n{{Main|de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory}}\n\nAssuming the validity of Bell's theorem, any deterministic hidden-variable theory that is [[consistency|consistent]] with [[quantum mechanics]] would have to be [[Principle of locality|non-local]], maintaining the existence of instantaneous or faster-than-light relations (correlations) between physically separated entities. The currently best-known hidden-variable theory, the \"causal\" interpretation of the physicist and philosopher [[David Bohm]], originally published in 1952, is a ''non-local hidden-variable theory''. Bohm unknowingly rediscovered (and extended) the idea that Louis de Broglie had proposed in 1927 (and abandoned) \u2013 hence this theory is commonly called \"de Broglie-Bohm theory\". Bohm posited ''both'' the quantum particle, e.g. an electron, and a hidden 'guiding wave' that governs its motion. Thus, in this theory electrons are quite clearly particles\u2014when a [[double-slit experiment]] is performed, its trajectory goes through one slit rather than the other. Also, the slit passed through is not random but is governed by the (hidden) guiding wave, resulting in the wave pattern that is observed. Since the location where the particles start in the double-slit experiment is unknown, the initial position of the particle is the hidden variable.\n\nSuch a view does not contradict the idea of local events that is used in both classical atomism and [[relativity theory]] as Bohm's theory (and quantum mechanics) are still locally causal (that is, information travel is still restricted to the speed of light) but allow non-local correlations. It points to a view of a more [[Holism in science|holistic]], mutually interpenetrating and interacting world. Indeed, Bohm himself stressed the holistic aspect of quantum theory in his later years, when he became interested in the ideas of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]].\n\nIn Bohm's interpretation, the (non-local) [[quantum potential]] constitutes an implicate (hidden) order which organizes a particle, and which may itself be the result of yet a further implicate order: a ''superimplicate order'' which organizes a field.<ref>David Pratt: [http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw/science/prat-boh.htm \"David Bohm and the Implicate Order\"]. Appeared in ''Sunrise magazine'', February/March 1993, Theosophical University Press</ref> Nowadays Bohm's theory is considered to be one of many [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] which give a [[Scientific realism|realist]] interpretation, and not merely a [[Positivism|positivistic]] one, to quantum-mechanical calculations.

A famous non-local theory is the [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]].\n\n== Motivation ==\nAs per its [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation]], quantum mechanics is non-deterministic, meaning that it generally does not predict the outcome of any measurement with certainty. Instead, it indicates what the probabilities of the outcomes are, with the indeterminism of observable quantities constrained by the [[uncertainty principle]]. The question arises whether there might be some deeper reality hidden beneath quantum mechanics, to be described by a more fundamental theory that can always predict the outcome of each measurement with certainty: if the exact properties of every subatomic particle were known the entire system could be modeled exactly using deterministic physics similar to classical physics.\n\nIn other words, it is conceivable that quantum mechanics is an incomplete description of nature. The designation of variables as underlying \"hidden\" variables depends on the level of physical description (so, for example, \"if a gas is described in terms of temperature, pressure, and volume, then the velocities of the individual atoms in the gas would be hidden variables\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Marjorie Senechal|Senechal M]], Cronin J |year=2001 |title=Social influences on quantum mechanics?-I |journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=15\u201317 |doi=10.1007/BF03024596 }}</ref>). Physicists supporting De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory maintain that underlying the observed probabilistic nature of the universe is a deterministic objective foundation/property\u2014the hidden variable. Others, however, believe that there is no deeper deterministic reality in quantum mechanics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nA lack of a kind of [[Philosophical realism|realism]] (understood here as asserting independent existence and evolution of physical quantities, such as position or momentum, without the process of measurement) is crucial in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]. Realistic interpretations (which were already incorporated, to an extent, into the physics of Feynman<ref>Individual diagrams are often split into several parts, which may occur beyond observation; only the diagram as a whole describes an observed event.</ref>), on the other hand, assume that particles have certain trajectories. Under such view, these trajectories will [[Almost all|almost always]] be continuous, which follows both from the finitude of the perceived speed of light (\"leaps\" should rather be precluded) and, more importantly, from the principle of least action, as [[Path integral formulation#Quantum action principle|deduced in quantum physics]] by Dirac. But continuous movement, in accordance with the [[Continuous function#Definition in terms of limits of functions|mathematical definition]], implies deterministic movement for a range of time arguments;<ref>For every subset of points within a range, a value for every argument from the subset will be determined by the points in the neighbourhood. Thus, as a whole, the evolution in time can be described (for a specific time interval) as a function, e.g. a linear one or an arc. See [[Continuous function#Definition in terms of limits of functions]]</ref> and thus realism is, under modern physics, one more reason for seeking (at least certain limited) determinism and thus a hidden-variable theory (especially that such theory exists: see [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory|De Broglie\u2013Bohm interpretation]]).\n\nAlthough determinism was initially a major motivation for physicists looking for hidden-variable theories, non-deterministic theories trying to explain what the supposed reality underlying the quantum mechanics formalism looks like are also considered hidden-variable theories; for example [[Edward Nelson]]'s [[Stochastic interpretation|stochastic mechanics]].\n\n== \"God does not play dice\" ==\nIn June 1926, [[Max Born]] published a paper, \"Zur Quantenmechanik der Sto\u00dfvorg\u00e4nge\" (\"Quantum Mechanics of Collision Phenomena\") in the scientific journal ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'', in which he was the first to clearly enunciate the probabilistic interpretation of the quantum [[wavefunction|wave function]], which had been introduced by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] earlier in the year. Born concluded the paper as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Here the whole problem of determinism comes up. From the standpoint of our quantum mechanics there is no quantity which in any individual case causally fixes the consequence of the collision; but also experimentally we have so far no reason to believe that there are some inner properties of the atom which conditions a definite outcome for the collision. Ought we to hope later to discover such properties ... and determine them in individual cases? Or ought we to believe that the agreement of theory and experiment\u2014as to the impossibility of prescribing conditions for a causal evolution\u2014is a pre-established harmony founded on the nonexistence of such conditions? I myself am inclined to give up determinism in the world of atoms. But that is a philosophical question for which physical arguments alone are not decisive.</blockquote>\n\nBorn's interpretation of the wave function was criticized by Schr\u00f6dinger, who had previously attempted to interpret it in real physical terms, but [[Albert Einstein]]'s response became one of the earliest and most famous assertions that quantum mechanics is incomplete:\n\n<blockquote>Quantum mechanics is very worthy of regard. But an inner voice tells me that this is not yet the right track. The theory yields much, but it hardly brings us closer to the Old One's secrets. I, in any case, am convinced that ''He'' does not play dice.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Born\u2013Einstein letters: correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born from 1916\u20131955, with commentaries by Max Born|year=1971|publisher=Macmillan|page=91}}</ref><ref>[https://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/legacy/unified.php Cache of the Einstein section of the American Museum of Natural History]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Niels Bohr]] reportedly replied to Einstein's later expression of this sentiment by advising him to \"stop telling God what to do.\"<ref>This is a common paraphrasing.  Bohr recollected his reply to Einstein at the 1927 [[Solvay Congress]] in his essay \"Discussion with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics\", in ''Albert Einstein, Philosopher\u2013Scientist'', ed. Paul Arthur Shilpp, Harper, 1949, p. 211: \"...in spite of all divergencies of approach and opinion, a most humorous spirit animated the discussions.  On his side, Einstein mockingly asked us whether we could really believe that the providential authorities took recourse to dice-playing (\"''ob der liebe Gott w\u00fcrfelt''\"), to which I replied by pointing at the great caution, already called for by ancient thinkers, in ascribing attributes to Providence in everyday language.\"  Werner Heisenberg, who also attended the congress, recalled the exchange in ''Encounters with Einstein'', Princeton University Press, 1983, p. 117,: \"But he [Einstein] still stood by his watchword, which he clothed in the words: 'God does not play at dice.'  To which Bohr could only answer: 'But still, it cannot be for us to tell God, how he is to run the world.'\"</ref>\n\n== Early attempts at hidden-variable theories ==\n\nShortly after making his famous \"God does not play dice\" comment, Einstein attempted to formulate a deterministic counter proposal to quantum mechanics, presenting a paper at a meeting of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin, on 5 May 1927, titled \"Bestimmt Schr\u00f6dinger's Wellenmechanik die Bewegung eines Systems vollst\u00e4ndig oder nur im Sinne der Statistik?\" (\"Does Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics determine the motion of a system completely or only in the statistical sense?\").<ref>[http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000034338 Albert Einstein Archives] reel 2, item 100</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1355219896000159/1-s2.0-S1355219896000159-main.pdf?_tid=06ae7b37-6825-472b-8be3-f515851ab7f8&acdnat=1544206721_2e803b8f2bcddf0b2244b9437c009c33|title=Einstein\u2019s 1927 Unpublished Hidden-Variable Theory: Its Background,Context and Significance|website=ac.els-cdn.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  However, as the paper was being prepared for publication in the academy's journal, Einstein decided to withdraw it, possibly because he discovered that, contrary to his intention, it implied [[separable state|non-separability]] of [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] systems, which he regarded as absurd.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baggott |first=Jim |year=2011 |title=The Quantum Story: A History in 40 Moments |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=116\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[Solvay Conference#Fifth Conference|Fifth Solvay Congress]], held in Belgium in October 1927 and attended by all the major theoretical physicists of the era, [[Louis de Broglie]] presented [[Pilot wave theory|his own version of a deterministic hidden-variable theory]], apparently unaware of Einstein's aborted attempt earlier in the year. In his theory, every particle had an associated, hidden \"pilot wave\" which served to guide its trajectory through space. The theory was subject to criticism at the Congress, particularly by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], which de Broglie did not adequately answer. De Broglie abandoned the theory shortly thereafter.\n\n== Declaration of completeness of quantum mechanics, and the Bohr\u2013Einstein debates ==\n{{Main|Bohr\u2013Einstein debates}}\nAlso at the Fifth Solvay Congress, Max Born and [[Werner Heisenberg]] made a presentation summarizing the recent tremendous theoretical development of quantum mechanics. At the conclusion of the presentation, they declared:\n\n<blockquote>[W]hile we consider ... a quantum mechanical treatment of the electromagnetic field ... as not yet finished, we consider quantum mechanics to be a closed theory, whose fundamental physical and mathematical assumptions are no longer susceptible of any modification....\n\nOn the question of the 'validity of the law of causality' we have this opinion: as long as one takes into account only experiments that lie in the domain of our currently acquired physical and quantum mechanical experience, the assumption of indeterminism in principle, here taken as fundamental, agrees with experience.<ref>Max Born and Werner Heisenberg, \"Quantum mechanics\", proceedings of the Fifth Solvay Congress.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough there is no record of Einstein responding to Born and Heisenberg during the technical sessions of the Fifth Solvay Congress, he did challenge the completeness of quantum mechanics during informal discussions over meals, presenting a [[thought experiment]] intended to demonstrate that quantum mechanics could not be entirely correct. He did likewise during the Sixth Solvay Congress held in 1930. Both times, [[Niels Bohr]] is generally considered to have successfully defended quantum mechanics by discovering errors in Einstein's arguments.\n\n== EPR paradox ==\n{{Main|EPR paradox}}\n\nThe debates between Bohr and Einstein essentially concluded in 1935, when Einstein finally expressed what is widely considered his best argument against the completeness of quantum mechanics. [[EPR paradox|Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen]] had proposed their definition of a \"complete\" description as one that uniquely determines the values of all its measurable properties.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=A. |last=Einstein |first2=B. |last2=Podolsky |first3=N. |last3=Rosen |year=1935 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue= |pages=777\u2013780 |doi=10.1103/physrev.47.777 }}</ref> Einstein later summarized their argument as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Consider a mechanical system consisting of two partial systems ''A'' and ''B'' which interact with each other only during a limited time. Let the ''\u03c8'' function [i.e., [[wavefunction]]] before their interaction be given. Then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation will furnish the ''\u03c8'' function after the interaction has taken place. Let us now determine the physical state of the partial system ''A'' as completely as possible by measurements. Then quantum mechanics allows us to determine the ''\u03c8'' function of the partial system ''B'' from the measurements made, and from the ''\u03c8'' function of the total system. This determination, however, gives a result which depends upon which of the physical quantities (observables) of ''A'' have been measured (for instance, coordinates or momenta). Since there can be only one physical state of ''B'' after the interaction which cannot reasonably be considered to depend on the particular measurement we perform on the system ''A'' separated from ''B'' it may be concluded that the ''\u03c8'' function is not unambiguously coordinated to the physical state. This coordination of several ''\u03c8'' functions to the same physical state of system ''B'' shows again that the ''\u03c8'' function cannot be interpreted as a (complete) description of a physical state of a single system.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Einstein A |year=1936 |title=Physics and Reality |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=221}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBohr answered Einstein's challenge as follows:\n\n<blockquote>[The argument of] Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen contains an ambiguity as regards the meaning of the expression \"without in any way disturbing a system.\" ... [E]ven at this stage [i.e., the measurement of, for example, a particle that is part of an [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] pair], there is essentially the question of an influence on the very conditions which define the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior of the system. Since these conditions constitute an inherent element of the description of any phenomenon to which the term \"physical reality\" can be properly attached, we see that the argumentation of the mentioned authors does not justify their conclusion that quantum-mechanical description is essentially incomplete.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Bohr N |year=1935 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? |journal=Physical Review |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=700 |url=http://prola.aps.org/pdf/PR/v48/i8/p696_1 |doi=10.1103/physrev.48.696|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48..696B }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBohr is here choosing to define a \"physical reality\" as limited to a phenomenon that is immediately observable by an arbitrarily chosen and explicitly specified technique, using his own special definition of the term 'phenomenon'.

If, on the other hand, statistical correlations resulting from [[quantum entanglement]] could not be explained by local hidden variables, the Bell inequality would be violated. Another [[no-go theorem]] concerning hidden-variable theories is the [[Kochen\u2013Specker theorem]].\n\nPhysicists such as [[Alain Aspect]] and Paul Kwiat have performed [[Bell test experiments|experiments]] that have found violations of these inequalities up to 242 standard deviations<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kwiat P.

This rules out local hidden-variable theories, but does not rule out non-local ones. Theoretically, there could be [[Bell test loopholes|experimental problems]] that affect the validity of the experimental findings.\n\n[[Gerard 't Hooft]] has disputed the validity of Bell's theorem on the basis of the [[superdeterminism]] loophole and proposed some ideas to construct local deterministic models.<ref>G 't Hooft, ''The Free-Will Postulate in Quantum Mechanics'' [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701097]; ''Entangled quantum states in a local deterministic theory'' [https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3408]</ref>\n\n== Bohm's hidden-variable theory ==\n{{Main|de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory}}\n\nAssuming the validity of Bell's theorem, any deterministic hidden-variable theory that is [[consistency|consistent]] with [[quantum mechanics]] would have to be [[Principle of locality|non-local]], maintaining the existence of instantaneous or faster-than-light relations (correlations) between physically separated entities. The currently best-known hidden-variable theory, the \"causal\" interpretation of the physicist and philosopher [[David Bohm]], originally published in 1952, is a ''non-local hidden-variable theory''. Bohm unknowingly rediscovered (and extended) the idea that Louis de Broglie had proposed in 1927 (and abandoned) \u2013 hence this theory is commonly called \"de Broglie-Bohm theory\". Bohm posited ''both'' the quantum particle, e.g. an electron, and a hidden 'guiding wave' that governs its motion. Thus, in this theory electrons are quite clearly particles\u2014when a [[double-slit experiment]] is performed, its trajectory goes through one slit rather than the other. Also, the slit passed through is not random but is governed by the (hidden) guiding wave, resulting in the wave pattern that is observed. Since the location where the particles start in the double-slit experiment is unknown, the initial position of the particle is the hidden variable.\n\nSuch a view does not contradict the idea of local events that is used in both classical atomism and [[relativity theory]] as Bohm's theory (and quantum mechanics) are still locally causal (that is, information travel is still restricted to the speed of light) but allow non-local correlations. It points to a view of a more [[Holism in science|holistic]], mutually interpenetrating and interacting world. Indeed, Bohm himself stressed the holistic aspect of quantum theory in his later years, when he became interested in the ideas of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]].\n\nIn Bohm's interpretation, the (non-local) [[quantum potential]] constitutes an implicate (hidden) order which organizes a particle, and which may itself be the result of yet a further implicate order: a ''superimplicate order'' which organizes a field.<ref>David Pratt: [http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw/science/prat-boh.htm \"David Bohm and the Implicate Order\"]. Appeared in ''Sunrise magazine'', February/March 1993, Theosophical University Press</ref> Nowadays Bohm's theory is considered to be one of many [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] which give a [[Scientific realism|realist]] interpretation, and not merely a [[Positivism|positivistic]] one, to quantum-mechanical calculations.

The pyrrolidine ring structure is present in numerous natural [[alkaloid]]s such as [[nicotine]] and [[hygrine]]. It is found in many drugs such as [[procyclidine]] and [[bepridil]]. It also forms the basis for the [[racetam]] compounds (''e.g.'' [[piracetam]], [[aniracetam]]).
