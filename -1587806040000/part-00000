{"title_page": "Flat-chested kitten syndrome", "text_new": "'''Flat-chested kitten syndrome (FCKS)''', is a disorder in [[cat]]s, wherein kittens develop a compression of the [[thorax]] (chest/ribcage) caused by lung collapse. This is a soft-tissue problem and is not caused by vertebral or bony malformation. However lung collapse can be a secondary symptom caused by bony deformity affecting the thorax such as pectus excavatum. In mild cases, the underside of the chest becomes flattened (hence the name of the condition); in extreme cases the entire thorax is flattened, looking as if the kitten has been stepped on. The kitten will appear to go from normal to flat in the space of about 2\u20133 hours, and will usually then stabilise. FCKS is frequently misdiagnosed as pectus excavatum due to inadequate veterinary literature or inexperience of the vet.\n\nFCKS is most frequently caused by collapsed lungs (and not as formerly believed, by a muscle spasm in the intercostal muscles). There are numerous causes for lung collapse, and therefore numerous causes for FCKS. One possible cause for flat chestedness that develops soon after birth is [[atelectasis]].\n\nCauses of [[atelectasis]] include insufficient attempts at respiration by the newborn, [[bronchial obstruction]], or absence of [[surfactant]] (a substance secreted by [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] that coats the lungs and prevents the surfaces from sticking together). Lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing lung collapse if severe. There can be many reasons for atelectasis in kittens, but probably the most common cause is [[Preterm birth|prematurity]]. Newborn atelectasis would not be unusual in a very large litter of kittens (such as 10), where the size of the litter may lead all the kittens to be small and mildly underdeveloped.\n\nUnlike human babies, kittens are born very immature: blind, deaf, the intestinal tract not fully developed etc., so even slight prematurity may tip them over the edge from being viable to non viable. Many FCKS kittens may have fallen just the wrong side of this boundary in their development at the time of birth. Further, if a kitten does not scream or open its lungs well enough at birth, even if it is fully mature and has sufficient surfactant, it may end up with atelectasis. Patches of atelectasis in the lungs mean that part of a lung is not operating properly. If the kitten goes to sleep and its respiratory rate drops, the patches of atelectasis can slowly expand until large areas of the lung collapse and cannot be reinflated. Good advice to any breeder therefore would be to ensure that kittens cry loudly when they are born, to make sure that the airways are clear, but also that the lungs expand as fully as possible. (This was the reason newborn babies were always held upside down immediately after birth (so that any residual fluid drains downwards) and smacked to make them cry strongly.)\n\nSome kittens suffer from congenital 'secondary' atelectasis, which presents shortly after birth. There have been no reports of kittens born flat (primary atelectasis). [[Hyaline membrane disease]] is a type of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn in which there is formation of a [[hyaline]]-like membrane lining the terminal respiratory passages, and this may also be a (rarer) cause of FCKS. Pressure from outside the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases&nbsp;\u2013 which may explain the development of FCKS in older kittens (e.g. 10 days old) who are not strong enough to breathe through even a light mucus, or who may have inhaled milk during suckling.\n\n[[Tumors]] and inhaled objects (possible if bedding contains loose fluff) can also cause obstruction or irritation of the airway, leading to lung collapse and secondary atelectasis. In an older cat the [[intercostal muscles]] are so well developed, and the ribs rigid enough that the ribcage will not flatten if the lung collapses: in kittens the bones are much more flexible, and the tendons and muscles more flaccid, allowing movement of the thorax into abnormal positions.\n\nOther causes of lung collapse can include diaphragmatic hernia, or diaphragmatic spasm (breeders report the position of the gut and thorax as appearing to be like a 'stalled hiccup'). Diaphragmatic spasm is easily checked by pinching the [[phrenic nerve]] in the neck between the fingertips. Kittens with this type of FCKS will improve almost immediately, but may require repeated pinching to prevent the spasm from recurring.\n\n== Evidential basis and statistical analysis ==\n[[File:FCKSbyBreed.png|thumb|Reports of kittens with FCKS by breed 1999-2018]]\n[[File:GCCF regAnalysis.png|thumb|GCCF statistics for numbers of kittens registered 1999-2018]]\nAlmost all reporting of FCKS is treated as anecdotal, since it comes from breeders and not from veterinary practitioners. However, in the absence of robust clinical studies breeder-reporting is the only source of information currently available. Reporting about type of FCKS is hampered by the lack of differentiation between one type and another by both breeders and vets. The data informing this article came from three sources:\n* Analysis of emails reporting cases of FCKS sent to the owner of a website giving information about the condition and methods of treatment, 1999-2019 [87 of these kittens were examined in person by the author]\n* Data gathered by the THINK project 2005-2015 who published an online questionnaire (the project is now defunct)\n* Directly solicited reports requested from 27 individual breeders of Abyssinian (4 responded) and 35 breeders of British Shorthair (2 responded) in the UK\nThe 20-year analysis was compared with the [http://www.gccfcats.org Governing Council of the Cat Fancy] in the UK (GCCF) analysis of numbers of kittens registered during the same period. The full report is to be published during 2020.<ref>Reference will be provided when publication information is available.</ref>\n\nOnly direct reports from owners (362) about their own cats or vets examining kittens (2) were considered. Kittens exhibiting any other condition (including pectus excavatum) were excluded. The overwhelming majority of reports (76%) were of single FCKS cases in a litter, with the remainder whole or part litters.\nThe data comprised 311 reports of litters of kittens in which one or more developed FCKS, for a total of 464 affected kittens (see table).\n\nReports in which the sex was specified showed breakdown by sex of male 56%/female 44%. 16 breeders reported that whereas they might have expected the smallest kitten in a litter (if any) to develop FCKS, it was the largest and strongest kittens that developed flat chests, and these were often males. The condition does not appear to be sex-linked, but the preponderance of male kittens in this reporting group may be due to the fact that males tend to be larger than females and these are the kittens getting most milk or suckling hardest because they are stronger, in which case the type of FCKS in these litters may have been due to colic caused by overfeeding (see Causes, below).\n\nReports originated from 21 countries (Australia (15), Austria (11), Belgium (2), Canada (8), Denmark (3), Finland (2), France (24), Germany (13), Hungary (1), Japan (2), Netherlands (14), New Zealand (6), Norway (5), Portugal (1), Singapore (1), Slovakia (1), South Africa (5), Sweden (11), Switzerland (1), UK (100), USA (85)) and covered 39 breeds (including non-pedigree domestic shorthair, non-pedigree domestic longhair, and some \u2018unrecognised\u2019 crosses between two pedigree breeds or pedigree breeds x DSH). 10 reports did not specify breed.\n\nHigh numbers of reports in certain breeds has in the past been taken to imply that some breeds are more prone to the condition than others, but the data is skewed by various factors: a) the numbers of kittens bred; b) cluster-reporting in response to articles in breed club circulars or c) the work of a particular group of breeders (cf Burmese) in attempting to address a problem that they had seen in their own lines d) the culture within an individual breed of information-sharing or reporting problems. Breeders are generally not inclined to discuss health issues because of a culture of blame and gossip, having a dramatic effect on information-sharing. No \u2018cluster\u2019 triggers have been identified for the relatively high number of reports in the Maine Coon or Bengal breeds, while the Burmese cat club commissioned a study into the condition in 1997 by Sturgess et al, and the THINK project solicited reports from Burmese breeders specifically. However statistics on the registration of kittens provided by the [http://www.gccfcats.org GCCF] show that Bengal, Burmese and Maine Coon are consistently in the top nine breeds by number of kittens registered (see table). The breeds showing highest numbers of kittens registered therefore broadly correlate demographically to reports of FCKS. More significant is perhaps the low number of reported cases in the British Shorthair (especially when compared with the Manx), but this seems to be attributable to the culture of breeders in that group.\n\nMortality: of 195 cases where the outcome was notified, 88 died, or were euthanised due to distress; 107 recovered and survived beyond 3 months of age. Those that recovered fully did not appear to suffer any long-term effects, although reporting is patchy.\n\nMentions of FCKS in the veterinary literature (usually no more than a single sentence) include no descriptive information and have no evidential basis, in particular the claim in Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976) that the condition may be hereditary, which has been repeated in subsequent literature.\n\n== Onset and diagnosis ==\nFCKS develops usually in kittens around three days of age, and sometimes affects whole litters, sometimes only individuals or part of a litter. Kittens can go flat any time during early maturation, some flattening as late as 10 days of age or (in very rare cases) later. It is possible that the later-developing cases are due to [[Respiratory tract infection]] or [[pneumonia]]. Until 2010 FCKS was believed to be caused by a spasm in the [[intercostal muscle|intercostal]] muscles, but re-examination of old post-mortem data (i.e. that kittens remain flat even when they are dead and therefore cannot maintain a muscular spasm) and new data has led to the conclusion that flattening is caused by failure of the [[lung]]s to inflate normally or, when it occurs in older kittens, by lung collapse. This cause is now cited by the veterinary community (Sturgess 2016) but without any source acknowledgement.\n\nGross physical symptoms include flattening of the underside of the thorax in moderate cases (a ridge can usually be felt along the sides of the ribcage, running parallel to the spine); complete flattening of the upper body in extreme cases (the kitten looks as if it has been stepped on); moderate to extreme effort and/or gasping during breathing; the gut is drawn upwards during the in-breath. Breathing is not usually rapid (as in pneumonia or pyrexia) but at a normal rate when compared with unaffected kittens. The position of the thorax and activity of the abdomen is not unlike that seen during normal hiccups, but the sudden spasm in hiccups is slowed down or halted in FCKS: where a hiccup releases, returning the body to a normal position, FCKS breathing does not release. There may be involvement with digestive difficulty in FCKS kittens (see Colic, below).\n[[File:FCKSnormalThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of normal cat thorax]]\n[[File:FCKSdeformedThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of thoracic deformities of flat chested kitten]]\n\n[[File:FCKSbanana.jpg|thumb|Banana used to demonstrate FCKS shape]]Determining whether a kitten has FCKS or not can be difficult with only text descriptions: a mild case of FCKS causes the thorax to feel similar to the shape of a banana when held curve downward. The ribcage is not fixed in position, and the most noticeable effect in mild cases is the ridge along the side of the ribcage.\n\nThe condition causes weight-gain to halt, respiratory distress, inability to feed normally and, in a significant proportion of cases, death. However, since a significant percentage of kittens survive the condition immediate euthanasia is not indicated, and supportive treatments can be employed to increase the likelihood of survival (see Treatment, below).\n\nThe condition is often misdiagnosed as ''[[Pectus excavatum]]'',<ref>Kit Sturgess et al: An investigation of Taurine levels as a possible cause of FCKS. Burmese Cat Club Newsletter 1980, [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/BCC/ downloadable pdf files accessible from this page]</ref> with which it has no direct connection, although FCKS kittens may also have PE. Although the condition is believed to be more prevalent in the Burmese breed it is found in every breed of cat, including non-pedigree domestic cats, and the apparent prevalence in the [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] is most likely due to better communication between breeders and reporting of the condition, as well as the naturally more barrel-shaped chest of this particular genotype.<ref>Edinburgh FAB resident, Royal Dick Veterinary Hospital: Report in ''FAB Journal'' (1993), vol. 31 (1) 71-72</ref> Since early reporting of the condition identified the Burmese as susceptible the [[Bengal (cat)|Bengal]] breed, with a similar physiology, has emerged, and shows a similarly large number of FCKS kittens, however this may be due to specific interest in the condition among those working with the breeds. It is reported in all breeds and in domestic non-pedigree cats, both those kept as pets and those living as 'barn cats'. An article in a Swedish cat club newsletter about FCKS led to a spike in reporting of the condition in Ragdolls in Sweden.\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:MauFCK.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian Mau kitten with FCKS]]\n|[[File:RexFCK.jpg|thumb|center|Rex kitten with FCKS and Kyphosis - note narrowing of thorax around the shoulders]]\n| [[File:Flat kitten b.png|thumb|center|Oriental kitten with moderate to extreme FCKS. Pectus Excavatum is not present. The kitten was wrapped in a 'corset' for about 2 weeks. It is now a healthy adult.]]\n|}\n\nThe syndrome is life-threatening in a significant number of cases (possibly around 40%) mainly due to a lack of understanding of the underlying cause of the condition, failure to treat colic (leading to slow starvation) and insufficient sources of information in veterinary literature.\n\n== Causes ==\n\n=== Genetic/Heredity ===\nThere is no statistical evidence to suggest that FCKS may be due to genetic factors: certain bloodlines ''seem'' to produce a preponderance of kittens with the condition, but this may be due to enhanced reporting within the breed. The literature citing heredity as a cause (Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976)) does not provide any evidential support and the information is repeated in later literature citing that source as authority. The majority of cases are of single kittens, with low but significant numbers of whole or part litters reported. Numerous breeders experience periods in which FCKS seems to occur over a number of matings, but then stops, suggesting an environmental cause. Incidences of the condition have been reported in many litters that were repeat matings of previously healthy litters; matings repeated after the incidence of FCKS do not produce flat kittens any more frequently than non-repeat matings; recovered FCKS that have been bred from have likewise not produced offspring that suffered from the condition any more frequently than normal cats, but numbers in this category are obviously low. It is possible that some lines in which the queens provide excessive milk may lead to colic-related FCKS in the kittens, leading to the supposition of heredity. Although after experiencing cases of FCKS most breeders do not repeat matings. In 59 cases of repeat matings 52 litters did '''not''' result in FCKS again while 7 did.\n\n=== Developmental ===\nIt is possible that the lung collapse in neo-nates (i.e. around 3 days of age) could be due to a lack of [[surfactant]] -  the coating of the inside of the lung that prevents the inner surfaces of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] from sticking together. (Causes of surfactant deficiency are not discussed here, but the role of surfactant is discussed in a number of articles in the ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' vol. 65, 1990.<ref>particularly B A Hills: The role of lung surfactant, ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' 1990, 65, 13-29</ref>). Kittens are born immature in many ways, and full inflation of the lungs does not happen immediately, but takes place gradually over a period of several days after birth. Although a kitten may seem active and thriving, its lungs will not be fully inflated until approx. day 3 after birth. Thus if inflation fails to happen correctly the [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] in the chest cavity will cause the ribcage&nbsp;\u2013 which is extremely flexible&nbsp;\u2013 to collapse inward, dragged in by the lungs, and '''not''' collapsing due to muscular cramping, and compressing the lungs.\n\n=== Infection ===\nNeo-natal and Later lung collapse may be due to lung infection, or possibly to a malfunction in the [[epiglottis]], causing the in-breath to draw air into the digestive tract rather than the lungs. A short term malfunction of this sort may be perpetuated by the resulting colic creating a feedback loop that interrupts the correct breathing process.\n\nAutopsy and analysis of [[Aspiration pneumonia|lung aspirate]] in a group of flat-chested kittens bred by a US Vet showed the presence of [[Cat flu|Herpes virus]].\n\n=== Diaphragmatic spasm ===\n[[File:Phrenic002.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of the Phrenic Nerve (diagram)</center>]]\nSpasm in the diaphragm leads to the muscle 'locking up' so that all breathing effort falls to the intercostal muscles. The resulting loss of movement causes the lungs to deflate gradually. This is easily diagnosed and treated (see Treatment below) by short-term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]].\n\n=== Colic ===\nA kitten that has difficulty in breathing is very likely also to suffer from [[colic]] (which can cause weight loss in the early development of a normal kitten), and a very small daily (or twice daily) dose of [[Liquid paraffin (medicinal)|liquid paraffin]] (one or two drops placed on the tongue of the kitten, or 0.1 ml) should help to alleviate this problem. FCKS kittens who do not maintain weight are usually among the group which die, but many of them may simply be unable to feed properly due to colic, becoming increasingly weak and lethargic, and fading due to malnutrition as much as to the thoracic problems.\n\nColic has many causes, but in a kitten with respiratory difficulty it is possible that a malfunction during the breathing process leads the kitten to swallow air instead of taking it into its lungs. The GI tract fills with air while the lungs do not receive a proper air supply, preventing them from inflating fully. Pressure from the stomach exacerbates the condition. Treating for colic with liquid paraffin seems to shorten recovery time from 4\u201310 weeks to a matter of days.\n\n== Treatment ==\n[[File:Position of phrenic nerve in cat.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of Phrenic nerve in a sleeping kitten. The nerve bifurcates and runs down both sides of the neck.</center>]]\nTreatment is difficult to define given the number of different causes and the wealth of anecdotal information collected by and from cat breeders. Treatments have hitherto been based on the assumption that FCKS is caused by a muscular [[spasm]], and their effectiveness is impossible to assess because some kittens will recover spontaneously without intervention. FCKS cannot be corrected surgically.\n\nDiaphragmatic spasm is easily tested for and treated by short term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]]. The nerve runs down the outside of the neck where the neck joins to the shoulder, within a bundle of muscles and tendons at this junction. The cluster can be pinched gently and held for a few seconds each time. Kittens with spasmodic FCKS will show almost immediate improvement, but the treatment may need to be repeated several times over a few days as the spasm may have a tendency to recur, particularly after suckling. It is sometimes evident that the spasm only affects one side of the diaphragm, as interruption of the nerve is only necessary or effective on one side.\n\nContinuous positive air pressure ([[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]]) is used in human babies with lung collapse, but this is impossible with kittens. It is possible that the success of some breeders in curing kittens by splinting the body, thus putting pressure on the ribcage, was successful as it has created the effect of positive air pressure, thus gradually re-inflating the lungs by pulling them open rather than pushing them open as is the case with CPAP (see below).\n\n=== Drugs ===\nThe use of [[steroids]] ([[Dexamethasone]]) coupled with an antibiotic ([[Amoxicillin]]) will support the kitten in a number of ways, the steroid enhancing maturation and the antibiotic addressing the possibility of underlying infection and compensating for the immuno-depressant properties of the steroid. The steroid will also encourage the kitten to feed more energetically, keeping its weight up. However the primary supportive mechanism must be nutritional. Kittens who are only supported with feeding and do not receive drugs seem to have a similar prognosis to those receiving drugs. Drug treatment cannot be used to replace nutritional support (i.e. supplementary feeding), A very small number of breeders having read the report by Sturgess et al (which was inconclusive) believe that Taurine plays a part in the condition. These breeders give the queen large doses of Taurine (1000&nbsp;mg) daily until the kittens recover&nbsp;\u2013 apparently within a few days. Long-term use of high doses of Taurine should be monitored by a veterinarian.\n\nKittens have a much higher metabolism than adults, so drugs cannot simply be calibrated based on adult protocols but adjusted for weight. Antibiotics administered 2x daily in adults need to be given 3x daily in kittens, and doses given at 24-hour intervals need to be given at 18- to 20-hour intervals. In addition, because the liver does not metabolise drugs as efficiently as in adults, a higher dose relative to body weight may need to be given. Little information is available in veterinary literature about drug dosing in neonates; almost all treatment protocols are based on adult animals. The neonatal human literature is here used as a guide. See [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4268272/ Lawrence C. Ku and P. Brian Smith, 'Dosing in neonates: Special considerations in physiology and trail design'] and multiple other sources of information. Observation of drug responses in neonatal kittens indicates increased frequency is essential.\n\n=== Splinting and physical therapy ===\nSplinting the kitten in a specially-constructed corset made from a rigid material such as a toilet roll, section of plastic bottle or high-density foam encourages the ribcage to a more normal position, and reported mortality seemed to decline when this practice was introduced.<ref>http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information regarding splinting of FCKS kittens]</ref> This may be because encouraging the chest to a more correct position helps the lungs to re-inflate. However a large proportion of kittens cannot tolerate a splint, and the distress it causes is extremely counterproductive. It can also be dangerous in cases where pressure on the sides causes the sternum to move inwards rather than outwards, and should only be undertaken with veterinary support and advice. Some kittens recover without intervention, so it is not known whether the various treatments based on encouraging the thorax to return to a normal shape contributed to recovery.<ref>Although corsets can be improvised easily from e.g. plastic drinks bottles etc., one breeder has marketed a 'corset' design that she found successful with her kittens www.fck-flat-korsett.de</ref>\n\nSome breeders have found that applying manual pressure to the sides of the ribcage can help, as the chest rounds out with encouragement (gentle pressure timed to coincide with the natural movement of the thorax in breathing), but usually the chest goes flat again as soon as massage is discontinued. It may however help in encouraging the lungs to inflate a little more with each breath, but should not be used if it causes distress to the kitten. Many breeders report that affected kittens seem to enjoy massage. Encouraging a kitten to lie on its side can be helpful, and draping another kitten (or the mother's arm) over it while it is sleeping on its side places a gentle continuous pressure on the ribcage which may also be helpful. If the kitten is uncomfortable it will move away. (It is important to ensure that pressure is not placed on the kitten if it is lying flat on its chest.)\n\nOver-handling FCKS kittens can lead to unnecessary weight loss and [[Fatigue (medical)|lethargy]], so the use of massage, waking the kitten for extra feeds from the mother etc. should be checked against gains and losses in weight. Some vets believe that encouraging the kitten to cry and also to have to move more to reach its mother may be helpful. There is no data from breeders supporting this theory.\n\n== Survival and long-term prognosis ==\nIt is difficult to determine whether a kitten that goes flat will survive or not. A good indicator is the weight of the kitten: those that continue to gain weight generally have a better chance of survival. Supplement feeding is therefore recommended in all cases, together with vitamin supplements,<ref>[http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information about kitten milk and other supplements further down the page]</ref> although many of these kittens will not accept hand feeding. Liquid Paraffin to alleviate colic seems to be significant in assisting normal feeding and weight-gain.\n\nAnother indicator to the severity of the case is the use of the stomach when breathing: normal kittens use only the ribcage, a flat-chested kitten may manage to breathe only using the ribcage, or may suck the gut upwards with every breath&nbsp;\u2013 if the latter is the case then the likelihood of survival seems to be lower, though still not sufficient to warrant immediate [[euthanasia]]. If the condition is stable (i.e. the flatness does not increase over time) or improving, the kitten is more likely to survive. If the condition worsens over several days, survival is less likely.\n\nKittens with FCKS may die (or have to be euthanased) very soon after onset. There are two points at which breeders report kittens that were otherwise doing well deteriorating and dying: at 10 days of age and at 3 weeks. Generally if the kitten is still flat, but survives the 3-week developmental stage, its prognosis is good. Many will have returned to a normal shape by this time. Those retaining some degree of flatness often grow out of the condition at any point in the ensuing 6 months, and the vast majority of survivors appear to lead normal lives with no side-effects, either physical or immunological.\n\nFCKS kittens that survive but who have not been given any drug treatment or support other than supplementary feeding, generally recover over a period of 4\u201310 weeks, and are usually normal by 12 weeks of age, though some take as long as 6 months to normalise. In the very small number of kittens reported so far treated with steroids, antibiotics and liquid paraffin (to address colic) recovery is usually seen within a matter of days. Given the number of different types of FCKS these kittens (all with the minor form of the condition) may not be representative of all cases. More data is required for statistical analysis.\n\nA small proportion of severe FCKS kittens are left with long-term respiratory problems, [[kyphosis]], and in some cases cardiac issues caused by the compression of the thorax during the early developmental stages (particularly where the condition has been coupled with Pectus Excavatum). Cardiac issues are generally audible on physical examination; further indications include the kitten becoming breathless after play, less active than siblings, and failure to grow and develop normally.\n\n== Breeding with FCKS ==\nCrucial in the decision to breed would be the primary cause of FCKS in the litter, which may or may not be genetic (see Heredity above). Some recovered FCKS adults have produced FCKS offspring in their turn, and some queens consistently produce flat kittens, so breeding from those lines is therefore inadvisable. However, repeat matings in which FCKS has appeared does not result in further FCKS kittens any more often than non-repeat matings. Queens and studs who consistently throw complete litters of kittens with the condition are generally neutered, but isolated instances of single flat kittens in an otherwise healthy litter seem to be unlikely to have a genetic component and neutering of parents of such kittens is not usually necessary in pedigree breeding, particularly where doing so may have detrimental effects on the gene pool.\n\nIf the cause of flattening is colic related to over-production of milk then this would not be cause for neutering. The only way to determine if the cause is digestive would be if the condition was alleviated by pinching the phrenic nerve and/or use of liquid paraffin to relieve colic, resulting in improvement in the condition.\n\nLine-breeding or inbreeding is highly inadvisable in any situation, and particularly so in lines where FCKS has appeared, given the possibility of inheritcance of any underlying condition or breeding factor that may cause kittens to develop FCKS.\n\n== Other conditions ==\nKittens with FCKS sometimes also show bony deformities such as [[Pectus Excavatum]] or [[Kyphosis]] (characterised in kittens by a dip in the spine just behind the shoulder blades). Although a kitten may be born with these deformities, extreme forms of FCKS may cause Kyphosis to develop in an otherwise normal kitten, as the kitten grows with the spine held in an abnormal position due to the flattened ribcage. When there are bony deformities in the upper body, or other problems present, these may contribute to malfunctioning in soft-tissue organs such as the respiratory and digestive systems.\n\n== Flat chestedness in other animals ==\nFlat chest occurs in piglets and puppies, may be known in cattle (anecdotal information only), and is also recorded in humans, though possibly in humans this is not the same type of condition and may be a bone deformity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.vetstream.com/treat/felis/diseases/flat-chested-kitten-and-pectus-excavatum Vetstream article on FCKS in journal ''Felis'' ISSN 2398-2950]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/page58/index.html Flat-Chested Kitten Syndrome]\n* [http://theses.vet-alfort.fr/telecharger.php?id=1840/  Marine Minnaert: ''\u00c9tude r\u00e9trospective de la cage thoracique plate chez le chat : caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques et cliniques, pronostic et aspects g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques'', PhD thesis (2014) pdf]\n* [https://icatcare.org/advice/cat-health/flat-chested-kitten-syndrome/ International Cat Care website; based on Sturgess 1997, which is out of date and incorrect in many particulars]\n[[Category:Cat diseases]]\n[[Category:Respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period]]\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9423237?dopt=abstract/ Sturgess C P, Waters L, Gruffydd-Jones T J et al (1997) Investigation of the association between whole blood and tissue taurine levels and the development of thoracic deformities in neonatal Burmese kittens.

This is a soft-tissue problem and is not caused by vertebral or bony malformation. However lung collapse can be a secondary symptom caused by bony deformity affecting the thorax such as pectus excavatum. In mild cases, the underside of the chest becomes flattened (hence the name of the condition); in extreme cases the entire thorax is flattened, looking as if the kitten has been stepped on. The kitten will appear to go from normal to flat in the space of about 2\u20133 hours, and will usually then stabilise. FCKS is frequently misdiagnosed as pectus excavatum due to inadequate veterinary literature or inexperience of the vet.\n\nFCKS is most frequently caused by collapsed lungs (and not as formerly believed, by a muscle spasm in the intercostal muscles). There are numerous causes for lung collapse, and therefore numerous causes for FCKS. One possible cause for flat chestedness that develops soon after birth is [[atelectasis]].\n\nCauses of [[atelectasis]] include insufficient attempts at respiration by the newborn, [[bronchial obstruction]], or absence of [[surfactant]] (a substance secreted by [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] that coats the lungs and prevents the surfaces from sticking together). Lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing lung collapse if severe. There can be many reasons for atelectasis in kittens, but probably the most common cause is [[Preterm birth|prematurity]]. Newborn atelectasis would not be unusual in a very large litter of kittens (such as 10), where the size of the litter may lead all the kittens to be small and mildly underdeveloped.\n\nUnlike human babies, kittens are born very immature: blind, deaf, the intestinal tract not fully developed etc., so even slight prematurity may tip them over the edge from being viable to non viable. Many FCKS kittens may have fallen just the wrong side of this boundary in their development at the time of birth. Further, if a kitten does not scream or open its lungs well enough at birth, even if it is fully mature and has sufficient surfactant, it may end up with atelectasis. Patches of atelectasis in the lungs mean that part of a lung is not operating properly. If the kitten goes to sleep and its respiratory rate drops, the patches of atelectasis can slowly expand until large areas of the lung collapse and cannot be reinflated. Good advice to any breeder therefore would be to ensure that kittens cry loudly when they are born, to make sure that the airways are clear, but also that the lungs expand as fully as possible. (This was the reason newborn babies were always held upside down immediately after birth (so that any residual fluid drains downwards) and smacked to make them cry strongly.)\n\nSome kittens suffer from congenital 'secondary' atelectasis, which presents shortly after birth. There have been no reports of kittens born flat (primary atelectasis). [[Hyaline membrane disease]] is a type of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn in which there is formation of a [[hyaline]]-like membrane lining the terminal respiratory passages, and this may also be a (rarer) cause of FCKS. Pressure from outside the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases&nbsp;\u2013 which may explain the development of FCKS in older kittens (e.g. 10 days old) who are not strong enough to breathe through even a light mucus, or who may have inhaled milk during suckling.\n\n[[Tumors]] and inhaled objects (possible if bedding contains loose fluff) can also cause obstruction or irritation of the airway, leading to lung collapse and secondary atelectasis. In an older cat the [[intercostal muscles]] are so well developed, and the ribs rigid enough that the ribcage will not flatten if the lung collapses: in kittens the bones are much more flexible, and the tendons and muscles more flaccid, allowing movement of the thorax into abnormal positions.\n\nOther causes of lung collapse can include diaphragmatic hernia, or diaphragmatic spasm (breeders report the position of the gut and thorax as appearing to be like a 'stalled hiccup'). Diaphragmatic spasm is easily checked by pinching the [[phrenic nerve]] in the neck between the fingertips. Kittens with this type of FCKS will improve almost immediately, but may require repeated pinching to prevent the spasm from recurring.\n\n== Evidential basis and statistical analysis ==\n[[File:FCKSbyBreed.png|thumb|Reports of kittens with FCKS by breed 1999-2018]]\n[[File:GCCF regAnalysis.png|thumb|GCCF statistics for numbers of kittens registered 1999-2018]]\nAlmost all reporting of FCKS is treated as anecdotal, since it comes from breeders and not from veterinary practitioners. However, in the absence of robust clinical studies breeder-reporting is the only source of information currently available. Reporting about type of FCKS is hampered by the lack of differentiation between one type and another by both breeders and vets. The data informing this article came from three sources:\n* Analysis of emails reporting cases of FCKS sent to the owner of a website giving information about the condition and methods of treatment, 1999-2019 [87 of these kittens were examined in person by the author]\n* Data gathered by the THINK project 2005-2015 who published an online questionnaire (the project is now defunct)\n* Directly solicited reports requested from 27 individual breeders of Abyssinian (4 responded) and 35 breeders of British Shorthair (2 responded) in the UK\nThe 20-year analysis was compared with the [http://www.gccfcats.org Governing Council of the Cat Fancy] in the UK (GCCF) analysis of numbers of kittens registered during the same period. The full report is to be published during 2020.<ref>Reference will be provided when publication information is available.</ref>\n\nOnly direct reports from owners (362) about their own cats or vets examining kittens (2) were considered. Kittens exhibiting any other condition (including pectus excavatum) were excluded. The overwhelming majority of reports (76%) were of single FCKS cases in a litter, with the remainder whole or part litters.\nThe data comprised 311 reports of litters of kittens in which one or more developed FCKS, for a total of 464 affected kittens (see table).\n\nReports in which the sex was specified showed breakdown by sex of male 56%/female 44%. 16 breeders reported that whereas they might have expected the smallest kitten in a litter (if any) to develop FCKS, it was the largest and strongest kittens that developed flat chests, and these were often males. The condition does not appear to be sex-linked, but the preponderance of male kittens in this reporting group may be due to the fact that males tend to be larger than females and these are the kittens getting most milk or suckling hardest because they are stronger, in which case the type of FCKS in these litters may have been due to colic caused by overfeeding (see Causes, below).\n\nReports originated from 21 countries (Australia (15), Austria (11), Belgium (2), Canada (8), Denmark (3), Finland (2), France (24), Germany (13), Hungary (1), Japan (2), Netherlands (14), New Zealand (6), Norway (5), Portugal (1), Singapore (1), Slovakia (1), South Africa (5), Sweden (11), Switzerland (1), UK (100), USA (85)) and covered 39 breeds (including non-pedigree domestic shorthair, non-pedigree domestic longhair, and some \u2018unrecognised\u2019 crosses between two pedigree breeds or pedigree breeds x DSH). 10 reports did not specify breed.\n\nHigh numbers of reports in certain breeds has in the past been taken to imply that some breeds are more prone to the condition than others, but the data is skewed by various factors: a) the numbers of kittens bred; b) cluster-reporting in response to articles in breed club circulars or c) the work of a particular group of breeders in attempting to address a problem that they had seen in their own lines d) the culture within an individual breed of information-sharing or reporting problems. Breeders are generally not inclined to discuss health issues because of a culture of blame and gossip, having a dramatic effect on information-sharing. No \u2018cluster\u2019 triggers have been identified for the relatively high number of reports in the Maine Coon or Bengal breeds, while the Burmese cat club commissioned a study into the condition in 1997 by Sturgess et al, and the THINK project solicited reports from Burmese breeders specifically. However statistics on the registration of kittens provided by the [http://www.gccfcats.org GCCF] show that Bengal, Burmese and Maine Coon are consistently in the top nine breeds by number of kittens registered (see table). The breeds showing highest numbers of kittens registered therefore broadly correlate demographically to reports of FCKS. More significant is perhaps the low number of reported cases in the British Shorthair (especially when compared with the Manx), but this seems to be attributable to the culture of breeders in that group.\n\nMortality: of 195 cases where the outcome was notified, 88 died, or were euthanised due to distress; 107 recovered and survived beyond 3 months of age. Those that recovered fully did not appear to suffer any long-term effects, although reporting is patchy.\n\nMentions of FCKS in the veterinary literature (usually no more than a single sentence) include no descriptive information and have no evidential basis, in particular the claim in Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976) that the condition may be hereditary, which has been repeated in subsequent literature.\n\n== Onset and diagnosis ==\nFCKS develops usually in kittens around three days of age, and sometimes affects whole litters, sometimes only individuals or part of a litter. Kittens can go flat any time during early maturation, some flattening as late as 10 days of age or (in very rare cases) later. It is possible that the later-developing cases are due to [[Respiratory tract infection]] or [[pneumonia]]. Until 2010 FCKS was believed to be caused by a spasm in the [[intercostal muscle|intercostal]] muscles, but re-examination of old post-mortem data (i.e. that kittens remain flat even when they are dead and therefore cannot maintain a muscular spasm) and new data has led to the conclusion that flattening is caused by failure of the [[lung]]s to inflate normally or, when it occurs in older kittens, by lung collapse. This cause is now cited by the veterinary community (Sturgess 2016) but without any source acknowledgement.\n\nGross physical symptoms include flattening of the underside of the thorax in moderate cases (a ridge can usually be felt along the sides of the ribcage, running parallel to the spine); complete flattening of the upper body in extreme cases (the kitten looks as if it has been stepped on); moderate to extreme effort and/or gasping during breathing; the gut is drawn upwards during the in-breath. Breathing is not usually rapid (as in pneumonia or pyrexia) but at a normal rate when compared with unaffected kittens. The position of the thorax and activity of the abdomen is not unlike that seen during normal hiccups, but the sudden spasm in hiccups is slowed down or halted in FCKS: where a hiccup releases, returning the body to a normal position, FCKS breathing does not release. There may be involvement with digestive difficulty in FCKS kittens (see Colic, below).\n[[File:FCKSnormalThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of normal cat thorax]]\n[[File:FCKSdeformedThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of thoracic deformities of flat chested kitten]]\n\n[[File:FCKSbanana.jpg|thumb|Banana used to demonstrate FCKS shape]]Determining whether a kitten has FCKS or not can be difficult with only text descriptions: a mild case of FCKS causes the thorax to feel similar to the shape of a banana when held curve downward. The ribcage is not fixed in position, and the most noticeable effect in mild cases is the ridge along the side of the ribcage.\n\nThe condition causes weight-gain to halt, respiratory distress, inability to feed normally and, in a significant proportion of cases, death. However, since a significant percentage of kittens survive the condition immediate euthanasia is not indicated, and supportive treatments can be employed to increase the likelihood of survival (see Treatment, below).\n\nThe condition is often misdiagnosed as ''[[Pectus excavatum]]'',<ref>Kit Sturgess et al: An investigation of Taurine levels as a possible cause of FCKS. Burmese Cat Club Newsletter 1980, [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/BCC/ downloadable pdf files accessible from this page]</ref> with which it has no direct connection, although FCKS kittens may also have PE. Although the condition is believed to be more prevalent in the Burmese breed it is found in every breed of cat, including non-pedigree domestic cats, and the apparent prevalence in the [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] is most likely due to better communication between breeders and reporting of the condition, as well as the naturally more barrel-shaped chest of this particular genotype.<ref>Edinburgh FAB resident, Royal Dick Veterinary Hospital: Report in ''FAB Journal'' (1993), vol. 31 (1) 71-72</ref> Since early reporting of the condition identified the Burmese as susceptible the [[Bengal (cat)|Bengal]] breed, with a similar physiology, has emerged, and shows a similarly large number of FCKS kittens, however this may be due to specific interest in the condition among those working with the breeds. It is reported in all breeds and in domestic non-pedigree cats, both those kept as pets and those living as 'barn cats'. An article in a Swedish cat club newsletter about FCKS led to a spike in reporting of the condition in Ragdolls in Sweden.\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:MauFCK.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian Mau kitten with FCKS]]\n|[[File:RexFCK.jpg|thumb|center|Rex kitten with FCKS and Kyphosis - note narrowing of thorax around the shoulders]]\n| [[File:Flat kitten b.png|thumb|center|Oriental kitten with moderate to extreme FCKS. Pectus Excavatum is not present. The kitten was wrapped in a 'corset' for about 2 weeks. It is now a healthy adult.]]\n|}\n\nThe syndrome is life-threatening in a significant number of cases (possibly around 40%) mainly due to a lack of understanding of the underlying cause of the condition, failure to treat colic (leading to slow starvation) and insufficient sources of information in veterinary literature.\n\n== Causes ==\n\n=== Genetic/Heredity ===\nThere is no statistical evidence to suggest that FCKS may be due to genetic factors: certain bloodlines ''seem'' to produce a preponderance of kittens with the condition, but this may be due to enhanced reporting within the breed. The literature citing heredity as a cause (Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976)) does not provide any evidential support and the information is repeated in later literature citing that source as authority. The majority of cases are of single kittens, with low but significant numbers of whole or part litters reported. Numerous breeders experience periods in which FCKS seems to occur over a number of matings, but then stops, suggesting an environmental cause. Incidences of the condition have been reported in many litters that were repeat matings of previously healthy litters; matings repeated after the incidence of FCKS do not produce flat kittens any more frequently than non-repeat matings; recovered FCKS that have been bred from have likewise not produced offspring that suffered from the condition any more frequently than normal cats, but numbers in this category are obviously low. It is possible that some lines in which the queens provide excessive milk may lead to colic-related FCKS in the kittens, leading to the supposition of heredity. Although after experiencing cases of FCKS most breeders do not repeat matings. In 59 cases of repeat matings 52 litters did '''not''' result in FCKS again while 7 did.\n\n=== Developmental ===\nIt is possible that the lung collapse in neo-nates (i.e. around 3 days of age) could be due to a lack of [[surfactant]] -  the coating of the inside of the lung that prevents the inner surfaces of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] from sticking together. (Causes of surfactant deficiency are not discussed here, but the role of surfactant is discussed in a number of articles in the ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' vol. 65, 1990.<ref>particularly B A Hills: The role of lung surfactant, ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' 1990, 65, 13-29</ref>). Kittens are born immature in many ways, and full inflation of the lungs does not happen immediately, but takes place gradually over a period of several days after birth. Although a kitten may seem active and thriving, its lungs will not be fully inflated until approx. day 3 after birth. Thus if inflation fails to happen correctly the [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] in the chest cavity will cause the ribcage&nbsp;\u2013 which is extremely flexible&nbsp;\u2013 to collapse inward, dragged in by the lungs, and '''not''' collapsing due to muscular cramping, and compressing the lungs.\n\n=== Infection ===\nNeo-natal and Later lung collapse may be due to lung infection, or possibly to a malfunction in the [[epiglottis]], causing the in-breath to draw air into the digestive tract rather than the lungs. A short term malfunction of this sort may be perpetuated by the resulting colic creating a feedback loop that interrupts the correct breathing process.\n\nAutopsy and analysis of [[Aspiration pneumonia|lung aspirate]] in a group of flat-chested kittens bred by a US Vet showed the presence of [[Cat flu|Herpes virus]].\n\n=== Diaphragmatic spasm ===\n[[File:Phrenic002.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of the Phrenic Nerve (diagram)</center>]]\nSpasm in the diaphragm leads to the muscle 'locking up' so that all breathing effort falls to the intercostal muscles. The resulting loss of movement causes the lungs to deflate gradually. This is easily diagnosed and treated (see Treatment below) by short-term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]].\n\n=== Colic ===\nA kitten that has difficulty in breathing is very likely also to suffer from [[colic]] (which can cause weight loss in the early development of a normal kitten), and a very small daily (or twice daily) dose of [[Liquid paraffin (medicinal)|liquid paraffin]] (one or two drops placed on the tongue of the kitten, or 0.1 ml) should help to alleviate this problem. FCKS kittens who do not maintain weight are usually among the group which die, but many of them may simply be unable to feed properly due to colic, becoming increasingly weak and lethargic, and fading due to malnutrition as much as to the thoracic problems.\n\nColic has many causes, but in a kitten with respiratory difficulty it is possible that a malfunction during the breathing process leads the kitten to swallow air instead of taking it into its lungs. The GI tract fills with air while the lungs do not receive a proper air supply, preventing them from inflating fully. Pressure from the stomach exacerbates the condition. Treating for colic with liquid paraffin seems to shorten recovery time from 4\u201310 weeks to a matter of days.\n\n== Treatment ==\n[[File:Position of phrenic nerve in cat.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of Phrenic nerve in a sleeping kitten. The nerve bifurcates and runs down both sides of the neck.</center>]]\nTreatment is difficult to define given the number of different causes and the wealth of anecdotal information collected by and from cat breeders. Treatments have hitherto been based on the assumption that FCKS is caused by a muscular [[spasm]], and their effectiveness is impossible to assess because some kittens will recover spontaneously without intervention. FCKS cannot be corrected surgically.\n\nDiaphragmatic spasm is easily tested for and treated by short term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]]. The nerve runs down the outside of the neck where the neck joins to the shoulder, within a bundle of muscles and tendons at this junction. The cluster can be pinched gently and held for a few seconds each time. Kittens with spasmodic FCKS will show almost immediate improvement, but the treatment may need to be repeated several times over a few days as the spasm may have a tendency to recur, particularly after suckling. It is sometimes evident that the spasm only affects one side of the diaphragm, as interruption of the nerve is only necessary or effective on one side.\n\nContinuous positive air pressure ([[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]]) is used in human babies with lung collapse, but this is impossible with kittens. It is possible that the success of some breeders in curing kittens by splinting the body, thus putting pressure on the ribcage, was successful as it has created the effect of positive air pressure, thus gradually re-inflating the lungs by pulling them open rather than pushing them open as is the case with CPAP (see below).\n\n=== Drugs ===\nThe use of [[steroids]] ([[Dexamethasone]]) coupled with an antibiotic ([[Amoxicillin]]) will support the kitten in a number of ways, the steroid enhancing maturation and the antibiotic addressing the possibility of underlying infection and compensating for the immuno-depressant properties of the steroid. The steroid will also encourage the kitten to feed more energetically, keeping its weight up. However the primary supportive mechanism must be nutritional. Kittens who are only supported with feeding and do not receive drugs seem to have a similar prognosis to those receiving drugs. Drug treatment cannot be used to replace nutritional support (i.e. supplementary feeding), A very small number of breeders having read the report by Sturgess et al (which was inconclusive) believe that Taurine plays a part in the condition. These breeders give the queen large doses of Taurine (1000&nbsp;mg) daily until the kittens recover&nbsp;\u2013 apparently within a few days. Long-term use of high doses of Taurine should be monitored by a veterinarian.\n\nKittens have a much higher metabolism than adults, so drugs cannot simply be calibrated based on adult protocols but adjusted for weight. Antibiotics administered 2x daily in adults need to be given 3x daily in kittens, and doses given at 24-hour intervals need to be given at 18- to 20-hour intervals. In addition, because the liver does not metabolise drugs as efficiently as in adults, a higher dose relative to body weight may need to be given. Little information is available in veterinary literature about drug dosing in neonates; almost all treatment protocols are based on adult animals. The neonatal human literature is here used as a guide. See [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4268272/ Lawrence C. Ku and P. Brian Smith, 'Dosing in neonates: Special considerations in physiology and trail design'] and multiple other sources of information. Observation of drug responses in neonatal kittens indicates increased frequency is essential.\n\n=== Splinting and physical therapy ===\nSplinting the kitten in a specially-constructed corset made from a rigid material such as a toilet roll, section of plastic bottle or high-density foam encourages the ribcage to a more normal position, and reported mortality seemed to decline when this practice was introduced.<ref>http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information regarding splinting of FCKS kittens]</ref> This may be because encouraging the chest to a more correct position helps the lungs to re-inflate. However a large proportion of kittens cannot tolerate a splint, and the distress it causes is extremely counterproductive. It can also be dangerous in cases where pressure on the sides causes the sternum to move inwards rather than outwards, and should only be undertaken with veterinary support and advice. Some kittens recover without intervention, so it is not known whether the various treatments based on encouraging the thorax to return to a normal shape contributed to recovery.<ref>Although corsets can be improvised easily from e.g. plastic drinks bottles etc., one breeder has marketed a 'corset' design that she found successful with her kittens www.fck-flat-korsett.de</ref>\n\nSome breeders have found that applying manual pressure to the sides of the ribcage can help, as the chest rounds out with encouragement (gentle pressure timed to coincide with the natural movement of the thorax in breathing), but usually the chest goes flat again as soon as massage is discontinued. It may however help in encouraging the lungs to inflate a little more with each breath, but should not be used if it causes distress to the kitten. Many breeders report that affected kittens seem to enjoy massage. Encouraging a kitten to lie on its side can be helpful, and draping another kitten (or the mother's arm) over it while it is sleeping on its side places a gentle continuous pressure on the ribcage which may also be helpful. If the kitten is uncomfortable it will move away. (It is important to ensure that pressure is not placed on the kitten if it is lying flat on its chest.)\n\nOver-handling FCKS kittens can lead to unnecessary weight loss and [[Fatigue (medical)|lethargy]], so the use of massage, waking the kitten for extra feeds from the mother etc. should be checked against gains and losses in weight. Some vets believe that encouraging the kitten to cry and also to have to move more to reach its mother may be helpful. There is no data from breeders supporting this theory.\n\n== Survival and long-term prognosis ==\nIt is difficult to determine whether a kitten that goes flat will survive or not. A good indicator is the weight of the kitten: those that continue to gain weight generally have a better chance of survival. Supplement feeding is therefore recommended in all cases, together with vitamin supplements,<ref>[http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information about kitten milk and other supplements further down the page]</ref> although many of these kittens will not accept hand feeding. Liquid Paraffin to alleviate colic seems to be significant in assisting normal feeding and weight-gain.\n\nAnother indicator to the severity of the case is the use of the stomach when breathing: normal kittens use only the ribcage, a flat-chested kitten may manage to breathe only using the ribcage, or may suck the gut upwards with every breath&nbsp;\u2013 if the latter is the case then the likelihood of survival seems to be lower, though still not sufficient to warrant immediate [[euthanasia]]. If the condition is stable (i.e. the flatness does not increase over time) or improving, the kitten is more likely to survive. If the condition worsens over several days, survival is less likely.\n\nKittens with FCKS may die (or have to be euthanased) very soon after onset. There are two points at which breeders report kittens that were otherwise doing well deteriorating and dying: at 10 days of age and at 3 weeks. Generally if the kitten is still flat, but survives the 3-week developmental stage, its prognosis is good. Many will have returned to a normal shape by this time. Those retaining some degree of flatness often grow out of the condition at any point in the ensuing 6 months, and the vast majority of survivors appear to lead normal lives with no side-effects, either physical or immunological.\n\nFCKS kittens that survive but who have not been given any drug treatment or support other than supplementary feeding, generally recover over a period of 4\u201310 weeks, and are usually normal by 12 weeks of age, though some take as long as 6 months to normalise. In the very small number of kittens reported so far treated with steroids, antibiotics and liquid paraffin (to address colic) recovery is usually seen within a matter of days. Given the number of different types of FCKS these kittens (all with the minor form of the condition) may not be representative of all cases. More data is required for statistical analysis.\n\nA small proportion of severe FCKS kittens are left with long-term respiratory problems, [[kyphosis]], and in some cases cardiac issues caused by the compression of the thorax during the early developmental stages (particularly where the condition has been coupled with Pectus Excavatum). Cardiac issues are generally audible on physical examination; further indications include the kitten becoming breathless after play, less active than siblings, and failure to grow and develop normally.\n\n== Breeding with FCKS ==\nCrucial in the decision to breed would be the primary cause of FCKS in the litter, which may or may not be genetic (see Heredity above). Some recovered FCKS adults have produced FCKS offspring in their turn, and some queens consistently produce flat kittens, so breeding from those lines is therefore inadvisable. However, repeat matings in which FCKS has appeared does not result in further FCKS kittens any more often than non-repeat matings. Queens and studs who consistently throw complete litters of kittens with the condition are generally neutered, but isolated instances of single flat kittens in an otherwise healthy litter seem to be unlikely to have a genetic component and neutering of parents of such kittens is not usually necessary in pedigree breeding, particularly where doing so may have detrimental effects on the gene pool.\n\nIf the cause of flattening is colic related to over-production of milk then this would not be cause for neutering. The only way to determine if the cause is digestive would be if the condition was alleviated by pinching the phrenic nerve and/or use of liquid paraffin to relieve colic, resulting in improvement in the condition.\n\nLine-breeding or inbreeding is highly inadvisable in any situation, and particularly so in lines where FCKS has appeared, given the possibility of inheritcance of any underlying condition or breeding factor that may cause kittens to develop FCKS.\n\n== Other conditions ==\nKittens with FCKS sometimes also show bony deformities such as [[Pectus Excavatum]] or [[Kyphosis]] (characterised in kittens by a dip in the spine just behind the shoulder blades). Although a kitten may be born with these deformities, extreme forms of FCKS may cause Kyphosis to develop in an otherwise normal kitten, as the kitten grows with the spine held in an abnormal position due to the flattened ribcage. When there are bony deformities in the upper body, or other problems present, these may contribute to malfunctioning in soft-tissue organs such as the respiratory and digestive systems.\n\n== Flat chestedness in other animals ==\nFlat chest occurs in piglets and puppies, may be known in cattle (anecdotal information only), and is also recorded in humans, though possibly in humans this is not the same type of condition and may be a bone deformity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.vetstream.com/treat/felis/diseases/flat-chested-kitten-and-pectus-excavatum Vetstream article on FCKS in journal ''Felis'' ISSN 2398-2950]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/page58/index.html Flat-Chested Kitten Syndrome]\n* [http://theses.vet-alfort.fr/telecharger.php?id=1840/  Marine Minnaert: ''\u00c9tude r\u00e9trospective de la cage thoracique plate chez le chat : caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques et cliniques, pronostic et aspects g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques'', PhD thesis (2014) pdf]\n* [https://icatcare.org/advice/cat-health/flat-chested-kitten-syndrome/ International Cat Care website; based on Sturgess 1997, which is out of date and incorrect in many particulars]\n[[Category:Cat diseases]]\n[[Category:Respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period]]\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9423237?dopt=abstract/ Sturgess C P, Waters L, Gruffydd-Jones T J et al (1997) Investigation of the association between whole blood and tissue taurine levels and the development of thoracic deformities in neonatal Burmese kittens.

With the support of [[Henry Cole]] Director of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], who supplied Gregory with teachers, the school flourished and became a leader in the provision of instruction in applied art and design to working artisans, many of whom were employed by local manufacturing firms, including [[Royal Doulton|Doulton's]] and [[Farmer and Brindley]]. The rapid expansion of the school led to the need for new premises, and in 1860 [[Edward VII|Albert, Prince of Wales (Edward VII)]] laid the foundation stone for new premises in Millers Lane, built on the site of the [[Vauxhall Gardens]] as part of a redevelopment that included St Peter's church. The buildings are still standing, although the road is now called St Oswald's Place.<ref>[http://www.southwark.anglican.org/parishes/265p Streatham, St Peter - Lambeth, South Deanery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227134625/http://www.southwark.anglican.org/parishes/265p |date=27 December 2013 }}</ref><ref name=sculp>{{cite web|title=South London Technical School of Art (also Lambeth School of Art and City and Guilds of London Art School)|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib2_1207870826|website=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951|publisher=Glasgow University, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Henry Moore Institute|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Development under John Sparkes===\nIn 1857 [[John Charles Lewis Sparkes]] started teaching at the art school, soon becoming its Headmaster. Under Sparkes City and Guilds of London Art School was at the forefront of opposition to the monopoly claimed by the Royal Academy of Arts on the teaching of fine art practices, particularly drawing from the human figure. An attempt had been made to resolve this conflict in 1852, with the introduction by the British Government of the National Course on Instruction for art and design education, which was in effect a [[national curriculum]] for art training. This allowed for some elements of drawing to be taught, but within a broader curriculum that stressed the teaching of techniques to aid workers in artisan manufacturing industries rather than the training of artists.\n\nIn the case of City and Guilds of London Art School it was suggested at the time that Sparkes was ignoring the National Course on Instruction and teaching his students to be fine artists, particularly in 1865, when students from the art school won three medals at the annual awards handed out by the Royal Academy of Arts,<ref>The Athenaeum, vol. 1991, 23 December 1965, p. 894</ref> and again in 1867 when its students won three out of ten of the gold medals for art awarded by the Government, along with four silver medals awarded annually by the Royal Academy of Arts, and a bronze medal at the International Exposition held that year in Paris.<ref>'Lambeth School of Art' in ''The Art Journal,'' February 1866, p.45</ref> Certainly Sparkes and his colleagues at City and Guilds of London Art School ignored the general prohibition on life drawing being taught outside the Royal Academy of Arts, and the success of Sparkes's students at City and Guilds of London Art School in fine art competitions can be traced to this willingness by Sparkes to ignore regulations he believed were wrong.<ref>Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge, James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2014). p. 176</ref>\n\nThis radicalism in Sparkes can also be seen in his concern for the art and design tutors working both at City and Guilds of London Art School and elsewhere in Britain. In the 1860s a block grant was given by the British Government to the [[Royal College of Art|South Kensington Government School of Design]] for teachers' pay and this was then redistributed to other art schools across the country. As well as being widely considered an insufficient sum in the first place, the Government School of Design was accused by people such as Sparkes of holding on to too much of the money leading to the payment of what were called starvation wages at other art schools. Sparkes, in particular, was instrumental in campaigning for an increase in these wages, through both direct appeals to parliament and the establishment of the first national union of art teachers, the Association of Art Masters, in 1863.<ref>Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge, James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2014). p. 216</ref>\n\n===Connection to Doulton's Pottery===\nRecognising the limitations of government patronage of art schools, Sparkes cultivated a number of connections between the City and Guilds of London Art School and local manufacturing industries which would lead ultimately to City and Guilds of London Art School attaining the independent status it has today. One of the most notable of these was with [[Henry Doulton]] whose pottery factory, later known as [[Royal Doulton]], was located near to the City and Guilds of London Art School. \n\nIn 1863 Doulton joined the school's board of management and the following year he gave the school its first commission, for a terracotta frieze for his factory's new extension. Following on from this Doulton was a strong supporter and promoter of the art school's activities, including exhibiting experimental works by students at the [[1867 Paris Exhibition]] and at the [[Annual International Exhibitions (London 1871\u201374)|1871 London Exhibition]].<ref name=dick>{{cite book|last1=Wardleworth|first1=Dennis|title=William Reid Dick, Sculptor|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Farnham, Surrey|isbn=9781409439714|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oJmPfmQ7SgC&dq|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom about 1869, Doulton and his staff helped the art school to develop a curriculum that trained students for the pottery trade, and to carry out design work for Doulton. This collaboration provided [[Royal Doulton|Doulton's]] with a supply of higher-quality artwork for its trade, and gave students at Lambeth School of Art employment opportunities, and many noted English modellers and sculptors of the late nineteenth century owe their careers to this partnership.<ref name=sculp/><ref>{{cite book|last1=McKeown|first1=Julie|title=Royal Doulton|date=1997|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=0747803382|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxBdYICh0cwC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq}}</ref> \n\nThe close connection between the art school and Doulton's meant that the ethos of City and Guilds of London School of Art was based, from very early days, on a belief in a strong connection between the fine arts, craft and design. Consequently, its students and teachers became associated with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and to some extent the [[Art Nouveau]] movement.<ref>[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline College timeline at www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk (accessed 8 March 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228232823/http://cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline |date=28 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Connection to Mssrs Farmer and Brindley===\nIn addition to Doulton's, Sparkes also cultivated contacts with other local craft trade companies, one of the most notable of which was Mssrs Farmer and Brindley, a Lambeth-based architectural stone carving and terra-cotta company.<ref>Emma Hardy, 'Farmer and Brindley, Craftsmen and Sculptors, 1850-1930' in The Victorian Society Annual 1993, pp. 4\u201317</ref> As with Doulton's, a number of apprentices at Farmer and Brindley augmented their training with study at the Art School. This included the sculptors Charles John Allen (1862\u20131956), Harry Bates (1850\u20131899) and Nathaniel Hitch (1846\u20131936), and others, who became prominent sculptors in the Victorian and Edwardian periods.<ref>[https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/search/index.php?searchtype=all&search=farmer+and+brindley&x=0&y=0 University of Glasgow Mapping Sculpture Project]</ref>\n\n===City and Guilds Institute and City Livery Companies===\nIn 1878 Sparkes secured funding in the art school of the newly founded [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], and also ran the precursor to [[Imperial College London]].<ref name=dick/> The new backing secured the financial future of the art school without the strings attached to government funding. Under the new arrangement, the art school moved to new buildings in Kennington Park Road in Lambeth, which it still occupies, and was renamed the South London Technical School of Art. In 1932 it changed its name to the City and Guilds of London Institute Kennington and Lambeth Art School, reflecting the historical and continued support of the city of London [[Livery Companies]]. This was shortened in 1938 to the City and Guilds of London Art School.<ref>Jennifer Lang, ''City and Guilds of London Institute Centenary 1878-1978'' (London: City and Guilds Institute, 1978) p. 94</ref> The formal link between the parent body, the City and Guilds Institute, and the City and Guilds of London Art School was ended in 1971, when the art school became and independent trust.<ref>Jennifer Lang, ''City and Guilds of London Institute Centenary 1878-1978'' (London: City and Guilds Institute, 1978) p.138</ref>\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n\nGraduates of the Art School were involved in some of the leading social and political movements of the early twentieth century, including [[Clemence Housman]] and [[Laurence Housman]], who co-founded, in 1909, a society for artists who supported the [[Suffragette Movement]], called the [[Suffrage Atelier]].<ref>Elizabeth Crawford, ''The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928'' (London: Routledge, 1999) p. 662</ref> [[Laurence Housman]] later went on to found the alternative bookshop, which still bears his name, located in Caledonian Road, near London's [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] railway station.\n\nAfter the Second World War, new restoration and carving courses were established at the Art School to train people for the restoration of London's war-damaged buildings. However, during the 1960s the art school also developed a [[fine art]] program, although it still maintained and strengthened its programmes in restoration and carving. This resulted in the Art School evolving into both a school for fine art education, and a unique specialist training centre for the education of restorers and conservators of architectural stone and wood work. \n\nIn 1971 the Art School became an independent charitable trust, with the new Deed of Incorporation signed by Goeffrey Agnew (chairman of the art gallery [[Thomas Agnew & Sons]]), Sir Colin Skelton Anderson (Provost of the [[Royal College of Art]]), [[Sir John Betjeman]] (poet), [[Adrian Maurice Daintrey]] (artist), Gilbert Samuel (Lord Mayor of London), [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]] (sculptor and Former President of the [[Royal Academy]]), and [[Carel Weight]] (artist), amongst others.

With the support of [[Henry Cole]] Director of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], who supplied Gregory with teachers, the school flourished and became a leader in the provision of instruction in applied art and design to working artisans, many of whom were employed by local manufacturing firms, including [[Royal Doulton|Doulton's]] and [[Farmer and Brindley]]. The rapid expansion of the school led to the need for new premises, and in 1860 [[Edward VII|Albert, Prince of Wales (Edward VII)]] laid the foundation stone for new premises in Millers Lane, built on the site of the [[Vauxhall Gardens]] as part of a redevelopment that included St Peter's church. The buildings are still standing, although the road is now called St Oswald's Place.<ref>[http://www.southwark.anglican.org/parishes/265p Streatham, St Peter - Lambeth, South Deanery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227134625/http://www.southwark.anglican.org/parishes/265p |date=27 December 2013 }}</ref><ref name=sculp>{{cite web|title=South London Technical School of Art (also Lambeth School of Art and City and Guilds of London Art School)|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib2_1207870826|website=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951|publisher=Glasgow University, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Henry Moore Institute|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Development under John Sparkes===\nIn 1857 [[John Charles Lewis Sparkes]] started teaching at the art school, soon becoming its Headmaster. Under Sparkes City and Guilds of London Art School was at the forefront of opposition to the monopoly claimed by the Royal Academy of Arts on the teaching of fine art practices, particularly drawing from the human figure. An attempt had been made to resolve this conflict in 1852, with the introduction by the British Government of the National Course on Instruction for art and design education, which was in effect a [[national curriculum]] for art training. This allowed for some elements of drawing to be taught, but within a broader curriculum that stressed the teaching of techniques to aid workers in artisan manufacturing industries rather than the training of artists.\n\nIn the case of City and Guilds of London Art School it was suggested at the time that Sparkes was ignoring the National Course on Instruction and teaching his students to be fine artists, particularly in 1865, when students from the art school won three medals at the annual awards handed out by the Royal Academy of Arts,<ref>The Athenaeum, vol. 1991, 23 December 1965, p. 894</ref> and again in 1867 when its students won three out of ten of the gold medals for art awarded by the Government, along with four silver medals awarded annually by the Royal Academy of Arts, and a bronze medal at the International Exposition held that year in Paris.<ref>'Lambeth School of Art' in ''The Art Journal,'' February 1866, p.45</ref> Certainly Sparkes and his colleagues at City and Guilds of London Art School ignored the general prohibition on life drawing being taught outside the Royal Academy of Arts, and the success of Sparkes's students at City and Guilds of London Art School in fine art competitions can be traced to this willingness by Sparkes to ignore regulations he believed were wrong.<ref>Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge, James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2014). p. 176</ref>\n\nThis radicalism in Sparkes can also be seen in his concern for the art and design tutors working both at City and Guilds of London Art School and elsewhere in Britain. In the 1860s a block grant was given by the British Government to the [[Royal College of Art|South Kensington Government School of Design]] for teachers' pay and this was then redistributed to other art schools across the country. As well as being widely considered an insufficient sum in the first place, the Government School of Design was accused by people such as Sparkes of holding on to too much of the money leading to the payment of what were called starvation wages at other art schools. Sparkes, in particular, was instrumental in campaigning for an increase in these wages, through both direct appeals to parliament and the establishment of the first national union of art teachers, the Association of Art Masters, in 1863.<ref>Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge, James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2014). p. 216</ref>\n\n===Connection to Doulton's Pottery===\nRecognising the limitations of government patronage of art schools, Sparkes cultivated a number of connections between the City and Guilds of London Art School and local manufacturing industries which would lead ultimately to City and Guilds of London Art School attaining the independent status it has today. One of the most notable of these was with [[Henry Doulton]] whose pottery factory, later known as [[Royal Doulton]], was located near to the City and Guilds of London Art School. \n\nIn 1863 Doulton joined the school's board of management and the following year he gave the school its first commission, for a terracotta frieze for his factory's new extension. Following on from this Doulton was a strong supporter and promoter of the art school's activities, including exhibiting experimental works by students at the [[1867 Paris Exhibition]] and at the [[Annual International Exhibitions (London 1871\u201374)|1871 London Exhibition]].<ref name=dick>{{cite book|last1=Wardleworth|first1=Dennis|title=William Reid Dick, Sculptor|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Farnham, Surrey|isbn=9781409439714|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oJmPfmQ7SgC&dq|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom about 1869, Doulton and his staff helped the art school to develop a curriculum that trained students for the pottery trade, and to carry out design work for Doulton. This collaboration provided [[Royal Doulton|Doulton's]] with a supply of higher-quality artwork for its trade, and gave students at Lambeth School of Art employment opportunities, and many noted English modellers and sculptors of the late nineteenth century owe their careers to this partnership.<ref name=sculp/><ref>{{cite book|last1=McKeown|first1=Julie|title=Royal Doulton|date=1997|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=0747803382|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxBdYICh0cwC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq}}</ref> \n\nThe close connection between the art school and Doulton's meant that the ethos of City and Guilds of London School of Art was based, from very early days, on a belief in a strong connection between the fine arts, craft and design. Consequently, its students and teachers became associated with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and to some extent the [[Art Nouveau]] movement.<ref>[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline College timeline at www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk (accessed 8 March 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228232823/http://cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline |date=28 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Connection to Mssrs Farmer and Brindley===\nIn addition to Doulton's, Sparkes also cultivated contacts with other local craft trade companies, one of the most notable of which was Mssrs Farmer and Brindley, a Lambeth-based architectural stone carving and terra-cotta company.<ref>Emma Hardy, 'Farmer and Brindley, Craftsmen and Sculptors, 1850-1930' in The Victorian Society Annual 1993, pp. 4\u201317</ref> As with Doulton's, a number of apprentices at Farmer and Brindley augmented their training with study at the Art School. This included the sculptors Charles John Allen (1862\u20131956), Harry Bates (1850\u20131899) and Nathaniel Hitch (1846\u20131936), and others, who became prominent sculptors in the Victorian and Edwardian periods.<ref>[https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/search/index.php?searchtype=all&search=farmer+and+brindley&x=0&y=0 University of Glasgow Mapping Sculpture Project]</ref>\n\n===City and Guilds Institute and City Livery Companies===\nIn 1878 Sparkes secured funding in the art school of the newly founded [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], and also ran the pre-cursor to [[Imperial College London]].<ref name=dick/> The new backing secured the financial future of the art school without the strings attached to government funding. Under the new arrangement, the art school moved to new buildings in Kennington Park Road in Lambeth, which it still occupies, and was renamed the South London Technical School of Art. In 1932 it changed its name to the City and Guilds of London Institute Kennington and Lambeth Art School, reflecting the historical and continued support of the city of London [[Livery Companies]]. This was shortened in 1938 to the City and Guilds of London Art School.<ref>Jennifer Lang, ''City and Guilds of London Institute Centenary 1878-1978'' (London: City and Guilds Institute, 1978) p. 94</ref> The formal link between the parent body, the City and Guilds Institute, and the City and Guilds of London Art School was ended in 1971, when the art school became and independent trust.<ref>Jennifer Lang, ''City and Guilds of London Institute Centenary 1878-1978'' (London: City and Guilds Institute, 1978) p.138</ref>\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n\nGraduates of the Art School were involved in some of the leading social and political movements of the early twentieth century, including [[Clemence Housman]] and [[Laurence Housman]], who co-founded, in 1909, a society for artists who supported the [[Suffragette Movement]], called the [[Suffrage Atelier]].<ref>Elizabeth Crawford, ''The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928'' (London: Routledge, 1999) p. 662</ref> [[Laurence Housman]] later went on to found the alternative bookshop, which still bears his name, located in Caledonian Road, near London's [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] railway station.\n\nAfter the Second World War, new restoration and carving courses were established at the Art School to train people for the restoration of London's war-damaged buildings. However, during the 1960s the art school also developed a [[fine art]] program, although it still maintained and strengthened its programmes in restoration and carving. This resulted in the Art School evolving into both a school for fine art education, and a unique specialist training centre for the education of restorers and conservators of architectural stone and wood work. \n\nIn 1971 the Art School became an independent charitable trust, with the new Deed of Incorporation signed by Goeffrey Agnew (chairman of the art gallery [[Thomas Agnew & Sons]]), Sir Colin Skelton Anderson (Provost of the [[Royal College of Art]]), [[Sir John Betjeman]] (poet), [[Adrian Maurice Daintrey]] (artist), Gilbert Samuel (Lord Mayor of London), [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]] (sculptor and Former President of the [[Royal Academy]]), and [[Carel Weight]] (artist), amongst others. Support also came from artists such as [[Henry Moore]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Companies House, London, Articles of Association, reference no. 00992490</ref>\n\nIn 1997 and 1998 the Fine Art Painting, Sculpture and Conservation courses were validated at undergraduate BA (Hons) level.

When you contribute $10 for the chance to win a celebrity experience (set visit, dinner date, tickets to a premiere, etc.), $6 is donated to charity, $2.50 on average goes towards marketing expenses and credit card fees, and Omaze nets the remaining $1.50. A $10 contribution for the chance to win a prize-based experience (like a car, vacation or tuition) breaks down as follows: $1.50 is donated to charity; $7 typically goes to sourcing and shipping the prize, covering the winner's taxes, marketing the experience, and processing credit card fees; and $1.50 goes to Omaze. These experiences require substantially more resources to secure the prize and help spread the word.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaze.com/pages/about-us|website=Omaze|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nOmaze's business model has been criticized on the grounds that \"The celebrity culture and consumerism totally overrides the issue\" at hand,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/05/22/725782062/red-nose-day-2019-how-does-it-work-why-is-it-being-criticized|title=Red Nose Day 2019: How Does It Work, And Why Is It Being Criticized?|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> and that - while having been admittedly successful in raising large funds for organizations in need - it tends to \"divorce\" charity from its cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/tech/2017/10/25/16528024/omaze-online-charity-rick-and-morty|title=Can a Two-Minute Celebrity Video Save the World?|last=Bereznak|first=Alyssa|date=2017-10-25|website=The Ringer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> It has also been claimed that the organization fails to alert donors to the end of an event once a winner is supposed to be announced, and there is much speculation if some of the prizes are legitimate{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Companies based in Culver City, California]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2012]]\n[[Category:American fundraising websites]]\n[[Category:Online auction websites of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Cleanup|reason=Text sounds like advertisment.

When you contribute $10 for the chance to win a celebrity experience (set visit, dinner date, tickets to a premiere, etc.), $6 is donated to charity, $2.50 on average goes towards marketing expenses and credit card fees, and Omaze nets the remaining $1.50. A $10 contribution for the chance to win a prize-based experience (like a car, vacation or tuition) breaks down as follows: $1.50 is donated to charity; $7 typically goes to sourcing and shipping the prize, covering the winner's taxes, marketing the experience, and processing credit card fees; and $1.50 goes to Omaze. These experiences require substantially more resources to secure the prize and help spread the word.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaze.com/pages/about-us|website=Omaze|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nOmaze's business model has been criticized on the grounds that \"The celebrity culture and consumerism totally overrides the issue\" at hand,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/05/22/725782062/red-nose-day-2019-how-does-it-work-why-is-it-being-criticized|title=Red Nose Day 2019: How Does It Work, And Why Is It Being Criticized?|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> and that - while having been admittedly successful in raising large funds for organizations in need - it tends to \"divorce\" charity from its cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/tech/2017/10/25/16528024/omaze-online-charity-rick-and-morty|title=Can a Two-Minute Celebrity Video Save the World?|last=Bereznak|first=Alyssa|date=2017-10-25|website=The Ringer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> It has also been claimed that the organization fails to alert donors to the end of an event once a winner is supposed to be announced, and there is much speculation if some of the prizes are legitimate{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Companies based in Culver City, California]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2012]]\n[[Category:American fundraising websites]]\n[[Category:Online auction websites of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Varnent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Filled in 2 bare reference(s) with reFill 2", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaze"}

When, at ancient universities, the lector had completed his lecture, there would traditionally follow a disputation, during which students could take up certain points and argue them. The position that one took during a disputation was the thesis, while the dissertation was the line of reasoning with which one buttressed it. Olga Weijers: The medieval ''disputatio''. In: [http://www.ascleiden.nl/Pdf/horaestklein.pdf ''Hora est! (On dissertations)''], p.23-27. Leiden University Library, 2005</ref> is a document submitted in support of candidature for an [[academic degree]] or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings.<!-- who knows what this source actually says? It's not publicly accessible and (especially if not even quoted from) needs to be replaced with one that is--><ref name=\"iso7144\">International Standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 7144: Documentation\u2014[http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=13736&ICS1=1&ICS2=140&ICS3=40 Presentation of theses and similar documents], International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, 1986.</ref> In some contexts, the word \"thesis\" or a cognate is used for part of a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] or [[Master's degree|master's]] course, while \"dissertation\" is normally applied to a doctorate, while in other contexts, the reverse is true.<ref>[http://www.ascleiden.nl/Pdf/horaestklein.pdf Douwe Breimer, Jos Damen et al.: ''Hora est! (On dissertations)'']. Leiden University Library, 2005</ref> The term '''graduate thesis''' is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grad.ubc.ca/handbook-graduate-supervision/graduate-thesis|title=The Graduate Thesis|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university, or program, and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration.\n\nThe word \"dissertation\" can at times be used to describe a [[treatise]] without relation to obtaining an academic degree. The term \"thesis\" is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"thesis\" comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, meaning \"something put forth\", and refers to an intellectual [[proposition]]. \"Dissertation\" comes from the [[Latin]] ''dissert\u0101ti\u014d'', meaning \"discussion\". [[Aristotle]] was the first philosopher to define the term thesis. <blockquote>\"A 'thesis' is a supposition of some eminent philosopher that conflicts with the general opinion...for to take notice when any ordinary person expresses views contrary to men's usual opinions would be silly\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Works of Aristotle|last=Aristotle|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1928|isbn=|editor-last=Ross|editor-first=W.D.|volume=1|location=Oxford|pages=Bk. I.11 104b19\u201323|translator-last=Pickard-Cambridge|translator-first=W.A.|chapter=Topica}}</ref></blockquote>For Aristotle, a thesis would therefore be a supposition that is stated in contradiction with general opinion or express disagreement with other philosophers (104b33-35). A supposition is a statement or opinion that may or may not be true depending on the evidence and/or proof that is offered (152b32). The purpose of the dissertation is thus to outline the proofs of why the author disagrees with other philosophers or the general opinion.\n\n== Structure and presentation style ==\n[[File:Irony thesis.png|thumb|Cover page to [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]'s university thesis (1841).]]\n\n=== Structure ===\nA thesis (or dissertation) may be arranged as a [[thesis by publication]] or a [[monograph]], with or without appended papers, respectively, though many graduate programs allow candidates to submit a curated collection of published papers. An ordinary monograph has a [[title page]], an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], a [[table of contents]], comprising the various chapters like introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and [[bibliography]] or more usually a references section. They differ in their structure in accordance with the many different areas of study (arts, humanities, social sciences, technology, sciences, etc.) and the differences between them. In a thesis by publication, the chapters constitute an introductory and comprehensive review of the appended published and unpublished article documents.\n\nDissertations normally report on a research project or study, or an extended analysis of a topic. The structure of a thesis or dissertation explains the purpose, the previous research literature impinging on the topic of the study, the methods used, and the findings of the project. Most world universities use a multiple chapter format : \n:a) an introduction: which introduces the research topic, the methodology, as well as its scope and significance\n:b) a literature review: reviewing relevant literature and showing how this has informed the research issue\n:c) a methodology chapter, explaining how the research has been designed and why the research methods/population/data collection and analysis being used have been chosen \n:d) a findings chapter: outlining the findings of the research itself\n:e) an analysis and discussion chapter: analysing the findings and discussing them in the context of the literature review (this chapter is often divided into two\u2014analysis and discussion) \n:f) a conclusion.:<ref>Thomas, Gary (2009) ''Your Research Project''. Thousand Oaks: Sage.</ref><ref>Rudestam & Newton (2007) ''Surviving your dissertation. '' Thousand Oaks: Sage.</ref> which shows judgement or decision reached by thesis\n\n=== Style ===\nDegree-awarding institutions often define their own [[Style guide|house style]] that candidates have to follow when preparing a thesis document. In addition to institution-specific house styles, there exist a number of field-specific, national, and international standards and recommendations for the presentation of theses, for instance [[ISO 7144]].<ref name=\"iso7144\"/> Other applicable international standards include [[ISO 2145]] on section numbers, [[ISO 690]] on bibliographic references, and [[ISO 31]] on quantities or units.\n\nSome older house styles specify that [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (title page, abstract, table of content, etc.) must use a separate page number sequence from the main text, using [[Roman numerals]]. The relevant international standard<ref name=\"iso7144\"/> and many newer style guides recognize that this [[book design]] practice can cause confusion where electronic document viewers number all pages of a document continuously from the first page, independent of any printed page numbers. They, therefore, avoid the traditional separate number sequence for front matter and require a single sequence of [[Arabic numerals]] starting with 1 for the first printed page (the [[recto]] of the title page).\n\nPresentation requirements, including pagination, layout, type and color of paper, use of [[acid-free paper]] (where a copy of the dissertation will become a permanent part of the library collection), [[paper size]], order of components, and citation style, will be checked page by page by the accepting officer before the thesis is accepted and a receipt is issued.\n\nHowever, strict standards are not always required. Most Italian universities, for example, have only general requirements on the character size and the page formatting, and leave much freedom for the actual typographic details.<ref>{{cite web | title=Italian Studies MA Thesis Work Plan | url=https://italian.georgetown.edu/graduate-thesis-work-plan }}</ref>\n\n== Thesis committee ==\nThe thesis or dissertation committee is a committee that supervises a student's dissertation. In the US, these committees usually consist of a primary supervisor or [[Doctoral advisor|advisor]] and two or more committee members, who supervise the progress of the dissertation and may also act as the examining committee, or jury, at the oral examination of the thesis (see below).\n\nAt most universities, the committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with his or her primary adviser, usually after completion of the [[comprehensive examination]]s or prospectus meeting, and may consist of members of the comps committee. The committee members are doctors in their field (whether a PhD or other designation) and have the task of reading the dissertation, making suggestions for changes and improvements, and sitting in on the defense. Sometimes, at least one member of the committee must be a professor in a department that is different from that of the student.\n\n== Role of thesis supervisor ==\nThe role of the thesis supervisor is to assist and support a student in his/her studies, and to determine whether a thesis is ready for examination.<ref> Imperial College London, 'Roles and Responsibilities: Research Degree Supervision'. July 2014. https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/registry/qa/public/good-practice/roles-and-responsibilities/Research-Degree-Supervisor.pdf.

''Australian Universities' Review.'' 62(1):26-40.</ref> The thesis is authored by the student, not the supervisor. The duties of the thesis supervisor also include checking for copyright compliance and ensuring that the student has included in/with the thesis a statement attesting that he/she is the sole author of the thesis.<ref> M.

According to a committee resolution, the dissertation can be approved or rejected by an academic committee consisting of the thesis director, the thesis coordinator, and at least one evaluator from another recognized university in which the student is pursuing his or her academic program. All the dissertation referees must already have achieved at least the academic degree that the candidate is trying to reach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coneau.gob.ar/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825184546/http://www.coneau.edu.ar/index.php?item=29&apps=16&id=428&act=ver&idioma=en|url-status=dead|title=CONEAU|archivedate=25 August 2010|website=CONEAU}}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Disputed section|Canadian Theses|date=February 2016}}\n\nAt English-speaking [[List of universities in Canada|Canadian universities]], writings presented in fulfillment of [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] coursework requirements are normally called ''papers'', ''term papers'' or ''essays''. A longer paper or essay presented for completion of a 4-year bachelor's degree is sometimes called a ''major paper''. High-quality research papers presented as the empirical study of a \"postgraduate\" consecutive bachelor [[honours degree|''with Honours'']] or Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree are called ''thesis'' (Honours Seminar Thesis). Major papers presented as the final project for a master's degree are normally called ''thesis''; and major papers presenting the student's research towards a [[doctorate|doctoral degree]] are called ''theses'' or ''dissertations''.\n\nAt Canadian universities under the French influenced system,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca |title=Carleton University \u2013 Canada's Capital University |publisher=Carleton.ca |date= |accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref> students may have a choice between presenting a \"''m\u00e9moire''\"', which is a shorter synthetic work (roughly 75 pages) and a ''th\u00e8se'' which is one hundred pages or more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A synthetic monograph associated with doctoral work is referred to as a \"''th\u00e8se''\". See also [[compilation thesis]]. Either work can be awarded a \"''mention d'honneur''\" (excellence) as a result of the decision by the examination committee, although these are rare.\n\nA typical undergraduate paper or essay might be forty pages. Master's theses are approximately one hundred pages. PhD theses are usually over two hundred pages. This may vary greatly by discipline, program, college, or university. However, normally the required minimum study period is primarily depending on the complexity or quality of research requirements.\n\nTheses Canada acquires and preserves a comprehensive collection of Canadian theses at [[Library and Archives Canada]]' (LAC) through a partnership with Canadian universities who participate in the program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/thesescanada/index-e.html |title=Our Universities \u2013 About Theses Canada \u2013 Theses Canada Portal |publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Croatia ===\nAt most university [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] in Croatia, a degree is obtained by defending a thesis after having passed all the classes specified in the degree programme. In the [[Bologna process|Bologna]] system, the bachelor's thesis, called ''zavr\u0161ni rad'' (literally \"final work\" or \"concluding work\") is defended after 3 years of study and is about 30 pages long. Most students with bachelor's degrees continue onto master's programmes which end with a master's thesis called ''diplomski rad'' (literally \"diploma work\" or \"graduate work\"). The term dissertation is used for a doctoral degree paper (''doktorska disertacija'').\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn the Czech Republic, higher education is completed by passing all classes remaining to the educational compendium for given degree and defending a thesis. For [[bachelor]]s programme the thesis is called ''bakal\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 pr\u00e1ce'' (bachelor's thesis), for master's degrees and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees it is the ''diplomov\u00e1 pr\u00e1ce'' (master's thesis), and for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree it is dissertation ''dizerta\u010dn\u00ed pr\u00e1ce''. Thesis for so called Higher-Professional School (Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed odborn\u00e1 \u0161kola, VO\u0160) is called ''absolventsk\u00e1 pr\u00e1ce''.\n\n=== Finland ===\nThe following types of thesis are used in Finland (names in Finnish/Swedish):\n* ''Kandidaatintutkielma/kandidatavhandling'' is the dissertation associated with lower-level academic degrees ([[bachelor's degree]]), and at [[Vocational university|universities of applied science]].\n* ''Pro gradu(-tutkielma)/(avhandling )pro gradu'', colloquially referred to simply as 'gradu', is the dissertation for [[master's degrees]], which make up the majority of degrees conferred in Finland, and this is therefore the most common type of thesis submitted in the country.  The equivalent for engineering and architecture students is ''diplomity\u00f6/diplomarbete''.\n* The highest-level theses are called ''lisensiaatintutkielma/licentiatavhandling'' and ''(tohtorin)v\u00e4it\u00f6skirja/doktorsavhandling'', for [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] and [[Doctor (title)|doctoral]] degrees, respectively.\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:Claude Bernard's thesis for his doctorate Wellcome M0011459.jpg|thumb|The cover of the thesis presented by [[Claude Bernard]] to obtain his [[Doctorate of Medicine]] (1843).]]\n\nIn France, the academic dissertation or thesis is called a ''th\u00e8se'' and it is reserved for the final work of doctoral candidates. The minimum page length is generally (and not formally) 100 pages (or about 400,000 characters), but is usually several times longer (except for technical theses and for \"exact sciences\" such as physics and maths).\n\nTo complete a master's degree in research, a student is required to write a ''[[m\u00e9moire]]'', the French equivalent of a master's thesis in other higher education systems.\n\nThe word ''dissertation'' in French is reserved for shorter (1,000\u20132,000 words), more generic academic treatises.\n\nThe defense is called a ''soutenance''.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, an academic thesis is called ''Abschlussarbeit'' or, more specifically, the basic name of the degree complemented by ''-arbeit'' (rough translation: ''-work''; e.g., ''Diplomarbeit'', ''Masterarbeit'', ''Doktorarbeit''). For bachelor's and master's degrees, the name can alternatively be complemented by ''-thesis'' instead (e.g., ''Bachelorthesis'').\n\nLength is often given in page count and depends upon departments, faculties, and fields of study. A bachelor's thesis is often 40\u201360 pages long, a diploma thesis and a master's thesis usually 60\u2013100. The required submission for a doctorate is called a ''Dissertation'' or ''Doktorarbeit''. The submission for a [[Habilitation]], which is an academic qualification, not an academic degree, is called ''Habilitationsschrift'', not ''Habilitationsarbeit''. PhD by publication is becoming increasingly common in many fields of study{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}.\n\nA doctoral degree is often earned with multiple levels of a [[Latin honors]] remark for the thesis ranging from ''summa cum laude'' (best) to ''rite'' (duly). A thesis can also be rejected with a Latin remark (''non-rite'', ''non-sufficit'' or worst as ''sub omni canone''). Bachelor's and master's theses receive [[Academic grading in Germany|numerical grades]] from 1.0 (best) to 5.0 (failed).\n\n=== India ===\nIn India the thesis defense is called a {{lang|la|viva voce}} ([[Latin]] for \"by live voice\") examination (''viva'' in short). Involved in the ''viva'' are two examiners, one guide(student guide) and the candidate. One examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an [[external examiner]] from a different university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/programmes.html |title=MSc Engg and PhD in IISc |publisher=Ece.iisc.ernet.in |accessdate=24 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111192137/http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/programmes.html |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn India, PG Qualifications such as MSc Physics accompanies submission of dissertation in Part I and submission of a Project (a working model of an innovation) in Part II. Engineering and Designing qualifications such as BTech, B.E., B.Des, MTech, M.E. or M.Des also involves submission of dissertation. In all the cases, the dissertation can be extended for summer internship at certain [[research and development]] organizations or also as PhD synopsis.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn Indonesia, the term thesis is used specifically to refer to master's theses. The undergraduate thesis is called ''skripsi'', while the doctoral dissertation is called ''disertasi''. In general, those three terms are usually called as ''tugas akhir'' (final assignment), which is mandatory for the completion of a degree. Undergraduate students usually begin to write their final assignment in their third, fourth or fifth enrollment year, depends on the requirements of their respective disciplines and universities. In some universities, students are required to write a ''proposal skripsi'' or ''proposal tesis'' (thesis proposal) before they could write their final assignment. If the thesis proposal is considered to fulfill the qualification by the academic examiners, students then may proceed to write their final assignment.\n\n=== Iran ===\nIn Iran, usually students are required to present a thesis in their master's degree and a dissertation in their Doctorate degree, both of which requiring the students to defend their research before a committee and gaining their approval. Most of the norms and rules of writing a thesis or a dissertation are influenced by the French higher education system.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy there are normally three types of thesis. In order of complexity: one for the Laurea (equivalent to the UK Bachelor's Degree), another one for the Laurea Magistrale (equivalent to the UK Master's Degree) and then a thesis to complete the Dottorato di Ricerca (PhD). Thesis requirements vary greatly between degrees and disciplines, ranging from as low as 3\u20134 ECTS credits to more than 30. Thesis work is mandatory for the completion of a degree.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nMalaysian universities often follow the British model for dissertations and degrees. However, a few universities follow the United States model for theses and dissertations. Some public universities have both British and US style PhD programs. Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nIn Pakistan, at undergraduate level the thesis is usually called final year project, as it is completed in the senior year of the degree, the name project usually implies that the work carried out is less extensive than a thesis and bears lesser credit hours too. The undergraduate level project is presented through an elaborate written report and a presentation to the advisor, a board of faculty members and students. At graduate level however, i.e. in MS, some universities allow students to accomplish a project of 6 credits or a thesis of 9 credits, at least one publication <!--{{Fact}} begin-->{{fix\n|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed\n|text=citation needed\n|class=noprint Template-Fact\n|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources\n}}<!--{{Fact}} end--> is normally considered enough for the awarding of the degree with project and is considered mandatory for the awarding of a degree with thesis. A written report and a public thesis defense is mandatory, in the presence of a board of senior researchers, consisting of members from an outside organization or a university. A PhD candidate is supposed to accomplish extensive research work to fulfill the dissertation requirements with international publications being a mandatory requirement. The defense of the research work is done publicly.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nIn the Philippines, an academic thesis is named by the degree, such as bachelor/undergraduate thesis or masteral thesis. However, in [[Philippine English]], the term ''doctorate'' is typically replaced with ''doctoral'' (as in the case of \"doctoral dissertation\"), though in official documentation the former is still used. The terms ''thesis'' and ''dissertation'' are commonly used interchangeably in everyday language yet it generally understood that a ''thesis'' refers to bachelor/undergraduate and master academic work while a ''dissertation'' is named for doctorate work.\n\nThe Philippine system is influenced by American collegiate system, in that it requires a ''research project'' to be submitted before being allowed to write a thesis. This project is mostly given as a prerequisite writing course to the actual thesis and is accomplished in the term period before; supervision is provided by one professor assigned to a class. This project is later to be presented in front of an academic panel, often the entire faculty of an academic department, with their recommendations contributing to the acceptance, revision, or rejection of the initial topic. In addition, the presentation of the research project will help the candidate choose their primary thesis adviser.\n\nAn undergraduate thesis is completed in the final year of the degree alongside existing seminar (lecture) or laboratory courses, and is often divided into two presentations: ''proposal'' and ''thesis'' presentations (though this varies across universities), whereas a master thesis or doctorate dissertation is accomplished in the last term alone and is defended once. In most universities, a thesis is required for the bestowment of a degree to a candidate alongside a number of units earned throughout their academic period of stay, though for practice and skills-based degrees a ''practicum'' and a written report can be achieved instead. The examination board often consists of 3 to 5 examiners, often professors in a university (with a Masters or PhD degree) depending on the university's examination rules. Required word length, complexity, and contribution to scholarship varies widely across universities in the country.\n\n=== Poland ===\nIn Poland, a bachelor's degree usually requires a ''praca licencjacka'' (bachelor's thesis) or the similar level degree in engineering requires a ''praca in\u017cynierska'' (engineer's thesis/bachelor's thesis), the master's degree requires a ''praca magisterska'' (master's thesis). The academic dissertation for a PhD is called a ''dysertacja'' or ''praca doktorska''. The submission for the [[Habilitation]] is called ''praca habilitacyjna'' or ''dysertacja habilitacyjna''. Thus the term ''dysertacja'' is reserved for PhD and Habilitation degrees. All the theses need to be \"defended\" by the author during a special examination for the given degree. Examinations for PhD and Habilitation degrees are public.\n\n=== Portugal and Brazil ===\nIn Portugal and Brazil, a dissertation (''disserta\u00e7\u00e3o'') is required for completion of a master. The defense is done in a public presentation in which teachers, students, and the general public can participate. For the PhD, a thesis (''tese'') is presented for defense in a public exam. The exam typically extends over 3 hours. The examination board typically involves 5 to 6 scholars (including the advisor) or other experts with a PhD degree (generally at least half of them must be external to the university where the candidate defends the thesis, but it may depend on the University). Each university / faculty defines the length of these documents, and it can vary also in respect to the domains (a thesis in fields like philosophy, history, geography, etc., usually has more pages than a thesis in mathematics, computer science, statistics, etc.) but typical numbers of pages are around 60\u201380 for MSc and 150\u2013250 for PhD.{{Citation needed|reason=The number of pages can change a lot depending on the universities and the domains. Furthermore, 60 pages for a master's dissertation seems really wrong. I would say that the minimum is around 90. For instance, I accessed some master's dissertations randomly on the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's web site (http://www.teses.usp.br/index.php?option=com_jumi&fileid=11&Itemid=76&lang=en) and they had between 100 and 200 pages.|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn Brazil the Bachelor's Thesis is called ''TCC'' or ''Trabalho de Conclus\u00e3o de Curso'' (Final Term / Undergraduate Thesis / Final Paper).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.englishexperts.com.br/forum/como-dizer-tcc-trabalho-de-conclusao-de-curso-em-ingles-t402.html|title=Como dizer \"TCC - Trabalho de Conclus\u00e3o de Curso\" em ingl\u00eas|website=English Experts}}</ref>\n\n=== Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine ===\nIn Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine an academic dissertation or thesis is called what can be literally translated as a \"master's degree work\" (thesis), whereas the word ''dissertation'' is reserved for doctoral theses ([[Candidate of Sciences]]). To complete a master's degree, a student is required to write a thesis and to then defend the work publicly. The length of this manuscript usually is given in page count and depends upon educational institution, its departments, faculties, and fields of study {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== Slovenia ===\nAt universities in Slovenia, an academic thesis called ''diploma thesis'' is a prerequisite for completing undergraduate studies. The thesis used to be 40\u201360 pages long, but has been reduced to 20\u201330 pages in new [[Bologna process]] programmes. To complete Master's studies, a candidate must write ''magistrsko delo'' (Master's thesis) that is longer and more detailed than the undergraduate thesis. The required submission for the doctorate is called ''doktorska disertacija'' (doctoral dissertation). In pre Bologna programmes students were able to skip the preparation and presentation of a Master's thesis and continue straightforward towards doctorate.\n\n=== Slovakia ===\nIn Slovakia, higher education is completed by defending a thesis, which is called ''bachelor's thesis'' \"bakal\u00e1rska pr\u00e1ca\" for bachelors programme, master's thesis or \"diplomov\u00e1 pr\u00e1ca\" for master's degrees, and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees and dissertation \"dizerta\u010dn\u00e1 pr\u00e1ca\" for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:Licentiate thesis from Chalmers, Sweden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of a licentiate dissertation in Sweden]]\nIn Sweden, there are different types of theses. Practices and definitions vary between fields but commonly include the ''C thesis''/Bachelor thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies, ''D thesis''/'/[[Magister degree#Sweden|Magister]]/one year master's thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies and ''E Thesis''/two-year master's thesis, which corresponds to 30 HP or 20 weeks of independent studies. The undergraduate theses are called ''uppsats'' (\"essay\"), sometimes ''examensarbete'', especially at technical programmes.\n\nAfter that there are two types of post graduate theses: [[Licentiate (degree)#Finland and Sweden|licentiate]] thesis and PhD dissertation. A licentiate degree is approximately \"half a PhD\" in terms of the size and scope of the thesis. Swedish PhD studies should in theory last for four years, including course work and thesis work, but as many PhD students also teach, the PhD often takes longer to complete. The thesis can be written as a [[monograph]] or as a [[compilation thesis]]; in the latter case, the introductory chapters are called the ''kappa'' (literally \"coat\").<ref name=\"uhr-kappa\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uhr.se/publikationer/svensk-engelsk-ordbok/kappa-till-avhandling |title=introductory chapter of a compilation thesis |website=uhr.se |publisher=Universitets- och h\u00f6gskoler\u00e5det |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref> Either kind of PhD thesis is normally referred to as an ''avhandling''.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nOutside the academic community, the terms ''thesis'' and ''dissertation'' are interchangeable. At universities in the United Kingdom, the term ''thesis'' is usually associated with PhD/[[EngD]] ([[doctorate|doctoral]]) and research master's degrees, while ''dissertation'' is the more common term for a substantial project submitted as part of a taught master's degree or an [[undergraduate degree]] (e.g. [[Master of Science|MSc]], [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], BSc, [[BMus]], BEd, [[BEng]] etc.).\n\nThesis word lengths may differ by faculty/department and are set by individual universities.\n\nA wide range of supervisory arrangements can be found in the British academy, from single supervisors (more usual for undergraduate and Masters level work) to supervisory teams of up to three supervisors. In teams, there will often be a Director of Studies, usually someone with broader experience (perhaps having passed some threshold of successful supervisions). The Director may be involved with regular supervision along with the other supervisors, or may have more of an oversight role, with the other supervisors taking on the more day-to-day responsibilities of supervision.\n\n=== United States ===\nIn some U.S. doctoral programs, the \"dissertation\" can take up the major part of the student's total time spent (along with two or three years of classes) and may take years of full-time work to complete. At most universities, ''dissertation'' is the term for the required submission for the doctorate, and ''thesis'' refers only to the master's degree requirement.\n\n''Thesis'' is also used to describe a cumulative project for a bachelor's degree and is more common at selective colleges and universities, or for those seeking admittance to graduate school or to obtain an [[Latin honors|honors]] academic designation. These projects are called \"senior projects\" or \"senior theses\"; they are generally done in the senior year near graduation after having completed other courses, the independent study period, and the internship or student teaching period (the completion of most of the requirements before the writing of the paper ensures adequate knowledge and aptitude for the challenge). Unlike a dissertation or master's thesis, they are not as long and they do not require a novel contribution to knowledge or even a very narrow focus on a set subtopic. Like them, they can be lengthy and require months of work, they require supervision by at least one professor adviser, they must be focused on a certain area of knowledge, and they must use an appreciable amount of scholarly citations. They may or may not be defended before a committee but usually are not; there is generally no preceding examination before the writing of the paper, except for at very few colleges. Because of the nature of the graduate thesis or dissertation having to be more narrow and more novel, the result of original research, these usually have a smaller proportion of the work that is cited from other sources, though the fact that they are lengthier may mean they still have total citations.\n\nSpecific undergraduate courses, especially writing-intensive courses or courses taken by upperclassmen, may also require one or more extensive written assignments referred to variously as theses, essays, or papers. Increasingly, high schools are requiring students to complete a senior project or senior thesis on a chosen topic during the final year as a prerequisite for graduation. The [[extended essay]] component of the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme]], offered in a growing number of American high schools, is another example of this trend.\n\nGenerally speaking, a dissertation is judged as to whether or not it makes an original and unique contribution to scholarship. Lesser projects (a master's thesis, for example) are judged by whether or not they demonstrate mastery of available scholarship in the presentation of an idea.{{dubious|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe required complexity or quality of research of a thesis may vary significantly among universities or programs.\n\n== Thesis examinations ==\nOne of the requirements for certain advanced degrees is often an oral examination (called a ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'' examination or just ''viva'' in the UK and certain other English-speaking countries). This examination normally occurs after the dissertation is finished but before it is submitted to the university, and may comprise a presentation (often public) by the student and questions posed by an examining committee or jury. In North America, an initial oral examination in the field of specialization may take place just before the student settles down to work on the dissertation. An additional oral exam may take place after the dissertation is completed and is known as a '''thesis''' or '''dissertation''' \"'''defense'''\", which at some universities may be a mere formality and at others may result in the student being required to make significant revisions.\n\n=== Examination results ===\nThe result of the examination may be given immediately following deliberation by the examiners (in which case the candidate may immediately be considered to have received his or her degree), or at a later date, in which case the examiners may prepare a defense report that is forwarded to a Board or Committee of Postgraduate Studies, which then officially recommends the candidate for the degree.\n\nPotential decisions (or \"verdicts\") include:\n\n* Accepted/pass with no corrections.\n: The thesis is accepted as presented. A grade may be awarded, though in many countries PhDs are not graded at all, and in others, only one of the theoretically possible grades (the highest) is ever used in practice.\n\n* The thesis must be revised.\n: Revisions (for example, correction of numerous grammatical or spelling errors; clarification of concepts or methodology; an addition of sections) are required. One or more members of the jury or the thesis supervisor will make the decision on the acceptability of revisions and provide written confirmation that they have been satisfactorily completed. If, as is often the case, the needed revisions are relatively modest, the examiners may all sign the thesis with the verbal understanding that the candidate will review the revised thesis with his or her supervisor before submitting the completed version.\n\n* Extensive revision required.\n: The thesis must be revised extensively and undergo the evaluation and defense process again from the beginning with the same examiners. Problems may include theoretical or methodological issues. A candidate who is not recommended for the degree after the second defense must normally withdraw from the program.\n\n* Unacceptable.\n: The thesis is unacceptable and the candidate must withdraw from the program. This verdict is given only when the thesis requires major revisions and when the examination makes it clear that the candidate is incapable of making such revisions.\n\nAt most North American institutions the latter two verdicts are extremely rare, for two reasons. First, to obtain the status of doctoral candidates, graduate students typically write a qualifying examination or comprehensive examination, which often includes an oral defense. Students who pass the qualifying examination are deemed capable of completing scholarly work independently and are allowed to proceed with working on a dissertation. Second, since the thesis supervisor (and the other members of the advisory committee) will normally have reviewed the thesis extensively before recommending the student proceed to the defense, such an outcome would be regarded as a major failure not only on the part of the candidate but also by the candidate's supervisor (who should have recognized the substandard quality of the dissertation long before the defense was allowed to take place). It is also fairly rare for a thesis to be accepted without any revisions; the most common outcome of a defense is for the examiners to specify minor revisions (which the candidate typically completes in a few days or weeks).\n\nAt universities on the British pattern it is not uncommon for theses at the ''viva'' stage to be subject to major revisions in which a substantial rewrite is required, sometimes followed by a new ''viva''. Very rarely, the thesis may be awarded the lesser degree of M.Phil ([[Master of Philosophy]]) instead, preventing the candidate from resubmitting the thesis.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, doctoral theses are usually examined by three examiners although some, like the [[Australian Catholic University]] and the [[University of New South Wales]], have shifted to using only two examiners; without a live defense except in extremely rare exceptions. In the case of a master's degree by research the thesis is usually examined by only two examiners. Typically one of these examiners will be from within the candidate's own department; the other(s) will usually be from other universities and often from overseas. Following submission of the thesis, copies are sent by mail to examiners and then reports sent back to the institution.\n\nSimilar to a master's degree by research thesis, a thesis for the research component of a master's degree by coursework is also usually examined by two examiners, one from the candidate's department and one from another university. For an Honours year, which is a fourth year in addition to the usual three-year bachelor's degree, the thesis is also examined by two examiners, though both are usually from the candidate's own department. Honours and Master's theses sometimes require an oral defense before they are accepted.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, a thesis is usually examined with an oral examination. This applies to almost all [[Diplom]], [[Magister (degree)|Magister]], master's and doctoral degrees as well as to most bachelor's degrees. However, a process that allows for revisions of the thesis is usually only implemented for doctoral degrees.\n\nThere are several different kinds of oral examinations used in practice. The ''Disputation'', also called ''Verteidigung'' (\"defense\"), is usually public (at least to members of the university) and is focused on the topic of the thesis. In contrast, the ''Rigorosum'' is not held in public and also encompasses fields in addition to the topic of the thesis. The ''Rigorosum'' is only common for doctoral degrees. Another term for an oral examination is ''Kolloquium'', which generally refers to a usually public scientific discussion and is often used synonymously with ''Verteidigung''.\n\nIn each case, what exactly is expected differs between universities and between faculties. Some universities also demand a combination of several of these forms.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nLike the British model, the PHD or MPhil student is required to submit their theses or dissertation for examination by two or three examiners. The first examiner is from the university concerned, the second examiner is from another local university and the third examiner is from a suitable foreign university (usually from Commonwealth countries). The choice of examiners must be approved by the university senate. In some public universities, a PhD or MPhil candidate may also have to show a number publications in peer reviewed academic journals as part of the requirement. An oral viva is conducted after the examiners have submitted their reports to the university. The oral viva session is attended by the Oral Viva chairman, a rapporteur with a PhD qualification, the first examiner, the second examiner and sometimes the third examiner.\n\nBranch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses to examine their PhD or MPhil candidates.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nIn the Philippines, a thesis is followed by an oral defense. In most universities, this applies to all bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees. However, the oral defense is held in once per semester (usually in the middle or by the end) with a presentation of revisions (so-called \"plenary presentation\") at the end of each semester. The oral defense is typically not held in public for bachelor and master oral defenses, however a colloquium is held for doctorate degrees.\n\n===Portugal===\nIn Portugal, a thesis is examined with an oral defense, which includes an initial presentation by the candidate followed by an extensive questioning/answering period. Typical duration for the total exam is 1 hour 30 minutes for the MSc and 3 hours for the PhD.\n\n=== North America ===\nIn North America, the ''thesis defense'' or ''oral defense'' is the final examination for [[Doctorate|doctoral]] candidates, and sometimes for [[master's degree|master's]] candidates.\n\nThe examining committee normally consists of the thesis committee, usually a given number of professors mainly from the student's university plus his or her primary supervisor, an [[external examiner]] (someone not otherwise connected to the university), and a chair person. Each committee member will have been given a completed copy of the dissertation prior to the defense, and will come prepared to ask questions about the thesis itself and the subject matter. In many schools, master's thesis defenses are restricted to the examinee and the examiners, but doctoral defenses are open to the public.\n\nThe typical format will see the candidate giving a short (20\u201340-minute) presentation of his or her research, followed by one to two hours of questions.\n\nAt some U.S. institutions, a longer public lecture (known as a \"thesis talk\" or \"thesis seminar\") by the candidate will accompany the defense itself, in which case only the candidate, the examiners, and other members of the faculty may attend the actual defense.\n\n=== Russia and Ukraine ===\nA student in Ukraine or Russia has to complete a thesis and then defend it in front of their department. Sometimes the defense meeting is made up of the learning institute's professionals and sometimes the students peers are allowed to view or join in. After the presentation and defense of the thesis, the final conclusion of the department should be that none of them have reservations on the content and quality of the thesis.\n\nA conclusion on the thesis has to be approved by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the educational institute. This conclusion (final grade so to speak) of the thesis can be defended/argued not only at the thesis council, but also in any other thesis council of Russia or Ukraine.\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe former [[:es:Diploma de Estudios Avanzados|Diploma de estudios avanzados]] (DEA) lasted two years and candidates were required to complete coursework and demonstrate their ability to research the specific topics they have studied. From 2011 on, these courses were replaced by academic Master's programmes that include specific training on epistemology, and scientific methodology. After its completion, students are able to enrol in a specific PhD programme (''programa de doctorado'') and begin a dissertation on a set topic for a maximum time of three years (full-time) and five years (part-time). All students must have a full professor as an academic advisor (''director de tesis'') and a tutor, who is usually the same person.\n\nA dissertation (''tesis doctoral''), with an average of 250 pages, is the main requisite along with typically one previously published journal article. Once candidates have published their written dissertations, they will be evaluated by two external academics (''evaluadores externos'') and subsequently it is usually exhibited publicly for fifteen natural days. After its approval, candidates must defend publicly their research before a three-member committee (''tribunal'') with at least one visiting academic: chair, secretary and member (''presidente'', ''secretario'' y ''vocal'').\n\nA typical public Thesis Defence (''defensa'') lasts 45 minutes and all attendants holding a doctoral degree are suitable to ask questions.\n\n=== United Kingdom, Ireland and Hong Kong ===\nIn Hong Kong, Ireland and the United Kingdom, the thesis defense is called a {{lang|la|viva voce}}  ([[Latin]] for \"by live voice\") examination (''viva'' for short). A typical ''viva'' lasts for approximately 3 hours, though there is no formal time limit. Involved in the ''viva'' are two examiners and the candidate. Usually, one examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an [[external examiner]] from a different university. Increasingly, the examination may involve a third academic, the 'chair'; this person, from the candidate's institution, acts as an impartial observer with oversight of the examination process to ensure that the examination is fair. The 'chair' does not ask academic questions of the candidate.<ref>Pearce, Lynne (2005) ''How to Examine a Thesis'', McGraw-Hill International, pp. 79\u201385</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are only two or at most three examiners, and in many universities the examination is held in private. The candidate's primary supervisor is not permitted to ask or answer questions during the viva, and their presence is not necessary. However, some universities permit members of the faculty or the university to attend. At the University of Oxford, for instance, any member of the University may attend a DPhil viva (the University's regulations require that details of the examination and its time and place be published formally in advance) provided he or she attends in full academic dress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/25-54_1_Regulations_governing_the_content_and_length_of_theses.shtml#subtitle_2 |title=Oxford University Examination Regulations, 2007 |publisher=Admin.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=24 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113002548/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/25-54_1_Regulations_governing_the_content_and_length_of_theses.shtml#subtitle_2 |archive-date=13 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Submission ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nA submission of the thesis is the last formal requirement for most students after the defense. By the final [[time limit|deadline]], the student must submit a complete copy of the thesis to the appropriate body within the accepting institution, along with the appropriate forms, bearing the signatures of the primary supervisor, the examiners, and in some cases, the head of the student's department. Other required forms may include library authorizations (giving the university library permission to make the thesis available as part of its collection) and [[copyright]] permissions (in the event that the student has incorporated copyrighted materials in the thesis). Many large scientific publishing houses (e.g. [[Taylor & Francis]], [[Elsevier]]) use copyright agreements that allow the authors to incorporate their published articles into dissertations without separate authorization.\n\nFailure to submit the thesis by the deadline may result in graduation (and granting of the degree) being delayed. At most U.S. institutions, there will also be various fees (for binding, microfilming, copyright registration, and the like), which must be paid before the degree will be granted.\n\nOnce all the paperwork is in order, copies of the thesis may be made available in one or more university [[Library|libraries]]. Specialist abstracting services exist to publicize the content of these beyond the institutions in which they are produced. Many institutions now insist on submission of digitized as well as printed copies of theses; the digitized versions of successful theses are often made available online.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Compilation thesis]]\n* [[Comprehensive examination]]\n* [[Dissertation Abstracts]]\n* [[Grey literature]]\n* [[Postgraduate education]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|thesis}}\n* [[Wikibooks:ETD Guide|en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ETD Guide Guide to electronic theses and dissertations]] on [[Wikibooks]]\n* [http://www.ndltd.org Networked Digital Library of] [https://writingservice.ae/thesis-help Theses and Dissertations] (NDLTD)\n* [http://ethos.bl.uk/Home.do EThOS Database] Database of UK Doctoral theses available through the British Library\n\n{{Academic publishing}}\n{{Portal bar|Education}}\n\n[[Category:Academia]]\n[[Category:Educational assessment and evaluation]]\n[[Category:Grey literature]]\n[[Category:Rhetoric]]\n[[Category:Scientific documents]]\n[[Category:Theses| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Thesis (disambiguation)}}\n{{redirect|Dissertation|the novel|The Dissertation}}\n{{short description|Document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree}}\n{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:1721 PhD Ceremony at Leiden University.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Doctoral ceremony at [[Leiden University]] (7 July 1721).]]\nA '''thesis''' or '''dissertation'''<ref>Originally, the concepts \"dissertation\" and \"thesis\" (plural, \"theses\") were not interchangeable.

Leiden University Library, 2005</ref> The term '''graduate thesis''' is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grad.ubc.ca/handbook-graduate-supervision/graduate-thesis|title=The Graduate Thesis|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university, or program, and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration.\n\nThe word \"dissertation\" can at times be used to describe a [[treatise]] without relation to obtaining an academic degree. The term \"thesis\" is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"thesis\" comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, meaning \"something put forth\", and refers to an intellectual [[proposition]]. \"Dissertation\" comes from the [[Latin]] ''dissert\u0101ti\u014d'', meaning \"discussion\". [[Aristotle]] was the first philosopher to define the term thesis. <blockquote>\"A 'thesis' is a supposition of some eminent philosopher that conflicts with the general opinion...for to take notice when any ordinary person expresses views contrary to men's usual opinions would be silly\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Works of Aristotle|last=Aristotle|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1928|isbn=|editor-last=Ross|editor-first=W.D.|volume=1|location=Oxford|pages=Bk. I.11 104b19\u201323|translator-last=Pickard-Cambridge|translator-first=W.A.|chapter=Topica}}</ref></blockquote>For Aristotle, a thesis would therefore be a supposition that is stated in contradiction with general opinion or express disagreement with other philosophers (104b33-35). A supposition is a statement or opinion that may or may not be true depending on the evidence and/or proof that is offered (152b32). The purpose of the dissertation is thus to outline the proofs of why the author disagrees with other philosophers or the general opinion.\n\n== Structure and presentation style ==\n[[File:Irony thesis.png|thumb|Cover page to [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]'s university thesis (1841).]]\n\n=== Structure ===\nA thesis (or dissertation) may be arranged as a [[thesis by publication]] or a [[monograph]], with or without appended papers, respectively, though many graduate programs allow candidates to submit a curated collection of published papers. An ordinary monograph has a [[title page]], an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], a [[table of contents]], comprising the various chapters like introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and [[bibliography]] or more usually a references section. They differ in their structure in accordance with the many different areas of study (arts, humanities, social sciences, technology, sciences, etc.) and the differences between them. In a thesis by publication, the chapters constitute an introductory and comprehensive review of the appended published and unpublished article documents.\n\nDissertations normally report on a research project or study, or an extended analysis of a topic. The structure of a thesis or dissertation explains the purpose, the previous research literature impinging on the topic of the study, the methods used, and the findings of the project. Most world universities use a multiple chapter format : \n:a) an introduction: which introduces the research topic, the methodology, as well as its scope and significance\n:b) a literature review: reviewing relevant literature and showing how this has informed the research issue\n:c) a methodology chapter, explaining how the research has been designed and why the research methods/population/data collection and analysis being used have been chosen \n:d) a findings chapter: outlining the findings of the research itself\n:e) an analysis and discussion chapter: analysing the findings and discussing them in the context of the literature review (this chapter is often divided into two\u2014analysis and discussion) \n:f) a conclusion.:<ref>Thomas, Gary (2009) ''Your Research Project''. Thousand Oaks: Sage.</ref><ref>Rudestam & Newton (2007) ''Surviving your dissertation. '' Thousand Oaks: Sage.</ref> which shows judgement or decision reached by thesis\n\n=== Style ===\nDegree-awarding institutions often define their own [[Style guide|house style]] that candidates have to follow when preparing a thesis document. In addition to institution-specific house styles, there exist a number of field-specific, national, and international standards and recommendations for the presentation of theses, for instance [[ISO 7144]].<ref name=\"iso7144\"/> Other applicable international standards include [[ISO 2145]] on section numbers, [[ISO 690]] on bibliographic references, and [[ISO 31]] on quantities or units.\n\nSome older house styles specify that [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (title page, abstract, table of content, etc.) must use a separate page number sequence from the main text, using [[Roman numerals]]. The relevant international standard<ref name=\"iso7144\"/> and many newer style guides recognize that this [[book design]] practice can cause confusion where electronic document viewers number all pages of a document continuously from the first page, independent of any printed page numbers. They, therefore, avoid the traditional separate number sequence for front matter and require a single sequence of [[Arabic numerals]] starting with 1 for the first printed page (the [[recto]] of the title page).\n\nPresentation requirements, including pagination, layout, type and color of paper, use of [[acid-free paper]] (where a copy of the dissertation will become a permanent part of the library collection), [[paper size]], order of components, and citation style, will be checked page by page by the accepting officer before the thesis is accepted and a receipt is issued.\n\nHowever, strict standards are not always required. Most Italian universities, for example, have only general requirements on the character size and the page formatting, and leave much freedom for the actual typographic details.<ref>{{cite web | title=Italian Studies MA Thesis Work Plan | url=https://italian.georgetown.edu/graduate-thesis-work-plan }}</ref>\n\n== Thesis committee ==\nThe thesis or dissertation committee is a committee that supervises a student's dissertation. In the US, these committees usually consist of a primary supervisor or [[Doctoral advisor|advisor]] and two or more committee members, who supervise the progress of the dissertation and may also act as the examining committee, or jury, at the oral examination of the thesis (see below).\n\nAt most universities, the committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with his or her primary adviser, usually after completion of the [[comprehensive examination]]s or prospectus meeting, and may consist of members of the comps committee. The committee members are doctors in their field (whether a PhD or other designation) and have the task of reading the dissertation, making suggestions for changes and improvements, and sitting in on the defense. Sometimes, at least one member of the committee must be a professor in a department that is different from that of the student.\n\n== Role of thesis supervisor ==\nThe role of the thesis supervisor is to assist and support a student in his/her studies, and to determine whether a thesis is ready for examination.<ref> Imperial College London, 'Roles and Responsibilities: Research Degree Supervision'.

According to a committee resolution, the dissertation can be approved or rejected by an academic committee consisting of the thesis director, the thesis coordinator, and at least one evaluator from another recognized university in which the student is pursuing his or her academic program. All the dissertation referees must already have achieved at least the academic degree that the candidate is trying to reach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coneau.gob.ar/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825184546/http://www.coneau.edu.ar/index.php?item=29&apps=16&id=428&act=ver&idioma=en|url-status=dead|title=CONEAU|archivedate=25 August 2010|website=CONEAU}}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Disputed section|Canadian Theses|date=February 2016}}\n\nAt English-speaking [[List of universities in Canada|Canadian universities]], writings presented in fulfillment of [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] coursework requirements are normally called ''papers'', ''term papers'' or ''essays''. A longer paper or essay presented for completion of a 4-year bachelor's degree is sometimes called a ''major paper''. High-quality research papers presented as the empirical study of a \"postgraduate\" consecutive bachelor [[honours degree|''with Honours'']] or Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree are called ''thesis'' (Honours Seminar Thesis). Major papers presented as the final project for a master's degree are normally called ''thesis''; and major papers presenting the student's research towards a [[doctorate|doctoral degree]] are called ''theses'' or ''dissertations''.\n\nAt Canadian universities under the French influenced system,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca |title=Carleton University \u2013 Canada's Capital University |publisher=Carleton.ca |date= |accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref> students may have a choice between presenting a \"''m\u00e9moire''\"', which is a shorter synthetic work (roughly 75 pages) and a ''th\u00e8se'' which is one hundred pages or more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A synthetic monograph associated with doctoral work is referred to as a \"''th\u00e8se''\". See also [[compilation thesis]]. Either work can be awarded a \"''mention d'honneur''\" (excellence) as a result of the decision by the examination committee, although these are rare.\n\nA typical undergraduate paper or essay might be forty pages. Master's theses are approximately one hundred pages. PhD theses are usually over two hundred pages. This may vary greatly by discipline, program, college, or university. However, normally the required minimum study period is primarily depending on the complexity or quality of research requirements.\n\nTheses Canada acquires and preserves a comprehensive collection of Canadian theses at [[Library and Archives Canada]]' (LAC) through a partnership with Canadian universities who participate in the program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/thesescanada/index-e.html |title=Our Universities \u2013 About Theses Canada \u2013 Theses Canada Portal |publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Croatia ===\nAt most university [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] in Croatia, a degree is obtained by defending a thesis after having passed all the classes specified in the degree programme. In the [[Bologna process|Bologna]] system, the bachelor's thesis, called ''zavr\u0161ni rad'' (literally \"final work\" or \"concluding work\") is defended after 3 years of study and is about 30 pages long. Most students with bachelor's degrees continue onto master's programmes which end with a master's thesis called ''diplomski rad'' (literally \"diploma work\" or \"graduate work\"). The term dissertation is used for a doctoral degree paper (''doktorska disertacija'').\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn the Czech Republic, higher education is completed by passing all classes remaining to the educational compendium for given degree and defending a thesis. For [[bachelor]]s programme the thesis is called ''bakal\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 pr\u00e1ce'' (bachelor's thesis), for master's degrees and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees it is the ''diplomov\u00e1 pr\u00e1ce'' (master's thesis), and for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree it is dissertation ''dizerta\u010dn\u00ed pr\u00e1ce''. Thesis for so called Higher-Professional School (Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed odborn\u00e1 \u0161kola, VO\u0160) is called ''absolventsk\u00e1 pr\u00e1ce''.\n\n=== Finland ===\nThe following types of thesis are used in Finland (names in Finnish/Swedish):\n* ''Kandidaatintutkielma/kandidatavhandling'' is the dissertation associated with lower-level academic degrees ([[bachelor's degree]]), and at [[Vocational university|universities of applied science]].\n* ''Pro gradu(-tutkielma)/(avhandling )pro gradu'', colloquially referred to simply as 'gradu', is the dissertation for [[master's degrees]], which make up the majority of degrees conferred in Finland, and this is therefore the most common type of thesis submitted in the country.  The equivalent for engineering and architecture students is ''diplomity\u00f6/diplomarbete''.\n* The highest-level theses are called ''lisensiaatintutkielma/licentiatavhandling'' and ''(tohtorin)v\u00e4it\u00f6skirja/doktorsavhandling'', for [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] and [[Doctor (title)|doctoral]] degrees, respectively.\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:Claude Bernard's thesis for his doctorate Wellcome M0011459.jpg|thumb|The cover of the thesis presented by [[Claude Bernard]] to obtain his [[Doctorate of Medicine]] (1843).]]\n\nIn France, the academic dissertation or thesis is called a ''th\u00e8se'' and it is reserved for the final work of doctoral candidates. The minimum page length is generally (and not formally) 100 pages (or about 400,000 characters), but is usually several times longer (except for technical theses and for \"exact sciences\" such as physics and maths).\n\nTo complete a master's degree in research, a student is required to write a ''[[m\u00e9moire]]'', the French equivalent of a master's thesis in other higher education systems.\n\nThe word ''dissertation'' in French is reserved for shorter (1,000\u20132,000 words), more generic academic treatises.\n\nThe defense is called a ''soutenance''.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, an academic thesis is called ''Abschlussarbeit'' or, more specifically, the basic name of the degree complemented by ''-arbeit'' (rough translation: ''-work''; e.g., ''Diplomarbeit'', ''Masterarbeit'', ''Doktorarbeit''). For bachelor's and master's degrees, the name can alternatively be complemented by ''-thesis'' instead (e.g., ''Bachelorthesis'').\n\nLength is often given in page count and depends upon departments, faculties, and fields of study. A bachelor's thesis is often 40\u201360 pages long, a diploma thesis and a master's thesis usually 60\u2013100. The required submission for a doctorate is called a ''Dissertation'' or ''Doktorarbeit''. The submission for a [[Habilitation]], which is an academic qualification, not an academic degree, is called ''Habilitationsschrift'', not ''Habilitationsarbeit''. PhD by publication is becoming increasingly common in many fields of study{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}.\n\nA doctoral degree is often earned with multiple levels of a [[Latin honors]] remark for the thesis ranging from ''summa cum laude'' (best) to ''rite'' (duly). A thesis can also be rejected with a Latin remark (''non-rite'', ''non-sufficit'' or worst as ''sub omni canone''). Bachelor's and master's theses receive [[Academic grading in Germany|numerical grades]] from 1.0 (best) to 5.0 (failed).\n\n=== India ===\nIn India the thesis defense is called a {{lang|la|viva voce}} ([[Latin]] for \"by live voice\") examination (''viva'' in short). Involved in the ''viva'' are two examiners, one guide(student guide) and the candidate. One examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an [[external examiner]] from a different university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/programmes.html |title=MSc Engg and PhD in IISc |publisher=Ece.iisc.ernet.in |accessdate=24 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111192137/http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/programmes.html |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn India, PG Qualifications such as MSc Physics accompanies submission of dissertation in Part I and submission of a Project (a working model of an innovation) in Part II. Engineering and Designing qualifications such as BTech, B.E., B.Des, MTech, M.E. or M.Des also involves submission of dissertation. In all the cases, the dissertation can be extended for summer internship at certain [[research and development]] organizations or also as PhD synopsis.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn Indonesia, the term thesis is used specifically to refer to master's theses. The undergraduate thesis is called ''skripsi'', while the doctoral dissertation is called ''disertasi''. In general, those three terms are usually called as ''tugas akhir'' (final assignment), which is mandatory for the completion of a degree. Undergraduate students usually begin to write their final assignment in their third, fourth or fifth enrollment year, depends on the requirements of their respective disciplines and universities. In some universities, students are required to write a ''proposal skripsi'' or ''proposal tesis'' (thesis proposal) before they could write their final assignment. If the thesis proposal is considered to fulfill the qualification by the academic examiners, students then may proceed to write their final assignment.\n\n=== Iran ===\nIn Iran, usually students are required to present a thesis in their master's degree and a dissertation in their Doctorate degree, both of which requiring the students to defend their research before a committee and gaining their approval. Most of the norms and rules of writing a thesis or a dissertation are influenced by the French higher education system.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy there are normally three types of thesis. In order of complexity: one for the Laurea (equivalent to the UK Bachelor's Degree), another one for the Laurea Magistrale (equivalent to the UK Master's Degree) and then a thesis to complete the Dottorato di Ricerca (PhD). Thesis requirements vary greatly between degrees and disciplines, ranging from as low as 3\u20134 ECTS credits to more than 30. Thesis work is mandatory for the completion of a degree.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nMalaysian universities often follow the British model for dissertations and degrees. However, a few universities follow the United States model for theses and dissertations. Some public universities have both British and US style PhD programs. Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nIn Pakistan, at undergraduate level the thesis is usually called final year project, as it is completed in the senior year of the degree, the name project usually implies that the work carried out is less extensive than a thesis and bears lesser credit hours too. The undergraduate level project is presented through an elaborate written report and a presentation to the advisor, a board of faculty members and students. At graduate level however, i.e. in MS, some universities allow students to accomplish a project of 6 credits or a thesis of 9 credits, at least one publication <!--{{Fact}} begin-->{{fix\n|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed\n|text=citation needed\n|class=noprint Template-Fact\n|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources\n}}<!--{{Fact}} end--> is normally considered enough for the awarding of the degree with project and is considered mandatory for the awarding of a degree with thesis. A written report and a public thesis defense is mandatory, in the presence of a board of senior researchers, consisting of members from an outside organization or a university. A PhD candidate is supposed to accomplish extensive research work to fulfill the dissertation requirements with international publications being a mandatory requirement. The defense of the research work is done publicly.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nIn the Philippines, an academic thesis is named by the degree, such as bachelor/undergraduate thesis or masteral thesis. However, in [[Philippine English]], the term ''doctorate'' is typically replaced with ''doctoral'' (as in the case of \"doctoral dissertation\"), though in official documentation the former is still used. The terms ''thesis'' and ''dissertation'' are commonly used interchangeably in everyday language yet it generally understood that a ''thesis'' refers to bachelor/undergraduate and master academic work while a ''dissertation'' is named for doctorate work.\n\nThe Philippine system is influenced by American collegiate system, in that it requires a ''research project'' to be submitted before being allowed to write a thesis. This project is mostly given as a prerequisite writing course to the actual thesis and is accomplished in the term period before; supervision is provided by one professor assigned to a class. This project is later to be presented in front of an academic panel, often the entire faculty of an academic department, with their recommendations contributing to the acceptance, revision, or rejection of the initial topic. In addition, the presentation of the research project will help the candidate choose their primary thesis adviser.\n\nAn undergraduate thesis is completed in the final year of the degree alongside existing seminar (lecture) or laboratory courses, and is often divided into two presentations: ''proposal'' and ''thesis'' presentations (though this varies across universities), whereas a master thesis or doctorate dissertation is accomplished in the last term alone and is defended once. In most universities, a thesis is required for the bestowment of a degree to a candidate alongside a number of units earned throughout their academic period of stay, though for practice and skills-based degrees a ''practicum'' and a written report can be achieved instead. The examination board often consists of 3 to 5 examiners, often professors in a university (with a Masters or PhD degree) depending on the university's examination rules. Required word length, complexity, and contribution to scholarship varies widely across universities in the country.\n\n=== Poland ===\nIn Poland, a bachelor's degree usually requires a ''praca licencjacka'' (bachelor's thesis) or the similar level degree in engineering requires a ''praca in\u017cynierska'' (engineer's thesis/bachelor's thesis), the master's degree requires a ''praca magisterska'' (master's thesis). The academic dissertation for a PhD is called a ''dysertacja'' or ''praca doktorska''. The submission for the [[Habilitation]] is called ''praca habilitacyjna'' or ''dysertacja habilitacyjna''. Thus the term ''dysertacja'' is reserved for PhD and Habilitation degrees. All the theses need to be \"defended\" by the author during a special examination for the given degree. Examinations for PhD and Habilitation degrees are public.\n\n=== Portugal and Brazil ===\nIn Portugal and Brazil, a dissertation (''disserta\u00e7\u00e3o'') is required for completion of a master. The defense is done in a public presentation in which teachers, students, and the general public can participate. For the PhD, a thesis (''tese'') is presented for defense in a public exam. The exam typically extends over 3 hours. The examination board typically involves 5 to 6 scholars (including the advisor) or other experts with a PhD degree (generally at least half of them must be external to the university where the candidate defends the thesis, but it may depend on the University). Each university / faculty defines the length of these documents, and it can vary also in respect to the domains (a thesis in fields like philosophy, history, geography, etc., usually has more pages than a thesis in mathematics, computer science, statistics, etc.) but typical numbers of pages are around 60\u201380 for MSc and 150\u2013250 for PhD.{{Citation needed|reason=The number of pages can change a lot depending on the universities and the domains. Furthermore, 60 pages for a master's dissertation seems really wrong. I would say that the minimum is around 90. For instance, I accessed some master's dissertations randomly on the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's web site (http://www.teses.usp.br/index.php?option=com_jumi&fileid=11&Itemid=76&lang=en) and they had between 100 and 200 pages.|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn Brazil the Bachelor's Thesis is called ''TCC'' or ''Trabalho de Conclus\u00e3o de Curso'' (Final Term / Undergraduate Thesis / Final Paper).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.englishexperts.com.br/forum/como-dizer-tcc-trabalho-de-conclusao-de-curso-em-ingles-t402.html|title=Como dizer \"TCC - Trabalho de Conclus\u00e3o de Curso\" em ingl\u00eas|website=English Experts}}</ref>\n\n=== Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine ===\nIn Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine an academic dissertation or thesis is called what can be literally translated as a \"master's degree work\" (thesis), whereas the word ''dissertation'' is reserved for doctoral theses ([[Candidate of Sciences]]). To complete a master's degree, a student is required to write a thesis and to then defend the work publicly. The length of this manuscript usually is given in page count and depends upon educational institution, its departments, faculties, and fields of study {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== Slovenia ===\nAt universities in Slovenia, an academic thesis called ''diploma thesis'' is a prerequisite for completing undergraduate studies. The thesis used to be 40\u201360 pages long, but has been reduced to 20\u201330 pages in new [[Bologna process]] programmes. To complete Master's studies, a candidate must write ''magistrsko delo'' (Master's thesis) that is longer and more detailed than the undergraduate thesis. The required submission for the doctorate is called ''doktorska disertacija'' (doctoral dissertation). In pre Bologna programmes students were able to skip the preparation and presentation of a Master's thesis and continue straightforward towards doctorate.\n\n=== Slovakia ===\nIn Slovakia, higher education is completed by defending a thesis, which is called ''bachelor's thesis'' \"bakal\u00e1rska pr\u00e1ca\" for bachelors programme, master's thesis or \"diplomov\u00e1 pr\u00e1ca\" for master's degrees, and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees and dissertation \"dizerta\u010dn\u00e1 pr\u00e1ca\" for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:Licentiate thesis from Chalmers, Sweden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of a licentiate dissertation in Sweden]]\nIn Sweden, there are different types of theses. Practices and definitions vary between fields but commonly include the ''C thesis''/Bachelor thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies, ''D thesis''/'/[[Magister degree#Sweden|Magister]]/one year master's thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies and ''E Thesis''/two-year master's thesis, which corresponds to 30 HP or 20 weeks of independent studies. The undergraduate theses are called ''uppsats'' (\"essay\"), sometimes ''examensarbete'', especially at technical programmes.\n\nAfter that there are two types of post graduate theses: [[Licentiate (degree)#Finland and Sweden|licentiate]] thesis and PhD dissertation. A licentiate degree is approximately \"half a PhD\" in terms of the size and scope of the thesis. Swedish PhD studies should in theory last for four years, including course work and thesis work, but as many PhD students also teach, the PhD often takes longer to complete. The thesis can be written as a [[monograph]] or as a [[compilation thesis]]; in the latter case, the introductory chapters are called the ''kappa'' (literally \"coat\").<ref name=\"uhr-kappa\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uhr.se/publikationer/svensk-engelsk-ordbok/kappa-till-avhandling |title=introductory chapter of a compilation thesis |website=uhr.se |publisher=Universitets- och h\u00f6gskoler\u00e5det |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref> Either kind of PhD thesis is normally referred to as an ''avhandling''.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nOutside the academic community, the terms ''thesis'' and ''dissertation'' are interchangeable. At universities in the United Kingdom, the term ''thesis'' is usually associated with PhD/[[EngD]] ([[doctorate|doctoral]]) and research master's degrees, while ''dissertation'' is the more common term for a substantial project submitted as part of a taught master's degree or an [[undergraduate degree]] (e.g. [[Master of Science|MSc]], [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], BSc, [[BMus]], BEd, [[BEng]] etc.).\n\nThesis word lengths may differ by faculty/department and are set by individual universities.\n\nA wide range of supervisory arrangements can be found in the British academy, from single supervisors (more usual for undergraduate and Masters level work) to supervisory teams of up to three supervisors. In teams, there will often be a Director of Studies, usually someone with broader experience (perhaps having passed some threshold of successful supervisions). The Director may be involved with regular supervision along with the other supervisors, or may have more of an oversight role, with the other supervisors taking on the more day-to-day responsibilities of supervision.\n\n=== United States ===\nIn some U.S. doctoral programs, the \"dissertation\" can take up the major part of the student's total time spent (along with two or three years of classes) and may take years of full-time work to complete. At most universities, ''dissertation'' is the term for the required submission for the doctorate, and ''thesis'' refers only to the master's degree requirement.\n\n''Thesis'' is also used to describe a cumulative project for a bachelor's degree and is more common at selective colleges and universities, or for those seeking admittance to graduate school or to obtain an [[Latin honors|honors]] academic designation. These projects are called \"senior projects\" or \"senior theses\"; they are generally done in the senior year near graduation after having completed other courses, the independent study period, and the internship or student teaching period (the completion of most of the requirements before the writing of the paper ensures adequate knowledge and aptitude for the challenge). Unlike a dissertation or master's thesis, they are not as long and they do not require a novel contribution to knowledge or even a very narrow focus on a set subtopic. Like them, they can be lengthy and require months of work, they require supervision by at least one professor adviser, they must be focused on a certain area of knowledge, and they must use an appreciable amount of scholarly citations. They may or may not be defended before a committee but usually are not; there is generally no preceding examination before the writing of the paper, except for at very few colleges. Because of the nature of the graduate thesis or dissertation having to be more narrow and more novel, the result of original research, these usually have a smaller proportion of the work that is cited from other sources, though the fact that they are lengthier may mean they still have total citations.\n\nSpecific undergraduate courses, especially writing-intensive courses or courses taken by upperclassmen, may also require one or more extensive written assignments referred to variously as theses, essays, or papers. Increasingly, high schools are requiring students to complete a senior project or senior thesis on a chosen topic during the final year as a prerequisite for graduation. The [[extended essay]] component of the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme]], offered in a growing number of American high schools, is another example of this trend.\n\nGenerally speaking, a dissertation is judged as to whether or not it makes an original and unique contribution to scholarship. Lesser projects (a master's thesis, for example) are judged by whether or not they demonstrate mastery of available scholarship in the presentation of an idea.{{dubious|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe required complexity or quality of research of a thesis may vary significantly among universities or programs.\n\n== Thesis examinations ==\nOne of the requirements for certain advanced degrees is often an oral examination (called a ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'' examination or just ''viva'' in the UK and certain other English-speaking countries). This examination normally occurs after the dissertation is finished but before it is submitted to the university, and may comprise a presentation (often public) by the student and questions posed by an examining committee or jury. In North America, an initial oral examination in the field of specialization may take place just before the student settles down to work on the dissertation. An additional oral exam may take place after the dissertation is completed and is known as a '''thesis''' or '''dissertation''' \"'''defense'''\", which at some universities may be a mere formality and at others may result in the student being required to make significant revisions.\n\n=== Examination results ===\nThe result of the examination may be given immediately following deliberation by the examiners (in which case the candidate may immediately be considered to have received his or her degree), or at a later date, in which case the examiners may prepare a defense report that is forwarded to a Board or Committee of Postgraduate Studies, which then officially recommends the candidate for the degree.\n\nPotential decisions (or \"verdicts\") include:\n\n* Accepted/pass with no corrections.\n: The thesis is accepted as presented. A grade may be awarded, though in many countries PhDs are not graded at all, and in others, only one of the theoretically possible grades (the highest) is ever used in practice.\n\n* The thesis must be revised.\n: Revisions (for example, correction of numerous grammatical or spelling errors; clarification of concepts or methodology; an addition of sections) are required. One or more members of the jury or the thesis supervisor will make the decision on the acceptability of revisions and provide written confirmation that they have been satisfactorily completed. If, as is often the case, the needed revisions are relatively modest, the examiners may all sign the thesis with the verbal understanding that the candidate will review the revised thesis with his or her supervisor before submitting the completed version.\n\n* Extensive revision required.\n: The thesis must be revised extensively and undergo the evaluation and defense process again from the beginning with the same examiners. Problems may include theoretical or methodological issues. A candidate who is not recommended for the degree after the second defense must normally withdraw from the program.\n\n* Unacceptable.\n: The thesis is unacceptable and the candidate must withdraw from the program. This verdict is given only when the thesis requires major revisions and when the examination makes it clear that the candidate is incapable of making such revisions.\n\nAt most North American institutions the latter two verdicts are extremely rare, for two reasons. First, to obtain the status of doctoral candidates, graduate students typically write a qualifying examination or comprehensive examination, which often includes an oral defense. Students who pass the qualifying examination are deemed capable of completing scholarly work independently and are allowed to proceed with working on a dissertation. Second, since the thesis supervisor (and the other members of the advisory committee) will normally have reviewed the thesis extensively before recommending the student proceed to the defense, such an outcome would be regarded as a major failure not only on the part of the candidate but also by the candidate's supervisor (who should have recognized the substandard quality of the dissertation long before the defense was allowed to take place). It is also fairly rare for a thesis to be accepted without any revisions; the most common outcome of a defense is for the examiners to specify minor revisions (which the candidate typically completes in a few days or weeks).\n\nAt universities on the British pattern it is not uncommon for theses at the ''viva'' stage to be subject to major revisions in which a substantial rewrite is required, sometimes followed by a new ''viva''. Very rarely, the thesis may be awarded the lesser degree of M.Phil ([[Master of Philosophy]]) instead, preventing the candidate from resubmitting the thesis.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, doctoral theses are usually examined by three examiners although some, like the [[Australian Catholic University]] and the [[University of New South Wales]], have shifted to using only two examiners; without a live defense except in extremely rare exceptions. In the case of a master's degree by research the thesis is usually examined by only two examiners. Typically one of these examiners will be from within the candidate's own department; the other(s) will usually be from other universities and often from overseas. Following submission of the thesis, copies are sent by mail to examiners and then reports sent back to the institution.\n\nSimilar to a master's degree by research thesis, a thesis for the research component of a master's degree by coursework is also usually examined by two examiners, one from the candidate's department and one from another university. For an Honours year, which is a fourth year in addition to the usual three-year bachelor's degree, the thesis is also examined by two examiners, though both are usually from the candidate's own department. Honours and Master's theses sometimes require an oral defense before they are accepted.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, a thesis is usually examined with an oral examination. This applies to almost all [[Diplom]], [[Magister (degree)|Magister]], master's and doctoral degrees as well as to most bachelor's degrees. However, a process that allows for revisions of the thesis is usually only implemented for doctoral degrees.\n\nThere are several different kinds of oral examinations used in practice. The ''Disputation'', also called ''Verteidigung'' (\"defense\"), is usually public (at least to members of the university) and is focused on the topic of the thesis. In contrast, the ''Rigorosum'' is not held in public and also encompasses fields in addition to the topic of the thesis. The ''Rigorosum'' is only common for doctoral degrees. Another term for an oral examination is ''Kolloquium'', which generally refers to a usually public scientific discussion and is often used synonymously with ''Verteidigung''.\n\nIn each case, what exactly is expected differs between universities and between faculties. Some universities also demand a combination of several of these forms.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nLike the British model, the PHD or MPhil student is required to submit their theses or dissertation for examination by two or three examiners. The first examiner is from the university concerned, the second examiner is from another local university and the third examiner is from a suitable foreign university (usually from Commonwealth countries). The choice of examiners must be approved by the university senate. In some public universities, a PhD or MPhil candidate may also have to show a number publications in peer reviewed academic journals as part of the requirement. An oral viva is conducted after the examiners have submitted their reports to the university. The oral viva session is attended by the Oral Viva chairman, a rapporteur with a PhD qualification, the first examiner, the second examiner and sometimes the third examiner.\n\nBranch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses to examine their PhD or MPhil candidates.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nIn the Philippines, a thesis is followed by an oral defense. In most universities, this applies to all bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees. However, the oral defense is held in once per semester (usually in the middle or by the end) with a presentation of revisions (so-called \"plenary presentation\") at the end of each semester. The oral defense is typically not held in public for bachelor and master oral defenses, however a colloquium is held for doctorate degrees.\n\n===Portugal===\nIn Portugal, a thesis is examined with an oral defense, which includes an initial presentation by the candidate followed by an extensive questioning/answering period. Typical duration for the total exam is 1 hour 30 minutes for the MSc and 3 hours for the PhD.\n\n=== North America ===\nIn North America, the ''thesis defense'' or ''oral defense'' is the final examination for [[Doctorate|doctoral]] candidates, and sometimes for [[master's degree|master's]] candidates.\n\nThe examining committee normally consists of the thesis committee, usually a given number of professors mainly from the student's university plus his or her primary supervisor, an [[external examiner]] (someone not otherwise connected to the university), and a chair person. Each committee member will have been given a completed copy of the dissertation prior to the defense, and will come prepared to ask questions about the thesis itself and the subject matter. In many schools, master's thesis defenses are restricted to the examinee and the examiners, but doctoral defenses are open to the public.\n\nThe typical format will see the candidate giving a short (20\u201340-minute) presentation of his or her research, followed by one to two hours of questions.\n\nAt some U.S. institutions, a longer public lecture (known as a \"thesis talk\" or \"thesis seminar\") by the candidate will accompany the defense itself, in which case only the candidate, the examiners, and other members of the faculty may attend the actual defense.\n\n=== Russia and Ukraine ===\nA student in Ukraine or Russia has to complete a thesis and then defend it in front of their department. Sometimes the defense meeting is made up of the learning institute's professionals and sometimes the students peers are allowed to view or join in. After the presentation and defense of the thesis, the final conclusion of the department should be that none of them have reservations on the content and quality of the thesis.\n\nA conclusion on the thesis has to be approved by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the educational institute. This conclusion (final grade so to speak) of the thesis can be defended/argued not only at the thesis council, but also in any other thesis council of Russia or Ukraine.\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe former [[:es:Diploma de Estudios Avanzados|Diploma de estudios avanzados]] (DEA) lasted two years and candidates were required to complete coursework and demonstrate their ability to research the specific topics they have studied. From 2011 on, these courses were replaced by academic Master's programmes that include specific training on epistemology, and scientific methodology. After its completion, students are able to enrol in a specific PhD programme (''programa de doctorado'') and begin a dissertation on a set topic for a maximum time of three years (full-time) and five years (part-time). All students must have a full professor as an academic advisor (''director de tesis'') and a tutor, who is usually the same person.\n\nA dissertation (''tesis doctoral''), with an average of 250 pages, is the main requisite along with typically one previously published journal article. Once candidates have published their written dissertations, they will be evaluated by two external academics (''evaluadores externos'') and subsequently it is usually exhibited publicly for fifteen natural days. After its approval, candidates must defend publicly their research before a three-member committee (''tribunal'') with at least one visiting academic: chair, secretary and member (''presidente'', ''secretario'' y ''vocal'').\n\nA typical public Thesis Defence (''defensa'') lasts 45 minutes and all attendants holding a doctoral degree are suitable to ask questions.\n\n=== United Kingdom, Ireland and Hong Kong ===\nIn Hong Kong, Ireland and the United Kingdom, the thesis defense is called a {{lang|la|viva voce}}  ([[Latin]] for \"by live voice\") examination (''viva'' for short). A typical ''viva'' lasts for approximately 3 hours, though there is no formal time limit. Involved in the ''viva'' are two examiners and the candidate. Usually, one examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an [[external examiner]] from a different university. Increasingly, the examination may involve a third academic, the 'chair'; this person, from the candidate's institution, acts as an impartial observer with oversight of the examination process to ensure that the examination is fair. The 'chair' does not ask academic questions of the candidate.<ref>Pearce, Lynne (2005) ''How to Examine a Thesis'', McGraw-Hill International, pp. 79\u201385</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are only two or at most three examiners, and in many universities the examination is held in private. The candidate's primary supervisor is not permitted to ask or answer questions during the viva, and their presence is not necessary. However, some universities permit members of the faculty or the university to attend. At the University of Oxford, for instance, any member of the University may attend a DPhil viva (the University's regulations require that details of the examination and its time and place be published formally in advance) provided he or she attends in full academic dress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/25-54_1_Regulations_governing_the_content_and_length_of_theses.shtml#subtitle_2 |title=Oxford University Examination Regulations, 2007 |publisher=Admin.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=24 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113002548/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/25-54_1_Regulations_governing_the_content_and_length_of_theses.shtml#subtitle_2 |archive-date=13 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Submission ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nA submission of the thesis is the last formal requirement for most students after the defense. By the final [[time limit|deadline]], the student must submit a complete copy of the thesis to the appropriate body within the accepting institution, along with the appropriate forms, bearing the signatures of the primary supervisor, the examiners, and in some cases, the head of the student's department. Other required forms may include library authorizations (giving the university library permission to make the thesis available as part of its collection) and [[copyright]] permissions (in the event that the student has incorporated copyrighted materials in the thesis). Many large scientific publishing houses (e.g. [[Taylor & Francis]], [[Elsevier]]) use copyright agreements that allow the authors to incorporate their published articles into dissertations without separate authorization.\n\nFailure to submit the thesis by the deadline may result in graduation (and granting of the degree) being delayed. At most U.S. institutions, there will also be various fees (for binding, microfilming, copyright registration, and the like), which must be paid before the degree will be granted.\n\nOnce all the paperwork is in order, copies of the thesis may be made available in one or more university [[Library|libraries]]. Specialist abstracting services exist to publicize the content of these beyond the institutions in which they are produced. Many institutions now insist on submission of digitized as well as printed copies of theses; the digitized versions of successful theses are often made available online.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Compilation thesis]]\n* [[Comprehensive examination]]\n* [[Dissertation Abstracts]]\n* [[Grey literature]]\n* [[Postgraduate education]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|thesis}}\n* [[Wikibooks:ETD Guide|en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ETD Guide Guide to electronic theses and dissertations]] on [[Wikibooks]]\n* [http://www.ndltd.org Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations] (NDLTD)\n* [http://ethos.bl.uk/Home.do EThOS Database] Database of UK Doctoral theses available through the British Library\n\n{{Academic publishing}}\n{{Portal bar|Education}}\n\n[[Category:Academia]]\n[[Category:Educational assessment and evaluation]]\n[[Category:Grey literature]]\n[[Category:Rhetoric]]\n[[Category:Scientific documents]]\n[[Category:Theses| ]]\n", "name_user": "168.211.57.218", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis"}

She joined the party on 1 September 1930, and did some volunteer work, although she has not been characterized as politically active.

Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, \"My God, what a lot of rubbish.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=219}} In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, \"He no longer listens to voices of reason. Those who tell him what he wants to hear are the only ones he believes.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=222}}  There is no evidence that Magda attempted to intervene to save her Jewish stepfather from the [[Holocaust]]. Though his fate has not been established, it is widely assumed that he perished in the camps. Asked about her husband's [[antisemitism]], she answered: \"The F\u00fchrer wants it thus, and Joseph must obey.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=127}}\n\nFelix Franks, a German Jew who later became a British soldier, claimed that his grandparents got an [[exit visa]] from Germany with the help of Magda Goebbels:{{quote|My father and step-mother were left behind in Germany but, two days before the War started, they were asked to come to Gestapo Headquarters and given an exit visa.

Although she had a Jewish step-father, she eventually married Joseph Goebbels! My stepmother believes she may have acted as a sort of protecting hand and was involved with the exit visa.

Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nMagda was among the last to see both Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] before they [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on the afternoon of 30 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=827\u2013828}} On the following day, 1&nbsp;May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist [[Helmut Kunz]] to inject [[Goebbels children|their six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]] (Hitler's personal doctor) who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} Author [[James P. O'Donnell]] concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself. He surmises that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001}}\n\nMagda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=242}} According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.\n{{quote|We have demanded monstrous things from the German people, treated other nations with pitiless cruelty.

So you see, Ello, it would be quite impossible for me to go on living. We will take the children with us, they are too good, too lovely for the world which lies ahead. In the days to come Joseph will be regarded as one of the greatest criminals that Germany has ever produced. His children would hear that said daily, people would torment them, despise and humiliate them. They would have to bear the burden of his sins and vengeance would be wreaked on them...

In the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' she confided to Hitler's secretary [[Traudl Junge]], that \"I would rather have my children die, than live in disgrace, jeered at.

He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw\u00e4germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw\u00e4germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}}{{efn|[[Johannes Hentschel]] later told Misch a singular conflicting story that Goebbels killed himself in his room in the bunker, and Magda in the ''Vorbunker'', during the early hours of 2&nbsp;May. {{harv|Misch|2014|pp=182, 183}}}} The bodies were then doused with [[gasoline|petrol]], but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}}\n\nThe charred corpses were found on the afternoon of 2 May 1945 by Soviet troops.

Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, \"My God, what a lot of rubbish.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=219}} In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, \"He no longer listens to voices of reason. Those who tell him what he wants to hear are the only ones he believes.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=222}}  There is no evidence that Magda attempted to intervene to save her Jewish stepfather from the [[Holocaust]]. Though his fate has not been established, it is widely assumed that he perished in the camps. Asked about her husband's [[antisemitism]], she answered: \"The F\u00fchrer wants it thus, and Joseph must obey.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=127}}\n\nFelix Franks, a German Jew who later became a British soldier, claimed that his grandparents got an [[exit visa]] from Germany with the help of Magda Goebbels:{{quote|My father and step-mother were left behind in Germany but, two days before the War started, they were asked to come to Gestapo Headquarters and given an exit visa.

Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nMagda was among the last to see both Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] before they [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on the afternoon of 30 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=827\u2013828}} On the following day, 1&nbsp;May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist [[Helmut Kunz]] to inject [[Goebbels children|their six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]] (Hitler's personal doctor) who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} Author [[James P. O'Donnell]] concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself. He surmises that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001}}\n\nMagda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=242}} According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.\n{{quote|We have demanded monstrous things from the German people, treated other nations with pitiless cruelty.
