The \"Master cup\" series of Japan, \"Final round\" series of U.S.A, \"Strongstyle\" series of U.S.A, \"UT\" championship series of Europe are a few examples of events that are, or started off as exclusive Tekken events, and still hold it as a main game. The \"King of Iron Fist Tournament\" is a Tekken only tournament hosted by Namco themselves.

('''\u03a3\u0392\u03a1''', also '''SigRho''') is a national, collegiate, multicultural, [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|Greek-lettered fraternity]]. Sigma Beta Rho was founded on August 16, 1996, at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]].\n\n==Organization==\n\nThe '''National Executive Board''' (NEB) is the governing body of Sigma Beta Rho, and presides over the nationwide fraternity, which is divided into eight interim regions. Each region is appointed a Regional Governor (RG) by the NEB, who acts as the envoy to his respective region on the behalf of the NEB. Under each RG, there is also a Regional Advisory Committee (RAC).\n\nThe fraternity\u2019s national philanthropic focus is on its partnership with [[SOS Children's Villages]].<ref name=SigRhoserv>{{Cite web |url=http://society.sigrho.com/home/ |title=Sigma Beta Rho Community Channel |publisher=Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |accessdate=2010-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127092149/http://society.sigrho.com/home/# |archive-date=2010-01-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Sigma Beta Rho is currently working on establishing an internet-based newsletter, the Seven Star Journal.<ref name=sevstar>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sevenstarjournal.com/ |title=Seven Star Journal |publisher=Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |accessdate=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901040049/http://sevenstarjournal.com/ |archivedate=September 1, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nSigma Beta Rho is a charter member of the National APIDA Panhellenic Association (NAPA). Sigma Beta Rho member Akash Kuruvilla co-authored the original constitution of NAPA. The fraternity was also accepted into the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference]] (NIC) on 15 April 2007 as its 69th member.<ref name=SBRtoday>{{cite web|title=Sigma Beta Rho Today|url=http://sigrho.com/about-2/sigma-beta-rho-today/|work=sigrho.com|accessdate=14 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117160927/http://sigrho.com/about-2/sigma-beta-rho-today/|archivedate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nSigma Beta Rho maintains a non-hazing policy.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n\nThe first eight members of Sigma Beta Rho, known as the National Founding Fathers, are Saiful Khandker, Shoor Kalam, Russell Abdullah, Bonit Sharma, Rajan Dogra, Neil Datta, Suman Ghosh, and Anuj Datta.<ref name=SigRhoHistory>{{Cite web |url=http://sigmabetarho.com/main/aboutus.php |title=\u03a3\u0392\u03a1 National Founders |publisher=Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |accessdate=2010-06-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe eight founders originally attended three different college campuses, and came together to form Sigma Beta Rho as a South-Asian Interest fraternity. Sigma Beta Rho\u2019s pronouncement, however, occurred upon the establishment of its Beta chapter at Binghamton University on August 22, 1998. That same year the fraternity incorporated under the State Department of New York. Since 1998, Sigma Beta Rho has expanded to over 60 chapters and colonies in the United States, and has a total membership of over 3500 brothers.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Diversification===\n\nIn its first few years of existence, Sigma Beta Rho changed its focus from a South-Asian interest fraternity to one with a multicultural mission. The fraternity's mission advocates the idea that the United States is a [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|cultural salad bowl]], and that members should actively embrace both their own cultural heritage, as well as a work towards a better understanding of the greater community.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Entities==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ '''Entities of Sigma Beta Rho'''<ref name=SigRhoEntities>{{Cite web |url=http://sigrho.com/chapters/ |title=Chapters - Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |publisher=Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The fraternity was founded in 1906. As of January 2020, the fraternity has 161 Chartered Chapters, 80 active chapters, 11 colonies and around 4,300 [[College|collegiate]] members.<ref name=facts /> [[SeriousFun Children's Network]], founded by Beta Chapter alumnus [[Paul Newman]], is Phi Kappa Tau's National Philanthropy.

Under membership qualifications, \"Any male student not a member of a national college fraternity other than an honor society or professional fraternity who is pursuing undergraduate, ''post-graduate, or professional study''\" (Emphasis added).</ref>\n\nPhi Kappa Tau's mission statement is \"To champion a lifelong commitment to brotherhood, learning, ethical leadership and exemplary character.\" The fraternity's vision is \"To be recognized as a leadership organization that binds men together and challenges them to improve their campuses and the world.\"\n\n==History==\nPhi Kappa Tau Fraternity (commonly called [[Phi Tau (disambiguation)|Phi Tau]]) was founded in the Union Literary Society Hall of [[Miami University|Miami University's]] [[Harrison Hall (Miami University)|Old Main Building]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]], on March 17, 1906. The four founders were [[Taylor A. Borradaile]], [[Clinton D. Boyd]], [[Dwight I. Douglass]], and [[William H. Shideler]].\n\n[[File:harrison hall 3.png|left|thumb|alt=\"Old\" Harrison Hall|Old Main at Miami University, Phi Kappa Tau's founding site]]\nThe fraternity was founded as the non-Fraternity Association to give Miami's non-fraternity men a voice in campus political affairs. The name was changed to [[Phrenocon]] on March 6, 1909. The two proposed names were the \"Miami Friends\" and the \"Miami Comrades\", which were combined to form \"Frenocom\". \"Phrenocon\" was actually an alternate spelling of \"Frenocom\", the idea being to make the name sound more Greek.\n\nPhrenocon became \"national\" in 1911 when an organization of independent men known as the Ohio University Union chose to become the [[Ohio University]] chapter of Phrenocon. Additional Phrenocon chapters were established at [[Ohio State University]], [[Centre College]], [[Mount Union College]] and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]]. At Miami, Phrenocon began to have difficulty retaining members by the early 1910s. Often, men would join Phrenocon, then later withdraw their membership and join Greek-letter fraternities. In fact, the Miami chapters of [[Delta Tau Delta]] and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] were founded by Phrenocon members. For that reason, the Miami Chapter of Phrenocon withdrew from the National Phrenocon and adopted the name Phi Kappa Tau on March 9, 1916. Since 1919, Phi Kappa Tau has published a magazine, The Laurel. Previously, the magazine was known as Sidelights. The rest of the chapters agreed to the name change on December 21 of that year and invited Miami to return to the national organization as the Alpha chapter of Phi Kappa Tau. Eta Chapter at [[Muhlenberg College]] was the first chapter to charter after the change to Phi Kappa Tau. As part of their risk management policy, Phi Kappa Tau prohibits chapters from engaging in [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|hazing]] and underage drinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phikappatau.org/images/stories/learning/risk_management/PKT%20Risk%20Management%20Policy.pdf|title=Phi Kappa Tau Risk Management Policy - Reviewed July 2011|publisher=Phi Kappa Tau|format=pdf|accessdate=10 October 2013|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024603/http://phikappatau.org/images/stories/learning/risk_management/PKT%20Risk%20Management%20Policy.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> The fraternity recognizes a National Hazing Prevention Week in late September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phikappatau.org/preventhazing|title=Prevent Hazing|publisher=Phi Kappa Tau|accessdate=10 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930002106/http://www.phikappatau.org/preventhazing|archivedate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nPhi Kappa Tau has been a member since 1916 of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] (NIC), a consortium of national men's [[fraternities and sororities|social fraternities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicindy.org|title=North American Interfraternity Conference|author=|date=|website=North American Interfraternity Conference|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Phi Kappa Tau Foundation==\nThe Phi Kappa Tau Foundation was created in 1945 as a separate charitable organization.<ref name=facts />  The Foundation's significant expansion began in 1983 with the announcement of a challenge gift of over $1 million from [[Ewing T. Boles]], a member of fraternity's Delta Chapter at [[Centre College]]. The Boles gift was the largest gift to a fraternity or sorority foundation up until that time and became the lead gift in a $3.2-million capital campaign. That same year Boles was named an Honorary Founder by Phi Kappa Tau. Boles left an additional bequest of over $3 million to the Foundation upon his death. Its current assets exceed $11 million.<ref name=\"facts\">{{cite web|url=https://www.phikappatau.org/about/fraternity/|title=Mission, Creed, and Insignia of Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity|author=|date=|website=phikappatau.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organization and leadership==\nPhi Kappa Tau chapters are organized into Resident Councils which include the current collegiate members of a chapter and Graduate Councils made up of all members who have graduated or left school. Each council of a chapter is entitled to a vote at the National Convention, which typically meets every two years and is the highest level of authority in the organization. The convention elects a National Council which serves as a [[board of directors]] for the fraternity and governs between conventions.\n\nExecutive offices of the Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity and Foundation are in Oxford, Ohio. William F. Brasch (Louisville) is national president and Dale Holland (Kent State) is national vice president.<ref>62nd National Convention of Phi Kappa Tau</ref>\n\n==Men of Character Programs==\n{{Advert section|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe Phi Kappa Tau Men of Character Programs' mission is to build a greater and deeper understanding of the values of Phi Kappa Tau. This is intended to help the organization to build and sustain outstanding chapters and to help members grow as leaders.\n\nThe Presidents Academy trains new chapter presidents in the responsibilities of a president. Participants are taught how to lead effective meetings, create constructive relationships, and manage crises. Participants also network with other chapter and national Fraternity leaders.\n\nRegional Conferences are one-day conferences designed to prepare incoming officers for their positions, while providing additional members training to be more effective chapter leaders. The conferences educate participants on leadership skill building, an overview of Fraternity operations and the day-to-day tasks of the particular offices.\n\nThe Leadership Academy is the Fraternity' individualized leadership-development event. The four-day program is offered in two to three sessions of 40-60 students at summer camps across the country.\n\nA Building Men of Character (BMC) Retreat is a two-day chapter-focused program intended to help chapters develop a vision and plan of action.\n\nGood to Great Retreats are modeled after ideas presented in [[James C. Collins]]' book ''[[Good to Great]]''. They are four-hour programs designed to assist chapters with specific issues or needs. The programs focus on such topics as recruiting men of character, Ritual, Executive Council transitions, and risk management through a program called \"ResponseAbility\".\n\nThe Volunteer Development Institute is a three-day program designed for volunteers who work directly with chapters.

The four founders were [[Taylor A. Borradaile]], [[Clinton D. Boyd]], [[Dwight I. Douglass]], and [[William H. Shideler]].\n\n[[File:harrison hall 3.png|left|thumb|alt=\"Old\" Harrison Hall|Old Main at Miami University, Phi Kappa Tau's founding site]]\nThe fraternity was founded as the non-Fraternity Association to give Miami's non-fraternity men a voice in campus political affairs. The name was changed to [[Phrenocon]] on March 6, 1909. The two proposed names were the \"Miami Friends\" and the \"Miami Comrades\", which were combined to form \"Frenocom\". \"Phrenocon\" was actually an alternate spelling of \"Frenocom\", the idea being to make the name sound more Greek.\n\nPhrenocon became \"national\" in 1911 when an organization of independent men known as the Ohio University Union chose to become the [[Ohio University]] chapter of Phrenocon. Additional Phrenocon chapters were established at [[Ohio State University]], [[Centre College]], [[Mount Union College]] and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]]. At Miami, Phrenocon began to have difficulty retaining members by the early 1910s. Often, men would join Phrenocon, then later withdraw their membership and join Greek-letter fraternities. In fact, the Miami chapters of [[Delta Tau Delta]] and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] were founded by Phrenocon members. For that reason, the Miami Chapter of Phrenocon withdrew from the National Phrenocon and adopted the name Phi Kappa Tau on March 9, 1916. Since 1919, Phi Kappa Tau has published a magazine, The Laurel. Previously, the magazine was known as Sidelights. The rest of the chapters agreed to the name change on December 21 of that year and invited Miami to return to the national organization as the Alpha chapter of Phi Kappa Tau. Eta Chapter at [[Muhlenberg College]] was the first chapter to charter after the change to Phi Kappa Tau. As part of their risk management policy, Phi Kappa Tau prohibits chapters from engaging in [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|hazing]] and underage drinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phikappatau.org/images/stories/learning/risk_management/PKT%20Risk%20Management%20Policy.pdf|title=Phi Kappa Tau Risk Management Policy - Reviewed July 2011|publisher=Phi Kappa Tau|format=pdf|accessdate=10 October 2013|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024603/http://phikappatau.org/images/stories/learning/risk_management/PKT%20Risk%20Management%20Policy.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> The fraternity recognizes a National Hazing Prevention Week in late September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phikappatau.org/preventhazing|title=Prevent Hazing|publisher=Phi Kappa Tau|accessdate=10 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930002106/http://www.phikappatau.org/preventhazing|archivedate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nPhi Kappa Tau has been a member since 1916 of the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference]] (NIC), a consortium of national men's [[fraternities and sororities|social fraternities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicindy.org|title=North-American Interfraternity Conference|author=|date=|website=North-American Interfraternity Conference|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Phi Kappa Tau Foundation==\nThe Phi Kappa Tau Foundation was created in 1945 as a separate charitable organization.<ref name=facts />  The Foundation's significant expansion began in 1983 with the announcement of a challenge gift of over $1 million from [[Ewing T. Boles]], a member of fraternity's Delta Chapter at [[Centre College]]. The Boles gift was the largest gift to a fraternity or sorority foundation up until that time and became the lead gift in a $3.2-million capital campaign. That same year Boles was named an Honorary Founder by Phi Kappa Tau. Boles left an additional bequest of over $3 million to the Foundation upon his death. Its current assets exceed $11 million.<ref name=\"facts\">{{cite web|url=https://www.phikappatau.org/about/fraternity/|title=Mission, Creed, and Insignia of Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity|author=|date=|website=phikappatau.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organization and leadership==\nPhi Kappa Tau chapters are organized into Resident Councils which include the current collegiate members of a chapter and Graduate Councils made up of all members who have graduated or left school. Each council of a chapter is entitled to a vote at the National Convention, which typically meets every two years and is the highest level of authority in the organization. The convention elects a National Council which serves as a [[board of directors]] for the fraternity and governs between conventions.\n\nExecutive offices of the Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity and Foundation are in Oxford, Ohio. William F. Brasch (Louisville) is national president and Dale Holland (Kent State) is national vice president.<ref>62nd National Convention of Phi Kappa Tau</ref>\n\n==Men of Character Programs==\n{{Advert section|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe Phi Kappa Tau Men of Character Programs' mission is to build a greater and deeper understanding of the values of Phi Kappa Tau. This is intended to help the organization to build and sustain outstanding chapters and to help members grow as leaders.\n\nThe Presidents Academy trains new chapter presidents in the responsibilities of a president. Participants are taught how to lead effective meetings, create constructive relationships, and manage crises. Participants also network with other chapter and national Fraternity leaders.\n\nRegional Conferences are one-day conferences designed to prepare incoming officers for their positions, while providing additional members training to be more effective chapter leaders. The conferences educate participants on leadership skill building, an overview of Fraternity operations and the day-to-day tasks of the particular offices.\n\nThe Leadership Academy is the Fraternity' individualized leadership-development event. The four-day program is offered in two to three sessions of 40-60 students at summer camps across the country.\n\nA Building Men of Character (BMC) Retreat is a two-day chapter-focused program intended to help chapters develop a vision and plan of action.\n\nGood to Great Retreats are modeled after ideas presented in [[James C. Collins]]' book ''[[Good to Great]]''. They are four-hour programs designed to assist chapters with specific issues or needs. The programs focus on such topics as recruiting men of character, Ritual, Executive Council transitions, and risk management through a program called \"ResponseAbility\".\n\nThe Volunteer Development Institute is a three-day program designed for volunteers who work directly with chapters. The program is focused on working with college students and providing volunteers with an understanding of the national organization.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn 2003, [[Bradley University]] student Robert Schmalz, age 22, died from alcohol poisoning during a rush week event.
