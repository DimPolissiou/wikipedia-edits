In the first year of service, the new library saw over 660,000 visits from the community, and over 100,000 people used the meeting room spaces, including the new 200-seat Whipple Auditorium.\n\n==History==\n\nOn March 2, 1896 the city of Cedar Rapids was to make a vote on whether or not they would have a public library. Due largely to the work of a group of women called the City Federation of Ladies Literary Clubs led by Ada Van Vechten, the vote was favorable. On January 15, 1897, the first public library was to open its doors to the citizens of Cedar Rapids. It was located in a small room of the Granby building.<ref name=Ralph>{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Ralph|title=Tales of the Town: Little-Known Anecdotes of Life in Cedar Rapids|year=1967|publisher=Stamats Publishing Company|pages=105\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nAfter a few years, the library had outgrown the room. It was moved to the Dows auditorium in May 1900. [[Andrew Carnegie]] was contacted in late January 1901 to request money to construct a dedicated library building. He agreed to give $75,000 if the town would pledge $7,500 in taxation annually to support the maintenance. In early 1903, the library chose Ely corner at Third Avenue and Fifth Street as the future site of the [[Carnegie library]]. On June 23, 1905, the new library was open.<ref name=\"Ralph\"/><ref name=Brown>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Janet|title=The First 100 Years: 1896-1996|year=1996|pages=1\u201378}}</ref>\n\nThe years to follow were filled with a variety of strategies to expand services within the town and beyond. In 1910, E. Joanna Hagey became the librarian. She was the driving force behind the extension work for nearly three decades. Books were brought to schools, drug stores, and workplaces for extra convenience. Surrounding townships had contracted for library services.<ref>{{cite news|title=We're Certainly Bookworms Here|newspaper=The Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette|date=December 5, 1914}}</ref> By 1928, six library stations were in operation. In 1930 there was a new Kenwood Park station, the first branch building owned by the library.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], circulation had reached record highs for the library. Beginning in 1933, the circulation began to fall as it had for other libraries across the nation. Everything started to normalize towards the end of the '30s. In 1940 there were 15 people staffing the library. The head librarian, who had replaced Hagey at the end of 1939, was Miss Alice Story. Another librarian that would later have a lasting effect on the library and the community, Evelyn Zerzanek, worked under Miss Story as the head librarian of the school and the children's department.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nEvelyn Zerzanek worked hard to not only get books into children's hands, but also to think for themselves and be creative. Under her direction, the summer reading programs and story times had increased in popularity.<ref>{{cite news|last=McHugh|first=Nancy|title=Library Introduces 'Project Neptune'|newspaper=The Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=June 20, 1965}}</ref> Evelyn also loved children's book illustrations.

Together they would make twelve stops each week at regular locations. Instead of many rented stations, the library now consisted of the two bookmobiles, the Kenwood Park station, and the main building.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=John|title=Second Bookmobile for Cedar Rapids|newspaper=The Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=October 31, 1954}}</ref>\n\nCrowding became a pressing issue for the library throughout the '60s. Much of the material had to be stored in the basement. New materials had to be turned away due to the space restrictions. In 1969, the library proposed to expand the current building and to establish a west-side branch. It failed to reach 60% voter approval.<ref>{{cite news|last=Elsea|first=Jerry|title=Library Bonds Need 60 Percent Margin|newspaper=The Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=December 14, 1969}}</ref> In 1971, a branch was established on Edgewood Road NW. The first two of three bookmobiles were retired by 1972.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nFor the next twelve years, the library would be unsuccessful at securing a majority vote. The library had changed its proposal from remodeling the library to constructing a new facility during that time. In 1981, the Hall Foundation offered over 25% of the $7.9 million bond issue if the city would pay the remainder, but again, the 60% voter approval would not be met. About four months later, the Hall Foundation of Cedar Rapids offered to pay $6.8 million over the next ten years on the condition that the Library Foundation, established in 1972, could obtain $1 million in private donations. By the end of September, $1.3 million in private contributions had secured the amount necessary to move forward with the plans for a new library.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nThe new library at 500 First Street SE opened on February 17, 1985. The floor space of the new building was 83,000 square feet compared with 29,000 square feet in the Carnegie building. Space issues were not the reason for moving as they had been in the past. The flood of 2008 had taken out much of the adult and reference collections. The children's books on the upper level, along with the Zerzanek collection, were all saved.<ref>{{cite news|last=Raasch|first=Jeff|title=Getting Library Back Will Be 'Healing'|newspaper=The Gazette|date=June 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe library would lease space at the Westdale Mall where they had already established a library branch in August 1988. The branch material would be consolidated with the library's surviving collection in the former Osco Drug Store space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Belz|first=Adam|title=C.R.

They offer a variety of programs including the Summer Reading Program, Adult Summer Reading Program, story times, and Play and Learn. There are a number of databases and other materials, such as e-books, downloadable audiobooks, and downloadable music, that can be accessed either at the library or remotely with a library card. Other events include author talks, live music, and art exhibits by local area artists.\n\nWith the passing of the FY2017 Budget on January 7, 2016, voted on by the Cedar Rapids Public Library Board of Trustees, the library was subjected to budget costs totaling approximately $461,000. These cuts resulted in a reduction of library services, including operation hours. Effective starting March 27, 2016 both the Downtown and Ladd locations will be open Monday-Thursday, 9am-8pm and Fridays 9am-5pm. The Downtown Library will also be open on Saturday, 9am-5pm but closed on Sunday, while the Ladd location will be closed on Saturday and open Sunday, 1-5pm.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://crlibrary.org/about-us/news/new-hours-take-effect-march-27/|title = crlibrary.org :: New Hours Take Effect March 27|website = crlibrary.org|access-date = 2016-03-21|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322202618/http://crlibrary.org/about-us/news/new-hours-take-effect-march-27/|archivedate = 2016-03-22}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.crlibrary.org/ Official Website]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Public libraries in Iowa]]\n[[Category:Education in Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|41.952833|N|91.718248|W|type:landmark|display=title}}\nThe '''Cedar Rapids Public Library''' (CRPL) serves the city of [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]].

Surrounding townships had contracted for library services.<ref>{{cite news|title=We're Certainly Bookworms Here|newspaper=The Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette|date=December 5, 1914}}</ref> By 1928, six library stations were in operation. In 1930 there was a new Kenwood Park station, the first branch building owned by the library.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], circulation had reached record highs for the library. Beginning in 1933, the circulation began to fall as it had for other libraries across the nation. Everything started to normalize towards the end of the '30s. In 1940 there were 15 people staffing the library. The head librarian, who had replaced Hagey at the end of 1939, was Miss Alice Story. Another librarian that would later have a lasting effect on the library and the community, Evelyn Zerzanek, worked under Miss Story as the head librarian of the school and the children's department.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nEvelyn Zerzanek worked hard to not only get books into children's hands, but also to think for themselves and be creative. Under her direction, the summer reading programs and story times had increased in popularity.<ref>{{cite news|last=McHugh|first=Nancy|title=Library Introduces 'Project Neptune'|newspaper=The Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=June 20, 1965}}</ref> Evelyn also loved children's book illustrations. She started a collection that would grow to over 850 original paintings and drawings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evelyn Zerzanek|url=http://www.crlibrary.org/about-us/evelyn-zerzank/|work=Cedar Rapids Public Library|accessdate=8 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425161142/http://www.crlibrary.org/about-us/evelyn-zerzank/|archivedate=25 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s, two bookmobiles were purchased that had replaced all of the stations. Together they would make twelve stops each week at regular locations. Instead of many rented stations, the library now consisted of the two bookmobiles, the Kenwood Park station, and the main building.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=John|title=Second Bookmobile for Cedar Rapids|newspaper=The Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=October 31, 1954}}</ref>\n\nCrowding became a pressing issue for the library throughout the '60s. Much of the material had to be stored in the basement. New materials had to be turned away due to the space restrictions. In 1969, the library proposed to expand the current building and to establish a west-side branch. It failed to reach 60% voter approval.<ref>{{cite news|last=Elsea|first=Jerry|title=Library Bonds Need 60 Percent Margin|newspaper=The Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=December 14, 1969}}</ref> In 1971, a branch was established on Edgewood Road NW. The first two of three bookmobiles were retired by 1972.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nFor the next twelve years, the library would be unsuccessful at securing a majority vote. The library had changed its proposal from remodeling the library to constructing a new facility during that time. In 1981, the Hall Foundation offered over 25% of the $7.9 million bond issue if the city would pay the remainder, but again, the 60% voter approval would not be met. About four months later, the Hall Foundation of Cedar Rapids offered to pay $6.8 million over the next ten years on the condition that the Library Foundation, established in 1972, could obtain $1 million in private donations. By the end of September, $1.3 million in private contributions had secured the amount necessary to move forward with the plans for a new library.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nThe new library at 500 First Street SE opened on February 17, 1985. The floor space of the new building was 83,000 square feet compared with 29,000 square feet in the Carnegie building. Space issues were not the reason for moving as they had been in the past. The flood of 2008 had taken out much of the adult and reference collections. The children's books on the upper level, along with the Zerzanek collection, were all saved.<ref>{{cite news|last=Raasch|first=Jeff|title=Getting Library Back Will Be 'Healing'|newspaper=The Gazette|date=June 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe library would lease space at the Westdale Mall where they had already established a library branch in August 1988. The branch material would be consolidated with the library's surviving collection in the former Osco Drug Store space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Belz|first=Adam|title=C.R.

On May 5, 2012, construction began on the new downtown location, which opened to the public in August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Report FY 2012|url=http://www.crlibrary.org/about-us/annual-report-fy-2012/|publisher=Cedar Rapids Public Library|accessdate=26 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010405/http://www.crlibrary.org/about-us/annual-report-fy-2012/|archivedate=28 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Services==\nThe CRPL offers an abundance of regular services, including free computer classes, public computer and wifi access, and meeting rooms for the public. They offer a variety of programs including the Summer Reading Program, Adult Summer Reading Program, story times, and Play and Learn. There are a number of databases and other materials, such as e-books, downloadable audiobooks, and downloadable music, that can be accessed either at the library or remotely with a library card. Other events include author talks, live music, and art exhibits by local area artists.\n\nWith the passing of the FY2017 Budget on January 7, 2016, voted on by the Cedar Rapids Public Library Board of Trustees, the library was subjected to budget costs totaling approximately $461,000. These cuts resulted in a reduction of library services, including operation hours. Effective starting March 27, 2016 both the Downtown and Ladd locations will be open Monday-Thursday, 9am-8pm and Fridays 9am-5pm. The Downtown Library will also be open on Saturday, 9am-5pm but closed on Sunday, while the Ladd location will be closed on Saturday and open Sunday, 1-5pm. <ref>{{Cite web|url = http://crlibrary.org/about-us/news/new-hours-take-effect-march-27/|title = crlibrary.org :: New Hours Take Effect March 27|website = crlibrary.org|access-date = 2016-03-21|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322202618/http://crlibrary.org/about-us/news/new-hours-take-effect-march-27/|archivedate = 2016-03-22}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.crlibrary.org/ Official Website]\n\n[[Category:Public libraries in Iowa]]\n[[Category:Education in Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Rapids_Public_Library"}
