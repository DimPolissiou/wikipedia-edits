It has a population of around 6,200. Most local amenities are shared with the adjacent villages of [[Carfin]], [[Holytown]] and [[New Stevenston]] which have a combined population of around 20,000 across the four localities.\n\n==History==\nSituated on rich tracts of [[coal]] and other minerals, the original settlement of Newarthill occurred in the early to mid-nineteenth century. Originally thought to have been named after the larger and more northerly [[Harthill, Scotland|Harthill]], it has recently been discovered that historical mentions of Newarthill actually pre-date Harthill. One quoted, but unproven, derivation is the Gaelic Nuadh-Ard, meaning New Hill, with a tautological \"hill\" added in the English translation.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town of Newarthill is roughly bounded by the Legbrannock Burn to the north, the railway line connecting [[Carfin]] and [[Cleland, North Lanarkshire|Cleland]] to the south, the junction of the [[B7066 road|B7066]] with Biggar Road to the east and the [[A723 road|A723]] to the west. Situated on the northern side of the [[Clyde Valley]], the town rises highest in the north east and slopes downward to the west. The higher land was the centre of initial settlement and holds most of the town's oldest and most significant buildings. Several modern housing estates have appeared on the outskirts and greenbelt areas of the village, rendering it less distinct from the surrounding conurbation.\n\nThere is no town centre as such, with residents chiefly relying on the amenities provided by neighbouring places such as [[Motherwell]], [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], [[Wishaw]], [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]] and [[Glasgow]]. It is generally considered to consist of two schemes, the older, formerly coal-heated east and the more recent, gas-powered west. This perception has altered in light of large new housing estates encircling the village.\n\n==Amenities==\nThe local schools are Newarthill Primary, St Teresa's Primary, Keir Hardie Memorial Primary and [[Brannock High School]]. The local authority-funded community centre, also on High Street, offers a range of activities from nursery care to computing classes. The library on Kirkhall Road offers a modern range of books and other media despite the distinctly 1970s exterior. Sports facilities are few and far between, with the existing pitches within school grounds long since closed to the general public.\n\nThe local police station lies near the centre of the village, while fire brigade and hospital facilities have to be sought outwith Newarthill. The nearest hospitals are [[Wishaw General Hospital|Wishaw General]] and [[Monklands Hospital|Monklands Infirmary]] in [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]]. There are two main places of worship, St. Teresa's Chapel and Newarthill Parish Church, with the nearest [[mosque]] in [[New Stevenston]].\n\n===Travel and transport facilities===\nNewarthill is situated in close proximity to the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]], offering road connections to Glasgow, Edinburgh, between and beyond. The B7066 is the major connecting route to Carfin and Motherwell, while those heading west on minor roads will generally do so through [[Holytown]], [[Mossend]] and beyond. These roads are well served by regular bus services by companies including [[First Glasgow]] 254 and united 1 These services generally operate until 5pm. Service is limited on Sundays. There are several local taxi companies with varying levels of service.\n\nThe closest railway stations, depending on your position in Newarthill, are to be found at {{rws|Carfin}} and {{rws|Holytown}} (rather confusingly, Carfin Station is geographically within Newarthill and Holytown Station is within the adjacent village of New Stevenston) which are served by regularly timetabled trains operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]], connecting [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. There is a two-hourly service on Sundays. The nearest mainline station, connecting to services on the [[East Coast Main Line]] and [[West Coast Main Line]] travelling towards cities such as [[London]], is {{rws|Motherwell}}.\n\n===Sports and Leisure===\nNewarthill Bowling Club exists just off High Street and adjacent to Newarthill Primary School, however it remains a members-only facility. On Mosshall Street, there are several football pitches and an amateur boxing club.\n\nNewarthill has few leisure facilities of note, excepting the facilities within [[Brannock High School]] and at Mosshall Street (where the boxing club is located). The village is, however, situated very close to several large sports facilities in the surrounding area, with [[Dalziel Park]] (sports fields and golf club), [[Jerviston|Colville Park Golf Club]] and [[Ravenscraig Sports Centre]]. The residents of Newarthill make use largely of the [[Aquatec]] Leisure Centre which is located on the outskirts of nearby Motherwell Town Centre. The facilities available here include a family friendly swimming pool and a well equipped gym.\n\nThe ''Torrance Park'' golf course and leisure facility between Newarthill and [[Newhouse, North Lanarkshire|Newhouse]] was completed in 2019<ref>[https://www.torranceparkgolf.co.uk/course/ The Course], Torrance Park Golf Club</ref> - this forms part of a wider residential development, based off the main road to [[Holytown]] and nominally linked to that village in documentation,<ref>[https://www.motherwelltimes.co.uk/business/plans-submitted-for-phase-two-of-torrance-park-1-4882854 Plans submitted for phase two of Torrance Park], Motherwell Times, 4 March 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.scottishconstructionnow.com/article/green-light-for-more-than-600-new-homes-at-torrance-park Green light for more than 600 new homes at Torrance Park], Scottish Construction Now, 29 October 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.murray-estates.co.uk/our-portfolio/torrance-park/phase/torrance-park-phase-2 Torrance Park - Phase 2], Murray Estates, 2019</ref> but sharing the ''ML1 5'' postcode with Newarthill and being counted alongside it in some statistics.\n\nThere is also a local amateur football team, Newarthill Athletic AFC, who were founded in 2015. They follow a long list of teams from the area.\n\n===Public houses and takeaways===\n[[File:Newarthill Main Street.jpg|thumb|Main Street in Newarthill]]\nNewarthill, like several surrounding villages, boasts its fair share of public houses and licensed establishments. These are concentrated in the High Street area and have consistently closed and reopened at the mercy of the drinking public. Currently these include Bar Mango, the Cottage Inn, Newarthill Bowling Club, The Club (formerly Newarthill Working Men's Club), The Oranger, and the Hibernian Social Club.\n\nThere is a similar volume of fast food takeaways of the more traditional variety - there are Indian and fish and chip restaurants, but no multinational brands. The Bakers Oven, a small cafe, has a small sit-in area, 'Taste' (a Coffee and Sandwich bar) was situated on the High Street but recently closed and the premises have been converted to an extension for the next door veterinary surgery.\n\nThere used to be a local Post Office and Spar store, but it was demolished after a fire burned it down on Christmas Day 2009. A [[Nisa (retailer)|Nisa Local]] convenience store (opened Nov 2010) has been built on the Spar site, which does have a Post Office, and is one of only a few small food stores in the village. The main tourist accommodation, the Silverburn Hotel was recently damaged in a fire and having been foreclosed for over a year, has recently been demolished.\n\nChanda best takeaway, i personally recommend Spicy Chips, Cheese and Donner for \u00a35.50\n\n==Notable figures==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n* [[Damian Barr]], journalist\n*[[Charlie Flynn]], boxer\n* [[Rhonda Jones]], footballer\n* [[Christopher Kane]], fashion designer\n* [[Liz Lochhead]], playwright, author and former [[Poet Laureate]] of Scotland\n* [[Gary McAllister]],  Scotland international midfielder\n* [[Sir Robert McAlpine, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert McAlpine]], construction industry figure\n* [[Hugh McJarrow]], footballer\n*[[Leigh Nicol|Leigh Nicol,]] footballer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/budding-scotland-star-leigh-nicols-2549035|title=Budding Scotland star Leigh Nicol\u2019s dream move to Arsenal Ladies hit by funding snag|last=Paterson|first=Colin|date=2012-08-28|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n*[[Elaine C.

It belongs to [[Kilakarai]] [[Taluk]] and [[town panchayat]]. The village is the location of the grave and shrine of Qutbus Sultan Syed Ibrahim [[Shahid|Shaheed]] Badusha, the previous ruler of [[Madinah Al Munawwara]]. Erwadi also belongs to [[Kadaladi]] assembly constituency, which is a part of [[Ramanathapuram (Lok Sabha constituency)]]. However, after the delimitations in 2009, Erwadi has been joined to the [[Ramanathapuram]] assembly constituency. Although a small town, Erwadi is the second largest contributor for the revenue of Ramanthapuram District.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Shaheed Coins.JPG|right|thumb|220px|The coin published by Syed Ibrahim Shaheed in Ervadi during his rule]]\n<br />\n\n===The war===\n[[File:Pandicoins1.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Coins used by the Muslim rulers and Pandiya rulers in Ervadi and Ramanathapuram provinces]]\nSultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed sent Sikandar Badusha to offer Islamic teachings to the [[Pandiya]] ruler, Thiru Pandiyan, in [[Madurai]] but he refused to accept them and waged war. Shaheed's troops won and Sultan Sikandar Badusha was throned in Madurai. Shaheed's troops marched towards Bouthramanickapattinam. Shaheed Badusha offered Islam to King Vikrama Pandiyan, who vehemently refused and asked Shaheed to leave the kingdom. Shaheed refused to leave without converting them to Islam. Vikrama Pandiyan declared war. A very violent war consisting of about 10 battles, each lasting around 3\u20134 days, was waged. All of the family members of Shaheed Badusha were killed, including his only son Syed Abutahir, his brother Syed Ismail, his brother-in-law Zainul Aabideen and many of Shaheed Badusha's martyrs and ministers, including Amir Abbas of Rome, Abdul Qadir Mujahid, Muhaiyaddeen, Aboobakkar Abdul Hakkim, Abdullah, Shamsuddin of [[Makkah]], Qamaruddin, Nooruddeen, Muhammadh Yusuf, Jafar Sadiq, Rome Syed Ahmad, Zulfaqar Ali, Chanthana Peer of [[Turkey]], Abdul Qadir Gilani, Abdul Qadir Samadaani, Pathan Sahib, Hamza Basheer, and Uvaisul Hasan Ridwanullahi Ta'ala Alaihim Ajmaeen.<ref>Vol.1 Edition 6, Mathan 4 Page 42 of Failul Majid Fi manaaqibi Shaheed written by Syed Ibrahim Levvai Aalim and published by Ameer Batcha Aalim Publications, Erwadi Dargah, Ramanathapuram District.</ref>\nFinally, King Vikrama [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandiyan]] and his sons Indra Pandiyan and Chandra Pandiyan were killed and Shaheed won the war, claiming the throne of Bouthiramanickapattinam. He ruled the province for twelve years and spread Islam all over south Tamil Nadu. Coins struck during the rule of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed have been found by archeologists.<ref>Sethu Sulthaniyar varalaru written by Dr.S.M.A.Kather, published by Nargees publications, Trichy.</ref> \n\n===The peace===\n[[File:muslimscoin.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Reverse view of the coins]]\nThe rivalry between King Vikrama Pandiyan's and Shaheed's supporters slowly fizzled, due to the huge loss of life sustained in the war, including King Pandiyan, as well as the capture of Bouthiramanickapattinam. All citizens, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or family, were treated equally; hence, citizens were happier and there was no war.\n\n====The royal wedding of the crown prince====\nDuring Shaheed Badusha's rule in Bouthiramanickapattinam Province, the neighbouring rulers came together under the leadership of Shaheed Badusha. During the end of his rule, Shaheed solemnized the marriage of the crown prince Badusha Syed Ishaq, his brother's son, with Sayyida Zainab, the daughter of his sister Rabiaa Amma. The wedding was a spectacular event. Thousands of elephants, Arabian horses, and camels came in procession. The royal fort was illuminated grandly. Lights were lit all over the Bouthramanickapattinam Province for a week. All citizens of the province were treated with complete feasts for 3 days. Thousands of sheep were slaughtered for the grand feasts. \n\n====Separation of provinces====\nTwelve years later, King Tiru Pandiyan came from Madurai with a larger army and assassinated Shaheed Badusha in order to recapture the throne. The king Tiru Pandiyan  was killed in the war. Badusha Syed Is'haq (Shaheed Badusha's brother Syed Ismail Badusha's son) and Pandiyan prince Jamara Kolakalap Pandiyan split the kingdom. The rivalry between the [[Arabs]] and Pandiyans came to an end when both signed a pact, stating that Arabs (descendants of Shaheed Badusha) would rule Bouthiramanickapattinam Province and the Pandiyans would rule [[Ramanathapuram]] Province. Syed Is'haq, Syed Ibrahim, Syed Baqir, Syed Qasim, Syed Tahir Ridwanullahi Ta'ala Alaihim Ajmaeen and other descendants of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed have ruled the Bouthiramanickapattinam Province, while Regunatha Sethupathi, Kilavan (Kizhavan) Sethupathi, Vijaya Regunatha Sethupathi, Muthu Regunatha Sethupathi, [[Muthuramalinga Sethupathi II|Muthuramalinga Sethupathi]], [[Bhaskara Sethupathi]], Kumaran Sethupathi and other descendants of Sethupathi have ruled Ramanathapuram Province. This arrangement continued to be implemented until the 17th century, when the British East India Company started occupying India.\n\n== Religious importance ==\nAl Qutbul Hamid wal Gausul Majid Badhusha Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, king of [[Madinah]] and 18th generation descendant of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], is said to have traveled to Erwadi, erstwhile Bouthiramanickapattinam, during his journey to India in the early 12th century to spread Islam according to Muhammad's wish.<ref>Edition 3, page 24 of ''Erwadi Shaheed Nayagam varalaaru'', authored by Moulvi.Haji.Marhoom.S.Amjad Ibrahim Levvai Aalim Saahib and published by Ameer Aalim Publications, Erwadi Durgah, Ramanathapuram District, India</ref>\n\n==Shuhadaas and Waliyatullahs in Erwadi==\n[[File:Erwadimasjid.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Erwadi Masjid with huge minaret]]\nThe graves of Emperor Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed Badusha along with his kith and kin is found in the main dargah campus, along with a large mosque.

It also contains a [[minaret]] of around {{convert|250|ft|m}} height that can be viewed from the shores of Ramanathapuram District and acts as a virtual [[lighthouse]] to the fishermen in Ervadi and the adjacent villages.\n\n===Shuhadaas in the main dargah===\nThe main shrine or Dargah in Erwadi is among the holiest places in Tamil Nadu because it is mixed with the soil of Madinah and is an important site for pilgrimage. Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and most of his family members, close relatives and other shuhadaas' graves are found in the main Dargah. The big hall of the shrine of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shahid was constructed by Eiatibar Khan, during the time of the [[Nawab]] of [[Arcot]]. There is a flag throne to the south of the main entrance of the dargah. The flag throne is built surrounding the grave of Begum, wife of Eaitibar Khan who constructed the Dargah. The main Dargah has three entrances. It is fully open except for the dargahs.\n\n===Kattupalli Shuhadaas===\nKattupalli is one of the main places where the war between Pandyas and Arabs was held. It is also the graveyard of Arabs where the Dargahs of all important ministers of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed badhusha are found. It is in the northern side of the main dargah within 0.5&nbsp;km. Kattupalli accommodates the crowd of people that gathers during the Sandanakoodu urus festival.\n\n==Ervadi Santhanakoodu Festival==\n{{main|Erwadi Santhanakoodu Festival}}\nThe annual Santhanakoodu festival is held at Ervadi dargha, [[Ramanathapuram district]] during the Islamic month of [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]] commemorating the shahadat anniversary of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahid badhusha and is celebrated together by Hindus and Muslims.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ervadi.com/urus-festival|title=Urus Festival {{!}} Ervadi Dargah {{!}} Ervadi {{!}} Ibrahim Shahid {{!}} Kattupalli {{!}} Tamil Nadu Ziyarat {{!}} Syed Ibrahim Shahid {{!}} Dawate Islam {{!}} Religious Healing {{!}} Healing Prayers {{!}} Faith Healing|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The Deventhirakula velalar, Yadavas, Parayars, Dalits, Adi Dravidas and the Fishermen community bear the duty of Carrying the Chariot, holding light lamps, putting crackers while the Levvais (Dargah Huqdar Mujavirs) take care of religious duties such as reciting Moulid sheriff, Dua smearing sandal on the roula and praying for the welfare of pilgrims. \n\n==Tourism==\nErwadi has many hotels and restaurants with middle class facilities.

[[Sea turtle]]s are frequent visitors to the gulf as are sacred [[shark]]s, [[dugong]]s, and dolphins.\n\n==Transportation and Connectivity==\n====Road====\nErwadi is connected via the [[East Coast Road]] to [[Kilakarai]] at a distance of 27 km, a town in the district [[Ramanathapuram]] which falls on NH 49 from [[Madurai]] to [[Rameswaram]]. TNSTC operates direct buses to Erwadi from various parts of Tamil Nadu like [[Madurai]], Kumuli, [[Pattukottai]], [[Thondi]], [[Nagore]] and [[Chennai]].

in [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram District]], [[Tamil Nadu]], a state in [[South India]]. It belongs to [[Kilakarai]] [[Taluk]] and [[town panchayat]]. The village is the location of the grave and shrine of Qutbus Sultan Syed Ibrahim [[Shahid|Shaheed]] Badusha, the previous ruler of [[Madinah Al Munawwara]]. Erwadi also belongs to [[Kadaladi]] assembly constituency, which is a part of [[Ramanathapuram (Lok Sabha constituency)]]. However, after the delimitations in 2009, Erwadi has been joined to the [[Ramanathapuram]] assembly constituency. Although a small town, Erwadi is the second largest contributor for the revenue of Ramanthapuram District.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Shaheed Coins.JPG|right|thumb|220px|The coin published by Syed Ibrahim Shaheed in Ervadi during his rule]]\n<br />\n\n===The war===\n[[File:Pandicoins1.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Coins used by the Muslim rulers and Pandiya rulers in Ervadi and Ramanathapuram provinces]]\nSultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed sent Sikandar Badusha to offer Islamic teachings to the [[Pandiya]] ruler, Thiru Pandiyan, in [[Madurai]] but he refused to accept them and waged war. Shaheed's troops won and Sultan Sikandar Badusha was throned in Madurai. Shaheed's troops marched towards Bouthramanickapattinam. Shaheed Badusha offered Islam to King Vikrama Pandiyan, who vehemently refused and asked Shaheed to leave the kingdom. Shaheed refused to leave without converting them to Islam. Vikrama Pandiyan declared war. A very violent war consisting of about 10 battles, each lasting around 3\u20134 days, was waged. All of the family members of Shaheed Badusha were killed, including his only son Syed Abutahir, his brother Syed Ismail, his brother-in-law Zainul Aabideen and many of Shaheed Badusha's martyrs and ministers, including Amir Abbas of Rome, Abdul Qadir Mujahid, Muhaiyaddeen, Aboobakkar Abdul Hakkim, Abdullah, Shamsuddin of [[Makkah]], Qamaruddin, Nooruddeen, Muhammadh Yusuf, Jafar Sadiq, Rome Syed Ahmad, Zulfaqar Ali, Chanthana Peer of [[Turkey]], Abdul Qadir Gilani, Abdul Qadir Samadaani, Pathan Sahib, Hamza Basheer, and Uvaisul Hasan Ridwanullahi Ta'ala Alaihim Ajmaeen.<ref>Vol.1 Edition 6, Mathan 4 Page 42 of Failul Majid Fi manaaqibi Shaheed written by Syed Ibrahim Levvai Aalim and published by Ameer Batcha Aalim Publications, Erwadi Dargah, Ramanathapuram District.</ref>\nFinally, King Vikrama [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandiyan]] and his sons Indra Pandiyan and Chandra Pandiyan were killed and Shaheed won the war, claiming the throne of Bouthiramanickapattinam. He ruled the province for twelve years and spread Islam all over south Tamil Nadu. Coins struck during the rule of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed have been found by archeologists.<ref>Sethu Sulthaniyar varalaru written by Dr.S.M.A.Kather, published by Nargees publications, Trichy.</ref> \n\n===The peace===\n[[File:muslimscoin.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Reverse view of the coins]]\nThe rivalry between King Vikrama Pandiyan's and Shaheed's supporters slowly fizzled, due to the huge loss of life sustained in the war, including King Pandiyan, as well as the capture of Bouthiramanickapattinam. All citizens, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or family, were treated equally; hence, citizens were happier and there was no war.\n\n====The royal wedding of the crown prince====\nDuring Shaheed Badusha's rule in Bouthiramanickapattinam Province, the neighbouring rulers came together under the leadership of Shaheed Badusha. During the end of his rule, Shaheed solemnized the marriage of the crown prince Badusha Syed Ishaq, his brother's son, with Sayyida Zainab, the daughter of his sister Rabiaa Amma. The wedding was a spectacular event. Thousands of elephants, Arabian horses, and camels came in procession. The royal fort was illuminated grandly. Lights were lit all over the Bouthramanickapattinam Province for a week. All citizens of the province were treated with complete feasts for 3 days. Thousands of sheep were slaughtered for the grand feasts. \n\n====Separation of provinces====\nTwelve years later, King Tiru Pandiyan came from Madurai with a larger army and assassinated Shaheed Badusha in order to recapture the throne. The king Tiru Pandiyan  was killed in the war. Badusha Syed Is'haq (Shaheed Badusha's brother Syed Ismail Badusha's son) and Pandiyan prince Jamara Kolakalap Pandiyan split the kingdom. The rivalry between the [[Arabs]] and Pandiyans came to an end when both signed a pact, stating that Arabs (descendants of Shaheed Badusha) would rule Bouthiramanickapattinam Province and the Pandiyans would rule [[Ramanathapuram]] Province. Syed Is'haq, Syed Ibrahim, Syed Baqir, Syed Qasim, Syed Tahir Ridwanullahi Ta'ala Alaihim Ajmaeen and other descendants of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed have ruled the Bouthiramanickapattinam Province, while Regunatha Sethupathi, Kilavan (Kizhavan) Sethupathi, Vijaya Regunatha Sethupathi, Muthu Regunatha Sethupathi, [[Muthuramalinga Sethupathi II|Muthuramalinga Sethupathi]], [[Bhaskara Sethupathi]], Kumaran Sethupathi and other descendants of Sethupathi have ruled Ramanathapuram Province. This arrangement continued to be implemented until the 17th century, when the British East India Company started occupying India.\n\n== Religious importance ==\nAl Qutbul Hamid wal Gausul Majid Badhusha Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, king of [[Madinah]] and 18th generation descendant of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], is said to have traveled to Erwadi, erstwhile Bouthiramanickapattinam, during his journey to India in the early 12th century to spread Islam according to Muhammad's wish.<ref>Edition 3, page 24 of ''Erwadi Shaheed Nayagam varalaaru'', authored by Moulvi.Haji.Marhoom.S.Amjad Ibrahim Levvai Aalim Saahib and published by Ameer Aalim Publications, Erwadi Durgah, Ramanathapuram District, India</ref> Considering the religious importance of the place, the Tamil national daily Dinamalar has published [http://www.dinamalar.com/360view_detail_eng.asp?id=417#top 360<sup>o</sup> travel view of the dargah].\n\n==Shuhadaas and Waliyatullahs in Erwadi==\n[[File:Erwadimasjid.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Erwadi Masjid with huge minaret]]\nThe graves of Emperor Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed Badusha along with his kith and kin is found in the main dargah campus, along with a large mosque.

Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and most of his family members, close relatives and other shuhadaas' graves are found in the main Dargah. The big hall of the shrine of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shahid was constructed by Eiatibar Khan, during the time of the [[Nawab]] of [[Arcot]]. There is a flag throne to the south of the main entrance of the dargah. The flag throne is built surrounding the grave of Begum, wife of Eaitibar Khan who constructed the Dargah. The main Dargah has three entrances. It is fully open except for the dargahs.\n\n===Kattupalli Shuhadaas===\nKattupalli is one of the main places where the war between Pandyas and Arabs was held.

This power works until the power is discovered.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: Nobody discovered Gautier's secret, being in common to all the housemates, so all the housemates were nominated.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: Gautier held a free pass to the final, and therefore was immune from nominating and being nominated.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: By revealing her secret, Clara was nominated automatically.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: In Week 3, nominations are cancelled after Ben walked out the game.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: Some housemates were nominated to enter in the Secret Room.\n* {{note|7|Note 7}}: Vincent and \u00c9milie had the power to switch one original nominee. They saved Alexia and switched it by Morgane.\n* {{note|8|Note 8}}: Two clans are opposed: the clan of Florine and the clan of Ana\u00efs. The clan of Ana\u00efs is automatically nominated because Julien choose a place in final. But, Florine must switch one girl and one boy of her clan for one girl and one boy from Ana\u00efs's clan to meet her mother.\n* {{note|9|Note 9}}: Vincent has to choose between two boxes, with Alexia and \u00c9milie names. He had to choose one of the boxes, and the one that he chose will be immune. He chose \u00c9milie's box, meaning she is immune.\n* {{note|10|Note 10}}: This week the housemates are divided into two houses: the Immunity House and the Nomination House. Between the week, there were opportunities to swamp houses. On Tuesday, the ones who were in the Nomination House were nominated, meaning that Florine, Guillaume, Jamel and Vincent are up for eviction this week.\n* {{note|11|Note 11}}: Gautier and Jamel had to give immunity to a housemate. They decided to give the immunity to Florine.\n* {{note|12|Note 12}}: \u00c9milie was automatically nominated for reveal clues from her secret.\n* {{note|13|Note 13}}: Gautier won the right to save one of the nominees, and replace with other. He could not save \u00c9milie, as she was automatically nominated. He decided to save Clara and replace her with Julien.\n* {{note|14|Note 14}}: Eddy answered the red phone, and is automatically nominated. Then, Ana\u00efs had the power to swamp Eddy with Julien, or not. She decided to don't do that, so Eddy is still automatically nominated. Then, Eddy had the power to swamp him with either Ana\u00efs or Alexia. He decided to swamp with Alexia, meaning she's automatically nominated this week.\n* {{note|15|Note 15}}: This week the girls are immune. But, one of them has to be automatically nominated. Clara and \u00c9milie had to automatically nominate either Ana\u00efs or Florine. They decided to nominate Ana\u00efs.\n* {{note|16|Note 16}}: In Week 10, Gautier and Julien are the Kings of Nominations. First, they to nominate 2 housemates between Alexia, Florine and Eddy. The one who they don't chose will be immune. They nominated Alexia and Eddy, meaning that Florine is immune. In the next day, they had to nominate either Clara and Vincent. They decided to nominate Vincent, meaning Clara is immune.\n* {{note|17|Note 17}}: As nominees, Alexia, Ana\u00efs, Eddy and Vincent can choose to nominate automatically one of the responsible of their nominations between Gautier and Julien. They decided to nominate Julien, meaning Gautier is immune.\n* {{note|18|Note 18}}: Vincent has an ultimatum: he has to convalide his cagnotte more \u20ac50.00. If he accepts, there will be no nominations, and he will be evicted, but if he doesn't accepts, all housemates will be up for eviction. He accepted the ultimatum. But, instead of being evicted, Vincent will move to the Secret Room on Friday.\n* {{note|19|Note 19}}: Stephanie ([[Secret Story 4 (France)|SS4]]) as to decide to either automatically nominate Alexia, or to give immunity to Florine. She decided to give immunity to Florine.\n* {{note|20|Note 20}}: This week Vincent has the power to nominate 2 housemates. He nominated Clara and Gautier, meaning they are up for eviction.\n* {{note|21|Note 21}}: Alexia won the ticket to the final. However, he has a dilemma: Alexia, you can choose to take all the money of Vincent's account, and give to him the ticket place or keep your ticket place and doesn't win more money. She decided to keep the ticker. Therefore, she is the first finalist, and the other 5 are automatically nominated. It will be a double eviction.</small>\n\n== Nominations totals received ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; line-height:13px; text-align:center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"\n\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" |\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 1}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 2}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 3}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 4}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 5}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 6}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 7}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 8}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 9}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 10}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 11}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 12}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 13}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 14}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Total}}\n|-\n!

He nominated Clara and Gautier, meaning they are up for eviction.\n* {{note|21|Note 21}}: Alexia won the ticket to the final. However, he has a dilemma: Alexia, you can choose to take all the money of Vincent's account, and give to him the ticket place or keep your ticket place and doesn't win more money. She decided to keep the ticker. Therefore, she is the first finalist, and the other 5 are automatically nominated. It will be a double eviction.</small>\n\n== Nominations totals received ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; line-height:13px; text-align:center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"\n\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" |\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 1}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 2}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 3}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 4}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 5}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 6}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 7}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 8}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 9}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 10}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 11}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 12}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 13}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Week 14}}\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | {{nowrap|Total}}\n|-\n!

It originally aired on April 21, 2011. The episode was written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] and [[Julie Plec]] and directed by [[Joshua Butler]].He has a daughter named Mia Dekker\n\n==Plot==\nElijah ([[Daniel Gillies]]) wakes up in the Salvatore basement after Elena ([[Nina Dobrev]]) removes the dagger from his body. Elena tries to keep him quiet so Damon ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) and Stefan ([[Paul Wesley]]) will not hear him. Elijah needs to get out of the house since he is not invited in, and Elena, to convince him that he can trust her, hands him the dagger. Stefan wakes up the next morning and discovers that Elijah's body is gone while at the same time, Klaus needs his real body and asks Maddox ([[Gino Anthony Pesi]]) to take care of it.\n\nStefan calls Elena to see if she is okay and asks her where Elijah is. Elena reassures him that she is fine and that Elijah is with her, asking Stefan to trust her and let her do what she thinks best. Stefan, even though he does not agree with her plan, agrees, making Damon unhappy. Elijah explains to Elena how he and Klaus met Katherine and that Klaus is his brother.\n\nJenna ([[Sara Canning]]) returns home after all the messages \"Elena\" left her about staying away from Alaric and calls Stefan to ask what is wrong. Stefan goes to meet her, only to find out that Alaric/Klaus is already there waiting for him.  Damon goes to Alaric's apartment with Andie ([[Dawn Olivieri]]) to see if Katherine is there. When they find her, Damon gives her [[Verbena|vervain]] to drink so that Klaus will not be able to compel her.\n\nElijah continues to tell Elena the story of his family, and he reveals her that the curse of the sun and the moon is fake. Klaus and Elijah made that curse up, but there is another curse that is worse and it is on Klaus. That is the curse Klaus wants to break. At the same time, Alaric/Klaus tells Jenna about vampires but Jenna does not believe him. When she attempts to leave, Klaus tries to stop her, and Stefan attacks Klaus, giving Jenna the opportunity to escape. Stefan calls Elena to let her know that Jenna knows the truth, and Elena leaves Elijah to go to Jenna. In a flashback, we see that Elijah was in love with Katherine back in 1492.\n\nElena tries to calm Jenna down and tells her the whole truth. Then, she goes back to Elijah, asking him to tell her about the curse. Elijah tells her that his mother was unfaithful to his father and Klaus is a brother from another father, a werewolf, something that makes Klaus both a vampire and a werewolf. Klaus wants to break the curse that is upon him so he can reawaken his werewolf side and create an army of hybrids. Since Klaus is both a vampire and a werewolf, Elijah explains Elena that the dagger cannot kill him, and they have to try to do it using a witch when Klaus is on transition, a moment that makes him weak. Elena tells him that she knows a witch that can channel the power they need, and Elijah tells her that the curse needs to be broken during a full moon.\n\nThrough another flashback, we see that Elijah found a way to protect the life of the doppelg\u00e4nger during the sacrifice, meaning he can protect Elena's life. Katherine did not know about that; that is why she ran away from Klaus when she found out what he wanted her for. Elena and Elijah go to the Salvatore house to find Damon and Stefan fighting. Elijah asks for their apology since they tried to kill him; Stefan apologizes but Damon does not trust Elijah. Stefan explains to Elijah that Damon is angry with him at the moment but he will come around at the end and work with them.\n\nThe episode ends with Klaus ([[Joseph Morgan (actor)|Joseph Morgan]]) taking his real body back.\n\n==Feature music==\nIn \"Klaus\" we can hear the songs:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Vampire Diaries Season 2 Episode 19: \"Klaus\" Music|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/music/shows/the-vampire-diaries/episodes/klaus.html|publisher=TV Fanatic|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}</ref>\n*\"Compulsion\" by [[Doves (band)|Doves]]\n*\"[[Get Some (Lykke Li song)|Get Some]]\" by [[Lykke Li]]\n*\"[[Helena Beat]]\" by [[Foster the People]]\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Klaus\" was watched by 2.70 million; down by 0.11 from the previous episode.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seidman|first1=Robert|title=Thursday Final Ratings: 'Vampire Diaries,' 'American Idol' Adjusted Up; 'Community,' 'Parks & Recreation' Down|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/04/22/thursday-final-ratings-vampire-diaries-american-idol-adjusted-up-community-parks-recreation-down/90313/#comment-814742|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=April 22, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Reviews===\n\"Klaus\" received positive reviews.\n\nCarrie Raisler from [[The A.V.

It originally aired on April 21, 2011. The episode was written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] and [[Julie Plec]] and directed by [[Joshua Butler]].\n\n==Plot==\nElijah ([[Daniel Gillies]]) wakes up in the Salvatore basement after Elena ([[Nina Dobrev]]) removes the dagger from his body. Elena tries to keep him quiet so Damon ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) and Stefan ([[Paul Wesley]]) will not hear him. Elijah needs to get out of the house since he is not invited in, and Elena, to convince him that he can trust her, hands him the dagger. Stefan wakes up the next morning and discovers that Elijah's body is gone while at the same time, Klaus needs his real body and asks Maddox ([[Gino Anthony Pesi]]) to take care of it.\n\nStefan calls Elena to see if she is okay and asks her where Elijah is. Elena reassures him that she is fine and that Elijah is with her, asking Stefan to trust her and let her do what she thinks best. Stefan, even though he does not agree with her plan, agrees, making Damon unhappy. Elijah explains to Elena how he and Klaus met Katherine and that Klaus is his brother.\n\nJenna ([[Sara Canning]]) returns home after all the messages \"Elena\" left her about staying away from Alaric and calls Stefan to ask what is wrong. Stefan goes to meet her, only to find out that Alaric/Klaus is already there waiting for him.  Damon goes to Alaric's apartment with Andie ([[Dawn Olivieri]]) to see if Katherine is there. When they find her, Damon gives her [[Verbena|vervain]] to drink so that Klaus will not be able to compel her.\n\nElijah continues to tell Elena the story of his family, and he reveals her that the curse of the sun and the moon is fake. Klaus and Elijah made that curse up, but there is another curse that is worse and it is on Klaus. That is the curse Klaus wants to break. At the same time, Alaric/Klaus tells Jenna about vampires but Jenna does not believe him. When she attempts to leave, Klaus tries to stop her, and Stefan attacks Klaus, giving Jenna the opportunity to escape. Stefan calls Elena to let her know that Jenna knows the truth, and Elena leaves Elijah to go to Jenna. In a flashback, we see that Elijah was in love with Katherine back in 1492.\n\nElena tries to calm Jenna down and tells her the whole truth. Then, she goes back to Elijah, asking him to tell her about the curse. Elijah tells her that his mother was unfaithful to his father and Klaus is a brother from another father, a werewolf, something that makes Klaus both a vampire and a werewolf. Klaus wants to break the curse that is upon him so he can reawaken his werewolf side and create an army of hybrids. Since Klaus is both a vampire and a werewolf, Elijah explains Elena that the dagger cannot kill him, and they have to try to do it using a witch when Klaus is on transition, a moment that makes him weak. Elena tells him that she knows a witch that can channel the power they need, and Elijah tells her that the curse needs to be broken during a full moon.\n\nThrough another flashback, we see that Elijah found a way to protect the life of the doppelg\u00e4nger during the sacrifice, meaning he can protect Elena's life.

Hence, there are more particles gaining energy from the wave than losing to the wave, which leads to wave damping.\nIf, however, the slope of the function is positive, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is smaller than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles losing energy to the wave than gaining from the wave, which leads to a resultant increase in the wave energy.\n\n== Physical interpretation ==\n\nThe mathematical theory of Landau damping is somewhat involved\u2014see the section below. However, there is a simple physical interpretation [introduced in section 7.5 of <ref name=\":0\" /> with a caveat], which, though not strictly correct, helps to visualize this phenomenon.\n\n[[File:Phys interp landau damp.svg|thumb]]\n\nIt is possible to imagine [[Plasma oscillation|Langmuir waves]] as waves in the sea, and the particles as surfers trying to catch the wave, all moving in the same direction. If the surfer is moving on the water surface at a velocity slightly less than the waves he will eventually be caught and pushed along the wave (gaining energy), while a surfer moving slightly faster than a wave will be pushing on the wave as he moves uphill (losing energy to the wave).\n\nIt is worth noting that only the surfers are playing an important role in this energy interactions with the waves; a beachball floating on the water (zero velocity) will go up and down as the wave goes by, not gaining energy at all. Also, a boat that moves very fast (faster than the waves) does not exchange much energy with the wave.\n\nA simple mechanical description of particle dynamics provides a quantitative estimate of the synchronization of particles with the wave [Equation (1) of <ref name=\":1\" />]. A more rigorous approach shows the strongest synchronization occurs for particles with a velocity in the wave frame proportional to the damping rate and independent of the wave amplitude [section 4.1.3 of <ref>{{Cite book|title=Microscopic Dynamics of Plasmas and Chaos|journal = Microscopic Dynamics of Plasmas and Chaos. Series: Series in Plasma Physics|volume = 12|last=Escande|first=Dominique|last2=Elskens|first2=Yves|date=2002-10-23|isbn=9780750306126|series=Series in Plasma Physics|doi=10.1201/9781420033953|bibcode=2002SPP....12.....E}}</ref>]. Since Landau damping occurs for waves with arbitrarily small amplitudes, this shows the most active particles in this damping are far from being trapped. This is natural, since trapping involves diverging time scales for such waves (specifically <math>T_\\text{trap} \\sim A^{-1/2}</math> for a wave amplitude <math>A</math>).\n\n== Theoretical physics: perturbation theory in a Vlasovian frame ==\n\nTheoretical treatment starts with the [[Vlasov equation]] in the non-relativistic zero-magnetic field limit, the Vlasov\u2013Poisson set of equations. Explicit solutions are obtained in the limit of a small <math>E</math>-field. The distribution function <math>f</math> and field <math>E</math> are expanded in a series: <math> f=f_0(v)+f_1(x,v,t)+f_2(x,v,t)</math>, <math>E=E_1(x,t)+E_2(x,t)</math> and terms of equal order are collected.\n\nTo '''first order''' the Vlasov\u2013Poisson equations read\n\n:<math>(\\partial_t + v\\partial_x)f_1 + {e\\over m}E_1 f'_0 = 0, \\quad \n \\partial_x E_1 = {e\\over \\epsilon_0} \\int f_1 \\mathrm{d}v</math>.\n\nLandau calculated<ref name=\"orig\" /> the wave caused by an initial disturbance <math>f_1(x,v,0) = g(v)\\exp(ikx)</math> and found by aid of [[Laplace transform]] and [[contour integration]] a damped travelling wave of the form <math>\\exp[ik(x-v_\\text{ph}t)-\\gamma t]</math> with [[wave number]] <math>k</math> and damping decrement\n\n:<math>\\gamma\\approx-{\\pi\\omega_p^3 \\over 2k^2N} f'_0(v_\\text{ph}), \\quad\n  N = \\int f_0 \\mathrm{d}v</math>.\n\nHere <math>\\omega_p</math> is the [[plasma oscillation]] frequency and <math>N</math> is the electron density. Later [[Nico van Kampen]] proved<ref>van Kampen, N. G., \"On the theory of stationary waves in plasma\", ''Physica'' 21 (1955), 949\u2013963. See http://theor.jinr.ru/~kuzemsky/kampenbio.html</ref> that the same result can be obtained with [[Fourier transform]]. He showed that the linearized Vlasov\u2013Poisson equations have a continuous spectrum of singular normal modes, now known as '''van Kampen modes'''\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{kN} f'_0 \\frac{\\mathcal P}{kv-\\omega} + \\epsilon \\delta\\left(v-\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\right) </math>\n\nin which <math>\\mathcal P</math> signifies principal value, <math>\\delta</math> is the delta function (see [[generalized function]]) and\n\n:<math>\\epsilon = 1 + \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{kN} \\int f'_0 \\frac{\\mathcal P}{\\omega-kv} \\mathrm{d}v</math>\n\nis the plasma permittivity. Decomposing the initial disturbance in these modes he obtained the Fourier spectrum of the resulting wave. Damping is explained by phase-mixing of these Fourier modes with slightly different frequencies near <math>\\omega_p</math>.\n\nIt was not clear how damping could occur in a collisionless plasma: where does the wave energy go? In fluid theory, in which the plasma is modeled as a dispersive dielectric medium,<ref>Landau, L. D. and Lifshitz, E. M., ''Electrodynamics of Continuous Media'' \u00a780, Pergamon Press (1984).</ref> the energy of Langmuir waves is known: field energy multiplied by the Brillouin factor <math>\\partial_\\omega(\\omega\\epsilon)</math>.\nBut damping cannot be derived in this model. To calculate energy exchange of the wave with resonant electrons, Vlasov plasma theory has to be expanded to '''second order''' and problems about suitable initial conditions and secular terms arise.\n\n[[File:Ldamp2.jpg|thumb]] In Ref.<ref>Best, Robert W. B., \"Energy and momentum density of a Landau-damped wave packet\", ''J. Plasma Phys.'' 63 (2000), 371-391</ref> these problems are studied. Because calculations for an infinite wave are deficient in second order, a [[wave packet]] is analysed. Second-order initial conditions are found that suppress secular behavior and excite a wave packet of which the energy agrees with fluid theory. The figure shows the energy density of a wave packet traveling at the [[group velocity]], its energy being carried away by electrons moving at the phase velocity. Total energy, the area under the curves, is conserved.\n\n== Mathematical theory: the Cauchy problem for perturbative solutions ==\n\nThe rigorous mathematical theory is based on solving the [[Cauchy problem]] for the evolution equation (here the partial differential Vlasov\u2013Poisson equation) and proving estimates on the solution.\n\nFirst a rather complete linearized mathematical theory has been developed since Landau.<ref>See for instance Backus, G. \"Linearized plasma oscillations in arbitrary electron distributions\".

Hence, there are more particles gaining energy from the wave than losing to the wave, which leads to wave damping.\nIf, however, the slope of the function is positive, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is smaller than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles losing energy to the wave than gaining from the wave, which leads to a resultant increase in the wave energy.\n\n== Physical interpretation ==\n\nThe mathematical theory of Landau damping is somewhat involved\u2014see the section below. However, there is a simple physical interpretation [introduced in section 7.5 of <ref name=\":0\" /> with a caveat], which, though not strictly correct, helps to visualize this phenomenon.\n\n[[File:Phys interp landau damp.svg|thumb]]\n\nIt is possible to imagine [[Plasma oscillation|Langmuir waves]] as waves in the sea, and the particles as surfers trying to catch the wave, all moving in the same direction. If the surfer is moving on the water surface at a velocity slightly less than the waves he will eventually be caught and pushed along the wave (gaining energy), while a surfer moving slightly faster than a wave will be pushing on the wave as he moves uphill (losing energy to the wave).\n\nIt is worth noting that only the surfers are playing an important role in this energy interactions with the waves; a beachball floating on the water (zero velocity) will go up and down as the wave goes by, not gaining energy at all. Also, a boat that moves very fast (faster than the waves) does not exchange much energy with the wave.\n\nA simple mechanical description of particle dynamics provides a quantitative estimate of the synchronization of particles with the wave [Equation (1) of <ref name=\":1\" />]. A more rigorous approach shows the strongest synchronization occurs for particles with a velocity in the wave frame proportional to the damping rate and independent of the wave amplitude [section 4.1.3 of <ref>{{Cite book|title=Microscopic Dynamics of Plasmas and Chaos|journal = Microscopic Dynamics of Plasmas and Chaos. Series: Series in Plasma Physics|volume = 12|last=Escande|first=Dominique|last2=Elskens|first2=Yves|date=2002-10-23|isbn=9780750306126|series=Series in Plasma Physics|doi=10.1201/9781420033953|bibcode=2002SPP....12.....E}}</ref>]. Since Landau damping occurs for waves with arbitrarily small amplitudes, this shows the most active particles in this damping are far from being trapped. This is natural, since trapping involves diverging time scales for such waves (specifically <math>T_\\text{trap} \\sim A^{-1/2}</math> for a wave amplitude <math>A</math>).\n\n== Theoretical physics: perturbation theory in a Vlasovian frame ==\n\nTheoretical treatment starts with the [[Vlasov equation]] in the non-relativistic zero-magnetic field limit, the Vlasov\u2013Poisson set of equations. Explicit solutions are obtained in the limit of a small <math>E</math>-field. The distribution function <math>f</math> and field <math>E</math> are expanded in a series: <math> f=f_0(v)+f_1(x,v,t)+f_2(x,v,t)</math>, <math>E=E_1(x,t)+E_2(x,t)</math> and terms of equal order are collected.\n\nTo '''first order''' the Vlasov\u2013Poisson equations read\n\n:<math>(\\partial_t + v\\partial_x)f_1 + {e\\over m}E_1 f'_0 = 0, \\quad \n \\partial_x E_1 = {e\\over \\epsilon_0} \\int f_1 \\mathrm{d}v</math>.\n\nLandau calculated<ref name=\"orig\" /> the wave caused by an initial disturbance <math>f_1(x,v,0) = g(v)\\exp(ikx)</math> and found by aid of [[Laplace transform]] and [[contour integration]] a damped travelling wave of the form <math>\\exp[ik(x-v_\\text{ph}t)-\\gamma t]</math> with [[wave number]] <math>k</math> and damping decrement\n\n:<math>\\gamma\\approx-{\\pi\\omega_p^3 \\over 2k^2N} f'_0(v_\\text{ph}), \\quad\n  N = \\int f_0 \\mathrm{d}v</math>.\n\nHere <math>\\omega_p</math> is the [[plasma oscillation]] frequency and <math>N</math> is the electron density. Later [[Nico van Kampen]] proved<ref>van Kampen, N. G., \"On the theory of stationary waves in plasma\", ''Physica'' 21 (1955), 949\u2013963. See http://theor.jinr.ru/~kuzemsky/kampenbio.html</ref> that the same result can be obtained with [[Fourier transform]]. He showed that the linearized Vlasov\u2013Poisson equations have a continuous spectrum of singular normal modes, now known as '''van Kampen modes'''\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{kN} f'_0 \\frac{\\mathcal P}{kv-\\omega} + \\epsilon \\delta\\left(v-\\frac{\\omega}{k}\\right) </math>\n\nin which <math>\\mathcal P</math> signifies principal value, <math>\\delta</math> is the delta function (see [[generalized function]]) and\n\n:<math>\\epsilon = 1 + \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{kN} \\int f'_0 \\frac{\\mathcal P}{\\omega-kv} \\mathrm{d}v</math>\n\nis the plasma permittivity. Decomposing the initial disturbance in these modes he obtained the Fourier spectrum of the resulting wave. Damping is explained by phase-mixing of these Fourier modes with slightly different frequencies near <math>\\omega_p</math>.\n\nIt was not clear how damping could occur in a collisionless plasma: where does the wave energy go? In fluid theory, in which the plasma is modeled as a dispersive dielectric medium,<ref>Landau, L. D. and Lifshitz, E. M., ''Electrodynamics of Continuous Media'' \u00a780, Pergamon Press (1984).</ref> the energy of Langmuir waves is known: field energy multiplied by the Brillouin factor <math>\\partial_\\omega(\\omega\\epsilon)</math>.\nBut damping cannot be derived in this model. To calculate energy exchange of the wave with resonant electrons, Vlasov plasma theory has to be expanded to '''second order''' and problems about suitable initial conditions and secular terms arise.\n\n[[File:Ldamp2.jpg|thumb]] In Ref.<ref>Best, Robert W. B., \"Energy and momentum density of a Landau-damped wave packet\", ''J. Plasma Phys.'' 63 (2000), 371-391</ref> these problems are studied. Because calculations for an infinite wave are deficient in second order, a [[wave packet]] is analysed. Second-order initial conditions are found that suppress secular behavior and excite a wave packet of which the energy agrees with fluid theory. The figure shows the energy density of a wave packet traveling at the [[group velocity]], its energy being carried away by electrons moving at the phase velocity. Total energy, the area under the curves, is conserved.\n\n== Mathematical theory: the Cauchy problem for perturbative solutions ==\n\nThe rigorous mathematical theory is based on solving the [[Cauchy problem]] for the evolution equation (here the partial differential Vlasov\u2013Poisson equation) and proving estimates on the solution.\n\nFirst a rather complete linearized mathematical theory has been developed since Landau.<ref>See for instance Backus, G. \"Linearized plasma oscillations in arbitrary electron distributions\".
