{"title_page": "Cryptic crossword", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n\nA '''cryptic crossword''' is a [[crossword|crossword puzzle]] in which each clue is a word puzzle in and of itself. Cryptic crosswords are particularly popular in the [[United Kingdom]], where they originated,<ref name=Eliot_Brief>{{cite web|last1=Eliot |first1=George |title=Brief History of Crossword Puzzles |url=https://www.crosswordtournament.com/more/wynne.html |publisher=American Crossword Puzzle Tournament}}</ref> [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], and in several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malta]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. In the [[United States]], cryptics are sometimes known as \"British-style\" crosswords. Compilers of cryptic crosswords are commonly called \"setters\" in the [[UK]].\n\nCryptic crossword puzzles come in two main types:  the basic cryptic in which each clue answer is entered into the diagram normally, and \"themed\" or \"variety\" cryptics, in which some or all of the answers must be altered before entering, usually in accordance with a hidden pattern or rule which must be discovered by the solver.\n\n== History and development ==\nCryptic crosswords originated in the UK.  The first British crossword puzzles appeared around 1923 and were purely definitional, but from the mid-1920s they began to include cryptic material: not cryptic clues in the modern sense, but anagrams, classical allusions, incomplete quotations, and other references and wordplay. [[Torquemada (crossword compiler)|Torquemada]] (Edward Powys Mathers), who set for ''The Saturday Westminster'' from 1925 and for ''[[The Observer]]'' from 1926 until his death in 1939, was the first setter to use cryptic clues exclusively and is often credited as the inventor of the cryptic crossword.<ref name=mathers_strange>{{cite web|last1=Millington|first1=Roger|title=The Strange World of the Crossword (excerpt)|url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/mathers.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe first newspaper crosswords appeared in the ''Sunday'' and ''[[Daily Express]]'' from about 1924. Crosswords were gradually taken up by other newspapers, appearing in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1925, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' from 1929 and ''[[The Times]]'' from 1930.  These newspaper puzzles were almost entirely non-cryptic at first and gradually used more cryptic clues, until the fully cryptic puzzle as known today became widespread.  In some papers this took until about 1960.\n\nPuzzles appeared in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' from 1930, but this was a weekly magazine rather than a newspaper, and the puzzles were much harder than the newspaper ones, though again they took a while to become entirely cryptic.\n\nTorquemada's puzzles were extremely obscure and difficult, and later setters reacted against this tendency by developing a standard for fair clues, ones that can be solved, at least in principle, by deduction, without needing leaps of faith or insights into the setter's thought processes.\n\nThe basic principle of fairness was set out by ''Listener'' setter '''Afrit''' ([[Alistair Ferguson Ritchie]]) in his book ''Armchair Crosswords'' (1946), wherein he credits it to the fictional ''Book of the Crossword'':\n\n:We must expect the composer to play tricks, but we shall insist that he play fair. The Book of the Crossword lays this injunction upon him: \"You need not mean what you say, but you must say what you mean.\" This is a superior way of saying that he can't have it both ways. He may attempt to mislead by employing a form of words which can be taken in more than one way, and it is your fault if you take it the wrong way, but it is his fault if you can't logically take it the right way.\n\nAn example of a clue which cannot logically be taken the right way:\n:''Hat could be dry (5)''\n\nHere the composer intends the answer to be \"derby\", with \"hat\" the definition, \"could be\" the anagram indicator, and \"be dry\" the anagram fodder. I.e., \"derby\" is an anagram of \"be dry\". But \"be\" is doing double duty, and this means that any attempt to read the clue cryptically in the form \"[definition] [anagram indicator] [fodder]\" fails: if \"be\" is part of the anagram indicator, then the fodder is too short, but if it is part of the fodder, there is no anagram indicator; to be a correct clue it would have to be \"Hat could '''be be''' dry (5)\", which is ungrammatical. A variation might read ''Hat turns out to be dry (5)'', but this also fails because the word \"to\", which is necessary to make the sentence grammatical, follows the indicator (\"turns out\") even though it is not part of the anagram indicated.\n\nTorquemada's successor at ''The Observer'' was '''Ximenes''' ([[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]], 1902\u20131971), and in his influential work, ''Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword Puzzle'' (1966), he set out more detailed guidelines for setting fair cryptic clues, now known as \"Ximenean principles\" and sometimes described by the word \"square-dealing\".<ref>Reissued Aug 2001: Swallowtail Books {{ISBN|1-903400-04-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-903400-04-3}}</ref> The most important of them are tersely summed up by Ximenes' successor '''[[Azed]]''' ([[Jonathan Crowther]], born 1942):\n\n:A good cryptic clue contains three elements:\n:# a precise definition\n:# a fair subsidiary indication\n:# nothing else\n\nThe Ximenean principles are adhered to most strictly in the subgenre of \"advanced cryptics\" \u2014 difficult puzzles using barred grids and a large vocabulary. Easier puzzles often have more relaxed standards, permitting a wider array of clue types, and allowing a little flexibility. The popular ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' setter '''Araucaria''' ([[John Galbraith Graham]], 1921&ndash;2013) was a noted non-Ximenean, celebrated for his witty, if occasionally unorthodox, clues.\n\n== Popularity ==\nMost of the major national [[newspaper]]s in the UK carry both cryptic and concise (quick) crosswords in every issue. The puzzle in ''[[The Guardian]]'' is well loved for its humour and quirkiness, and quite often includes puzzles with themes, which are extremely rare in ''The Times''.<ref>How to master the Times Crossword, Tim Moorey, p. 186</ref>\n\nMany Canadian newspapers, including the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', ''[[Toronto Star]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', carry cryptic crosswords.\n\nCryptic crosswords do not commonly appear in U.S. publications, although they can be found in magazines such as ''[[GAMES Magazine]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[Harper's]]'', and occasionally in the Sunday ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''[[New York Post]]'' reprints cryptic crosswords from ''The Times''. In April 2018, [[The New Yorker]] published the first of a new weekly series of cryptic puzzles.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Remnick |first1=David |authorlink1=David Remnick |title=Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle |url=https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/introducing-the-new-yorker-crossword-puzzle |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> Other sources of cryptic crosswords in the U.S. (at various difficulty levels) are puzzle books, as well as UK and Canadian newspapers distributed in the U.S. Other venues include the ''Enigma'', the magazine of the [[National Puzzlers' League]], and formerly, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. The latter puzzle, after a long and distinguished run, appeared solely on ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s website for several years, and ended with the October 2009 issue.  A similar puzzle by the same authors now appears monthly in ''[https://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/ The Wall Street Journal]''.\n\nCryptic crosswords are very popular in Australia. Most Australian newspapers will have at least one cryptic crossword, if not two. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'' in [[Melbourne]] publish daily cryptic crosswords, including Friday's challenging cryptic by 'DA' ([[David Astle]]). \"Lovatts\", an Australian puzzle publisher, regularly issues cryptic crossword puzzle books.\n\n== How cryptic clues work ==\nIn essence, a cryptic clue leads to its answer as long as it is read in the right way. What the clue appears to say when read normally (the ''surface reading'') is a distraction and usually has nothing to do with the clue answer.  The challenge is to find the way of reading the clue that leads to the solution.\n\nA typical clue consists of two parts, the definition and the wordplay. It provides two ways of getting to the answer. The definition, which usually exactly matches the [[part of speech]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], and [[grammatical number|number]] of the answer, is in essence the same as any 'straight' crossword clue, a synonym for the answer. It usually appears at the start or the end of a clue.\n\nThe other part (the ''subsidiary indication'', or ''wordplay'') provides an alternative route to the answer (this part would be a second definition in the case of double definition clues). One of the tasks of the solver is to find the boundary between definition and wordplay and insert a mental pause there when reading the clue ''cryptically''. This wordplay gives the solver some instructions on how to get to the answer another way. (Sometimes the two parts are joined with a link word or phrase such as \"from\", \"gives\" or \"could be\".)\n\nThere are many sorts of wordplay, such as anagrams and double definitions, but they all conform to rules. The crossword setters do their best to stick to these rules when writing their clues, and solvers can use these rules and conventions to help them solve the clues. Noted cryptic setter [[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]] (who wrote cryptics under the pseudonym of Ximenes) discusses the importance and art of fair cluemanship in his seminal book on cryptic crosswords, ''Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword'' (1966, reprinted 2001).<ref>{{cite book |last=Macnutt |first=Derrick |title=Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword  |year=2001 |publisher=Swallowtail Books |location=London |isbn=1-903400-04-X |pages=42\u201353}}</ref>\n\nBecause a typical cryptic clue describes its answer in detail and often more than once, the solver can usually have a great deal of confidence in the answer once it has been determined. The clues are 'self-checking'. This is in contrast to non-cryptic crossword clues which often have several possible answers and force the solver to use the crossing letters to distinguish which was intended.\n\nHere is an example (taken from ''[[The Guardian]]'' crossword of 6 August 2002, set by \"Shed\").\n\n:15D ''Very sad unfinished story about rising smoke (8)''\n\nis a clue for <small>TRAGICAL</small>.  This breaks down as follows.\n*15D indicates the location and direction (down) of the solution in the grid\n*\"Very sad\" is the definition\n*\"unfinished story\" gives \"tal\" (\"tale\" with one letter missing; i.e., unfinished)\n*\"rising smoke\" gives \"ragic\" (a \"cigar\" is a smoke and this is a down clue so \"rising\" indicates that \"cigar\" should be written up the page; i.e., backwards)\n*\"about\" means that the letters of \"tal\" should be put either side of \"ragic\", giving \"tragical\"\n*\"(8)\" says that the answer is a single word of eight letters.\n\nThere are many \"code words\" or \"indicators\" that have a special meaning in the cryptic crossword context. (In the example above, \"about\", \"unfinished\" and \"rising\" all fall into this category). Learning these, or being able to spot them, is a useful and necessary part of becoming a skilled cryptic crossword solver.\n\n[[#Compilers|Compilers]] or setters often use slang terms and abbreviations, generally without indication, so familiarity with these is important for the solver. Abbreviations may be as simple as 'west' = W, 'New York' = NY, but may also be more difficult.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://crossword365.com/pages/cryptic-abbreviations |title=Cryptic crossword abbreviations |accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> Words that can mean more than one thing are commonly exploited; often the meaning the solver must use is completely different from the one it appears to have in the clue. Some examples are:\n\n* Bloomer - often means flower (a thing that blooms).\n* Flower - often means river (a thing that flows).\n* Lead - could be the metal, an electric cable, or the verb.\n* Nice - if capitalized as the first word, could either be \"amiable\" or the French city.  Thus \"Nice friend\" often means the letters ''ami''.\n* Novel - could be a book, or a word for new, or a code-word indicating an anagram.\n* Permit - could be a noun (meaning license) or a verb (meaning allow).\n\nOf these examples, \"flower\" is an invented meaning by back-formation from the -er suffix, which cannot be confirmed in a standard dictionary.  A similar trick is played in the old clue \"A wicked thing\" for CANDLE, where the -ed suffix must be understood in its \"equipped with a ...\" meaning.  In the case of the -er suffix, this trick could be played with other meanings of the suffix, but except for river \u2192 BANKER (a river is not a 'thing that banks' but a 'thing that has banks'), this is rarely done.\n\nSometimes \"compiler\", or the name or codename of the compiler (if visible by the crossword), codes for some form of the pronoun \"I, me, my, mine\".\n\nIn the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' back page, Monday 15 March 2017, 7 down, is \"Banish spirits with zero ice upsetting imbibing times (8)\"; the answer is <small>EXORCIZE</small>: it means \"banish spirits\", and is \"zero ice\" rearranged, including 'x' (described as \"times\").\n\n== Grids for cryptic crosswords ==\n[[File:British crossword.svg|thumb|A lattice-style grid common for cryptic crosswords]]\n\nA typical cryptic crossword grid is generally 15\u00d715, with half-turn [[rotational symmetry]].  Unlike typical American [[crosswords]], in which every square is almost always ''checked'' (that is, each square provides a letter for both an across and a down answer), only about half of the squares in a cryptic crossword are checked.\n\nIn most daily newspaper cryptic crosswords, grid designs are restricted to a set of stock grids.  In the past this was because [[hot metal typesetting]] meant that new grids were expensive.<ref>{{cite news\n|last=Tossman\n|first=David\n|title=Crossword 847 answers and explanations\n|date=23 November 2013\n|url=https://www.listener.co.nz/entertainment/cryptic-crosswords/crossword-847-answers-and-explanations/\n|newspaper=[[New Zealand Listener]]\n}}</ref>\n\nSome papers have additional grid rules. In ''[[The Times]]'', for example, all words have at least half the letters checked, and although words can have two unchecked squares in succession, they cannot be the first two or last two letters of a word.  The grid shown here breaks one ''Times'' grid rule: the 15-letter words at 9 and 24 across each have 8 letters unchecked out of 15.  ''[[The Independent]]'' allows setters to use their own grid designs.\n\nVariety (UK: \"advanced\") cryptic crosswords typically use a \"barred grid\" with no black squares and a slightly smaller size; 12&times;12 is typical. Word boundaries are denoted by thick lines called \"bars\".  In these variety puzzles, one or more clues may require modification to fit into the grid, such as dropping or adding a letter, or being anagrammed to fit other, unmodified clues; unclued spaces may spell out a secret message appropriate for the puzzle theme once the puzzle is fully solved.  The solver also may need to determine where answers fit into the grid.\n\nA July 2006 \"Puzzlecraft\" section in [[Games Magazine|''Games'' magazine]] on cryptic crossword construction noted that for cryptic crosswords to be readily solvable, no fewer than half the letters for every word should be checked by another word for a standard cryptic crossword, while nearly every letter should be checked for a variety cryptic crossword.  In most UK \"advanced cryptics\" ('variety cryptic'), at least three-quarters of the letters in each word are checked.\n\n== Regional variation ==\n\n=== British and North American differences ===\nThere are notable differences between British and North American (including Canadian) cryptics. American cryptics are thought of as holding to a more rigid set of construction rules than British ones. American cryptics usually require all words in a clue to be used in service of the wordplay or definition, whereas British ones allow for more extraneous or supporting words. In American cryptics, a clue is only allowed to have one subsidiary indication, but in British cryptics the occasional clue may have more than one; e.g., a ''triple definition'' clue would be considered an amusing variation in the UK but unsound in the US.\n\n=== Other languages ===\nFor the most part, cryptic crosswords are an [[English-language]] phenomenon, although similar puzzles are popular in a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] form in [[Israel]] (where they are called ''tashbetsey higayon'' (\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05e6\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df) \"Logic crosswords\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zuckermann.org/cryptic.html|title=One of Dr Ghil`ad Zuckermann's Cryptic Crosswords|publisher=}}</ref> and (as ''Cryptogram'')  in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. In Poland similar crosswords are called \"[[Hetman]] crosswords\". 'Hetman', a senior commander, and also the name for a [[queen (chess)|queen]] in [[Chess]], emphasises their importance over other crosswords. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], this type of crossword puzzle is known as ''piilosana'' (literally \"hidden word\"), while ''krypto'' refers to a crossword puzzle where the letters have been coded as numbers. The [[Germany|German]] ''ZEITmagazin'' has a weekly cryptic crossword called ''Um die Ecke gedacht'' and the ''SZ Magazin'' features ''das Kreuz mit den Worten''.\n\nIn India the [[Telugu Language|Telugu]] publication [[Sakshi (newspaper)|Sakshi]] carries a \"Tenglish\" (Telugu-English, bilingual) cryptic crossword;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/09/how-kishore-solved-tenglish-crossword.html|title=Tenglish crossword|publisher=Crossword Unclued, 29 September 2012.}}</ref> the [[Prajavani]] and [[Vijaya Karnataka]] crossword ([[Kannada Language|Kannada]]) also employs cryptic wordplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/08/kannada-crosswords.html|title=Kannada crosswords: Prajavani, Udayavani, Kannada Prabha|publisher=Crossword Unclued, 22 August 2012.}}</ref> Enthusiasts have also created cryptic crosswords in Hindi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2014/08/prize-hindi-puzzle-winner.html|title=Prize Hindi Puzzle: Here's Our Winner|publisher=}}</ref> Since 1994, ''enigmista'' [[w:it:Ennio Peres|Ennio Peres]] has challenged Italians annually with ''[http://www.parole.tv/xw/cruciperes.asp Il cruciverba pi\u00f9 difficile del mondo]'' (The World's Most Difficult Crossword), which has many features in common with English-style cryptics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/07/22/il-cruciverba-piu-difficile-del-mondo/1893519/|title=Il cruciverba pi\u00f9 difficile del mondo|author=Dario De Toffoli|work=Il Fatto Quotidiano}}</ref>\n\nIn Chinese something similar is the [[riddle]] of Chinese characters, where partial characters instead of substrings are clued and combined.\n\n== Types of cryptic clues ==\nClues given to the solver are based on various forms of wordplay.  Nearly every clue has two non-overlapping parts to it: one part that provides an unmodified but often indirect definition for the word or phrase, and a second part that includes the wordplay involved.  In a few cases, the two definitions are one and the same, as often in the case of [[#\"& lit.\"|\"& lit.\"]] clues.  Most cryptic crosswords provide the number of letters in the answer, or in the case of phrases, a series of numbers to denote the letters in each word: \"cryptic crossword\" would be clued with \"(7,9)\" following the clue.  More advanced puzzles may drop this portion of the clue.\n\n=== Anagrams ===\n[[File:Animation for the anagram CORSET = ESCORT.gif|thumb|Animation for the anagram CORSET = ESCORT]]\nAn [[anagram]] is a rearrangement of a certain section of the clue to form the answer. This is usually indicated by words such as \"strange\", \"bizarre\", \"muddled\", \"wild\", \"drunk\", or any other term indicating change. One example:\n\n:''Chaperone shredded corset (6)''\n\ngives <small>ESCORT</small>, which means ''chaperone'' and is an anagram of ''corset'', indicated by the word ''shredded''.\n\nAnagram clues are characterized by an indicator word adjacent to a phrase that has the same number of letters as the answer. The indicator tells the solver that there is an [[anagram]] they need to solve to work out the answer. Indicators come either before or after the letters to be anagrammed. In an American cryptic, only the words given in the clue may be anagrammed; in some older puzzles, the words to be anagrammed may be clued and ''then'' anagrammed. So in this clue:\n\n:''Chew honeydew fruit (5)''\n\n''Chew'' is the anagram indicator; ''honeydew'' clues ''melon'', which is to be anagrammed; and ''fruit'' is the definition for the answer, <small>LEMON</small>.  This kind of clue is called an ''indirect anagram'', which in the vast majority of cryptic crosswords are not used, ever since they were criticised by 'Ximenes' in his 1966 book ''On the Art of the Crossword''.  Minor exception: simple abbreviations may be used to spice up the process; e.g., \"Husband, a most eccentric fellow\" (6) for THOMAS, where the anagram is made from A, MOST, and H = husband.\n\nAnagram indicators, among the thousands possible, include: about, abstract, absurd, adapted, adjusted, again, alien, alternative, anew, another, around, arranged, assembled, assorted, at sea, awful, awkward, bad, barmy, becomes, blend, blow, break, brew, build, careless, changed, chaotic, characters, clumsy, composed, confused, contrived, convert, cooked, corrupt, could be, crazy, damaged, dancing, designed, develop, different, disorderly, disturbed, doctor, eccentric, edited, engineer, fabricate, fake, fancy, faulty, fiddled, fix, foolish, form, free, fudge, gives, ground, hammer, haywire, hybrid, improper, in a tizzy, involved, irregular, jostle, jumbled, jumping, kind of, knead, letters, loose, made, managed, maybe, messy, mistaken, mix, modified, moving, muddled, mutant, new, novel, odd, off, order, organised, otherwise, out, outrageous, peculiar, perhaps, playing, poor, possible, prepared, produced, queer, questionable, random, reform, remodel, repair, resort, rough, shaken, shifting, silly, sloppy, smashed, somehow, sort, spoilt, strange, style, switch, tangled, treated, tricky, troubled, turning, twist, unconventional, undone, unsettled, unsound, untidy, unusual, upset, used, vary, version, warped, wayward, weird, wild, working, wrecked, wrong.\n\nIt is common for the setter to use a juxtaposition of anagram indicator and anagram that form a common phrase to make the clue appear as much like a 'normal' sentence or phrase as possible.  For example:\n\n:''Lap dancing friend (3)''\n\nuses ''dancing'' as the indicator as it fits cohesively with ''lap'' to give the solution, <small>PAL</small>.\n\n=== Charade ===\nHere, the answer is formed by joining individually clued words to make a larger word (namely, the answer).\n\nFor example:\n\n:''Outlaw leader managing money (7)''\n\nThe answer is <small>BANKING</small> formed by <small>BAN</small> for \"outlaw\" and <small>KING</small> for \"leader\". The definition is \"managing money\". With this example, the words appear in the same order in the clue as they do in the answer, and no special words are needed to indicate this. However, the order of the parts is sometimes indicated with words such as \"against\", \"after\", \"on\", \"with\" or \"above\" (in a down clue).\n\n=== Containers ===\nA container clue puts one set of letters inside another. So:\n\n:''Apostle's friend outside of university (4)''\n\ngives <small>PAUL</small> (\"apostle\"), by placing \"pal\" (\"friend\") outside of \"U\" (\"university\"); the \"'s\" could be treated as the [[genitive]] case suffix or as short for \"is\".\n\nA similar example:\n\n:''Utter nothing when there's wickedness about (5)''\n\nThe answer is <small>VOICE</small> (\"utter\"), formed by placing \"O\" (\"nothing\") inside the word \"vice\" (\"wickedness\").\n\nOther container indicators are \"inside\", \"over\", \"around\", \"about\", \"clutching\", \"enters\", and the like.\n\n=== Deletions ===\nDeletions consist of ''beheadments'', ''curtailments'', and ''internal deletions''.  In beheadments, a word loses its first letter.  In curtailments, it loses its last letter, and internal deletions remove an inner letter, such as the middle one.\n\nAn example of a beheadment:\n\n:''Beheaded celebrity is sailor (3)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>TAR</small>, another word for \"sailor\", which is a \"celebrity\", or star, without the first letter.\n\nOther indicator words of beheadment include \"don't start\", \"topless\", and \"after the first\".\n\nAn example of curtailment:\n\n:''Shout, \"Read!\" endlessly (3)''\n\nThe answer is <small>BOO</small>.  If you ignore the punctuation, a book is a \"read\", and book \"endlessly\" is ''boo'', a \"shout\".\n\nOther indicators include \"nearly\" and \"unfinished\".\n\nAn example of internal deletion:\n\n:''Challenging sweetheart heartlessly (6)''\n\nThe answer is <small>DARING</small>, which means \"challenging\", and is darling without its middle letter, or \"heartlessly\".\n\nNote that \"sweetheart\" could also be simply \"wee\" or the letter \"E\", that is, the \"heart\" (middle) of \"sweet\".\n\n=== Double definition ===\nA clue may, rather than having a definition part and a wordplay part, have two definition parts. Thus:\n\n: ''Not seeing window covering (5)''\n\nwould have the answer <small>BLIND</small>, because ''blind'' can mean both \"not seeing\" and \"window covering\". Note that since these definitions come from the same root word, an American magazine might not allow this clue. American double definitions tend to require both parts to come from different roots, as in this clue:\n\n: ''Eastern European buff (6)''\n\nThis takes advantage of the two very different meanings (and pronunciations) of <small>POLISH</small>, the one with the long \"o\" sound meaning \"someone from Poland\" and the one with the short \"o\" sound meaning \"make shiny\".\n\nThese clues tend to be short; in particular, two-word clues are almost always double-definition clues.\n\nIn the UK, multiple definitions are occasionally used; e.g.:\n\n: ''Blue swallow feathers fell from above (4)''\n\nis a quintuple definition of <small>DOWN</small> (\"blue\" (sad), \"swallow\" (drink), \"feathers\" (plumage), \"fell\" (cut down) and \"from above\"),<ref>Arachne (30 January 2014), [https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26170 Cryptic crossword No 26,170], ''The Guardian''</ref> but in the US this would be considered unsound.\n\nSome British newspapers have an affection for quirky clues of this kind where the two definitions are similar:\n\n: ''Let in or let on (5)'' \u2013 <small>ADMIT</small>\n\nNote that these clues do not have clear indicator words.\n\n=== Hidden words ===\nWhen the answer appears in the clue but is contained within one or more words, it is hidden.  For example:\n\n:''Found ermine, deer hides damaged (10)''\n\ngives <small>UNDERMINED</small>, which means (cryptically at least) \"damaged\" and can be found as part of \"Fo'''und ermine d'''eer\". The word \"hides\" is used to mean \"contains,\" but in the surface sense suggests \"pelts\". A complication is that \"damaged\" often (but not in this clue) means \"rearrange the letters\".\n\nPossible indicators of a hidden clue are \"in part\", \"partially\", \"in\", \"within\", \"hides\", \"conceals\", \"some\", and \"held by\".\n\nAnother example:\n\n:''Introduction to do-gooder canine (3)''\n\ngives <small>DOG</small>, which is the first part of, or \"introduction to\", the word \"do-gooder\", and means \"canine\".\nHidden words clues are sometimes called \"Embedded words\" or \"Telescopic clues\". The opposite of a hidden word clue, where letters ''missing'' from a sentence have to be found, is known as a [[Printer's Devilry]], and appears in some advanced cryptics.\n\nThere are several common techniques used in Hidden Word clues.\n\n==== Initial letters ====\nThe first letters of part of the clue are put together to give the answer.\n\nAn example of an initialism:\n\n:''Initially amiable person eats primate (3)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>APE</small>, which is a type of primate. \"Initially\" signals that you must take the first letters of \"'''a'''miable '''p'''erson '''e'''ats\" \u2013 \"ape\".\n\nAnother example would be:\n\n:''At first, actor needing new identity emulates orphan in musical theatre (5)''\n\nThe answer would be [[Annie (musical)|<small>ANNIE</small>]], the name of a famous orphan in musical theatre. This is obtained from the first letters of \"actor needing new identity emulates\".\n\nWords that indicate initialisms also include \"firstly\" and \"to start\".\n\nIt is possible to have initialisms just for certain parts of the clue.  It is also possible to employ the same technique to the end of words. For example:\n\n:''Old country lady went round Head Office initially before end of day (7)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>DAHOMEY</small>, which used to be a kingdom in Africa (an \"old country\"). Here, we take the first letters of only the words \"Head Office\" (ho) and we take the \"end\" of the word \"day\" (y). The letters of the word \"dame\", meaning \"lady\", are then made to go around the letters \"ho\" to form Dahomey.\n\n==== Odd/even letters ====\nEither the odd or even letters of words in the clue give the answer. An example is:\n\n:''Odd stuff of Mr. Waugh is set for someone wanting women to vote (10)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>SUFFRAGIST</small>, which is \"someone wanting women to vote\". The word \"odd\" indicates that we must take every other letter of the rest of the clue, starting with the first: StUfF oF mR wAuGh Is SeT.\n\n=== Homophones ===\n[[Homophone]]s are words that sound the same but have different meanings, such as \"night\" and \"knight\".  Homophone clues always have an indicator word or phrase that has to do with phonetics, such as \"reportedly\", \"they say\", \"utterly\" (here treated as \"utter(ing)-ly\" and not with its usual meaning), \"vocal\", \"to the audience\", \"auditioned\", \"by the sound of it\", \"is heard\", \"in conversation\" and \"on the radio\". \"Broadcast\" is a particularly devious indicator as it could indicate either a homophone or an anagram.\n\nAn example of a homophone clue is\n\n:''We hear twins shave (4)''\n\nwhich is a clue for <small>PARE</small>, which means \"shave\" and is a homophone of pair, or \"twins\".  The homophone is indicated by \"we hear\".\n\nIf the two words are the same length, the clue should be phrased in such a way that only one of them can be the answer. This is usually done by having the homophone indicator adjacent to the word that is not the definition; therefore, in the previous example, \"we hear\" was adjacent to \"twins\" and the answer was ''pare'' rather than ''pair''. The indicator could come between the words if they were of different lengths and the enumeration was given, such as in the case of \"right\" and \"rite\".\n\n=== Letter Banks ===\nThe letter bank form of cluing consists of a shorter word (or words) containing no repeated letters (an \"isogram\"), and a longer word or phrase built by using each of these letters (but no others) at least once but repeating them as often as necessary. This type of clue has been described by American constructors Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto, who write the weekly puzzle for The Nation. The shorter word is typically at least three or four letters in length, while the target word or phrase is at least three letters longer than the bank word. For example, the four letters in the word TENS can be used as a bank to form the word TENNESSEE. Typically, the clue contains indicator words such as \"use,\" \"take,\" or \"implement\" to signal that a letter bank is being employed.\n\nA more complicated example of a letter bank is:\n\n: ''Composer taking and retaking ingredients of Advil? Not! (7,7)''\n\nIn this case, \"ingredients\" signals that the letters of both \"Advil\" and \"Not\" form the bank. Those letters yield the answer, ANTONIO VIVALDI. \n\nKosman and Picciotto consider this to be a newer and more complicated form of cluing that offers another way, besides the anagram, of mixing and recombining letters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/going-bank/|title=Going to the Bank {{!}} The Nation|last=Picciotto|first=Joshua Kosman and Henri|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>\n\n=== Reversals ===\nA word that gets turned around to make another is a reversal. For example:\n\n:''Returned beer fit for a king (5)''\n\nThe answer is <small>REGAL</small>. \"Lager\" (i.e., \"beer\") is \"returned\" to make ''regal,'' i.e. fit for a king.\n\nOther indicator words include \"receding\", \"in the mirror\", \"going the wrong way\", \"returns\", \"reverses\" \"to the left\" or \"left\" (for across clues), and \"rising\", \"overturned\" or \"mounted\" or \"comes up\" (for down clues).\n\n=== Cryptic definition ===\nHere the clue appears to say one thing, but with a slight shift of viewpoint it says another.  For example:\n\n:''Flower of London?'' (6)\n\ngives <small>THAMES</small>, a flow-er of London.  Here, the surface reading suggests a blossom, which disguises the fact that the name of a river is required. Notice the question mark: this is often (though by no means always) used by compilers to indicate this sort of clue is one where you need to interpret the words in a different fashion.  The way that a clue reads as an ordinary sentence is called its ''surface reading'' and is often used to disguise the need for a different interpretation of the clue's component words.\n\nThis type of clue is common in British and Canadian cryptics but is a bit less common in American cryptics; in American-style crosswords, a clue like this is generally called a punny clue. It's almost certainly the oldest kind of cryptic clue: cryptic definitions appeared in the UK newspaper puzzles in the late 1920s and early 1930s that mixed cryptic and plain definition clues and evolved into fully cryptic crosswords.\n\n=== Spoonerism ===\nA relatively uncommon clue type, a [[Spoonerism]] is a play on words where corresponding [[consonant cluster]]s are switched between two words in a phrase (or syllables in a word) and the switch forms another pair of proper ''sounding'' words. For example: \"butterfly\" = \"flutter by\".\n\nBoth the solution word or phrase and its corresponding Spoonerism are clued for, and the clue type is almost always indicated by reference to Spooner himself \u2013 with some regions/publications insisting his religious title \"Rev.\" or \"Reverend\" be included. In contrast to all other clue types, this makes them almost impossible to disguise. But that doesn't necessarily make them easy.\n\nAn example of a Spoonerism clue is:\n\n:''He will casually put down Spooner's angry bear (9)''\n\nThe answer is <small>LITTERBUG</small> (''He will casually put down''). The Spoonerism is \"bitter\" (''angry'') and \"lug\" (''bear, as in carry'').\n\nThe vast majority of Spoonerism clues swap the first consonants of words or syllables, but Spoonerisms are not strictly restricted to that form and some setters will take advantage of this. John Henderson (Enigmatist in the [[The Guardian|Guardian]]) once clued for the Spoonerism \"light crick\" from \"right click\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=John|title=(Enigmatist)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25930|work=Cryptic crossword No 25,930|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=London|date=24 April 2013}}</ref> which didn't sit well with many solvers.\n\n=== \"&lit.\" ===\nAn \"&lit.\" or \"Literal\" clue is not a clue type, but, rather a variant on an existing clue. \"&lit\" stands for \"and literally so\". In this case, the entire clue is both a definition and a cryptic clue. In some publications &lit clues are indicated by an [[exclamation mark]] at the end of the clue.  For example:\n\n:''God incarnate, essentially! (4)''\n\nThe answer is <small>ODIN</small>. The Norse god [[Odin]] is hidden in \"g'''od in'''carnate\", as clued by \"essentially\", but the definition of Odin is also the whole clue, as Odin is essentially a God incarnate.\n\nThis satisfies the \"& lit.\" clue definition but as read is clearly a cryptic clue.  Another example:\n\n:''Spoil vote! (4)''\n\nwould give the answer <small>VETO</small>; in the cryptic sense, ''spoil'' works as an [[anagram]] indicator for ''vote'', while the whole clue is, with a certain amount of licence allowed to crossword setters, a definition.\n\nAnother example:\n\n:''e.g., Origin of goose (3)''\n\ngives the answer <small>EGG</small>. Geese find their origins in eggs, so the whole clue gives \"egg\", but the clue can also be broken down: e.g., loses its full stops to give ''eg'', followed by the first letter (i.e., the \"origin\") of the word goose\u2014''g''\u2014to make ''egg''.\n\n''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Tuesday 22 April 2014 has: \"Dog in wild? Yes! (5)\"; the answer is <small>[[dingo|DINGO]]</small>. \"Dog in wild\" means \"rearrange the letters of \"<small>DOG IN</small>\", '''and''' is the definition.\n\n== Clueing techniques ==\n\n=== Combination clues ===\nIt is very common for a clue to employ more than one method of wordplay.  For example:\n\n:''Illustrious baron returns in pit (9)''\n\nThe answer is <small>HONORABLE</small>.  \"Baron\" \"returns\", or is reversed, and put inside \"pit\" or hole, to make ''honorable'', or \"illustrious\".\n\nIn this example, the clue uses a combination of Reversal and Hidden clue types:\n\n:''Cruel to turn part of Internet torrid (6)''\n\nThe answer to this clue is <small>ROTTEN</small>. The phrase \"to turn\" indicates \"to reverse,\" and \"part of\" suggests a piece of \"Internet torrid\".\n\n=== Misleading clues ===\n\nTo make clues more difficult, cryptic constructors will frequently use traditional indicator words in a misleading manner.\n\n*A cryptic crossword on the back page of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' on 14 March 2012 included the answer <small>ANALYSIS</small>, whose clue was \"Close study of broken '''nails''', '''say''' (8)\": \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is part of an anagram.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' back page, 8 November 2012: \"Drunk compiler's admitted boob (5)\" means \"Means 'drunk', <small>MY</small> contains <small>ERR</small>, has 5 letters\", = <small>MERRY</small>. (\"Drunk\" often mean \"rearrange the letters\", but not this time.)\n* In a crossword by ''[[Araucaria (compiler)|Araucaria]]'', \"Araucaria is\" coded for <small>IAM</small> (= \"I am\") as part of an answer.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 25 February 2014: \"French place in island beset by cold sadly\": \"sadly\" usually means \"damaged\", \"with the letters rearranged\", but here it codes for \"alas\"; <small>I</small> inside <small>C ALAS</small> makes <small>CALAIS</small>, which is a French place.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 32, 3 April 2014: \"Bug starts to '''m'''ove '''i'''n '''d'''ark, '''g'''lowing '''e'''ndlessly (5)\": usually \"endlessly\" and similar mean \"remove the last letter\", but here it is one of five consecutive words to form an [[acronym]] from, as the word \"starts\" shows; the answer is <small>MIDGE</small>.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 18, 1 September 2015: 4 down: \"How one may find Etna to increase danger? (2,3,4)\": the answer (<small>UP THE ANTE</small>) describes how to make the clue word <small>ETNA</small>, which is the reverse of usual.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 27 March 2017: 10 down: \"One might see flow in this game (8)\":  the answer (<small>WILDFOWL</small>) describes how to make the clue word <small>FLOW</small>, which is the reverse of usual; \"game\" is as in sport shooting.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 16, 2 May 2017: 1 across: \"Schoolchild's punishment, devising a cryptic clue for 'crows'? (7,5)\": the answer is <small>HUNDRED LINES</small>: reverse of the usual way to use a Roman number.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 32, 14 November 2017: 28 across: \"Very old diamonds, say (5)\": <small>V O ICE</small>: \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is the definition; the word \"voice\" can be used as a verb.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 34, 22 March 2018: 3 down: \"Trouble from win<u>d is turb</u>ulent\": answer is <small>DISTURB</small>; the word \"turbulent\" suggests forming an anagram, which does not happen here.\n* A clue in the ''Daily Telegraph'' September 2018 started \"Communist leader\", which would be expected to mean the letter C; but this time it was the definition, and the answer was <small>CHE GUEVARA</small>.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 3 June 2019: 20 down: \"Discover the truth about \\ gang fight in New York City\": both parts are definitions of \"[[wikt:rumble|<small>RUMBLE</small>]]\" :: in a British newspaper, although \"rumble\" for \"gang fight\" is American [[street gang]] jargon.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 21 June 2019: 12 across: \"Greek goddess, flanked by banks of [[Tigris]] in ancient city (6)\": The Greek goddess is [[Hebe (mythology)|<small>HEBE</small>]], not one much known of; between the first and last letters of <small>TIGRIS</small>, makes [[Thebes, Greece|<small>THEBES</small>]]; \"ancient city\" usually means [[Ur|<small>UR</small>]], but not here.\n\n=== Clues valid only on particular days or in particular areas ===\n* A cryptic crossword in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' on [[Easter Sunday]] 2014 had an anagram clue whose answer was <small>EASTER SUNDAY</small>, and its definition part was \"today\".\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' on 8 April 2019, page 30: 5 down: \"Parade one month ago (5,4)\": its answer was <small>MARCH PAST</small>; that clue would be valid only in April each year.\n* In a cryptic crossword in the British newspaper ''Daily Telegraph'' (20 April 2017), the clue \"''Irritating proverb we're told (4)'' (<small>SORE</small> = \"[[wikt:saw#Etymology 2|saw]]\") depends on a [[homophony]] which only happens in [[non-rhotic]] pronunciation such as in British English.\n\n== Bits and pieces ==\nAbbreviations are popular with crossword compilers for cluing individual letters or short sections of the answer. Consider this clue:\n\n''About to come between little Desmond and worker for discourse (7)''\n\n:There are two abbreviations used here.  \"About\" is abbreviated \"c\" (for \"circa\"), and \"little Desmond\" indicates that the [[diminutive]] of Desmond (namely, DES) is required.  The \"c\" is \"to come between\" DES and ANT (a worker; note that compilers also use \"worker\" to stand for BEE or HAND), giving [[wikt:descant|DESCANT]], which means \"discourse\".\n\nCompilers use many of these [[crossword abbreviations]].\n\nAnother type of abbreviation in clues might be words that refer to letters. For example, 'you' refers to the letter U, 'why' refers to the letter Y, etc. A clue for instance:\n\n:''For example, why didn't you put the country? (5)''\n\n:The answer is \"<small>EGYPT</small>\". Three abbreviations are used here. \"For example\" is abbreviated to the letters E and G (for \"e.g.\"), \"why\" indicates the letter Y. The phrase \"didn't you put\" is the letters P and T (the word \"you\" refers to U, and word \"didn't\" means that the letter U in \"put\" should be left out, making it PT). Adding those letters together gets \"the country\" - EGYPT.\n\nThere are many ways in which constructors can clue a part of a clue. In this clue:\n\n''Exclamation of surprise about spectacles, from the top (3)''\n\n:The word \"spectacles\" clues OO because these letters look like a pair of spectacles \"from the top\". The answer is thus COO, which is an \"exclamation of surprise\" with C coming from \"circa\", clued by \"about\".\n\nOften, Roman numerals are used to break down words into their component letter groups. E.g. In this clue:\n\n''A team's first supporter is pivotal (4)''\n\n:The answer is AXIS, and the direct meaning is conveyed by the words \"is pivotal\". The first A is followed by \"XI\" which is Roman for 11 (refers to the number of players on the field in a cricket or [[soccer]] team). \"First supporter\" refers to the letter \"S\" which is the first letter of the word \"supporter\".\n\n== Clueing technique and difficulty ==\nCryptic clue styles across newspapers are ostensibly similar, but there are technical differences which result in the work of setters being regarded as either Ximenean or Libertarian (and often a combination of both).\n\nXimenean rules are very precise in terms of grammar and syntax, especially as regards the indicators used for various methods of wordplay. Libertarian setters may use devices which \"more or less\" get the message across. For example, when treating the answer BEER the setter may decide to split the word into BEE and R and, after finding suitable ways to define the answer and BEE, now looks to give the solver a clue to the letter R. Ximenean rules would not allow something like \"reach first\" to indicate that R is the first letter of \"reach\" because, grammatically, that is not what \"reach first\" implies. Instead, a phrase along the lines of \"first to reach\" would be needed as this conforms to rules of grammar. Many Libertarian crossword editors would, however, accept \"reach first\" as it would be considered to reasonably get the idea across. For instance, a clue following Ximenean rules for BEER (BEE + R) may look as such:\n:''Stinger first to reach drink (4)''\nWhile a clue following Libertarian rules may look as follows:\n:''Stinger reaches first drink (4)''\n\n''The Guardian'' is perhaps the most Libertarian of cryptic crosswords, while ''The Times'' is mostly Ximenean. The others tend to be somewhere in between; the ''Financial Times'' and ''Independent'' tend towards Ximenean, the ''Daily Telegraph'' also \u2013 although its Toughie crossword can take a very Libertarian approach depending on the setter.  None of the major daily cryptics in the UK is \"strictly Ximenean\"; all allow clues which are just cryptic definitions, and strict Ximenean rules exclude such clues.  There are other differences like nounal anagram indicators and in current ''Times'' crosswords, unindicated definition by example: \"bay\" in the clue indicating HORSE in the answer, without a qualification like \"bay, perhaps\".\n\nIn terms of difficulty, Libertarian clues can seem impenetrable to inexperienced solvers. However, more significant is the setter him/herself. Crosswords in the ''Times'' and ''Daily Telegraph'' are published anonymously, so the crossword editor ensures that clues adhere to a consistent house style. Inevitably each setter has an individual (and often very recognisable) approach to clue-writing, but the way in which wordplay devices are used and indicated is kept within a defined set of rules.\n\nIn the ''Guardian'', ''Independent'', ''Financial Times'' and ''Telegraph'' Toughie series the setters' pseudonyms are published, so solvers become familiar with the styles of individual setters rather than house rules. Thus the level of difficulty is associated with the setter rather than the newspaper, though puzzles by individual setters can actually vary in difficulty considerably.\n\nIt is effectively impossible, then, to describe one newspaper's crosswords as the toughest or easiest. For newcomers to cryptic puzzles the ''Daily Telegraph'' is often regarded as an ideal starting point, but this is contentious. Since all of the newspapers have different styles, concentrating on one of them is likely to lead to proficiency in only one style of clue-writing; moving to a different series, after perhaps years spent with just one, can leave the solver feeling as if they have gone back to square one. The better technique is to simply attempt as many different crosswords as possible, perhaps to find a \"comfort zone\" but, more importantly, to experience the widest possible range of Ximenean/Libertarian styles.\n\n== Cryptic crosswords in specific publications ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn Britain it is traditional \u2014 dating from the cryptic crossword pioneer [[Edward Powys Mathers|Edward (Bill) Powys Mathers]] (1892\u20131939), who called himself \"Torquemada\" after the Spanish [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisitor]] \u2014 for compilers to use evocative pseudonyms. \"Crispa\", named from the Latin for \"curly-headed\", who set crosswords for the ''Guardian'' from 1954<ref>A Display of Lights (9), Val Gilbert, 2008 - p. 155</ref> until her retirement in 2004, legally changed her surname to \"Crisp\" after divorcing in the 1970s.  Some pseudonyms have obvious connotations: for example, Torquemada as already described, or \"Mephisto\" with fairly obvious devilish overtones.  Others are chosen for logical but less obvious reasons, though \"Dinmutz\" (the late Bert Danher in the ''Financial Times'') was produced by random selection of [[Scrabble]] tiles.\n\n;''The Daily Telegraph/Sunday Telegraph''\n:The ''Telegraph'', like the ''Times'', does not identify the setter of each puzzle but, unlike the ''Times'', has a regular setter for each day of the week, plus a few occasional setters to cover holidays or sickness. Regular setters include John Halpern, Ray Terrell, Jeremy Mutch, Don Manley, Allan Smith, Steve Bartlett and Richard Palmer. The regular setters as of 1 November 2006 are shown in a photograph [http://www.crossword.org.uk/valgilbert.htm here]. The crossword editor is Chris Lancaster, who took over from Phil McNeill in early 2018.  There is an advanced cryptic called Enigmatic Variations in the ''Sunday Telegraph'', and also a 15&times;15 blocked-grid puzzle.\n\n:In September 2008 the ''Telegraph'' started printing a 'Toughie' crossword as well as the daily puzzle, from Tuesday to Friday.  This is described by the paper as \"the toughest crossword in Fleet Street\" or similar and does include the setter's pseudonym.  Comments from some solvers on these puzzles don't always agree with this assessment, rating maybe half of them as close to average broadsheet cryptic difficulty.\n\n;''The Guardian''\n:Notable compilers of ''[[The Guardian]]'''s cryptic crosswords include Enigmatist, Pasquale, Paul (John Halpern again), Rufus (now retired), and the late [[Bob Smithies]] (Bunthorne) and [[Araucaria (compiler)|Araucaria]].  The puzzle is edited by Hugh Stephenson.\n\n;''The Independent''\n:''The Independent'' went online only in 2016, but still has a cryptic crossword. Setters include Virgilius, Dac, Phi, Quixote, Nimrod, Monk, Nestor, Bannsider, Anax, Merlin, Mass, Math, Morph, Scorpion, Tees and Punk ([[John Halpern]]).  The daily puzzle is edited by Eimi (Mike Hutchinson).\n\n;''i''\n:The ''i'' newspaper was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to The Independent, but was bought by Johnston Press in February 2016 when The Independent moved to digital-only publication. The fiendish Inquisitor puzzle is edited by John Henderson whose predecessor was the late former ''Times'' crossword editor Mike Laws. The crosswords are often themed and may contain a Nina: a hidden feature. \n\n;''The National''\n:Launched in Scotland as \"The Newspaper that supports an independent Scotland\" on 24 November 2014 after the independence referendum on 18 September. The National has a daily cryptic crossword after a request from readers to include one. The National is the only daily pro-independence newspaper in Scotland and is edited by Sunday Herald editor Richard Walker.\n\n;''The Observer''\n:Home of the famous [[Azed]] crossword, which employs a barred grid and a wider vocabulary than standard cryptics, and in conjunction with its predecessors 'Torquemada' and 'Ximenes' is the longest-running series of barred-grid puzzles. On the first Sunday of every month and at Christmas, Azed runs a clue-writing competition, via which many of today's top compilers have learnt their trade. ''The Observer'' also features a standard cryptic crossword, the Everyman, compiled by Allan Scott.\n\n;''Private Eye''\n:In the early 1970s the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' had a crossword set by the Labour MP [[Tom Driberg]], under the pseudonym of \"Tiresias\" (supposedly \"a distinguished academic churchman\"). It is currently set by Eddie James under the name \"Cyclops\". This crossword is usually topical, and contains material varying from risqu\u00e9 to rude, in clues, answers and the solver's head; much of the rudeness is by innuendo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It also often includes references to the content of the rest of the magazine, or its jargon in which, for example, the current monarch of the UK is \"Brenda\" and the likely next one \"Prince Brian\".  The \u00a3100 prize for the first correct solution opened is unusually high for a crossword and attracts many entrants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n;''The Radio Times''\n:Roger Prebble has compiled the cryptic crossword since 1999.\n\n;''Significance''\n:[[Significance (magazine)|''Significance'']] is a joint publication between the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society; it contains a cryptic crossword in its puzzle section.  The magazine offers a randomly awarded $150 or \u00a3100 to spend on [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] books for those that submit a correct entry.\n\n;''The Spectator''\n:Cryptics in the weekly ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' often have a specific theme, such as a tribute to a public figure who has died recently or a historic event that has its anniversary this week. As in most British periodicals, the cryptic in the ''Spectator'' is numbered: in the ''Spectator'''s case, a puzzle's theme may be related to its specific number (such as a historic event that occurred in the year corresponding to the four-digit number of the puzzle for that week). Compilers include Doc (the puzzle editor as well as chief setter), Dumpynose (an anagram for 'Pseudonym') and Columba.\n\n;''The Sunday Times''\n:''[[The Sunday Times]]'' cryptic crossword is compiled in rotation by three setters: Jeff Pearce, Dean Mayer and David McLean, the latter taking over from Tim Moorey in January 2016. (Mr Moorey's final puzzle included the hidden message 'Farewell from Tim'; he continues to set Mephisto puzzles.) The position of puzzles editor is now held by Peter Biddlecombe. Until her retirement in December 2010, Barbara Hall was puzzles editor for 32 years, and wrote about half the paper's cryptic crosswords. The ''Sunday Times'' is also home to the difficult barred-grid Mephisto puzzle, currently set in rotation by Don Manley, Paul McKenna and Tim Moorey.

(The ''Times'' was a relatively late adopter: the ''Telegraph'' crossword started in 1925, and the ''Guardian'' in 1929.) The ''Times'' has a team of about 15 setters, many of whom set puzzles for other papers.  The setter of each puzzle is not identified.  The ''Times'' also has \"jumbo\" (23&times;23) puzzles in the Saturday edition and since 1991 has provided a home for the famously difficult advanced cryptic puzzle which used to appear in the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''.\n\n:The daily ''Times'' puzzle is syndicated in the ''New York Post'' (US) and ''The Australian'' (Aus) papers.  In both cases, the puzzle appears some weeks after it appeared in ''The Times''.\n\n:In October 2007, [[The Bugle]]&mdash;a TimesOnline podcast by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and [[Andy Zaltzman]]&mdash;introduced the first, revolutionary \"Audio Cryptic Crossword.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-bugle-audio-crossword-dxkd8bfspwk |title= The Bugle Audio Crossword|publisher=The Times UK}}</ref>\n\n;''Viz'' magazine\n:Since 2009 the adult comic magazine ''Viz'' has incorporated a cryptic crossword credited to Anus. This is a collaboration of two setters, one of whom has a minor role in supplying some pre-written clues. In keeping with the comic's \"top shelf\" status the puzzle content is an amalgam of humour and obscenity, although the clueing style retains both Libertarian and Ximenean disciplines.\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n;''The Age'' (Australia)\n:(see ''Sydney Morning Herald'')\n\n;''The Atlantic'' (US)\n:''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine had a long-running variety cryptic crossword, known as the Puzzler, created by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon beginning in 1977,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/acrostic/|title= Acrostic Creators|author= Horne, Jim|date= 8 November 2008|work= Wordplay: The Crossword Blog of The New York Times|publisher= [[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2009 }}</ref> available only online since March 2006.

Some other puzzles in the publication include cryptic elements, such as double definition puzzles or hidden word puzzles.\n\n;''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada)\n:\"Canada's national newspaper\" includes a daily cryptic somewhat less difficult than its British cousins.  The crossword also comes with another set of \"Quick Clues\" (American-style) which provide a completely different set of answers. Fraser Simpson compiles the Saturday cryptic; he also used to compile an advanced cryptic in ''The Walrus''.  Once a year on [[Canada Day]], ''The Globe'' published a large 24\u00d724 bar-diagram cryptic, but as of 2015 it no longer does.\n:\n\n'''''The Geraldine News (New Zealand)'''''\n\nThis weekly local paper carries a cryptic once a month.

The paper continued to run his puzzles after his death in April 2010. The last of Crozier's crosswords was published in the ''Irish Times'' on 22 October 2011.

Christine Lovatt is the main cryptic compiler, and she has been so for 30 years.\n\n;''The Nation'' (US)\n:This liberal American political weekly has featured a weekly cryptic puzzle since 1947. [[Frank W. Lewis]] wrote the puzzle from late 1947 until his retirement in late 2009.

Cryptic crosswords are particularly popular in the [[United Kingdom]], where they originated,<ref name=Eliot_Brief>{{cite web|last1=Eliot |first1=George |title=Brief History of Crossword Puzzles |url=https://www.crosswordtournament.com/more/wynne.html |publisher=American Crossword Puzzle Tournament}}</ref> [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], and in several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malta]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. In the [[United States]], cryptics are sometimes known as \"British-style\" crosswords. Compilers of cryptic crosswords are commonly called \"setters\" in the [[UK]].\n\nCryptic crossword puzzles come in two main types:  the basic cryptic in which each clue answer is entered into the diagram normally, and \"themed\" or \"variety\" cryptics, in which some or all of the answers must be altered before entering, usually in accordance with a hidden pattern or rule which must be discovered by the solver.\n\n== History and development ==\nCryptic crosswords originated in the UK.  The first British crossword puzzles appeared around 1923 and were purely definitional, but from the mid-1920s they began to include cryptic material: not cryptic clues in the modern sense, but anagrams, classical allusions, incomplete quotations, and other references and wordplay. [[Torquemada (crossword compiler)|Torquemada]] (Edward Powys Mathers), who set for ''The Saturday Westminster'' from 1925 and for ''[[The Observer]]'' from 1926 until his death in 1939, was the first setter to use cryptic clues exclusively and is often credited as the inventor of the cryptic crossword.<ref name=mathers_strange>{{cite web|last1=Millington|first1=Roger|title=The Strange World of the Crossword (excerpt)|url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/mathers.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe first newspaper crosswords appeared in the ''Sunday'' and ''[[Daily Express]]'' from about 1924. Crosswords were gradually taken up by other newspapers, appearing in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1925, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' from 1929 and ''[[The Times]]'' from 1930.  These newspaper puzzles were almost entirely non-cryptic at first and gradually used more cryptic clues, until the fully cryptic puzzle as known today became widespread.  In some papers this took until about 1960.\n\nPuzzles appeared in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' from 1930, but this was a weekly magazine rather than a newspaper, and the puzzles were much harder than the newspaper ones, though again they took a while to become entirely cryptic.\n\nTorquemada's puzzles were extremely obscure and difficult, and later setters reacted against this tendency by developing a standard for fair clues, ones that can be solved, at least in principle, by deduction, without needing leaps of faith or insights into the setter's thought processes.\n\nThe basic principle of fairness was set out by ''Listener'' setter '''Afrit''' ([[Alistair Ferguson Ritchie]]) in his book ''Armchair Crosswords'' (1946), wherein he credits it to the fictional ''Book of the Crossword'':\n\n:We must expect the composer to play tricks, but we shall insist that he play fair. The Book of the Crossword lays this injunction upon him: \"You need not mean what you say, but you must say what you mean.\" This is a superior way of saying that he can't have it both ways. He may attempt to mislead by employing a form of words which can be taken in more than one way, and it is your fault if you take it the wrong way, but it is his fault if you can't logically take it the right way.\n\nAn example of a clue which cannot logically be taken the right way:\n:''Hat could be dry (5)''\n\nHere the composer intends the answer to be \"derby\", with \"hat\" the definition, \"could be\" the anagram indicator, and \"be dry\" the anagram fodder. I.e., \"derby\" is an anagram of \"be dry\". But \"be\" is doing double duty, and this means that any attempt to read the clue cryptically in the form \"[definition] [anagram indicator] [fodder]\" fails: if \"be\" is part of the anagram indicator, then the fodder is too short, but if it is part of the fodder, there is no anagram indicator; to be a correct clue it would have to be \"Hat could '''be be''' dry (5)\", which is ungrammatical. A variation might read ''Hat turns out to be dry (5)'', but this also fails because the word \"to\", which is necessary to make the sentence grammatical, follows the indicator (\"turns out\") even though it is not part of the anagram indicated.\n\nTorquemada's successor at ''The Observer'' was '''Ximenes''' ([[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]], 1902\u20131971), and in his influential work, ''Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword Puzzle'' (1966), he set out more detailed guidelines for setting fair cryptic clues, now known as \"Ximenean principles\" and sometimes described by the word \"square-dealing\".<ref>Reissued Aug 2001: Swallowtail Books {{ISBN|1-903400-04-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-903400-04-3}}</ref> The most important of them are tersely summed up by Ximenes' successor '''[[Azed]]''' ([[Jonathan Crowther]], born 1942):\n\n:A good cryptic clue contains three elements:\n:# a precise definition\n:# a fair subsidiary indication\n:# nothing else\n\nThe Ximenean principles are adhered to most strictly in the subgenre of \"advanced cryptics\" \u2014 difficult puzzles using barred grids and a large vocabulary. Easier puzzles often have more relaxed standards, permitting a wider array of clue types, and allowing a little flexibility. The popular ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' setter '''Araucaria''' ([[John Galbraith Graham]], 1921&ndash;2013) was a noted non-Ximenean, celebrated for his witty, if occasionally unorthodox, clues.\n\n== Popularity ==\nMost of the major national [[newspaper]]s in the UK carry both cryptic and concise (quick) crosswords in every issue. The puzzle in ''[[The Guardian]]'' is well loved for its humour and quirkiness, and quite often includes puzzles with themes, which are extremely rare in ''The Times''.<ref>How to master the Times Crossword, Tim Moorey, p. 186</ref>\n\nMany Canadian newspapers, including the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', ''[[Toronto Star]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', carry cryptic crosswords.\n\nCryptic crosswords do not commonly appear in U.S. publications, although they can be found in magazines such as ''[[GAMES Magazine]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[Harper's]]'', and occasionally in the Sunday ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''[[New York Post]]'' reprints cryptic crosswords from ''The Times''. In April 2018, [[The New Yorker]] published the first of a new weekly series of cryptic puzzles.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Remnick |first1=David |authorlink1=David Remnick |title=Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle |url=https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/introducing-the-new-yorker-crossword-puzzle |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> Other sources of cryptic crosswords in the U.S. (at various difficulty levels) are puzzle books, as well as UK and Canadian newspapers distributed in the U.S. Other venues include the ''Enigma'', the magazine of the [[National Puzzlers' League]], and formerly, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. The latter puzzle, after a long and distinguished run, appeared solely on ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s website for several years, and ended with the October 2009 issue.  A similar puzzle by the same authors now appears monthly in ''[https://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/ The Wall Street Journal]''.\n\nCryptic crosswords are very popular in Australia. Most Australian newspapers will have at least one cryptic crossword, if not two. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'' in [[Melbourne]] publish daily cryptic crosswords, including Friday's challenging cryptic by 'DA' ([[David Astle]]). \"Lovatts\", an Australian puzzle publisher, regularly issues cryptic crossword puzzle books.\n\n== How cryptic clues work ==\nIn essence, a cryptic clue leads to its answer as long as it is read in the right way. What the clue appears to say when read normally (the ''surface reading'') is a distraction and usually has nothing to do with the clue answer.  The challenge is to find the way of reading the clue that leads to the solution.\n\nA typical clue consists of two parts, the definition and the wordplay. It provides two ways of getting to the answer. The definition, which usually exactly matches the [[part of speech]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], and [[grammatical number|number]] of the answer, is in essence the same as any 'straight' crossword clue, a synonym for the answer. It usually appears at the start or the end of a clue.\n\nThe other part (the ''subsidiary indication'', or ''wordplay'') provides an alternative route to the answer (this part would be a second definition in the case of double definition clues). One of the tasks of the solver is to find the boundary between definition and wordplay and insert a mental pause there when reading the clue ''cryptically''. This wordplay gives the solver some instructions on how to get to the answer another way. (Sometimes the two parts are joined with a link word or phrase such as \"from\", \"gives\" or \"could be\".)\n\nThere are many sorts of wordplay, such as anagrams and double definitions, but they all conform to rules. The crossword setters do their best to stick to these rules when writing their clues, and solvers can use these rules and conventions to help them solve the clues. Noted cryptic setter [[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]] (who wrote cryptics under the pseudonym of Ximenes) discusses the importance and art of fair cluemanship in his seminal book on cryptic crosswords, ''Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword'' (1966, reprinted 2001).<ref>{{cite book |last=Macnutt |first=Derrick |title=Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword  |year=2001 |publisher=Swallowtail Books |location=London |isbn=1-903400-04-X |pages=42\u201353}}</ref>\n\nBecause a typical cryptic clue describes its answer in detail and often more than once, the solver can usually have a great deal of confidence in the answer once it has been determined. The clues are 'self-checking'. This is in contrast to non-cryptic crossword clues which often have several possible answers and force the solver to use the crossing letters to distinguish which was intended.\n\nHere is an example (taken from ''[[The Guardian]]'' crossword of 6 August 2002, set by \"Shed\").\n\n:15D ''Very sad unfinished story about rising smoke (8)''\n\nis a clue for <small>TRAGICAL</small>.  This breaks down as follows.\n*15D indicates the location and direction (down) of the solution in the grid\n*\"Very sad\" is the definition\n*\"unfinished story\" gives \"tal\" (\"tale\" with one letter missing; i.e., unfinished)\n*\"rising smoke\" gives \"ragic\" (a \"cigar\" is a smoke and this is a down clue so \"rising\" indicates that \"cigar\" should be written up the page; i.e., backwards)\n*\"about\" means that the letters of \"tal\" should be put either side of \"ragic\", giving \"tragical\"\n*\"(8)\" says that the answer is a single word of eight letters.\n\nThere are many \"code words\" or \"indicators\" that have a special meaning in the cryptic crossword context. (In the example above, \"about\", \"unfinished\" and \"rising\" all fall into this category). Learning these, or being able to spot them, is a useful and necessary part of becoming a skilled cryptic crossword solver.\n\n[[#Compilers|Compilers]] or setters often use slang terms and abbreviations, generally without indication, so familiarity with these is important for the solver. Abbreviations may be as simple as 'west' = W, 'New York' = NY, but may also be more difficult.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://crossword365.com/pages/cryptic-abbreviations |title=Cryptic crossword abbreviations |accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> Words that can mean more than one thing are commonly exploited; often the meaning the solver must use is completely different from the one it appears to have in the clue. Some examples are:\n\n* Bloomer - often means flower (a thing that blooms).\n* Flower - often means river (a thing that flows).\n* Lead - could be the metal, an electric cable, or the verb.\n* Nice - if capitalized as the first word, could either be \"amiable\" or the French city.  Thus \"Nice friend\" often means the letters ''ami''.\n* Novel - could be a book, or a word for new, or a code-word indicating an anagram.\n* Permit - could be a noun (meaning license) or a verb (meaning allow).\n\nOf these examples, \"flower\" is an invented meaning by back-formation from the -er suffix, which cannot be confirmed in a standard dictionary.  A similar trick is played in the old clue \"A wicked thing\" for CANDLE, where the -ed suffix must be understood in its \"equipped with a ...\" meaning.  In the case of the -er suffix, this trick could be played with other meanings of the suffix, but except for river \u2192 BANKER (a river is not a 'thing that banks' but a 'thing that has banks'), this is rarely done.\n\nSometimes \"compiler\", or the name or codename of the compiler (if visible by the crossword), codes for some form of the pronoun \"I, me, my, mine\".\n\nIn the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' back page, Monday 15 March 2017, 7 down, is \"Banish spirits with zero ice upsetting imbibing times (8)\"; the answer is <small>EXORCIZE</small>: it means \"banish spirits\", and is \"zero ice\" rearranged, including 'x' (described as \"times\").\n\n== Grids for cryptic crosswords ==\n[[File:British crossword.svg|thumb|A lattice-style grid common for cryptic crosswords]]\n\nA typical cryptic crossword grid is generally 15\u00d715, with half-turn [[rotational symmetry]].  Unlike typical American [[crosswords]], in which every square is almost always ''checked'' (that is, each square provides a letter for both an across and a down answer), only about half of the squares in a cryptic crossword are checked.\n\nIn most daily newspaper cryptic crosswords, grid designs are restricted to a set of stock grids.  In the past this was because [[hot metal typesetting]] meant that new grids were expensive.<ref>{{cite news\n|last=Tossman\n|first=David\n|title=Crossword 847 answers and explanations\n|date=23 November 2013\n|url=https://www.listener.co.nz/entertainment/cryptic-crosswords/crossword-847-answers-and-explanations/\n|newspaper=[[New Zealand Listener]]\n}}</ref>\n\nSome papers have additional grid rules. In ''[[The Times]]'', for example, all words have at least half the letters checked, and although words can have two unchecked squares in succession, they cannot be the first two or last two letters of a word.  The grid shown here breaks one ''Times'' grid rule: the 15-letter words at 9 and 24 across each have 8 letters unchecked out of 15.  ''[[The Independent]]'' allows setters to use their own grid designs.\n\nVariety (UK: \"advanced\") cryptic crosswords typically use a \"barred grid\" with no black squares and a slightly smaller size; 12&times;12 is typical. Word boundaries are denoted by thick lines called \"bars\".  In these variety puzzles, one or more clues may require modification to fit into the grid, such as dropping or adding a letter, or being anagrammed to fit other, unmodified clues; unclued spaces may spell out a secret message appropriate for the puzzle theme once the puzzle is fully solved.  The solver also may need to determine where answers fit into the grid.\n\nA July 2006 \"Puzzlecraft\" section in [[Games Magazine|''Games'' magazine]] on cryptic crossword construction noted that for cryptic crosswords to be readily solvable, no fewer than half the letters for every word should be checked by another word for a standard cryptic crossword, while nearly every letter should be checked for a variety cryptic crossword.  In most UK \"advanced cryptics\" ('variety cryptic'), at least three-quarters of the letters in each word are checked.\n\n== Regional variation ==\n\n=== British and North American differences ===\nThere are notable differences between British and North American (including Canadian) cryptics. American cryptics are thought of as holding to a more rigid set of construction rules than British ones. American cryptics usually require all words in a clue to be used in service of the wordplay or definition, whereas British ones allow for more extraneous or supporting words. In American cryptics, a clue is only allowed to have one subsidiary indication, but in British cryptics the occasional clue may have more than one; e.g., a ''triple definition'' clue would be considered an amusing variation in the UK but unsound in the US.\n\n=== Other languages ===\nFor the most part, cryptic crosswords are an [[English-language]] phenomenon, although similar puzzles are popular in a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] form in [[Israel]] (where they are called ''tashbetsey higayon'' (\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05e6\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df) \"Logic crosswords\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zuckermann.org/cryptic.html|title=One of Dr Ghil`ad Zuckermann's Cryptic Crosswords|publisher=}}</ref> and (as ''Cryptogram'')  in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. In Poland similar crosswords are called \"[[Hetman]] crosswords\". 'Hetman', a senior commander, and also the name for a [[queen (chess)|queen]] in [[Chess]], emphasises their importance over other crosswords. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], this type of crossword puzzle is known as ''piilosana'' (literally \"hidden word\"), while ''krypto'' refers to a crossword puzzle where the letters have been coded as numbers. The [[Germany|German]] ''ZEITmagazin'' has a weekly cryptic crossword called ''Um die Ecke gedacht'' and the ''SZ Magazin'' features ''das Kreuz mit den Worten''.\n\nIn India the [[Telugu Language|Telugu]] publication [[Sakshi (newspaper)|Sakshi]] carries a \"Tenglish\" (Telugu-English, bilingual) cryptic crossword;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/09/how-kishore-solved-tenglish-crossword.html|title=Tenglish crossword|publisher=Crossword Unclued, 29 September 2012.}}</ref> the [[Prajavani]] and [[Vijaya Karnataka]] crossword ([[Kannada Language|Kannada]]) also employs cryptic wordplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/08/kannada-crosswords.html|title=Kannada crosswords: Prajavani, Udayavani, Kannada Prabha|publisher=Crossword Unclued, 22 August 2012.}}</ref> Enthusiasts have also created cryptic crosswords in Hindi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2014/08/prize-hindi-puzzle-winner.html|title=Prize Hindi Puzzle: Here's Our Winner|publisher=}}</ref> Since 1994, ''enigmista'' [[w:it:Ennio Peres|Ennio Peres]] has challenged Italians annually with ''[http://www.parole.tv/xw/cruciperes.asp Il cruciverba pi\u00f9 difficile del mondo]'' (The World's Most Difficult Crossword), which has many features in common with English-style cryptics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/07/22/il-cruciverba-piu-difficile-del-mondo/1893519/|title=Il cruciverba pi\u00f9 difficile del mondo|author=Dario De Toffoli|work=Il Fatto Quotidiano}}</ref>\n\nIn Chinese something similar is the [[riddle]] of Chinese characters, where partial characters instead of substrings are clued and combined.\n\n== Types of cryptic clues ==\nClues given to the solver are based on various forms of wordplay.  Nearly every clue has two non-overlapping parts to it: one part that provides an unmodified but often indirect definition for the word or phrase, and a second part that includes the wordplay involved.  In a few cases, the two definitions are one and the same, as often in the case of [[#\"& lit.\"|\"& lit.\"]] clues.  Most cryptic crosswords provide the number of letters in the answer, or in the case of phrases, a series of numbers to denote the letters in each word: \"cryptic crossword\" would be clued with \"(7,9)\" following the clue.  More advanced puzzles may drop this portion of the clue.\n\n=== Anagrams ===\n[[File:Animation for the anagram CORSET = ESCORT.gif|thumb|Animation for the anagram CORSET = ESCORT]]\nAn [[anagram]] is a rearrangement of a certain section of the clue to form the answer. This is usually indicated by words such as \"strange\", \"bizarre\", \"muddled\", \"wild\", \"drunk\", or any other term indicating change. One example:\n\n:''Chaperone shredded corset (6)''\n\ngives <small>ESCORT</small>, which means ''chaperone'' and is an anagram of ''corset'', indicated by the word ''shredded''.\n\nAnagram clues are characterized by an indicator word adjacent to a phrase that has the same number of letters as the answer. The indicator tells the solver that there is an [[anagram]] they need to solve to work out the answer. Indicators come either before or after the letters to be anagrammed. In an American cryptic, only the words given in the clue may be anagrammed; in some older puzzles, the words to be anagrammed may be clued and ''then'' anagrammed. So in this clue:\n\n:''Chew honeydew fruit (5)''\n\n''Chew'' is the anagram indicator; ''honeydew'' clues ''melon'', which is to be anagrammed; and ''fruit'' is the definition for the answer, <small>LEMON</small>.  This kind of clue is called an ''indirect anagram'', which in the vast majority of cryptic crosswords are not used, ever since they were criticised by 'Ximenes' in his 1966 book ''On the Art of the Crossword''.  Minor exception: simple abbreviations may be used to spice up the process; e.g., \"Husband, a most eccentric fellow\" (6) for THOMAS, where the anagram is made from A, MOST, and H = husband.\n\nAnagram indicators, among the thousands possible, include: about, abstract, absurd, adapted, adjusted, again, alien, alternative, anew, another, around, arranged, assembled, assorted, at sea, awful, awkward, bad, barmy, becomes, blend, blow, break, brew, build, careless, changed, chaotic, characters, clumsy, composed, confused, contrived, convert, cooked, corrupt, could be, crazy, damaged, dancing, designed, develop, different, disorderly, disturbed, doctor, eccentric, edited, engineer, fabricate, fake, fancy, faulty, fiddled, fix, foolish, form, free, fudge, gives, ground, hammer, haywire, hybrid, improper, in a tizzy, involved, irregular, jostle, jumbled, jumping, kind of, knead, letters, loose, made, managed, maybe, messy, mistaken, mix, modified, moving, muddled, mutant, new, novel, odd, off, order, organised, otherwise, out, outrageous, peculiar, perhaps, playing, poor, possible, prepared, produced, queer, questionable, random, reform, remodel, repair, resort, rough, shaken, shifting, silly, sloppy, smashed, somehow, sort, spoilt, strange, style, switch, tangled, treated, tricky, troubled, turning, twist, unconventional, undone, unsettled, unsound, untidy, unusual, upset, used, vary, version, warped, wayward, weird, wild, working, wrecked, wrong.\n\nIt is common for the setter to use a juxtaposition of anagram indicator and anagram that form a common phrase to make the clue appear as much like a 'normal' sentence or phrase as possible.  For example:\n\n:''Lap dancing friend (3)''\n\nuses ''dancing'' as the indicator as it fits cohesively with ''lap'' to give the solution, <small>PAL</small>.\n\n=== Charade ===\nHere, the answer is formed by joining individually clued words to make a larger word (namely, the answer).\n\nFor example:\n\n:''Outlaw leader managing money (7)''\n\nThe answer is <small>BANKING</small> formed by <small>BAN</small> for \"outlaw\" and <small>KING</small> for \"leader\". The definition is \"managing money\". With this example, the words appear in the same order in the clue as they do in the answer, and no special words are needed to indicate this. However, the order of the parts is sometimes indicated with words such as \"against\", \"after\", \"on\", \"with\" or \"above\" (in a down clue).\n\n=== Containers ===\nA container clue puts one set of letters inside another. So:\n\n:''Apostle's friend outside of university (4)''\n\ngives <small>PAUL</small> (\"apostle\"), by placing \"pal\" (\"friend\") outside of \"U\" (\"university\"); the \"'s\" could be treated as the [[genitive]] case suffix or as short for \"is\".\n\nA similar example:\n\n:''Utter nothing when there's wickedness about (5)''\n\nThe answer is <small>VOICE</small> (\"utter\"), formed by placing \"O\" (\"nothing\") inside the word \"vice\" (\"wickedness\").\n\nOther container indicators are \"inside\", \"over\", \"around\", \"about\", \"clutching\", \"enters\", and the like.\n\n=== Deletions ===\nDeletions consist of ''beheadments'', ''curtailments'', and ''internal deletions''.  In beheadments, a word loses its first letter.  In curtailments, it loses its last letter, and internal deletions remove an inner letter, such as the middle one.\n\nAn example of a beheadment:\n\n:''Beheaded celebrity is sailor (3)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>TAR</small>, another word for \"sailor\", which is a \"celebrity\", or star, without the first letter.\n\nOther indicator words of beheadment include \"don't start\", \"topless\", and \"after the first\".\n\nAn example of curtailment:\n\n:''Shout, \"Read!\" endlessly (3)''\n\nThe answer is <small>BOO</small>.  If you ignore the punctuation, a book is a \"read\", and book \"endlessly\" is ''boo'', a \"shout\".\n\nOther indicators include \"nearly\" and \"unfinished\".\n\nAn example of internal deletion:\n\n:''Challenging sweetheart heartlessly (6)''\n\nThe answer is <small>DARING</small>, which means \"challenging\", and is darling without its middle letter, or \"heartlessly\".\n\nNote that \"sweetheart\" could also be simply \"wee\" or the letter \"E\", that is, the \"heart\" (middle) of \"sweet\".\n\n=== Double definition ===\nA clue may, rather than having a definition part and a wordplay part, have two definition parts. Thus:\n\n: ''Not seeing window covering (5)''\n\nwould have the answer <small>BLIND</small>, because ''blind'' can mean both \"not seeing\" and \"window covering\". Note that since these definitions come from the same root word, an American magazine might not allow this clue. American double definitions tend to require both parts to come from different roots, as in this clue:\n\n: ''Eastern European buff (6)''\n\nThis takes advantage of the two very different meanings (and pronunciations) of <small>POLISH</small>, the one with the long \"o\" sound meaning \"someone from Poland\" and the one with the short \"o\" sound meaning \"make shiny\".\n\nThese clues tend to be short; in particular, two-word clues are almost always double-definition clues.\n\nIn the UK, multiple definitions are occasionally used; e.g.:\n\n: ''Blue swallow feathers fell from above (4)''\n\nis a quintuple definition of <small>DOWN</small> (\"blue\" (sad), \"swallow\" (drink), \"feathers\" (plumage), \"fell\" (cut down) and \"from above\"),<ref>Arachne (30 January 2014), [https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26170 Cryptic crossword No 26,170], ''The Guardian''</ref> but in the US this would be considered unsound.\n\nSome British newspapers have an affection for quirky clues of this kind where the two definitions are similar:\n\n: ''Let in or let on (5)'' \u2013 <small>ADMIT</small>\n\nNote that these clues do not have clear indicator words.\n\n=== Hidden words ===\nWhen the answer appears in the clue but is contained within one or more words, it is hidden.  For example:\n\n:''Found ermine, deer hides damaged (10)''\n\ngives <small>UNDERMINED</small>, which means (cryptically at least) \"damaged\" and can be found as part of \"Fo'''und ermine d'''eer\". The word \"hides\" is used to mean \"contains,\" but in the surface sense suggests \"pelts\". A complication is that \"damaged\" often (but not in this clue) means \"rearrange the letters\".\n\nPossible indicators of a hidden clue are \"in part\", \"partially\", \"in\", \"within\", \"hides\", \"conceals\", \"some\", and \"held by\".\n\nAnother example:\n\n:''Introduction to do-gooder canine (3)''\n\ngives <small>DOG</small>, which is the first part of, or \"introduction to\", the word \"do-gooder\", and means \"canine\".\nHidden words clues are sometimes called \"Embedded words\" or \"Telescopic clues\". The opposite of a hidden word clue, where letters ''missing'' from a sentence have to be found, is known as a [[Printer's Devilry]], and appears in some advanced cryptics.\n\nThere are several common techniques used in Hidden Word clues.\n\n==== Initial letters ====\nThe first letters of part of the clue are put together to give the answer.\n\nAn example of an initialism:\n\n:''Initially amiable person eats primate (3)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>APE</small>, which is a type of primate. \"Initially\" signals that you must take the first letters of \"'''a'''miable '''p'''erson '''e'''ats\" \u2013 \"ape\".\n\nAnother example would be:\n\n:''At first, actor needing new identity emulates orphan in musical theatre (5)''\n\nThe answer would be [[Annie (musical)|<small>ANNIE</small>]], the name of a famous orphan in musical theatre. This is obtained from the first letters of \"actor needing new identity emulates\".\n\nWords that indicate initialisms also include \"firstly\" and \"to start\".\n\nIt is possible to have initialisms just for certain parts of the clue.  It is also possible to employ the same technique to the end of words. For example:\n\n:''Old country lady went round Head Office initially before end of day (7)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>DAHOMEY</small>, which used to be a kingdom in Africa (an \"old country\"). Here, we take the first letters of only the words \"Head Office\" (ho) and we take the \"end\" of the word \"day\" (y). The letters of the word \"dame\", meaning \"lady\", are then made to go around the letters \"ho\" to form Dahomey.\n\n==== Odd/even letters ====\nEither the odd or even letters of words in the clue give the answer. An example is:\n\n:''Odd stuff of Mr. Waugh is set for someone wanting women to vote (10)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>SUFFRAGIST</small>, which is \"someone wanting women to vote\". The word \"odd\" indicates that we must take every other letter of the rest of the clue, starting with the first: StUfF oF mR wAuGh Is SeT.\n\n=== Homophones ===\n[[Homophone]]s are words that sound the same but have different meanings, such as \"night\" and \"knight\".  Homophone clues always have an indicator word or phrase that has to do with phonetics, such as \"reportedly\", \"they say\", \"utterly\" (here treated as \"utter(ing)-ly\" and not with its usual meaning), \"vocal\", \"to the audience\", \"auditioned\", \"by the sound of it\", \"is heard\", \"in conversation\" and \"on the radio\". \"Broadcast\" is a particularly devious indicator as it could indicate either a homophone or an anagram.\n\nAn example of a homophone clue is\n\n:''We hear twins shave (4)''\n\nwhich is a clue for <small>PARE</small>, which means \"shave\" and is a homophone of pair, or \"twins\".  The homophone is indicated by \"we hear\".\n\nIf the two words are the same length, the clue should be phrased in such a way that only one of them can be the answer. This is usually done by having the homophone indicator adjacent to the word that is not the definition; therefore, in the previous example, \"we hear\" was adjacent to \"twins\" and the answer was ''pare'' rather than ''pair''. The indicator could come between the words if they were of different lengths and the enumeration was given, such as in the case of \"right\" and \"rite\".\n\n=== Letter Banks ===\nThe letter bank form of cluing consists of a shorter word (or words) containing no repeated letters (an \"isogram\"), and a longer word or phrase built by using each of these letters (but no others) at least once but repeating them as often as necessary. This type of clue has been described by American constructors Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto, who write the weekly puzzle for The Nation. The shorter word is typically at least three or four letters in length, while the target word or phrase is at least three letters longer than the bank word. For example, the four letters in the word TENS can be used as a bank to form the word TENNESSEE. Typically, the clue contains indicator words such as \"use,\" \"take,\" or \"implement\" to signal that a letter bank is being employed.\n\nA more complicated example of a letter bank is:\n\n: ''Composer taking and retaking ingredients of Advil? Not! (7,7)''\n\nIn this case, \"ingredients\" signals that the letters of both \"Advil\" and \"Not\" form the bank. Those letters yield the answer, ANTONIO VIVALDI. \n\nKosman and Picciotto consider this to be a newer and more complicated form of cluing that offers another way, besides the anagram, of mixing and recombining letters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/going-bank/|title=Going to the Bank {{!}} The Nation|last=Picciotto|first=Joshua Kosman and Henri|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>\n\n=== Reversals ===\nA word that gets turned around to make another is a reversal. For example:\n\n:''Returned beer fit for a king (5)''\n\nThe answer is <small>REGAL</small>. \"Lager\" (i.e., \"beer\") is \"returned\" to make ''regal,'' i.e. fit for a king.\n\nOther indicator words include \"receding\", \"in the mirror\", \"going the wrong way\", \"returns\", \"reverses\" \"to the left\" or \"left\" (for across clues), and \"rising\", \"overturned\" or \"mounted\" or \"comes up\" (for down clues).\n\n=== Cryptic definition ===\nHere the clue appears to say one thing, but with a slight shift of viewpoint it says another.  For example:\n\n:''Flower of London?'' (6)\n\ngives <small>THAMES</small>, a flow-er of London.  Here, the surface reading suggests a blossom, which disguises the fact that the name of a river is required. Notice the question mark: this is often (though by no means always) used by compilers to indicate this sort of clue is one where you need to interpret the words in a different fashion.  The way that a clue reads as an ordinary sentence is called its ''surface reading'' and is often used to disguise the need for a different interpretation of the clue's component words.\n\nThis type of clue is common in British and Canadian cryptics but is a bit less common in American cryptics; in American-style crosswords, a clue like this is generally called a punny clue. It's almost certainly the oldest kind of cryptic clue: cryptic definitions appeared in the UK newspaper puzzles in the late 1920s and early 1930s that mixed cryptic and plain definition clues and evolved into fully cryptic crosswords.\n\n=== Spoonerism ===\nA relatively uncommon clue type, a [[Spoonerism]] is a play on words where corresponding [[consonant cluster]]s are switched between two words in a phrase (or syllables in a word) and the switch forms another pair of proper ''sounding'' words. For example: \"butterfly\" = \"flutter by\".\n\nBoth the solution word or phrase and its corresponding Spoonerism are clued for, and the clue type is almost always indicated by reference to Spooner himself \u2013 with some regions/publications insisting his religious title \"Rev.\" or \"Reverend\" be included. In contrast to all other clue types, this makes them almost impossible to disguise. But that doesn't necessarily make them easy.\n\nAn example of a Spoonerism clue is:\n\n:''He will casually put down Spooner's angry bear (9)''\n\nThe answer is <small>LITTERBUG</small> (''He will casually put down''). The Spoonerism is \"bitter\" (''angry'') and \"lug\" (''bear, as in carry'').\n\nThe vast majority of Spoonerism clues swap the first consonants of words or syllables, but Spoonerisms are not strictly restricted to that form and some setters will take advantage of this. John Henderson (Enigmatist in the [[The Guardian|Guardian]]) once clued for the Spoonerism \"light crick\" from \"right click\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=John|title=(Enigmatist)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25930|work=Cryptic crossword No 25,930|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=London|date=24 April 2013}}</ref> which didn't sit well with many solvers.\n\n=== \"&lit.\" ===\nAn \"&lit.\" or \"Literal\" clue is not a clue type, but, rather a variant on an existing clue. \"&lit\" stands for \"and literally so\". In this case, the entire clue is both a definition and a cryptic clue. In some publications &lit clues are indicated by an [[exclamation mark]] at the end of the clue.  For example:\n\n:''God incarnate, essentially! (4)''\n\nThe answer is <small>ODIN</small>. The Norse god [[Odin]] is hidden in \"g'''od in'''carnate\", as clued by \"essentially\", but the definition of Odin is also the whole clue, as Odin is essentially a God incarnate.\n\nThis satisfies the \"& lit.\" clue definition but as read is clearly a cryptic clue.  Another example:\n\n:''Spoil vote! (4)''\n\nwould give the answer <small>VETO</small>; in the cryptic sense, ''spoil'' works as an [[anagram]] indicator for ''vote'', while the whole clue is, with a certain amount of licence allowed to crossword setters, a definition.\n\nAnother example:\n\n:''e.g., Origin of goose (3)''\n\ngives the answer <small>EGG</small>. Geese find their origins in eggs, so the whole clue gives \"egg\", but the clue can also be broken down: e.g., loses its full stops to give ''eg'', followed by the first letter (i.e., the \"origin\") of the word goose\u2014''g''\u2014to make ''egg''.\n\n''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Tuesday 22 April 2014 has: \"Dog in wild? Yes! (5)\"; the answer is <small>[[dingo|DINGO]]</small>. \"Dog in wild\" means \"rearrange the letters of \"<small>DOG IN</small>\", '''and''' is the definition.\n\n== Clueing techniques ==\n\n=== Combination clues ===\nIt is very common for a clue to employ more than one method of wordplay.  For example:\n\n:''Illustrious baron returns in pit (9)''\n\nThe answer is <small>HONORABLE</small>.  \"Baron\" \"returns\", or is reversed, and put inside \"pit\" or hole, to make ''honorable'', or \"illustrious\".\n\nIn this example, the clue uses a combination of Reversal and Hidden clue types:\n\n:''Cruel to turn part of Internet torrid (6)''\n\nThe answer to this clue is <small>ROTTEN</small>. The phrase \"to turn\" indicates \"to reverse,\" and \"part of\" suggests a piece of \"Internet torrid\".\n\n=== Misleading clues ===\n\nTo make clues more difficult, cryptic constructors will frequently use traditional indicator words in a misleading manner.\n\n*A cryptic crossword on the back page of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' on 14 March 2012 included the answer <small>ANALYSIS</small>, whose clue was \"Close study of broken '''nails''', '''say''' (8)\": \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is part of an anagram.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' back page, 8 November 2012: \"Drunk compiler's admitted boob (5)\" means \"Means 'drunk', <small>MY</small> contains <small>ERR</small>, has 5 letters\", = <small>MERRY</small>. (\"Drunk\" often mean \"rearrange the letters\", but not this time.)\n* In a crossword by ''[[Araucaria (compiler)|Araucaria]]'', \"Araucaria is\" coded for <small>IAM</small> (= \"I am\") as part of an answer.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 25 February 2014: \"French place in island beset by cold sadly\": \"sadly\" usually means \"damaged\", \"with the letters rearranged\", but here it codes for \"alas\"; <small>I</small> inside <small>C ALAS</small> makes <small>CALAIS</small>, which is a French place.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 32, 3 April 2014: \"Bug starts to '''m'''ove '''i'''n '''d'''ark, '''g'''lowing '''e'''ndlessly (5)\": usually \"endlessly\" and similar mean \"remove the last letter\", but here it is one of five consecutive words to form an [[acronym]] from, as the word \"starts\" shows; the answer is <small>MIDGE</small>.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 18, 1 September 2015: 4 down: \"How one may find Etna to increase danger? (2,3,4)\": the answer (<small>UP THE ANTE</small>) describes how to make the clue word <small>ETNA</small>, which is the reverse of usual.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 27 March 2017: 10 down: \"One might see flow in this game (8)\":  the answer (<small>WILDFOWL</small>) describes how to make the clue word <small>FLOW</small>, which is the reverse of usual; \"game\" is as in sport shooting.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 16, 2 May 2017: 1 across: \"Schoolchild's punishment, devising a cryptic clue for 'crows'? (7,5)\": the answer is <small>HUNDRED LINES</small>: reverse of the usual way to use a Roman number.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 32, 14 November 2017: 28 across: \"Very old diamonds, say (5)\": <small>V O ICE</small>: \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is the definition; the word \"voice\" can be used as a verb.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 34, 22 March 2018: 3 down: \"Trouble from win<u>d is turb</u>ulent\": answer is <small>DISTURB</small>; the word \"turbulent\" suggests forming an anagram, which does not happen here.\n* A clue in the ''Daily Telegraph'' September 2018 started \"Communist leader\", which would be expected to mean the letter C; but this time it was the definition, and the answer was <small>CHE GUEVARA</small>.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 3 June 2019: 20 down: \"Discover the truth about \\ gang fight in New York City\": both parts are definitions of \"[[wikt:rumble|<small>RUMBLE</small>]]\" :: in a British newspaper, although \"rumble\" for \"gang fight\" is American [[street gang]] jargon.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 21 June 2019: 12 across: \"Greek goddess, flanked by banks of [[Tigris]] in ancient city (6)\": The Greek goddess is [[Hebe (mythology)|<small>HEBE</small>]], not one much known of; between the first and last letters of <small>TIGRIS</small>, makes [[Thebes, Greece|<small>THEBES</small>]]; \"ancient city\" usually means [[Ur|<small>UR</small>]], but not here.\n\n=== Clues valid only on particular days or in particular areas ===\n* A cryptic crossword in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' on [[Easter Sunday]] 2014 had an anagram clue whose answer was <small>EASTER SUNDAY</small>, and its definition part was \"today\".\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' on 8 April 2019, page 30: 5 down: \"Parade one month ago (5,4)\": its answer was <small>MARCH PAST</small>; that clue would be valid only in April each year.\n* In a cryptic crossword in the British newspaper ''Daily Telegraph'' (20 April 2017), the clue \"''Irritating proverb we're told (4)'' (<small>SORE</small> = \"[[wikt:saw#Etymology 2|saw]]\") depends on a [[homophony]] which only happens in [[non-rhotic]] pronunciation such as in British English.\n\n== Bits and pieces ==\nAbbreviations are popular with crossword compilers for cluing individual letters or short sections of the answer. Consider this clue:\n\n''About to come between little Desmond and worker for discourse (7)''\n\n:There are two abbreviations used here.  \"About\" is abbreviated \"c\" (for \"circa\"), and \"little Desmond\" indicates that the [[diminutive]] of Desmond (namely, DES) is required.  The \"c\" is \"to come between\" DES and ANT (a worker; note that compilers also use \"worker\" to stand for BEE or HAND), giving [[wikt:descant|DESCANT]], which means \"discourse\".\n\nCompilers use many of these [[crossword abbreviations]].\n\nAnother type of abbreviation in clues might be words that refer to letters. For example, 'you' refers to the letter U, 'why' refers to the letter Y, etc. A clue for instance:\n\n:''For example, why didn't you put the country? (5)''\n\n:The answer is \"<small>EGYPT</small>\". Three abbreviations are used here. \"For example\" is abbreviated to the letters E and G (for \"e.g.\"), \"why\" indicates the letter Y. The phrase \"didn't you put\" is the letters P and T (the word \"you\" refers to U, and word \"didn't\" means that the letter U in \"put\" should be left out, making it PT). Adding those letters together gets \"the country\" - EGYPT.\n\nThere are many ways in which constructors can clue a part of a clue. In this clue:\n\n''Exclamation of surprise about spectacles, from the top (3)''\n\n:The word \"spectacles\" clues OO because these letters look like a pair of spectacles \"from the top\". The answer is thus COO, which is an \"exclamation of surprise\" with C coming from \"circa\", clued by \"about\".\n\nOften, Roman numerals are used to break down words into their component letter groups. E.g. In this clue:\n\n''A team's first supporter is pivotal (4)''\n\n:The answer is AXIS, and the direct meaning is conveyed by the words \"is pivotal\". The first A is followed by \"XI\" which is Roman for 11 (refers to the number of players on the field in a cricket or [[soccer]] team). \"First supporter\" refers to the letter \"S\" which is the first letter of the word \"supporter\".\n\n== Clueing technique and difficulty ==\nCryptic clue styles across newspapers are ostensibly similar, but there are technical differences which result in the work of setters being regarded as either Ximenean or Libertarian (and often a combination of both).\n\nXimenean rules are very precise in terms of grammar and syntax, especially as regards the indicators used for various methods of wordplay. Libertarian setters may use devices which \"more or less\" get the message across. For example, when treating the answer BEER the setter may decide to split the word into BEE and R and, after finding suitable ways to define the answer and BEE, now looks to give the solver a clue to the letter R. Ximenean rules would not allow something like \"reach first\" to indicate that R is the first letter of \"reach\" because, grammatically, that is not what \"reach first\" implies. Instead, a phrase along the lines of \"first to reach\" would be needed as this conforms to rules of grammar. Many Libertarian crossword editors would, however, accept \"reach first\" as it would be considered to reasonably get the idea across. For instance, a clue following Ximenean rules for BEER (BEE + R) may look as such:\n:''Stinger first to reach drink (4)''\nWhile a clue following Libertarian rules may look as follows:\n:''Stinger reaches first drink (4)''\n\n''The Guardian'' is perhaps the most Libertarian of cryptic crosswords, while ''The Times'' is mostly Ximenean. The others tend to be somewhere in between; the ''Financial Times'' and ''Independent'' tend towards Ximenean, the ''Daily Telegraph'' also \u2013 although its Toughie crossword can take a very Libertarian approach depending on the setter.  None of the major daily cryptics in the UK is \"strictly Ximenean\"; all allow clues which are just cryptic definitions, and strict Ximenean rules exclude such clues.  There are other differences like nounal anagram indicators and in current ''Times'' crosswords, unindicated definition by example: \"bay\" in the clue indicating HORSE in the answer, without a qualification like \"bay, perhaps\".\n\nIn terms of difficulty, Libertarian clues can seem impenetrable to inexperienced solvers. However, more significant is the setter him/herself. Crosswords in the ''Times'' and ''Daily Telegraph'' are published anonymously, so the crossword editor ensures that clues adhere to a consistent house style. Inevitably each setter has an individual (and often very recognisable) approach to clue-writing, but the way in which wordplay devices are used and indicated is kept within a defined set of rules.\n\nIn the ''Guardian'', ''Independent'', ''Financial Times'' and ''Telegraph'' Toughie series the setters' pseudonyms are published, so solvers become familiar with the styles of individual setters rather than house rules. Thus the level of difficulty is associated with the setter rather than the newspaper, though puzzles by individual setters can actually vary in difficulty considerably.\n\nIt is effectively impossible, then, to describe one newspaper's crosswords as the toughest or easiest. For newcomers to cryptic puzzles the ''Daily Telegraph'' is often regarded as an ideal starting point, but this is contentious. Since all of the newspapers have different styles, concentrating on one of them is likely to lead to proficiency in only one style of clue-writing; moving to a different series, after perhaps years spent with just one, can leave the solver feeling as if they have gone back to square one. The better technique is to simply attempt as many different crosswords as possible, perhaps to find a \"comfort zone\" but, more importantly, to experience the widest possible range of Ximenean/Libertarian styles.\n\n== Cryptic crosswords in specific publications ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn Britain it is traditional \u2014 dating from the cryptic crossword pioneer [[Edward Powys Mathers|Edward (Bill) Powys Mathers]] (1892\u20131939), who called himself \"Torquemada\" after the Spanish [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisitor]] \u2014 for compilers to use evocative pseudonyms. \"Crispa\", named from the Latin for \"curly-headed\", who set crosswords for the ''Guardian'' from 1954<ref>A Display of Lights (9), Val Gilbert, 2008 - p. 155</ref> until her retirement in 2004, legally changed her surname to \"Crisp\" after divorcing in the 1970s.  Some pseudonyms have obvious connotations: for example, Torquemada as already described, or \"Mephisto\" with fairly obvious devilish overtones.  Others are chosen for logical but less obvious reasons, though \"Dinmutz\" (the late Bert Danher in the ''Financial Times'') was produced by random selection of [[Scrabble]] tiles.\n\n;''The Daily Telegraph/Sunday Telegraph''\n:The ''Telegraph'', like the ''Times'', does not identify the setter of each puzzle but, unlike the ''Times'', has a regular setter for each day of the week, plus a few occasional setters to cover holidays or sickness. Regular setters include John Halpern, Ray Terrell, Jeremy Mutch, Don Manley, Allan Smith, Steve Bartlett and Richard Palmer. The regular setters as of 1 November 2006 are shown in a photograph [http://www.crossword.org.uk/valgilbert.htm here]. The crossword editor is Chris Lancaster, who took over from Phil McNeill in early 2018.  There is an advanced cryptic called Enigmatic Variations in the ''Sunday Telegraph'', and also a 15&times;15 blocked-grid puzzle.\n\n:In September 2008 the ''Telegraph'' started printing a 'Toughie' crossword as well as the daily puzzle, from Tuesday to Friday.  This is described by the paper as \"the toughest crossword in Fleet Street\" or similar and does include the setter's pseudonym.  Comments from some solvers on these puzzles don't always agree with this assessment, rating maybe half of them as close to average broadsheet cryptic difficulty.\n\n;''The Guardian''\n:Notable compilers of ''[[The Guardian]]'''s cryptic crosswords include Enigmatist, Pasquale, Paul (John Halpern again), Rufus (now retired), and the late [[Bob Smithies]] (Bunthorne) and [[Araucaria (compiler)|Araucaria]].  The puzzle is edited by Hugh Stephenson.\n\n;''The Independent''\n:''The Independent'' went online only in 2016, but still has a cryptic crossword. Setters include Virgilius, Dac, Phi, Quixote, Nimrod, Monk, Nestor, Bannsider, Anax, Merlin, Mass, Math, Morph, Scorpion, Tees and Punk ([[John Halpern]]).  The daily puzzle is edited by Eimi (Mike Hutchinson).\n\n;''i''\n:The ''i'' newspaper was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to The Independent, but was bought by Johnston Press in February 2016 when The Independent moved to digital-only publication. The fiendish Inquisitor puzzle is edited by John Henderson whose predecessor was the late former ''Times'' crossword editor Mike Laws. The crosswords are often themed and may contain a Nina: a hidden feature. \n\n;''The National''\n:Launched in Scotland as \"The Newspaper that supports an independent Scotland\" on 24 November 2014 after the independence referendum on 18 September. The National has a daily cryptic crossword after a request from readers to include one. The National is the only daily pro-independence newspaper in Scotland and is edited by Sunday Herald editor Richard Walker.\n\n;''The Observer''\n:Home of the famous [[Azed]] crossword, which employs a barred grid and a wider vocabulary than standard cryptics, and in conjunction with its predecessors 'Torquemada' and 'Ximenes' is the longest-running series of barred-grid puzzles. On the first Sunday of every month and at Christmas, Azed runs a clue-writing competition, via which many of today's top compilers have learnt their trade. ''The Observer'' also features a standard cryptic crossword, the Everyman, compiled by Allan Scott.\n\n;''Private Eye''\n:In the early 1970s the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' had a crossword set by the Labour MP [[Tom Driberg]], under the pseudonym of \"Tiresias\" (supposedly \"a distinguished academic churchman\"). It is currently set by Eddie James under the name \"Cyclops\". This crossword is usually topical, and contains material varying from risqu\u00e9 to rude, in clues, answers and the solver's head; much of the rudeness is by innuendo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It also often includes references to the content of the rest of the magazine, or its jargon in which, for example, the current monarch of the UK is \"Brenda\" and the likely next one \"Prince Brian\".  The \u00a3100 prize for the first correct solution opened is unusually high for a crossword and attracts many entrants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n;''The Radio Times''\n:Roger Prebble has compiled the cryptic crossword since 1999.\n\n;''Significance''\n:[[Significance (magazine)|''Significance'']] is a joint publication between the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society; it contains a cryptic crossword in its puzzle section.  The magazine offers a randomly awarded $150 or \u00a3100 to spend on [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] books for those that submit a correct entry.\n\n;''The Spectator''\n:Cryptics in the weekly ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' often have a specific theme, such as a tribute to a public figure who has died recently or a historic event that has its anniversary this week. As in most British periodicals, the cryptic in the ''Spectator'' is numbered: in the ''Spectator'''s case, a puzzle's theme may be related to its specific number (such as a historic event that occurred in the year corresponding to the four-digit number of the puzzle for that week). Compilers include Doc (the puzzle editor as well as chief setter), Dumpynose (an anagram for 'Pseudonym') and Columba.\n\n;''The Sunday Times''\n:''[[The Sunday Times]]'' cryptic crossword is compiled in rotation by three setters: Jeff Pearce, Dean Mayer and David McLean, the latter taking over from Tim Moorey in January 2016. (Mr Moorey's final puzzle included the hidden message 'Farewell from Tim'; he continues to set Mephisto puzzles.) The position of puzzles editor is now held by Peter Biddlecombe. Until her retirement in December 2010, Barbara Hall was puzzles editor for 32 years, and wrote about half the paper's cryptic crosswords. The ''Sunday Times'' is also home to the difficult barred-grid Mephisto puzzle, currently set in rotation by Don Manley, Paul McKenna and Tim Moorey. Previous Mephisto setters were Richard Kilner (only setter, 1959 to 1973), Richard Whitelegg (only setter, 1973 to 1995), Chris Feetenby (1995-2008) and Mike Laws (1995-2011).<ref>The Sunday Times Mephisto Crossword Book 1, 2003 - Introduction</ref>\n\n;''The Times''\n:[[Adrian Bell]] was the first to set [[The Times|The ''Times'']] crossword from 1930<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/games_and_puzzles/article5976721.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=The Times crossword the man who began it all | first=Oliver | last=Kamm | date=2009-03-26 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> and was one of those responsible for establishing its distinctive cryptic style. (The ''Times'' was a relatively late adopter: the ''Telegraph'' crossword started in 1925, and the ''Guardian'' in 1929.) The ''Times'' has a team of about 15 setters, many of whom set puzzles for other papers.  The setter of each puzzle is not identified.  The ''Times'' also has \"jumbo\" (23&times;23) puzzles in the Saturday edition and since 1991 has provided a home for the famously difficult advanced cryptic puzzle which used to appear in the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''.\n\n:The daily ''Times'' puzzle is syndicated in the ''New York Post'' (US) and ''The Australian'' (Aus) papers.  In both cases, the puzzle appears some weeks after it appeared in ''The Times''.\n\n:In October 2007, [[The Bugle]]&mdash;a TimesOnline podcast by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and [[Andy Zaltzman]]&mdash;introduced the first, revolutionary \"Audio Cryptic Crossword.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-bugle-audio-crossword-dxkd8bfspwk |title= The Bugle Audio Crossword|publisher=The Times UK}}</ref>\n\n;''Viz'' magazine\n:Since 2009 the adult comic magazine ''Viz'' has incorporated a cryptic crossword credited to Anus. This is a collaboration of two setters, one of whom has a minor role in supplying some pre-written clues. In keeping with the comic's \"top shelf\" status the puzzle content is an amalgam of humour and obscenity, although the clueing style retains both Libertarian and Ximenean disciplines.\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n;''The Age'' (Australia)\n:(see ''Sydney Morning Herald'')\n\n;''The Atlantic'' (US)\n:''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine had a long-running variety cryptic crossword, known as the Puzzler, created by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon beginning in 1977,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/acrostic/|title= Acrostic Creators|author= Horne, Jim|date= 8 November 2008|work= Wordplay: The Crossword Blog of The New York Times|publisher= [[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2009 }}</ref> available only online since March 2006.

Some other puzzles in the publication include cryptic elements, such as double definition puzzles or hidden word puzzles.\n\n;''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada)\n:\"Canada's national newspaper\" includes a daily cryptic somewhat less difficult than its British cousins.  The crossword also comes with another set of \"Quick Clues\" (American-style) which provide a completely different set of answers. Fraser Simpson compiles the Saturday cryptic; he also used to compile an advanced cryptic in ''The Walrus''.  Once a year on [[Canada Day]], ''The Globe'' published a large 24\u00d724 bar-diagram cryptic, but as of 2015 it no longer does.\n:\n\n'''''The Geraldine News (New Zealand)'''''\n\nThis weekly local paper carries a cryptic once a month.

The paper continued to run his puzzles after his death in April 2010. The last of Crozier's crosswords was published in the ''Irish Times'' on 22 October 2011.

Christine Lovatt is the main cryptic compiler, and she has been so for 30 years.\n\n;''The Nation'' (US)\n:This liberal American political weekly has featured a weekly cryptic puzzle since 1947. [[Frank W. Lewis]] wrote the puzzle from late 1947 until his retirement in late 2009.  Lewis developed one of the most recognizably personal styles of cryptic setting, and ''The Nation'' published book collections of his puzzles.  Since December 2011, the weekly puzzle has been written by Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto.\n\n;''The National Post'' (Canada)\n:Carries a weekly puzzle by [[Emily Cox (compiler)|Emily Cox]] and [[Henry Rathvon]].\n\n;''New York Magazine''\n:[[Stephen Sondheim]]'s puzzles for ''[[New York Magazine]]'' have been collected in book form. Sondheim is himself a collector of old-time puzzles and board games.\n\n;''New Yorker''\n:For some of the time that this magazine was edited by Tina Brown (1997\u20131999), it included a small (8\u00d710) barred-grid cryptic crossword, set by a range of American and Canadian setters.  These puzzles are also available in a book collection.\n\n;''New York Times''\n:Two weeks in every 18, the \"variety puzzle\" in the Sunday edition is a cryptic crossword, usually by [[Emily Cox (compiler)|Emily Cox]] and [[Henry Rathvon]], Richard Silvestri, or Fraser Simpson.  One week in 18, it's a \"Puns and Anagrams\" puzzle, a relic of a 1940s attempt to introduce cryptic puzzles to the US.\n\n;''The New Zealand Herald'' (Auckland New Zealand)\n:The weekend edition features a cryptic crossword by \"Kropotkin\" (Rex Benson) in addition to syndicated crosswords from the UK and Australia.<ref>New Zealand Herald</ref>\n\n;''Ottawa Citizen''\n:The ''Ottawa Citizen'' has carried a weekly puzzle by Susannah Sears since 2001.\n\n;''Sydney Daily Telegraph''\n:Prints the \"Stickler\" puzzle, set by David Stickley.\n\n;''Sydney Morning Herald'' and ''The Age'' (Australia)\n:[[Fairfax Media]] papers, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'', print a daily puzzle, which was also available free on-line until 31 August 2009. Various compilers (setters) compose the puzzles, each being indicated by their initials. As of November 2013, compilers from Monday to Saturday include LR (Liam Runnalls), RM (Rose McGinley), DP (David Plomley), DH (Donald Harrison), NS (Nancy Sibtain), DA ([[David Astle]]), and DS (David Sutton).\n\n;''The Toronto Star'' (Canada)\n:Includes a cryptic crossword in the Saturday edition in the Puzzles section from the Sunday Times.

The station is on the Hainault loop of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] between [[Chigwell tube station|Chigwell]] and [[Woodford tube station|Woodford]] stations.<ref name=stn>{{cite map/Standard Tube Map}}</ref> However geographically it is midway between Woodford and Buckhurst Hill stations. It is located between Station Way and Cherry Tree Rise (off Buckhurst Way). Since 2 January 2007, the station has been in [[Travelcard Zone 4]].<ref name=stn />\n\nWith around {{Tubeexits list|Roding Valley tube station}} million passenger journeys recorded in {{Tubeexits list|year}}, Roding Valley is the {{tubeexits list rank|Roding Valley tube station}} station on the entire Underground network.<ref name=infobox_stats_ref_tube_2007/>\n\n==Location==\n{{one source|section|date=February 2015}}\nIt was originally named \"Roding Valley Halt\" (though while the full name appeared on tickets and timetables, the word \"Halt\" appeared on only some of the station signage), and was opened to serve new housing developments between Buckhurst Hill and Woodford. It was named after the [[River Roding]] which is close by, to the east. The track rises towards Chigwell and crosses the Roding over an impressive viaduct. Woodford Junction, where the Hainault branch leaves the main Central line to [[Epping tube station|Epping]], is very close to the station \u2014 Roding Valley's platforms are visible from the train in either direction between Woodford and Buckhurst Hill (on the left of the train towards Woodford).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bok5TC5Pyro Full Journey on the Central line from West Ruislip to Epping - YouTube]</ref>\n\nRoding Valley station has a very small catchment area, which explains its low usage. To the east is an undeveloped flood plain of the river Roding. A short distance to the north is [[Buckhurst Hill station]]. To the north-west is open space, while the areas to the south are served by [[Woodford station]], which has a better train service.\n\n==History==\nThe tracks through Roding Valley were opened on 1 May 1903 by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER) on its Woodford to [[Ilford railway station|Ilford]] line (the [[Fairlop Loop]]).<ref name=CULG_01>{{cite web\n| title = Clive's Underground Line Guides, Central Line, Dates\n| url = http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/central.html#dates\n| accessdate = 2007-12-29 }}</ref> The station was not opened until 3 February 1936 by the [[London & North Eastern Railway]] (LNER, successor to the GER).\n\nAs part of the 1935\u20131940 \"New Works Programme\" of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] the majority of the [[Woodford, London|Woodford]] to [[Ilford]] loop was to be transferred to form the eastern extensions of the Central line. Although work started in 1938 it was suspended at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 and work was only resumed in 1946. In connection with the alterations required for the electrification of the line, the station was closed from 29 November 1947.<ref name=CULG_01/> It reopened, with its present name, and was first served by the Central line from 21 November 1948.<ref name=CULG_01/> The rather basic station buildings (all-wooden on the Woodford-bound side) were replaced by more substantial structures by 1949.\n\n[[File:1992 Stock Roding Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Train arrives on a Hainault-bound service]]\n\nFrom the mid-1960s until the early 1990s the Woodford-Hainault section was largely operated separately from the rest of the Central line, using four-car (later three-car) trains of 1960 Stock.<ref name=centralline>[http://citytransport.info/Central.htm Railfanning London's Railways - Central line]</ref> The three car units had a 1938 tube stock middle carriage. These trains were adapted for [[Automatic train operation|Automatic Train Operation]] (ATO): the Woodford-Hainault section became the testing ground for ATO on the Victoria line.<ref name=centralline /> Some Victoria line (1967 Stock) trains were also used to operate this section<ref name=centralline /> and named FACT, \"Fully Automatic Controlled Train\". The separate operation has now been abolished, the 1960 Stock withdrawn and through trains to Central London now operate, albeit via Hainault.<ref name=rvtubestn>[https://pipsrailway.wordpress.com/2013/10/13/on-the-branch-line-from-woodford-to-hainault/ On the branch line\u2026from Woodford to Hainault]</ref> Because of this, it is normally quicker to travel to Woodford and change there,<ref name=centralline /> as trains to central London run frequently from that point. At the buildup to the peak periods, some trains starting from Hainault depot operate to central London via Grange Hill, Chigwell, Roding Valley and Woodford.<ref name=rvtubestn /> This is done for operating convenience but passenger demand for these services is particularly high.\n\n==The station today==\nRoding Valley is the most lightly used station on the Underground.

The station is on the Hainault loop of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] between [[Chigwell tube station|Chigwell]] and [[Woodford tube station|Woodford]] stations.<ref name=stn>{{cite map/Standard Tube Map}}</ref> However geographically it is midway between Woodford and Buckhurst Hill stations. It is located between Station Way and Cherry Tree Rise (off Buckhurst Way). Since 2 January 2007, the station has been in [[Travelcard Zone 4]].<ref name=stn />\n\nWith around {{Tubeexits list|Roding Valley tube station}} million passenger journeys recorded in {{Tubeexits list|year}}, Roding Valley is the {{tubeexits list rank|Roding Valley tube station}} station on the entire Underground network.<ref name=infobox_stats_ref_tube_2007/>\n\n==Location==\n{{one source|section|date=February 2015}}\nIt was originally named \"Roding Valley Halt\" (though while the full name appeared on tickets and timetables, the word \"Halt\" appeared on only some of the station signage), and was opened to serve new housing developments between Buckhurst Hill and Woodford. It was named after the [[River Roding]] which is close by, to the east. The track rises towards Chigwell and crosses the Roding over an impressive viaduct. Woodford Junction, where the Hainault branch leaves the main Central line to [[Epping tube station|Epping]], is very close to the station \u2014 Roding Valley's platforms are visible from the train in either direction between Woodford and Buckhurst Hill (on the left of the train towards Woodford).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bok5TC5Pyro Full Journey on the Central line from West Ruislip to Epping - YouTube]</ref>\n\nRoding Valley station has a very small catchment area, which explains its low usage. To the east is an undeveloped flood plain of the river Roding. A short distance to the north is [[Buckhurst Hill station]]. To the north-west is open space, while the areas to the south are served by [[Woodford station]], which has a better train service.\n\n==History==\nThe tracks through Roding Valley were opened on 1 May 1903 by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER) on its Woodford to [[Ilford railway station|Ilford]] line (the [[Fairlop Loop]]).<ref name=CULG_01>{{cite web\n| title = Clive's Underground Line Guides, Central Line, Dates\n| url = http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/central.html#dates\n| accessdate = 2007-12-29 }}</ref> The station was not opened until 3 February 1936 by the [[London & North Eastern Railway]] (LNER, successor to the GER).\n\nAs part of the 1935\u20131940 \"New Works Programme\" of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] the majority of the [[Woodford, London|Woodford]] to [[Ilford]] loop was to be transferred to form the eastern extensions of the Central line. Although work started in 1938 it was suspended at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 and work was only resumed in 1946. In connection with the alterations required for the electrification of the line, the station was closed from 29 November 1947.<ref name=CULG_01/> It reopened, with its present name, and was first served by the Central line from 21 November 1948.<ref name=CULG_01/> The rather basic station buildings (all-wooden on the Woodford-bound side) were replaced by more substantial structures by 1949.\n\n[[File:1992 Stock Roding Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Train arrives on a Hainault-bound service]]\n\nFrom the mid-1960s until the early 1990s the Woodford-Hainault section was largely operated separately from the rest of the Central line, using four-car (later three-car) trains of 1960 Stock.<ref name=centralline>[http://citytransport.info/Central.htm Railfanning London's Railways - Central line]</ref> The three car units had a 1938 tube stock middle carriage. These trains were adapted for [[Automatic train operation|Automatic Train Operation]] (ATO): the Woodford-Hainault section became the testing ground for ATO on the Victoria line.<ref name=centralline /> Some Victoria line (1967 Stock) trains were also used to operate this section<ref name=centralline /> and named FACT, \"Fully Automatic Controlled Train\". The separate operation has now been abolished, the 1960 Stock withdrawn and through trains to Central London now operate, albeit via Hainault.<ref name=rvtubestn>[https://pipsrailway.wordpress.com/2013/10/13/on-the-branch-line-from-woodford-to-hainault/ On the branch line\u2026from Woodford to Hainault]</ref> Because of this, it is normally quicker to travel to Woodford and change there,<ref name=centralline /> as trains to central London run frequently from that point. At the buildup to the peak periods, some trains starting from Hainault depot operate to central London via Grange Hill, Chigwell, Roding Valley and Woodford.<ref name=rvtubestn /> This is done for operating convenience but passenger demand for these services is particularly high.\n\n==The station today==\nRoding Valley is the most lightly used station on the Underground.

He confesses to his wife and she thanks her child, providing the inspiration for the artist to complete a great painting. It brings him success and he grows distant from his wife and becomes interested in another woman whom he was commissioned by. Once again saved by his daughter's actions, whose crying moves the woman to break off the relationship with the artist. The artist destroys the painting and learns a moral lesson.\n\nThe film was advertised to the American churchgoer as a moral picture. The film was generally well received by critics, but the faults of story for the sake of a moral lesson were noted. ''Adrift'', like all other American silents of the day, had no musical accompaniment, but a letter written into a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed [[lost film|lost]].\n\n==Plot ==\nAn official synopsis of the film was published in ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' states: \"Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, and he and his wife and little daughter are on the verge of starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all.

The couple, happy in poverty, are now rapidly drifting on the shoals of matrimonial disaster, but the child saves them. She is weeping one day when Miss Brent, the society woman, enters the room. Miss Brent, who has never seen the child before, asks the cause of her sorrow, and tries to comfort her. The child tells her, and Julia's heart is touched. Though she has contempt[u]ously ignored the wife, she feels that she cannot ruin the life of the helpless child, even to win the artist's love. On the spur of the moment, she writes a farewell note to Jack, and gives it to the child, saying that it will cure all her sorrow. Then she goes out of their lives forever.

An outsider had made a sacrifice to save the future of little Marie, when he, her father, who had always loved her, had selfishly forgotten his duty.

Henderson]]. The film depicts a story of a young artist whose lack of success leads him to attempt suicide. Before he can carry out the act, his daughter follows and stops him. He confesses to his wife and she thanks her child, providing the inspiration for the artist to complete a great painting. It brings him success and he grows distant from his wife and becomes interested in another woman whom he was commissioned by. Once again saved by his daughter's actions, whose crying moves the woman to break off the relationship with the artist. The artist destroys the painting and learns a moral lesson.\n\nThe film was advertised to the American churchgoer as a moral picture. The film was generally well received by critics, but the faults of story for the sake of a moral lesson were noted. ''Adrift'', like all other American silents of the day, had no musical accompaniment, but a letter written into a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed [[lost film|lost]].\n\n==Plot ==\nAn official synopsis of the film was published in ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' states: \"Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, and he and his wife and little daughter are on the verge of starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [this] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth.\"<ref name=\"plot\">{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/movingpicturenew04unse | title=Moving Picture News (1911) (1911) | publisher=[[Cinematograph Publishing Company]] | date=1911 | accessdate=January 15, 2015 | pages=76\u201377, 84}}</ref>\n\n\"But with wealth, the artist becomes dissatisfied with his wife, and is infatuated with a beautiful society woman whose portrait he is painting.
