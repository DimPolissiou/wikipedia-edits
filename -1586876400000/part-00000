It was produced by [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]] for [[Lucasfilm]] Ltd., with Lucas and [[Howard Kazanjian]] as executive producers. The film originated from Lucas's desire to create a modern version of the [[serial film]]s of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe first installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]], the film stars [[Harrison Ford]] as archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]], who battles a group of [[Nazis]] searching for the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. It co-stars [[Karen Allen]] as Indiana's former lover, [[Marion Ravenwood]]; [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]] as Indiana's rival, French [[archaeologist]] [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Ren\u00e9 Belloq|Ren\u00e9 Belloq]]; [[John Rhys-Davies]] as Indiana's sidekick, [[Sallah]]; [[Ronald Lacey]] as [[Gestapo]] agent [[Arnold Toht]]; and [[Denholm Elliott]] as Indiana's colleague, [[Marcus Brody]].\nProduction was based at [[Elstree Studios]], England, but filming also took place in [[La Rochelle, France]], [[Tunisia]], [[Hawaii]], and [[California]] from June to September 1980.\n\n''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' earned $389.9 million worldwide, becoming the [[1981 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1981]], and remains one of the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing films]] adjusted for [[inflation]].

The film began a franchise starting with ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', and including a [[prequel]] television series (''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'') and [[Indiana Jones franchise#Video games|numerous video games]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1936, American archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]] braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in [[Peru]] to retrieve a [[Golden Idol|golden idol]]. He is confronted by rival archaeologist [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Ren\u00e9 Belloq|Ren\u00e9 Belloq]] and the indigenous [[Jibito|Hovito]] people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones is forced to surrender the idol to Belloq but manages to escape aboard a waiting seaplane.\n\nTwo [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] agents later interview Jones at Marshall College, where he holds a teaching position, and inform him that the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] are working with his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, whom Jones studied under at the [[University of Chicago]]. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of [[Tanis]] in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], and that he possesses the headpiece of an [[ancient Egypt]]ian artifact known as \"the Staff of [[Ra]]\". Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the [[Ark of the Covenant]], believing it will grant their armies invincibility. The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark.\n\nHe travels to [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepal]] to discover that Ravenwood has died and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter [[Marion Ravenwood|Marion]]. Jones visits Marion at her [[tavern]] before a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Arnold Ernst Toht|Arnold Toht]], seeking the headpiece. A gunfight erupts, the bar is set ablaze and the headpiece lands in the flames. Toht severely burns his hand trying to retrieve it and flees the bar in agony. Jones and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Jones in his search. They travel to [[Cairo|Cairo, Egypt]], where they meet up with Jones' friend and skilled digger [[Sallah]]. He informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for \"the Well of Souls\", believed to lead to the Ark's location, with a replica of the headpiece created from the scar on Toht's hand. Jones and Marion are attacked by a group of Nazi soldiers, and Marion is seemingly killed in an explosion during the resulting chase. Jones regroups with Sallah, and they realize that the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place, as they only have part of the information regarding the Well's location.\n\nAfter a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Jones and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site. Jones finds Marion alive, bound and gagged in a tent; he does not set her free in fear of alerting the Nazis, but promises to come back for her later. Jones and Sallah use their staff to locate the Ark in the snake-infested Well of Souls. They fend off the snakes using fire and gasoline before reaching the stone coffin containing the Ark. Belloq, Toht, and Nazi officer [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Colonel Dietrich|Colonel Dietrich]] arrive and seize the Ark from Jones, before imprisoning him and Marion in the crypt. The two escape to a local airstrip, where Indy gets into a fistfight with a mechanic and destroys the [[flying wing]] that was to transport the Ark to [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]]. The panicked Nazis load the Ark onto a truck, but Indy manages to catch up on horseback, hijack the truck, defeat the Nazis, and make arrangements to transport the Ark to [[London]] aboard [[Tramp trade|tramp steamer]] ''Bantu Wind''. In the cargo hold, an unseen force burns the Nazi symbols painted on the wooden crate containing the Ark.\n\nThe next day a Nazi [[U-boat]] intercepts the ship. Belloq, Toht, and Dietrich seize the Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels with them to an island in the [[Aegean Sea]]. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with an anti-tank rocket, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders.\n\nThe Nazis take Jones and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Dressed as an [[Israelite]] [[High priest of Israel|kohen gadol]], Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark by invoking a standard Sabbath prayer,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jta.org/jewniverse/2016/why-indiana-joness-nazi-loving-enemy-said-a-torah-prayer |title=Why Indiana Jones' Nazi-Loving Enemy Said a Torah Prayer |author=Bohnen, Michael J. |date=22 February 2016 |website=jta.org |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref> and finds it full of sand, possibly all that is left of the Ten Commandments. As Jones warns Marion to keep her eyes shut, spirits emerge from the Ark, eventually revealing themselves to be [[Destroying angel (Bible)|angels of death]]. Flames then form above the opened Ark and bolts of energy shoot through the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. In the extreme heat, Dietrich is instantaneously mummified; all the flesh on Toht's face melts off his skull; and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf and vaporize the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Jones and Marion, in a whirlwind of fire before the Ark seals itself shut. Jones and Marion open their eyes and find the area wiped clean along with their ropes burned off, and embrace.\n\nBack in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Army Intelligence agents inform Jones and [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Marcus Brody|Marcus Brody]] that the Ark is someplace safe and will be studied and monitored by \"top men\". It is then shown being sealed in a wooden crate and stored in a giant government warehouse among countless other crates.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]], an [[archaeology]] professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones claims that he has no belief in the supernatural, only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark.

Between January 23\u201327, 1978, for nine hours a day, Lucas, Kasdan, and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas.

Spielberg had a darker vision of Jones, interpreting him as an [[alcoholic]] similar to [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character Fred C.

The film began a franchise starting with ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', and including a [[prequel]] television series (''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'') and [[Indiana Jones franchise#Video games|numerous video games]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1936, American archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]] braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in [[Peru]] to retrieve a [[Golden Idol|golden idol]]. He is confronted by rival archaeologist [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Ren\u00e9 Belloq|Ren\u00e9 Belloq]] and the indigenous [[Jibito|Hovito]] people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones is forced to surrender the idol to Belloq but manages to escape aboard a waiting seaplane.\n\nTwo [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] agents later interview Jones at Marshall College, where he holds a teaching position, and inform him that the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] are working with his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, whom Jones studied under at the [[University of Chicago]]. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of [[Tanis]] in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], and that he possesses the headpiece of an [[ancient Egypt]]ian artifact known as \"the Staff of [[Ra]]\". Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the [[Ark of the Covenant]], believing it will grant their armies invincibility. The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark.\n\nHe travels to [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepal]] to discover that Ravenwood has died and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter [[Marion Ravenwood|Marion]]. Jones visits Marion at her [[tavern]] before a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Arnold Ernst Toht|Arnold Toht]], seeking the headpiece. A gunfight erupts, the bar is set ablaze and the headpiece lands in the flames. Toht severely burns his hand trying to retrieve it and flees the bar in agony. Jones and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Jones in his search. They travel to [[Cairo|Cairo, Egypt]], where they meet up with Jones' friend and skilled digger [[Sallah]]. He informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for \"the Well of Souls\", believed to lead to the Ark's location, with a replica of the headpiece created from the scar on Toht's hand. Jones and Marion are attacked by a group of Nazi soldiers, and Marion is seemingly killed in an explosion during the resulting chase. Jones regroups with Sallah, and they realize that the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place, as they only have part of the information regarding the Well's location.\n\nAfter a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Jones and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site. Jones finds Marion alive, bound and gagged in a tent; he does not set her free in fear of alerting the Nazis, but promises to come back for her later. Jones and Sallah use their staff to locate the Ark in the snake-infested Well of Souls. They feud off the snakes using fire and gasoline before reaching the stone coffin containing the Ark. Belloq, Toht, and Nazi officer [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Colonel Dietrich|Colonel Dietrich]] arrive and seize the Ark from Jones, before imprisoning him and Marion in the crypt. The two escape to a local airstrip, where Indy gets into a fistfight with a mechanic and destroys the [[flying wing]] that was to transport the Ark to [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]]. The panicked Nazis load the Ark onto a truck, but Indy manages to catch up on horseback, hijack the truck, defeat the Nazis, and make arrangements to transport the Ark to [[London]] aboard [[Tramp trade|tramp steamer]] ''Bantu Wind''. In the cargo hold, an unseen force burns the Nazi symbols painted on the wooden crate containing the Ark.\n\nThe next day a Nazi [[U-boat]] intercepts the ship. Belloq, Toht, and Dietrich seize the Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels with them to an island in the [[Aegean Sea]]. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with an anti-tank rocket, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders.\n\nThe Nazis take Jones and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Dressed as an [[Israelite]] [[High priest of Israel|kohen gadol]], Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark by invoking a standard Sabbath prayer,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jta.org/jewniverse/2016/why-indiana-joness-nazi-loving-enemy-said-a-torah-prayer |title=Why Indiana Jones' Nazi-Loving Enemy Said a Torah Prayer |author=Bohnen, Michael J. |date=22 February 2016 |website=jta.org |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref> and finds it full of sand, possibly all that is left of the Ten Commandments. As Jones warns Marion to keep her eyes shut, spirits emerge from the Ark, eventually revealing themselves to be [[Destroying angel (Bible)|angels of death]]. Flames then form above the opened Ark and bolts of energy shoot through the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. In the extreme heat, Dietrich is instantaneously mummified; all the flesh on Toht's face melts off his skull; and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf and vaporize the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Jones and Marion, in a whirlwind of fire before the Ark seals itself shut. Jones and Marion open their eyes and find the area wiped clean along with their ropes burned off, and embrace.\n\nBack in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Army Intelligence agents inform Jones and [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Marcus Brody|Marcus Brody]] that the Ark is someplace safe and will be studied and monitored by \"top men\". It is then shown being sealed in a wooden crate and stored in a giant government warehouse among countless other crates.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]], an [[archaeology]] professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts.

Sound effects artists struck leather jackets and [[baseball glove]]s with a [[baseball bat]] to create a variety of punching noises and body blows. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, fingers running through cheese casserole and sponges sliding over concrete were used for the slithering noises. The sliding lid on a toilet cistern provided the sound for the opening of the Ark, and the sound of the boulder in the opening is a car rolling down a gravel driveway in neutral. Burtt also used, as he did in many of his films, the ubiquitous [[Wilhelm scream]] when a Nazi falls from a truck. In addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also demonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on ''Star Wars''.

Instead, black soldier fly larvae play a similar role to that of [[redworm]]s as essential decomposers in breaking down organic substrates and returning nutrients to the soil. The larvae have voracious appetites and can be used for [[composting]] household [[food waste|food scraps]] and [[agricultural waste]] products.\n\nAdditionally, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are an alternative source of protein for [[aquaculture]], [[animal feed]], [[Insect based pet food|pet food]] and [[Insects as food|human nutrition]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=Potential and challenges of insects as an innovative source for food and feed production | last=Rumpold | first=Brigit A. | last2=Schl\u00fcter | first2=Olivier K. | journal=Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies | year=2013 | volume=17 | pages=1\u201311 | doi=10.1016/j.ifset.2012.11.005}}</ref>\n\n=== As decomposers / in composting ===\nBlack soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are used to compost waste or convert the waste into animal feed. Fly larvae are among the most efficient animals at converting feed into biomass.\n\nWhen the larvae have completed their larval development through six [[instars]], they enter a stage called the \"prepupa\" wherein they cease to eat and empty their guts, their mouth parts change to an appendage that aids climbing, and they seek a humid, sheltered area to [[pupate]]. This prepupal migration instinct is used by [[wikiversity:grub composting|grub composting]] bins to self-harvest the mature larvae. [[wikiversity:Grub composting#BSFL bin designs|These containers]] have ramps or holes on the sides to allow the prepupae to climb out of the composter and drop into a collection area.The wastes include fresh manure and food wastes of both animal and vegetable origin.\n\nLarvae are beneficial in these ways:\n\n*Their large size relative to houseflies and blowflies allows them to prevent [[houseflies]] and [[blowflies]] from laying eggs in decaying matter by consuming larvae of other species.

They have less expendable energy due to their limited ability to consume food as adults. They are very easy to catch and relocate when they get inside a house, as they do not avoid being picked up, they are sanitary, and they neither bite nor sting. Their only defense seems to be hiding. When using a wet grub bin that will collect or kill all the pupae, the black soldier fly population is easy to reduce by killing the pupae/prepupae in the collection container, before they become flies. They may be killed by freezing, drying, manually feeding to domestic animals, putting the collection container in a chicken coop for automatic feeding, or feeding to wild birds with a mouse/pest-proof feeder.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thebiopod.com/forum/index.php?topic=122.msg405#msg405 | title=Feeding Grubs to Birds EXPERIMENT}}</ref>\n*Significant reductions of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and'' Salmonella enterica'' were measured in hen manure after larvae activity was added onto the manure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Marilyn C.|last2=Islam|first2=Mahbub|last3=Sheppard|first3=Craig|last4=Liao|first4=Jean|last5=Doyle|first5=Michael P.|date=April 2004|title=Reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in chicken manure by larvae of the black soldier fly|journal=Journal of Food Protection|volume=67|issue=4|pages=685\u2013690|doi=10.4315/0362-028x-67.4.685|issn=0362-028X|pmid=15083719|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f1450fa78326f7f8d17d6412a2f38875a4964050}}</ref>\n*They quickly reclaim [[wiktionary:would-be|would-be]] pollutants: Nine organic chemicals were greatly reduced or eliminated from manure in 24 hours.<ref name=\"alt to fish\">{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/15054/research-summary:-black-soldier-fly-prepupae-a-compelling-alternative-to-fish-meal-and-fish-oil|title=Research Summary: Black Soldier Fly Prepupae \u2013 A Compelling Alternative to Fish Meal and Fish Oil|date=February 14, 2011}}</ref>\n*They quickly reduce the volume and weight of would-be waste: The larval colony breaks apart its food, churns it, and creates heat, increasing compost evaporation.

This is usually done by enticing the soldier flies to lay eggs in small holes over the grub bin. Adult flies lay clusters of eggs in the edges of [[corrugated cardboard]] or [[corrugated plastic]]. In some regions, it is possible to start or maintain adequate larvae colonies from native soldier flies; however, pest species such as houseflies and blowflies are also drawn to many of the foods used to attract soldier flies (such as fermented chicken feed).\n\nIn tropical or subtropical climates, they might breed year-round, but in other climates, a greenhouse may be needed to obtain eggs in the cooler periods. The grubs are quite hardy and can handle more acidic conditions and higher temperatures than [[redworm]]s. Larvae can survive cold winters, particularly with large numbers of grubs, insulation, or [[compost]] heat (generated by the microorganisms in the grub bin or compost pile). Heat stimulates the grubs to crawl off, pupate, and hatch, and a great deal of light and heat seem to be required for breeding. Many small-scale grub farmers build their larval colonies from eggs deposited by wild soldier flies.\n\n==== Space and shape ====\nNewly emerged soldier flies perform the beginning of their mating ritual in flight.  The male grabs onto the female, and then grasps the female's ovipositor with his genitals.  They mate while stationary and connected.\n\nGerman scientists have successfully bred soldier flies in a space as small as 10 liters.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thebiopod.com/forum/index.php?topic=175.msg1783#msg1783 | title=Breeding BSF in captivity / Re: not easy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-08 | archive-date=2013-11-12 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112175106/http://www.terrarienbilder.com/vb/futtertiere_und_futterpflanzen/315-zucht_der_schwarzen_soldatenfliege_hermetia_illucens.html | url=http://www.terrarienbilder.com/vb/futtertiere_und_futterpflanzen/315-zucht_der_schwarzen_soldatenfliege_hermetia_illucens.html | title=Zucht der schwarzen Soldatenfliege (Hermetia illucens) | date=2010-04-02 | last=Jetter | first=Michael | language=de | trans-title=Breeding the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) | url-status=dead | website=Terrarienbilder.com}}</ref>\n\n==== Heat ====\nAdults typically mated and oviposited at temperatures of {{convert|24|to|40|C|F}} or more.

Instead, black soldier fly larvae play a similar role to that of [[redworm]]s as essential decomposers in breaking down organic substrates and returning nutrients to the soil. The larvae have voracious appetites and can be used for [[composting]] household [[food waste|food scraps]] and [[agricultural waste]] products.\n\nAdditionally, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are an alternative source of protein for [[aquaculture]], [[animal feed]], [[Insect based pet food|pet food]] and [[Insects as food|human nutrition]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=Potential and challenges of insects as an innovative source for food and feed production | last=Rumpold | first=Brigit A. | last2=Schl\u00fcter | first2=Olivier K. | journal=Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies | year=2013 | volume=17 | pages=1\u201311 | doi=10.1016/j.ifset.2012.11.005}}</ref>\n\n=== As decomposers / in composting ===\nBlack soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are used to compost waste or convert the waste into animal feed. Fly larvae are among the most efficient animals at converting feed into biomass.\n\nWhen the larvae have completed their larval development through six [[instars]], they enter a stage called the \"prepupa\" wherein they cease to eat and empty their guts, their mouth parts change to an appendage that aids climbing, and they seek a humid, sheltered area to [[pupate]]. This prepupal migration instinct is used by [[wikiversity:grub composting|grub composting]] bins to self-harvest the mature larvae. [[wikiversity:Grub composting#BSFL bin designs|These containers]] have ramps or holes on the sides to allow the prepupae to climb out of the composter and drop into a collection area.The wastes include fresh manure and food wastes of both animal and vegetable origin.\n\nLarvae are beneficial in these ways:\n\n*Their large size relative to houseflies and blowflies allows them to prevent [[houseflies]] and [[blowflies]] from laying eggs in decaying matter by consuming larvae of other species. This matters because compost systems inhabited by houseflies and blowflies carry a much greater stench than systems inhabited by BSFL, making'' H. illucens'' a more human-friendly way to minimize food waste.<ref name=\"compiled research\">{{cite web | url=http://biosystemsblog.com/2008/07/09/black-soldier-fly-compiled-research-on-best-cultivation-practices/ | title=Black Soldier Fly: Compiled Research On Best Cultivation Practices | publisher=Research Resources | date=9 July 2008}}</ref>\n*They are not a pest to humans. Unlike houseflies, adult black soldier flies have greatly-reduced sponging mouthparts and can only consume liquids such as flower nectar or do not eat at all. They do not regurgitate food along with digestive enzymes like houseflies, thus do not spread diseases.<ref name=\"Cranshaw\">{{cite book | date=2017 | first1=Whitney | first2=David | edition=2nd | isbn=978-1-4008-8894-8 | last1=Cranshaw | title=Garden Insects of North America: The Ultimate Guide to Backyard Bugs | publisher=Princeton University Press | last2=Shetlar | page=510}}</ref>\n*They are not attracted to human habitation or foods.<ref name=\"compiled research\" /> As a [[detritivore]] and [[coprovore]], the egg-bearing females are attracted to rotting food or manure.\n*Black soldier flies do not fly around as much as houseflies. They have less expendable energy due to their limited ability to consume food as adults. They are very easy to catch and relocate when they get inside a house, as they do not avoid being picked up, they are sanitary, and they neither bite nor sting. Their only defense seems to be hiding. When using a wet grub bin that will collect or kill all the pupae, the black soldier fly population is easy to reduce by killing the pupae/prepupae in the collection container, before they become flies. They may be killed by freezing, drying, manually feeding to domestic animals, putting the collection container in a chicken coop for automatic feeding, or feeding to wild birds with a mouse/pest-proof feeder.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thebiopod.com/forum/index.php?topic=122.msg405#msg405 | title=Feeding Grubs to Birds EXPERIMENT}}</ref>\n*Significant reductions of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and'' Salmonella enterica'' were measured in hen manure after larvae activity was added onto the manure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Marilyn C.|last2=Islam|first2=Mahbub|last3=Sheppard|first3=Craig|last4=Liao|first4=Jean|last5=Doyle|first5=Michael P.|date=April 2004|title=Reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in chicken manure by larvae of the black soldier fly|journal=Journal of Food Protection|volume=67|issue=4|pages=685\u2013690|doi=10.4315/0362-028x-67.4.685|issn=0362-028X|pmid=15083719|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f1450fa78326f7f8d17d6412a2f38875a4964050}}</ref>\n*They quickly reclaim [[wiktionary:would-be|would-be]] pollutants: Nine organic chemicals were greatly reduced or eliminated from manure in 24 hours.<ref name=\"alt to fish\">{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/15054/research-summary:-black-soldier-fly-prepupae-a-compelling-alternative-to-fish-meal-and-fish-oil|title=Research Summary: Black Soldier Fly Prepupae \u2013 A Compelling Alternative to Fish Meal and Fish Oil|date=February 14, 2011}}</ref>\n*They quickly reduce the volume and weight of would-be waste: The larval colony breaks apart its food, churns it, and creates heat, increasing compost evaporation. Significant amounts are also converted to [[carbon dioxide]] respired by the grubs and [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]/[[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] microorganisms. BSFL in a compost system typically reduce the volume of compost by around 50%.\n\nAside from the protein production, fly larvae also produce another valuable resource called [[frass]].

This is usually done by enticing the soldier flies to lay eggs in small holes over the grub bin. Adult flies lay clusters of eggs in the edges of [[corrugated cardboard]] or [[corrugated plastic]]. In some regions, it is possible to start or maintain adequate larvae colonies from native soldier flies; however, pest species such as houseflies and blowflies are also drawn to many of the foods used to attract soldier flies (such as fermented chicken feed).\n\nIn tropical or subtropical climates, they might breed year-round, but in other climates, a greenhouse may be needed to obtain eggs in the cooler periods. The grubs are quite hardy and can handle more acidic conditions and higher temperatures than [[redworm]]s. Larvae can survive cold winters, particularly with large numbers of grubs, insulation, or [[compost]] heat (generated by the microorganisms in the grub bin or compost pile). Heat stimulates the grubs to crawl off, pupate, and hatch, and a great deal of light and heat seem to be required for breeding. Many small-scale grub farmers build their larval colonies from eggs deposited by wild soldier flies.\n\n==== Space and shape ====\nNewly emerged soldier flies perform the beginning of their mating ritual in flight.  The male grabs onto the female, and then grasps the female's ovipositor with his genitals.  They mate while stationary and connected.\n\nGerman scientists have successfully bred soldier flies in a space as small as 10 liters.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thebiopod.com/forum/index.php?topic=175.msg1783#msg1783 | title=Breeding BSF in captivity / Re: not easy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-08 | archive-date=2013-11-12 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112175106/http://www.terrarienbilder.com/vb/futtertiere_und_futterpflanzen/315-zucht_der_schwarzen_soldatenfliege_hermetia_illucens.html | url=http://www.terrarienbilder.com/vb/futtertiere_und_futterpflanzen/315-zucht_der_schwarzen_soldatenfliege_hermetia_illucens.html | title=Zucht der schwarzen Soldatenfliege (Hermetia illucens) | date=2010-04-02 | last=Jetter | first=Michael | language=de | trans-title=Breeding the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) | url-status=dead | website=Terrarienbilder.com}}</ref>\n\n==== Heat ====\nAdults typically mated and oviposited at temperatures of {{convert|24|to|40|C|F}} or more.

Most attempts to raise large numbers of larvae with redworms in the same container, at the same time, are unsuccessful. Worms have been able to survive in/under grub bins when the bottom is the ground. Redworms can live in grub bins when a large number of larvae are not present. Worms can be added if the larval population gets low (in the cold season) and worms can be raised in grub bins while awaiting eggs from wild black soldier flies.\n\nAs a feeder species, BSFL are not known to be [[intermediate host]]s of [[parasitic worm]]s that infect poultry, while redworms are host to many.<ref name=\"worm table\">{{cite web | url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/htm/bc/tpou05.htm | title=TABLE 05: Common Helminths of Poultry | work=The Merck Veterinary Manual / Poultry / Helminthiasis | accessdate=April 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Names and trademarks ====\nBSFL were developed as a feeder insect for exotic pets by D.

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.

He has been redesigned: now taller and more muscular than before.<ref name=\"scarf\"/> As a somewhat exaggerated reference to his mainstream counterpart's easily deceived personality (as well being based on the stereotypical team muscles), Knuckles is also portrayed as being somewhat slow-witted and goofy in this series.\n\n==Reception and impact==\nThe character has received positive attention.

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.

He takes guarding Master Emerald seriously and has a fearsome temper with a \"chip on his shoulder\".

After returning home for the third season, he joins Sonic on the spaceship, \"Blue Typhoon\", which is captained by Tails after their planet was invaded by the Metarex.\n\nKnuckles is among the main cast in the ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' computer-animated series. He has been redesigned: now taller and more muscular than before.<ref name=\"scarf\"/> As a somewhat exaggerated reference to his mainstream counterpart's easily deceived personality (as well being based on the stereotypical team muscles), Knuckles is also portrayed as being somewhat slow-witted and goofy in this series.\n\n==Reception and impact==\nThe character has received positive attention.
