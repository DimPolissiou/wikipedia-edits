His mother is from the Dinka of Bahr El Ghazal. His mother was said to have a huge influence to young Ahmad. Ahmad had originally been a household slave in [[El Khandaq|al-Khanadaq]], then a center of commerce. He was later acquired by Mahdist forces under [[Wad el Nujumi]] to serve in the Mahdists 1889 invasion of Egypt. Ahmad either deserted or was taken prisoner by Anglo-Egyptian forces following the [[Battle of Toski]], and ended up enlisted in the [[Egyptian Army]].<ref name=\"Lamothe\"/>\n\nHis mother, al-Sabr, was of [[Dinka]] origin, and had formerly been a slave in al-Khanadaq before marrying his father.<ref name=\"Lamothe\"/>\n\n==Military service==\nLike many Sudanese of slave origins, Latif joined the military, as it offered one of the few means of social mobility. Whilst his father had served in the Egyptian Army, it was actually largely due to his mother than Latif was able to rise into the emerging middle class, commonly referred to as the effendiyya. When Latif moved from Ed Dueim to Khartoum c.1900, he was able to find support from his maternal uncle, Rihan Abd Allah, who his mother had connected him with.

Ahmad had originally been a household slave in [[El Khandaq|al-Khanadaq]], then a center of commerce. He was later acquired by Mahdist forces under [[Wad el Nujumi]] to serve in the Mahdists 1889 invasion of Egypt. Ahmad either deserted or was taken prisoner by Anglo-Egyptian forces following the [[Battle of Toski]], and ended up enlisted in the [[Egyptian Army]].<ref name=\"Lamothe\"/>\n\nHis mother, al-Sabr, was of [[Dinka]] origin, and had formerly been a slave in al-Khanadaq before marrying his father.<ref name=\"Lamothe\"/>\n\n==Military service==\nLike many Sudanese of slave origins, Latif joined the military, as it offered one of the few means of social mobility. Whilst his father had served in the Egyptian Army, it was actually largely due to his mother than Latif was able to rise into the emerging middle class, commonly referred to as the effendiyya. When Latif moved from Ed Dueim to Khartoum c.1900, he was able to find support from his maternal uncle, Rihan Abd Allah, who his mother had connected him with. Abd Allah may not have actually been Latif's biological uncle, but instead the term may have just arisen from Abd Allah sharing Latif's mothers Dinka and [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] roots.

Under the guise of pastoral characters, it is an examination of love and contains many allusions to contemporary literary figures. It enjoyed a modest success, but was not soon reprinted; its promised sequel was never published, and presumably never written.{{Speculation-inline}}\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe main characters of the Galatea are Elicio and Erastro, best friends and both in love with Galatea. \nThe novel opens with her and her best friend, Florisa, bathing, talking of love.\nErastro and Elicio reveal to each other their desire for Galatea, but agree not to let it come between their friendship.\nEventually, all four of them begin their journey to the wedding of Daranio and Silveria, along which, in the pastoral tradition, they encounter other characters who tell their own stories and often join the traveling group.\n\nThe vast majority of the characters in the book are involved primarily in minor story lines.\nLisandro loses his love, Leonida, when Crisalvo mistakenly kills her instead of his former love Silvia.\nLisandro avenges Leonida's death in the presence of the main party.\nAstor, under the pseudonym Silerio, feigns attraction for N\u00edsida\u2019s sister Blanca in order to avoid the scorn of N\u00edsida\u2019s lover Timbrio, who dies following the confusion present after a successful duel against his rival Pransiles.\nAstor\u2019s grief thrusts him into hermitage, waiting to hear from N\u00edsida.\nArsindo holds a poetry competition betwixt Francenio and Lauso, which is judged by Tirsi and Dam\u00f3n, lauded by many within the novel as some of the most famous poets of Spain. The competition is determined to have no single winner.\nThe wedding has controversy as Mireno is deeply in love with Silveria, yet Daranio\u2019s wealth guaranteed him the hand of Silveria.\n\nThese stories sometimes have characters that cross over, resulting in the sub-plots being intertwined at times.\nFor example, Teolinda, whose sister Leonida played in an integral role in separating Teolinda from her lover Artidoro, finds Leonida much later with a group of soldiers.\nThe fame of Tirsi and Dam\u00f3n instantly connects them with the hired wedding bards, Orompo, Crisio, Marsilio, and Orfenio, as well as the teacher Arsindo.\n\n==The Work==\n\n''La Galatea'' is an imitation of the ''Diana'' of [[Jorge de Montemayor]], and shows an even greater resemblance to [[Gaspar Gil Polo]]'s continuation of the ''Diana''. Next to ''Don Quixote'' and the ''Novelas exemplares'', his pastoral romance is considered particularly notable because it predicts the poetic direction in which Cervantes would go for the rest of his career. It possesses little originality, but is highly reminiscent of its models, and particularly of the ''Diana'' of Gil Polo.\n\nIn composing this pastoral romance, Cervantes seems to have intended to use the tale merely as an excuse for a rich collection of poems in the old Spanish and Italian styles. The story is merely the thread, which holds the beautiful garland together; the poems are the portion most deserving of attention. They are many and various, and uphold Cervantes' claim to rank among the most eminent poets, whether in reference to verse or to prose.  Should his originality in versified composition be called in question, a close study of ''Galatea'' must banish all doubt.<!-- opinion? -->\n\nContemporaries of Cervantes claimed that he was incapable of writing poetry, and that he could compose only beautiful prose; but that observation referred solely to his dramatic works. Every critic sufficiently acquainted with his lyrical compositions has rendered justice to their merit. From the romance of ''Galatea'', Cervantes must have composed in all the various kinds of syllabic measure used in his time. He even occasionally adopted the old dactylic [[stanza]]. He appears to have experienced some difficulty in the metrical form of the [[sonnet]], but his poems in Italian octaves display great facility.  Among these, the ''song of Caliope'', in the last book of the '' Galatea'', stands out.\n\nIn the same manner as Gil Polo in his ''Diana'', he makes the river [[Turia (river)|Turia]] pronounce the praises of the celebrated Valencians. The poetic fancy of Cervantes summons the muse [[Calliope]] before the shepherds and shepherdesses, to render solemn homage to those contemporaries whom he esteems worthy of distinction as poets. The most beautiful poems in the ''Galatea'' are a few in the [[cancion]] style, some of which are [[Iamb (foot)|iambics]], and some in [[trochee|trochaic]] or Old Spanish verse. Cervantes has here and there indulged in those antiquated and fantastic plays of wit, which at a subsequent period he himself ridiculed.\n\n==Themes==\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}\n;Upbringings and life-styles\n:One of the primary treatments in the Galatea, and most evident in the contrast between Elicio and Erastro, is the perception of rural and city folk and their lives.  Elicio, a cultured shepherd, and Erastro, a ''r\u00fastico ganadero'' (rustic herdsman) are an odd pair of friends, and throughout the novel their differing views come out in conversations with other characters.  Erastro, though from the rural parts of Spain, is very eloquent in speech\u2014a trait that surprises many.  However, because of his background, Erastro feels disadvantaged in his desire for Galatea, who had a very cultured upbringing similar to Elicio\u2019s.  A similar discussion ensues when a group of soldiers meets the group and one of them, Darinto, describes his view of pastoral (or rural) life as being a simple one, without all the complications, formalities and expenses of city life.  Dam\u00f3n replies that the rural life is not as glorious or desirable as Darinto imagines: there are just as many chores and other things to do in country life as in city life, and so is not the relaxing simple life described.\n;Friendship\n;Love, affection, and desire <!--book 1, xviii-->\n\n==Second Part==\nThe original title published with the work now simply known as the Galatea was ''La primera parte de la Galatea'' (The First Part of the Galatea).\nCervantes indicated on numerous occasions during his life he planned to publish a second part, even in the ending of the first part:\n\n''El fin deste amoroso cuento y historia [...] con otras cosas sucedidas a los pastores hasta aqu\u00ed nombrados, en la segunda parte desta historia se prometen, la cual, si con apacibles voluntades esta primera viene rescibida, tendr\u00e1 atrevimiento a salir con brevedad a ser vista de los ojos y entendimiento de las gentes'' (The end of this amorous story and tale [...] with other things which occurred to the shepherds named up to this point here, are promised for the second part of this story, which, if this first one is received with a good disposition, will dare to appear soon, to be observed by the eyes and understanding of the people.)\n\nIn Cervantes' later novel, ''[[Don Quixote]]'', ''La Galatea'' appears in the book burning scene. Its worth is measured as satisfactory in itself, but both the Barber and Curate agree the plot matters little without a Second Part.\nThe Galatea enjoyed moderate success, but any work that Cervantes may have begun on a conclusion was lost to history following his death.\n\n==In other media==\nThe book is used in the Starz series, ''Black Sails''.

Under the guise of pastoral characters, it is an examination of love and contains many allusions to contemporary literary figures. It enjoyed a modest success, but was not soon reprinted; its promised sequel was never published, and presumably never written.{{Speculation-inline}}\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe main characters of the Galatea are Elicio and Erastro, best friends and both in love with Galatea. \nThe novel opens with her and her best friend, Florisa, bathing, talking of love.\nErastro and Elicio reveal to each other their desire for Galatea, but agree not to let it come between their friendship.\nEventually, all four of them begin their journey to the wedding of Daranio and Silveria, along which, in the pastoral tradition, they encounter other characters who tell their own stories and often join the traveling group.\n\nThe vast majority of the characters in the book are involved primarily in minor story lines.\nLisandro loses his love, Leonida, when Crisalvo mistakenly kills her instead of his former love Silvia.\nLisandro avenges Leonida's death in the presence of the main party.\nAstor, under the pseudonym Silerio, feigns attraction for N\u00edsida\u2019s sister Blanca in order to avoid the scorn of N\u00edsida\u2019s lover Timbrio, who dies following the confusion present after a successful duel against his rival Pransiles.\nAstor\u2019s grief thrusts him into hermitage, waiting to hear from N\u00edsida.\nArsindo holds a poetry competition betwixt Francenio and Lauso, which is judged by Tirsi and Dam\u00f3n, lauded by many within the novel as some of the most famous poets of Spain. The competition is determined to have no single winner.\nThe wedding has controversy as Mireno is deeply in love with Silveria, yet Daranio\u2019s wealth guaranteed him the hand of Silveria.\n\nThese stories sometimes have characters that cross over, resulting in the sub-plots being intertwined at times.\nFor example, Teolinda, whose sister Leonida played in an integral role in separating Teolinda from her lover Artidoro, finds Leonida much later with a group of soldiers.\nThe fame of Tirsi and Dam\u00f3n instantly connects them with the hired wedding bards, Orompo, Crisio, Marsilio, and Orfenio, as well as the teacher Arsindo.\n\n==The Work==\n\n''La Galatea'' is an imitation of the ''Diana'' of [[Jorge de Montemayor]], and shows an even greater resemblance to [[Gaspar Gil Polo]]'s continuation of the ''Diana''. Next to ''Don Quixote'' and the ''Novelas exemplares'', his pastoral romance is considered particularly notable because it predicts the poetic direction in which Cervantes would go for the rest of his career. It possesses little originality, but is highly reminiscent of its models, and particularly of the ''Diana'' of Gil Polo.\n\nIn composing this pastoral romance, Cervantes seems to have intended to use the tale merely as an excuse for a rich collection of poems in the old Spanish and Italian styles. The story is merely the thread, which holds the beautiful garland together; the poems are the portion most deserving of attention. They are many and various, and uphold Cervantes' claim to rank among the most eminent poets, whether in reference to verse or to prose.  Should his originality in versified composition be called in question, a close study of ''Galatea'' must banish all doubt.<!-- opinion? -->\n\nContemporaries of Cervantes claimed that he was incapable of writing poetry, and that he could compose only beautiful prose; but that observation referred solely to his dramatic works. Every critic sufficiently acquainted with his lyrical compositions has rendered justice to their merit. From the romance of ''Galatea'', Cervantes must have composed in all the various kinds of syllabic measure used in his time. He even occasionally adopted the old dactylic [[stanza]]. He appears to have experienced some difficulty in the metrical form of the [[sonnet]], but his poems in Italian octaves display great facility.  Among these, the ''song of Caliope'', in the last book of the '' Galatea'', stands out.\n\nIn the same manner as Gil Polo in his ''Diana'', he makes the river [[Turia (river)|Turia]] pronounce the praises of the celebrated Valencians. The poetic fancy of Cervantes summons the muse [[Calliope]] before the shepherds and shepherdesses, to render solemn homage to those contemporaries whom he esteems worthy of distinction as poets. The most beautiful poems in the ''Galatea'' are a few in the [[cancion]] style, some of which are [[Iamb (foot)|iambics]], and some in [[trochee|trochaic]] or Old Spanish verse. Cervantes has here and there indulged in those antiquated and fantastic plays of wit, which at a subsequent period he himself ridiculed.\n\n==Themes==\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}\n;Upbringings and life-styles\n:One of the primary treatments in the Galatea, and most evident in the contrast between Elicio and Erastro, is the perception of rural and city folk and their lives.  Elicio, a cultured shepherd, and Erastro, a ''r\u00fastico ganadero'' (rustic herdsman) are an odd pair of friends, and throughout the novel their differing views come out in conversations with other characters.  Erastro, though from the rural parts of Spain, is very eloquent in speech \u2014 a trait that surprises many.  However, because of his background, Erastro feels disadvantaged in his desire for Galatea, who had a very cultured upbringing similar to Elicio\u2019s.  A similar discussion ensues when a group of soldiers meets the group and one of them, Darinto, describes his view of pastoral (or rural) life as being a simple one, without all the complications, formalities and expenses of city life.  Dam\u00f3n replies that the rural life is not as glorious or desirable as Darinto imagines: there are just as many chores and other things to do in country life as in city life, and so is not the relaxing simple life described.\n;Friendship\n;Love, affection, and desire <!--book 1, xviii-->\n\n==Second Part==\nThe original title published with the work now simply known as the Galatea was ''La primera parte de la Galatea'' (The First Part of the Galatea).\nCervantes indicated on numerous occasions during his life he planned to publish a second part, even in the ending of the first part:\n\n''El fin deste amoroso cuento y historia [...] con otras cosas sucedidas a los pastores hasta aqu\u00ed nombrados, en la segunda parte desta historia se prometen, la cual, si con apacibles voluntades esta primera viene rescibida, tendr\u00e1 atrevimiento a salir con brevedad a ser vista de los ojos y entendimiento de las gentes'' (The end of this amorous story and tale [...] with other things which occurred to the shepherds named up to this point here, are promised for the second part of this story, which, if this first one is received with a good disposition, will dare to appear soon, to be observed by the eyes and understanding of the people.)\n\nIn Cervantes' later novel, ''[[Don Quixote]]'', ''La Galatea'' appears in the book burning scene. Its worth is measured as satisfactory in itself, but both the Barber and Curate agree the plot matters little without a Second Part.\nThe Galatea enjoyed moderate success, but any work that Cervantes may have begun on a conclusion was lost to history following his death.\n\n==In other media==\nThe book is used in the Starz series, ''Black Sails''.  In the third episode of the second season, Captain Flint leaves a copy of ''La Galatea'' at the doorstep of his close friend, Miranda Barlow.\n\n==References==\nMiguel de Cervantes Saavedra.

Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]'' with the ''tirthankaras'' guiding every cycle of the [[Jain cosmology]]. Their religious texts are called Agamas.\n\nThe main religious premises of Jainism are ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahi\u1e43s\u0101]]'' (non-violence), ''[[anek\u0101ntav\u0101da]]'' (many-sidedness), ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-attachment) and ''[[asceticism]]''. Devout Jains take five main vows: ''[[ahi\u1e43s\u0101]]'' (non-violence), ''[[satya]]'' (truth), ''[[asteya]]'' (not stealing), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (celibacy or chastity or sexual continence), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. ''[[Parasparopagraho J\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m]]'' (the function of souls is to help one another) is the motto of Jainism. ''[[\u1e46am\u014dk\u0101ra mantra]]'' is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism.\n\nJainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, [[Digambara]]s and [[\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara]]s; Several smaller sub-traditions emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical. [[Jain monasticism|Jain mendicants]] are found in all Jain sub-traditions except [[Kanji Panth]] sub-tradition, with [[Laity|laypersons]] (''[[\u015ar\u0101vaka (Jainism)|\u015br\u0101vakas]]'') supporting the mendicants' spiritual pursuits with resources.\n\nJainism has between four and five million followers, with most Jains residing in [[Jainism in India|India]]. Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities are present in [[Jainism in Canada|Canada]], [[Jainism in Europe|Europe]], [[Jainism in Africa|Kenya]], the [[Jainism in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Jainism in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Suriname]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Jainism in the United States|United States]]. Jainism is also growing in [[Jainism in Japan|Japan]], where more than 5,000 ethnic Japanese families have converted to Jainism. Major Jain festivals include [[Paryushana]] and Daslakshana, Ashtanika, [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]], and [[Diwali (Jainism)|Dipawali]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Main principles==\n===Non-violence (''ahimsa'')===\n{{anchor|ahi\u1e43s\u0101}}{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}\n[[File:Ahinsa Parmo Dharm 1.jpg|thumb|Relief representing ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'']]\n[[File:Ahimsa Jainism Gradient.jpg|thumb|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes [[Ahimsa in Jainism|''Ahi\u1e43s\u0101'' in Jainism]].

The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer \"it is\" or \"it is not\" to metaphysical questions. The Mah\u0101v\u012bra, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both \"it is\", and \"it is not\", with \"perhaps\" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128\u2013135}} ''Sy\u0101dv\u0101da'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''nayav\u0101da'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anek\u0101ntav\u0101da''.

For Jain laypersons, it recommends limited possession of property that has been honestly earned, and giving excess property to charity.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}} According to Natubhai Shah, ''aparigraha'' applies to both the material and the psychic.

However, it is envisioned as a material substance (subtle matter) that can bind to the soul, travel with the soul substance in bound form between rebirths, and affect the suffering and happiness experienced by the ''jiva'' in the ''lokas''.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=92\u201395}} Karma is also believed to obscure and obstruct the innate nature and striving of the soul, as well as its spiritual potential in the next rebirth.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=99\u2013103}}\n\nThe relationship between the soul and karma, states Padmanabh Jaini, can be explained with the analogy of gold. Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold.

Jainism, like Buddhism and Hinduism, grants the freedom to choose beliefs such as in gods or no-gods, agree or disagree with core teachings, participate or not participate in prayers, rituals and festivals. They all consider ethical values such as non-violence to be important,{{sfn|Shaw|Demy|2017|p=635|quote=Ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (to do no harm) is a significant aspect of three major religions: Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism}} and link suffering to craving, individual's actions, intents, and karma, and believe spirituality is a means to enlightened peace, bliss and eternal liberation (''moksha'').{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18\u201322}}{{sfn|McFaul|2006|pp=27\u201340}}\n\nJainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. All of them believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates, amongst other things, the premise of ''[[anatta]]'' (\"non-self\", \"no eternal self or soul\"). Hinduism incorporates the premise of an eternal unchanging ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' (\"self\", \"soul\"), while Jainism incorporates the premises of a ''jiva'' (\"self\", \"soul\") that is both eternal and changing.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87\u201388}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2\u20135}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122\u2013125}} In Jaina thought, there are infinite eternal ''jivas'', predominantly all of which are in their cycles of rebirth, and a few who have liberated themselves through an ascetic life and become ''siddhas'' (a perfect one).{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=157\u2013158, 168\u2013169}} In contrast to Jainism, Hindu philosophies express a spectrum of views, ranging from [[advaita|nondualism]] where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one, to [[dvaita|dualism]] where souls are same and have Brahman-nature but are different from Brahman, and to other ideas.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=54\u201362, 77\u201382, 132}}{{sfn|Perrett|2013|pp=247\u2013248}}{{sfn|Bartley|2013|pp=1\u201310, 76\u201379, 87\u201398}}\n\nWhile both Hinduism and Jainism believe \"soul exists\" to be a self-evident truth, most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and constant (''[[vibhu]]''), but some Hindu scholars proposed soul to be atomic. Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and [[Brahman]] through a monistic or dualistic framework. In contrast, Jaina thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=58, 102\u2013105}}\n\nJainism is similar to Buddhism in [[epistemology|epistemically]] rejecting the Vedas and the Hindu metaphysical concept for Reality called Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe \"soul exists\" as a self-evident truth, and in their historic theology and practice have been more similar than with Buddhism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010b|pp=174\u2013175}}{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18\u201322}} Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried over their history, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Kelting|2009|pp=206 note 4}}\n\nSome early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the caste system in Hinduism.{{sfn|Nesfield|1885|pp=116\u2013117}}{{sfn|Pope|1880|pp=40\u201341}} Later scholars, such as Gombrich state that this notion is an error for which \"mainly Western authors are responsible\".{{sfn|Alberts|2007|pp=258\u2013259}} A caste system has been a historic part of Jain society.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=147\u2013149, 304 footnote 24}}{{sfn|Babb|1996|pp=137\u2013145, 54, 172}} According to Vilas Adinath Sangave, \"caste system is a universal feature of the Jaina community\", and the focus of Jainism has been the spiritual liberation of the individual rather than social reforms.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|pp=73, 316\u2013317}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Richard Gombrich]] and other scholars, Buddhism too was not a rejection or rebellion against any ancient caste system and it too was focused on individual's liberation from rebirths and suffering.

Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]'' with the ''tirthankaras'' guiding every cycle of the [[Jain cosmology]]. Their religious texts are called Agamas.\n\nThe main religious premises of Jainism are ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahi\u1e43s\u0101]]'' (non-violence), ''[[anek\u0101ntav\u0101da]]'' (many-sidedness), ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-attachment) and ''[[asceticism]]''. Devout Jains take five main vows: ''[[ahi\u1e43s\u0101]]'' (non-violence), ''[[satya]]'' (truth), ''[[asteya]]'' (not stealing), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (celibacy or chastity or sexual continence), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. ''[[Parasparopagraho J\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m]]'' (the function of souls is to help one another) is the motto of Jainism. ''[[\u1e46am\u014dk\u0101ra mantra]]'' is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism.\n\nJainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, [[Digambara]]s and [[\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara]]s; Several smaller sub-traditions emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical. [[Jain monasticism|Jain mendicants]] are found in all Jain sub-traditions except [[Kanji Panth]] sub-tradition, with [[Laity|laypersons]] (''[[\u015ar\u0101vaka (Jainism)|\u015br\u0101vakas]]'') supporting the mendicants' spiritual pursuits with resources.\n\nJainism has between four and five million followers, with most Jains residing in [[Jainism in India|India]]. Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities are present in [[Jainism in Canada|Canada]], [[Jainism in Europe|Europe]], [[Jainism in Africa|Kenya]], the [[Jainism in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Jainism in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Suriname]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Jainism in the United States|United States]]. Jainism is also growing in [[Jainism in Japan|Japan]], where more than 5,000 ethnic Japanese families have converted to Jainism. Major Jain festivals include [[Paryushana]] and Daslakshana, Ashtanika, [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]], and [[Diwali (Jainism)|Dipawali]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Main principles==\n===Non-violence (''ahimsa'')===\n{{anchor|ahi\u1e43s\u0101}}{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}\n[[File:Ahinsa Parmo Dharm 1.jpg|thumb|Relief representing ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'']]\n[[File:Ahimsa Jainism Gradient.jpg|thumb|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes [[Ahimsa in Jainism|''Ahi\u1e43s\u0101'' in Jainism]].

It states that any karma leads to a negation of the \"absolute non-violence\" principle, given man's limited perspective.

The Jain Agamas suggest that Mah\u0101v\u012bra's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a \"qualified yes\" (''sy\u0101t'').{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301\u2013305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205\u2013218}} These texts identify ''anek\u0101ntav\u0101da'' doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Mah\u0101v\u012bra and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer \"it is\" or \"it is not\" to metaphysical questions. The Mah\u0101v\u012bra, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both \"it is\", and \"it is not\", with \"perhaps\" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128\u2013135}} ''Sy\u0101dv\u0101da'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''nayav\u0101da'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anek\u0101ntav\u0101da''. ''Sy\u0101dv\u0101da'' recommends the expression of ''anek\u0101nta'' by prefixing the epithet ''sy\u0101d'' to every phrase or expression describing the \"permanent being\".{{sfn|Koller|2000|pp=400\u2013407}}{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=48\u201351}} There is no creator God in Jainism; existence has neither beginning nor end, and the permanent being is conceptualized as ''jiva'' (soul) and ''ajiva'' (matter) within a dualistic ''anek\u0101ntav\u0101da'' framework.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90\u201399, 104\u2013105, 229\u2013233}}\n\nAccording to Paul Dundas, in contemporary times the ''anek\u0101ntav\u0101da'' doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to \"promote a universal religious tolerance\", and a teaching of \"plurality\" and \"benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions\". Dundas states this is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mah\u0101v\u012bra's teachings.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232\u2013234}} The \"many pointedness, multiple perspective\" teachings of the Mah\u0101v\u012bra is a doctrine about the nature of [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute reality]] and human existence, and it is sometimes called \"non-absolutism\" doctrine.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=86\u201391}} However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, nor violence against disbelievers or any other living being as \"perhaps right\".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232\u2013234}} The five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no \"perhaps\" or \"that is just one perspective\" about them.{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98\u2013106}} Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism according to Dundas, but Jainism had a disagreement of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}\n\n===Non-attachment (''aparigraha'')===\n{{anchor|aparigraha}}{{Main|Aparigraha}}\n\nThe third main principle in Jainism is ''aparigraha'' which means non-attachment to worldly possessions.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}} For ascetics, Jainism requires a vow of complete non-possession of any property.

Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold. One can exert effort and purify gold, similarly, Jainism states that the defiled soul can be purified by proper refining methodology.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=107}} Karma either defiles the soul further, or refines it to a cleaner state, and this affects future rebirths.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=107\u2013115}} Karma is thus an [[efficient cause]] (''nimitta'') in Jain philosophy, but not the [[material cause]] (''upadana'').

Jainism, like Buddhism and Hinduism, grants the freedom to choose beliefs such as in gods or no-gods, agree or disagree with core teachings, participate or not participate in prayers, rituals and festivals. They all consider ethical values such as non-violence to be important,{{sfn|Shaw|Demy|2017|p=635|quote=Ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (to do no harm) is a significant aspect of three major religions: Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism}} and link suffering to craving, individual's actions, intents, and karma, and believe spirituality is a means to enlightened peace, bliss and eternal liberation (''moksha'').{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18\u201322}}{{sfn|McFaul|2006|pp=27\u201340}}\n\nJainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. All of them believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates, amongst other things, the premise of ''[[anatta]]'' (\"non-self\", \"no eternal self or soul\"). Hinduism incorporates the premise of an eternal unchanging ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' (\"self\", \"soul\"), while Jainism incorporates the premises of a ''jiva'' (\"self\", \"soul\") that is both eternal and changing.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87\u201388}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2\u20135}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122\u2013125}} In Jaina thought, there are infinite eternal ''jivas'', predominantly all of which are in their cycles of rebirth, and a few who have liberated themselves through an ascetic life and become ''siddhas'' (a perfect one).{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=157\u2013158, 168\u2013169}} In contrast to Jainism, Hindu philosophies express a spectrum of views, ranging from [[advaita|nondualism]] where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one, to [[dvaita|dualism]] where souls are same and have Brahman-nature but are different from Brahman, and to other ideas.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=54\u201362, 77\u201382, 132}}{{sfn|Perrett|2013|pp=247\u2013248}}{{sfn|Bartley|2013|pp=1\u201310, 76\u201379, 87\u201398}}\n\nWhile both Hinduism and Jainism believe \"soul exists\" to be a self-evident truth, most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and constant (''[[vibhu]]''), but some Hindu scholars proposed soul to be atomic. Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and [[Brahman]] through a monistic or dualistic framework. In contrast, Jaina thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=58, 102\u2013105}}\n\nJainism is similar to Buddhism in [[epistemology|epistemically]] rejecting the Vedas and the Hindu metaphysical concept for Reality called Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe \"soul exists\" as a self-evident truth, and in their historic theology and practice have been more similar than with Buddhism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010b|pp=174\u2013175}}{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18\u201322}} Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried over their history, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Kelting|2009|pp=206 note 4}}\n\nSome early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the caste system in Hinduism.{{sfn|Nesfield|1885|pp=116\u2013117}}{{sfn|Pope|1880|pp=40\u201341}} Later scholars, such as Gombrich state that this notion is an error for which \"mainly Western authors are responsible\".{{sfn|Alberts|2007|pp=258\u2013259}} A caste system has been a historic part of Jain society.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=147\u2013149, 304 footnote 24}}{{sfn|Babb|1996|pp=137\u2013145, 54, 172}} According to Vilas Adinath Sangave, \"caste system is a universal feature of the Jaina community\", and the focus of Jainism has been the spiritual liberation of the individual rather than social reforms.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|pp=73, 316\u2013317}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Richard Gombrich]] and other scholars, Buddhism too was not a rejection or rebellion against any ancient caste system and it too was focused on individual's liberation from rebirths and suffering.
