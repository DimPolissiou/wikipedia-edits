It was converted to an amphibious landing control vessel during the war and reclassified a Patrol Craft - Control or PCC.  It participated in six amphibious invasions as a control vessel.\n\n== Commissioning ==\n''PC-598'' was commissioned in Portland, Oregon on 5 March 1943, Lieutenant Benjamin V. Harrison, Jr. commanding.  With her new crew of \"plank owners\" she left the [[Commercial Iron Works]] pier on the [[Willamette River]] on 13 March for Astoria and then Seattle, Washington arriving on 15 March.  In Seattle, she took on provisions and munitions, and the crew received additional anti-aircraft gunnery training. On 31 March the ship test fired its [[3\"/50 caliber gun|3\"/50]], [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm]] guns off Marrowstone Point.<ref>''PC-598 Operational Remarks'', March 1943</ref>  The ship next relocated to San Diego arriving on 18 April.<ref>''PC-598 Administrative Remarks'', April 1943</ref> ''PC-598'' then moved on to San Francisco, arriving 5 May, loaded stores and departed for Pearl Harbor on 9 May.<ref>''PC-598 Administrative Remarks'', May 1943</ref>\n\n== Hawaii, Midway and Canton ==\nThe \"subchaser\" arrived in Pearl Harbor on 16 May 1943 and spent the next two months towing targets and picket duty on the sonar \"ping line\" patrolling for enemy submarines near Pearl Harbor.  On 7 August the ship sailed to [[Palmyra Atoll]] and [[Canton Island]].  The equator was crossed at 167 degrees West on 13 August and the new \"polliwogs\" were initiated by the experienced \"shellbacks\" among the crew into the [[Ancient Order of the Deep]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USS_PC-598_-_Ancient_Order_of_the_Deep,_13_August_1943.jpg| title=USS PC-598 - Ancient Order of the Deep, 13 August 1943| website=Wikimedia Commons}}</ref> [[File:USS PC-598 - Ancient Order of the Deep, 13 August 1943.jpg|thumb|400px|center|A ''PC-598'' crewman's Trusty Shellback card.]]The crew enjoyed the beach at [[Kanton Island|Canton]] and returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 August.

At Makin were [[USS Hydrographer (AGS-2)|''Hydrographer'']], there to survey the lagoon and anchorages, and the destroyer [[USS Capps (DD-550)|''Capps'']], late of [[Scapa Flow]], Scotland and [[Gibraltar]] in the [[Atlantic]].  Departing the atoll on 13 February, the ship stopped briefly at [[Funafuti]] on 16 February, anchoring alongside the repair ship [[USS Luzon (ARG-2)|''Luzon'']] and taking fuel and water from the minesweeper, [[USS YMS-290|''YMS-290'']].  The ship departed Funafuti on 16 February, detouring to collect the tanker [[ss Gulfbird|''Gulfbird'']] and escort it to Espiritu Santo, entering Selwyn Straight in the [[New Hebrides]] on 20 February.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1944</ref>  That same day, unable to raise anchor, 45 fathoms of chain and the anchor were cut loose and marked with a buoy to be recovered later by the tug [[USS Rail (AM-26)|''Rail'']], a Pearl Harbor survivor.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', March 1944, p. 4-5</ref>  On 27 February the ship was [[Degaussing|degaussed]] at Espiritu Santo to reduce the risk of detonating [[magnetic mines]].<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1944</ref>\n\n[[File:Pacific Theater showing areas of operation for PC-598.jpg|thumb|800px|center|The Pacific Theater showing locations visited by ''PC-598'' between May 1943 and August 1945]]\n\n=== Dull, monotonous duty in dismal surroundings ===\n\n[[wind force|Force 7]] winds and rough seas removed the upper racks [[Mousetrap (weapon)|Mousetrap]] and capstan control on 4 March.  ''PC-598'' spent 7\u20139 March hunting for a reported enemy submarine with the destroyer [[USS Coolbaugh (DE-217)|''Coolbaugh'']], later determined to be a wild goose chase.  The storm damage to the capstan was finally repaired 25 March. The same day the crew test fired their [[20mm Oerlikon]] guns at a towed sleeve in company with [[uss SC 502|''SC-502'']] and [[uss SC 639|''SC-639'']], finding the new Mark 14 sights produced poor results compared to the previous method involving the use of tracers. During March, the sub chaser escorted an odd assortment of ships to and from collection and dispersal points near Espritu Santo, including the transports [[USS Naos (AK-105)|''Naos'']] and [[USS Lyra (AK-101)|''Lyra'']],  a US Army cargo vessel [[US Army Ship F-53|''F-53'']], the tanker [[SS Cape Hatteras|''Cape Hatteras'']], the cargo vessel [[SS Tjibesar|''Tjibesar'']] and a Dutch merchant ship [[MV Boschfontein|''Boschfontein'']].  On 26 March the ship headed for [[Suva]], [[Fiji]] with two Liberty ships, [[SS Ethan A. Hitchcock|''Ethan A. Hitchcock'']] and [[SS Edwin Meredith|''Edwin Meredith'']].  ''Edwin Meredith'' peeled off on its own on 29 March, but ''Ethan A. Hitchcock'' continued on with the sub chaser to Suva, arriving 30 March.  ''PC-598'' then proceeded solo to Vunda Point at [[Viti Levu]] Island.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', March 1944</ref>\n\nThe PC returned from the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]] to Espritu Santo on 3 April, in company with the tanker [[SS Egg Harbor|''Egg Harbor'']].  April was spent operating in the area of Espiritu Santo, principally on escort duty in the company of other tankers including [[SS Soledad|''Soledad'']], [[SS Pequot Hill|''Pequot Hill'']], [[SS Crater Lake''|''Crater Lake'']], [[SS Sparrow's Point|''Sparrow's Point'']], [[SS Stanvac Capetown|''Stanvac Capetown'']] and [[SS Charlestown|''Charlestown'']].

Beginning 9 May, ''PC-598'' spent 4 days patrolling the Wawa Channel and then began a routine overhaul alongside [[USS Oceanus (ARB-2)|''Oceanus'']] that lasted until 19 May, during which the pesky Mark 4 sights were removed.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', May 1944, p.1</ref>\n\n=== Cruising with the Free French Navy ===\n\nOn 22 May the ship left for Guadalcanal escorting a convoy under the command of [[Savorgnan de Brazza (PG 78)|''Savorgnan de Brazza'']], a [[Free French]] ship which had sunk a [[Vichy]] sister ship of the same class in the [[Battle of Gabon]] in 1940 and rescued 76 survivors of the British ship [[SS Clan Macarthur|''Clan Macarthur'']], sunk in 1943 by a German submarine east of [[Madagascar]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bandcstaffregister.co.uk/page491.html| title=Clan MacArthur| website=The British and Commonwealth Shipping Company Limited}}</ref>  The convoy included the tanker [[SS Cape Pillar|''Cape Pillar'']], the Liberty ship [[SS Richard Moczkowski|''Richard Moczkowski'']] and the U.S. Army transport [[USAT William R.

The convoy arrived safely at Guadalcanal on 25 May and ''PC-598'' returned to Espiritu Santo to collect another.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', May 1944, p.2</ref>\n\n=== Marine airmen rescued at sea ===\n[[File:TBF mid1942.jpg|thumb|left|Gruman TBF Avenger Torpedo Bomber]]\nOn 30 May things got a bit more exciting for the ship.  While escorting [[USS Kalita|''Kalita'']] from Espiritu Santo to Guadalcanal, ''PC-598'' rescued two [[USMC]] airmen from a downed [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Gruman TBF-1 Avenger]] out of Turtle Bay Field, Espiritu Santo.  The plane, part of [[VMFA-323|Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 232 (VMTB-232)]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/USN/LLMay44.htm| title=USN Overseas Aircraft Loss List May 1944| website=Aviation Archaeological Investigation and Research, AAIR}}</ref> was on a routine flight but got lost in bad weather, ran low on gasoline and its crew decided to ditch the plane near the convoy.  The rescued crewmen were 1st Lieutenant A. J. Aune and Sergeant L. J. Eickhoff.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', May 1944, p.2</ref>\n\nThe convoy arrived safely on 1 June and the ship spent the next five days moored in [[Tulagi]] Harbor at [[Florida Island]] near Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.  For the remainder of June 1944, ''PC-598'' patrolled off Guadalcanal and escorted ships, including the Victory ship [[SS Canada Victory|''Canada Victory'']], later sunk by a [[kamikaze]] at Okinawa in April 1945,<ref>Askew, p. 242</ref> the Liberty ship [[SS Paul Revere|''Paul Revere'']], the cargo vessel [[USS Arided (AK-73)|''Arided'']] and Norwegian freighter [[SS Narvik|''Narvik'']].<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', June 1944</ref>  On 22 June Lieutenant (jg) Leo Hackney took command of the ship and Lieutenant Taylor was transferred to the [[Submarine Chaser Training Center]] in Miami.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', June 1944, p. 2</ref>\n\n=== Conversion to Patrol Craft - Control (PCC) ===\n\nThe ship returned to Espiritu Santo on 4 July, screening a convoy.  For the rest of July the ship remained moored at Espiritu Santo and the crew received gunnery, recognition and firefighting training at the island\u2019s \"Coconut College\".  Although not officially reclassified as such until after the end of the war,<ref>Silverstone, p.186</ref> it was here the ship was modified to accommodate its new role as a Patrol Craft - Control (PCC).<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', July 1944, p.1</ref>  Thirty-five PCs were converted to Patrol Craft - Control (PCC) for use in amphibious landing operations. Extra personnel (eight radiomen, two signalmen, one quartermaster and two communications officers), accommodations and communications equipment were added, the weight compensated for by removal of other equipment.

Between 26 and 29 August ''PC-598'' was involved in practice landings as a control ship off [[Cape Esperance]], Guadalcanal in preparation for the upcoming invasion of [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]].  Among the ships involved in the exercise was [[USS SC-669|''SC-669'']], the only SC class subchaser to receive credit for sinking an enemy submarine, [[Japanese submarine I-178|''I-178'']].<ref>Cressman, p. 162 - \"Submarine chaser ''SC-669'' sinks Japanese submarine ''I-178'' 30 miles west of Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, 15\u00b035'S, 166\u00b017'E.\"</ref>  The end of August saw ''PC-598'' moored at Purvis Bay, Florida Islands.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', August 1944</ref>\n\n== Invasion of Peleliu ==\n\n[[File:Assault on Peleliu - Map.jpg|thumb|left|Landing Beaches at Peleliu.]]\n\nOn 4 September 1944, ''PC-598'' formed up with the Tractor Group of the Western Attack Force and began anti-submarine screening on the way to the [[Battle of Peleliu|Invasion of Peleliu]].  The convoy arrived at Peleliu in the early morning of 15 September.  The invasion plan called for the [[1st Marine Division]] to assault the beachhead with three regiments. The 1st Marine Regiment (under the command of [[Chesty Puller|Colonel \"Chesty\" Puller]]) would be on the left flank, assaulting beaches White 1 and White 2.  In the center would be the 5th Marine Regiment assaulting beaches Orange 1 and Orange 2. The right flank would be held by the 7th Marine Regiment assaulting Orange 3.<ref>Hough, p. 19</ref>\n\n[[File:First wave of LVTs moves toward the invasion beaches - Peleliu.jpg|thumb|right|15 September 1944: The first wave of LVTs approach the beaches during the American assault on Peleliu.]]\n\nAt 0630 the Beachmaster and Communications team, Marine observers and newspaper correspondents arrived aboard.  Acting as a guide ship for White Beach 2, the ship advanced from the line of departure and moved toward the beach.  They bombarded the shore with 46 rounds from their [[3\"/50 caliber gun]], then advanced to the transfer line.  The PC remained there as control ship for the [[Landing Craft Infantry|LCIs]] and [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVTs]] of the 1st Marine Division en route to the beachhead.  At 0905 the ship assumed guide ship duties for the entire White Beach landing area and remained there overnight.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', September 1944, p. 1</ref>\n\n=== Burial at sea ===\n\nThe following day, 16 September, the ship was relieved of control duty.  The Beachmaster and Communications team left the ship which was then assigned to the anti-submarine screen for the LST Tractor Group at Peleliu until 25 September.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', September 1944, p. 1</ref>  While on the screen on 19 September, the ship stopped to identify a floating corpse, which was determined to be that of an American Marine. A thorough search of body revealed no identification whatsoever, the body being in such a state that no fingerprints were possible. The crew weighted and sank the body with a length of anchor chain in accordance with instructions from the destroyer [[USS Hazelwood (DD-531)|''Hazelwood'']].<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 19 September 1944</ref>\n\nLate in the day on 26 September, the LST Tractor Group formed in cruising disposition and proceeded to New Guinea.  The Tractor Group arrived at [[Hollandia, New Guinea]] on 30 September and anchored in [[Humboldt Bay]].<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', September 1944, p. 2</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nThe Battle of Peleliu remains controversial due to the island's lack of strategic value and a casualty rate which exceeded all other amphibious operations during the Pacific War. The 1st Marine Division was severely mauled and remained out of action until the invasion of Okinawa. On Peleliu, the 1st Marine Division suffered over 6,500 casualties, over a third of the division. The [[81st Infantry Division (United States)|81st Infantry Division]] suffered nearly 1,400 casualties while on the island.<ref>Hough, p. 183</ref>  The Japanese defenders, consisting of an estimated 10,500 men, were annihilated,<ref>Garand and Strowbridge, p. 285</ref> but would have lacked the means to interfere with US operations in the Pacific if the island had been by-passed, as had many other Japanese garrisons.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=77| title=Palau Islands and Ulithi Islands Campaign| author=Chen, C.

''PC-598'' entered [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] with the Northern Attack Force at 0740 on 20 October.  By 0820 she closed with the attack transport [[USS DuPage (APA-41)|''Dupage'']] to collect Lieut. E.E.

Fearing that the loss of the Philippines would result in the loss of shipping lanes to their oil supplies in South East Asia, the Japanese committed the remnants of the Imperial Japanese Navy in what would become the greatest naval battle in history, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].  Between 23 and 26 October 1944, there were four separate engagements: the [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], the [[Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o]] and the [[Battle off Samar]], as well as other actions.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.worldwar2facts.org/battle-of-leyte-gulf.html| title=Battle of Leyte Gulf Facts| website=World War 2 Facts}}</ref>  In four days of fighting the Japanese lost 26 of their finest ships: three battleships, one large carrier, three light carriers, six heavy cruisers, four light cruisers and nine destroyers, ending Japan's dream of being a naval power.<ref>Victory at Sea - Episode 16, The Battle for Leyte Gulf</ref>\n\n== Return to Hollandia, New Guinea ==\n\n=== Convoy attacked by submarine ===\nNear midnight on 24 October 1944, the convoy was in the [[Philippine Sea]] east of [[Mindanao]].

With its propellers and shafts removed to allow repairs, on 5 November the ship was towed from dry dock to the Destroyer Repair Base Dock at Hollandia.  There she was moored starboard side to [[USS SC-744|''SC-744'']], which would be sunk within a month by a [[kamikaze]] at Leyte Gulf.<ref>Cressman, p. 277</ref>  Eleven days later, on 16 November, the PC returned under tow by [[Landing Craft Mechanized|LCMs]] to ''AFD-24'' for dry docking and underwater repairs which were completed around midnight.  The next day, the ship left dry dock and returned under its own power to the Destroyer Repair Base dock where it remained through the end of November.  Lieutenant (jg) Clarence S.

Lieutenant Hackney, was detached from duty as commanding officer and left the ship.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 19 November 1944</ref>\n\nDuring the first three weeks of December, the ship lay anchored in Humboldt Bay or moored along Liberty dock #1 in Hollandia.  18 December was spent at the firing range, holding anti-aircraft practice and running the degaussing range.  The ship received replacement crew members and replenished supplies, water and fuel.  Late on 22 December they left Hollandia to proceed to Aitape, New Guinea under orders to join the Seventh Amphibious Force, which was forming for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon in the Philippines.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', December 1944</ref>\n\n=== Exercises off Aitape ===\n\n''PC-598'' arrived at [[Aitape]] the next day and anchored in Ataipe Road.  On the day before Christmas 1944, Captain Stephen G. Barchet, former commanding officer of the submarine [[USS Argonaut (SM-1)|''Argonaut'']], reported aboard to assume the duties of Senior Control Officer for White Beach at the Lingayen Gulf landings. Captain Barchet served as Operations Officer for the 7th Amphibious Force in the Pacific.

The enemy guns were silenced within minutes by counter fire from destroyers in the Gulf.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 11 January 1945</ref>  Captain Barchet and his control communications team left the ship on 15 January, replaced by Lieutenant Commander J.B. Avery who had been assisting Barchet since 14 January. The ship continued as flagship for Commander Task Unit 78.1.7 and later 78.1.11 until 28 January.  On 29 January the ship was relieved of its duties and reported alongside the landing craft repair ship [[USS Amycus (ARL-2)|''Amycus'']] for minor repairs, which were completed by the morning of 31 January.  That evening ''PC-598'' reported for duty as a screen vessel for a convoy departing from the Lingayen Gulf to Leyte.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', January 1945, p. 2</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nOver 200,000 soldiers were landed in the Lingayen Gulf during this period.  American naval forces suffered relatively heavy losses, particularly to their convoys, due to kamikaze attacks. During the first two weeks in January, a total of 24 ships were sunk and another 67 were damaged by kamikazes including the battleships {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}, [[USS New Mexico (BB-40)|''New Mexico'']] and [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|''Colorado'']], the Australian heavy cruiser [[HMAS Australia (D84)|''Australia'']], the light cruiser [[USS Columbia (CL-56)|''Columbia'']], and the destroyers [[USS Long (DD-209)|''Long'']] and [[USS Hovey (DD-208)|''Hovey'']].  Following the landings, the Lingayen Gulf became a vast supply depot to support the [[Battle of Luzon]].<ref>[[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf]], Wikipedia</ref>\n\n== Return to the Solomons ==\n\nThe convoy from Lingayen Gulf arrived in San Pedro Bay, near Leyte, on 2 February 1945 where Captain Rose reported to CTF 78 on ''Blue Ridge''.  The ship took on stores, fuel and water and anchored for the night off [[Samar Island]].  The next day the convoy left at 1800 to Guadalcanal via the [[Admiralty Islands]].  On 14 February ''PC-598'' passed the entrance nets to [[Seeadler Harbor]] at [[Manus Island|Manus]] in the Admiralty Islands<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref> where three months earlier the ammunition ship [[USS Mount Hood (AE-11)|''Mount Hood'']] exploded, killing all aboard her, obliterating the ship and sinking or severely damaging 22 other nearby ships.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ships/logs/AE/ae11-Loss.html| title=Selected documents relating to the loss of USS Mount Hood| website=Hyperwar}}</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Mount Hood (AE-11) explodes at Seeadler Harbor on 10 November 1944.jpg|thumb|left|The explosion of the USS Mount Hood (AE-11) in Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralty Islands on 10 November 1944.]]\n\nOnce more the ship's fuel, water and supplies were replenished.  ''PC-598'' was underway again in the company of other patrol craft on 16 February and arrived off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal on 20 February.  At Guadalcanal, Communications team #55 commanded by Lieutenant (jg) P.W. Cochran reported aboard for temporary duty and the ship was ordered by CinCPac to report as a control vessel to ComPhib Group 4.  On 21 February the ship visited the [[Florida Islands]], anchored in Govana Inlet and later made its way to the Egan Bluff water hole at Port Purvis to take on water.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref>\n\n''PC-598'' spent the last eight days of February anchored at various locations at Purvis Bay, Florida Islands in \"nests of ships\" including the tank landing ships [[USS LST-220|''LST-220'']], later used as a target vessel for atomic bomb test \"Able\" during [[Operation Crossroads]] in the summer of 1946,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq76-5.htm| title=Operation Crossroads: Disposition of Target Vessels| website=Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref> LST 213, involved in the rescue of survivors after the sinking of [[USS Gambier Bay (CVE-73)|''Gambier Bay'']] during the [[Battle off Samar]] and [[USS LST-698|''LST-698'']], the subject of the book ''LSTs, the Ships with the BIG MOUTH and what made these ships so essential in island actions of World War II (1944-45)'' written by a crew member, Homer Haswell. ''PC-598'' spent six of these days alongside the repair ship [[USS Briareus (AR-12)|''Briareus'']] undergoing voyage repairs and installing new control equipment.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref>\n\n=== Tractor Group Baker to the Ryukyus ===\n\nThe first six days of March, ''PC-598'' participated in training exercises off [[Cape Esperance]], Guadalcanal in preparation for the landings in Okinawa.  The ship then retired to Govana Inlet, [[Florida Islands]] for repairs provided by [[USS AFD-14|''AFD-14'']].  Late in the evening of 9 March, the ship joined Tractor Group Baker en route to the [[Russell Islands]], arriving 11 March at Macquitti Bay.  By 18 March Tractor Group Baker was once again on the move, this time to [[Ulithi]] in the [[Carolina Islands|Western Carolina Islands]].<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref>\n\n[[File:Mousetrap (7.2-Inch ASW Rocket).jpg|thumb|right|upright|4-missile launcher anti-submarine projector Mark 20. PCs carried two 4-missile launchers on their bow]]\n\nOn 21 March, the sub chaser passed into Ulithi Harbor via Mugai Channel and anchored in the northern anchorage.  While at Ulithi, the ship replenished stores from the non-self propelled storage barge, [[USS IX-151|''IX-151'']] and took water from the new distilling ship, [[USS Abatan (AW-4)|''Abatan'']], which provided potable water to landing craft, patrol vessels and escort ships unable to produce their own water.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/D/i/Distilling_Ships.htm| title=Distilling Ships (AW)| website=The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia}}</ref> Like many smaller ships, PCs could not produce their own fresh water and were reliant on larger vessels for drinking water.<ref>Veigele, p. 42</ref>\n\nJust before noon on 25 March, Lieutenant Vrooman, Blue Beach Control Officer, came aboard for the last leg of the journey to Okinawa. The submarine chaser then joined the anti-submarine screen for Tractor Group Baker, en route from Ulithi to the [[Ryukyus]].  The Tractor Group arrived at the Ryukyus on 31 March.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref>  Late that afternoon, ''PC-598'' pulled alongside [[USS LST-834|''LST-834'']] refueled and replenished water. ''LST-834'' is the central figure in ''Waddling to War'' by Bob Shannon.\n\nAt 1728, as ''PC-598'' began the transition from anti-submarine screening to control vessel duties, the crew dropped eight [[Mousetrap (weapon)|Mousetraps]] (ASW Mark 20 anti-submarine rockets) and their fuzes overboard.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref>\n\n== Battle of Okinawa ==\n\n[[File:Okinawa Invasion Beaches, 1 April 1945 - Map.jpg|thumb|left|Okinawa Invasion Beaches, 1 April 1945]]\n\n1 April 1945 was both [[Easter Sunday]] and [[April Fool's Day]], a coincidence not unremarked on by the crew of ''PC-598''.  It also marked the start of Operation Iceberg, the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]].  Released from screening duty at 0405, ''PC-598'' proceeded to the line of departure at Blue Beach to serve as the Control Vessel.  While approaching the line, several Japanese dive bombers, [[Aichi D3A|Aichi D3A \"VALS\"]], were seen attacking the ships.  One VAL approaching from the beach came within range of the ship's guns and the sub chaser opened fire.  Hits were observed and the plane caught fire and crashed into the sea.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', April 1945, p.1</ref>\n \n[[File:Supplying and developing the beachhead.jpg|thumb|right|Purple Beaches, Okinawa 4 April 1945]]\n\n''PC-598'' anchored at its assigned station with Lt. Vrooman acting as Blue Beach Control Officer.  Various Naval and Marine officers came aboard to use the ship as a control center during the landing phase of the operation.  The first assault wave was dispatched at 0800.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', April 1945, p.1</ref> The [[7th Marine Regiment]] (1st Marine Division) was assigned to Blue Beaches 1 and 2, and landed with its 1st and 2nd Battalions abreast followed by the 3rd Battalion.<ref>Frank, et al., p.113</ref> By early afternoon, the ship maneuvered 1000 yards closer to Blue Beach and anchored for the night.  The ship continued to act as Blue Beach Control Vessel until 5 April when it was detached and reassigned as Purple Beach Control Vessel in early afternoon.\n\n=== Kamikaze onslaught begins ===\nThe Japanese kamikaze onslaught against U.S. ships off Okinawa begins in earnest on 6 April.  The ship, anchored and serving as Purple Beach Control Vessel, along with the rest of the fleet, is under attack from numerous airplanes. The ship\u2019s guns fire on two VALS in range, downing one into the sea.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', April 1945, p.2</ref>\n\n[[File:Aichi D3A Type 99.jpg|thumb|Aichi D3A \"VALs\" in flight]]\n\nSuicide attacks by planes at Okinawa sank 26 U.S. war and merchant ships and damaged 225 others.<ref>Rottman, p. 76</ref>  On 6 April alone, six ships were sunk at Okinawa including the destroyers [[USS Bush (DD-529)|''Bush'']] and [[USS Colhoun (DD-801)|''Colhoun'']], the minesweeper [[USS Emmons (DMS-22)|''Emmons'']],  and the cargo ships [[SS Hobbs Victory|Hobbs Victory]] and [[SS Logan Victory|''Logan Victory'']].<ref>Cressman, p. 309-310</ref>  Many more were damaged.  In the midst of this inferno, ''PC-598'' is forced to maneuver to avoid a flaming gasoline barge drifting in the direction of the ship.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 6 April 1945</ref> Kamikaze attacks continued throughout the remainder of the war expending 1,900 Japanese planes and pilots.<ref>Rottman, p. 76</ref>\n\n=== Control Vessel for TransRon 16 ===\n\nExcept for a one-day excursion on 24 April to [[Kerama Retto]],<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 24 April 1945</ref> a protected anchorage to the west, ''PC-598'' remained anchored off the [[Hagushi]] landing beaches on the west coast of Okinawa through most of April, serving as Control Vessel for the unloading of Transportation Squadron 16.  On 9 April, Lieutenant Commander Dawes, USNR came aboard as Control Officer at Purple Beach to supervise the unloading.  Relieved of control duty on 11 April, the ship proceeded to [[USS Coronis (ARL-10)|''Coronis'']] for repairs which were completed 14 April after which the ship returned to its control duties.  On 18 April Commander Quine, USN came aboard as Control Officer. During April, nightly attacks were made by enemy aircraft on the ships lying at anchor off the Hagushi landing areas.  On each occasion the Control Vessel concealed itself in smoke and withheld fire.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', April 1945</ref>\n\n=== Nago Bay ===\n\nThe ship was relieved of its Control Vessel assignment on 30 April and ordered to Nago Wan (Nago Bay), Okinawa.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 30 April 1945</ref>  While at Nago Wan on 2 May, Lieutenant (jg) Rose was relieved of command of the ship and replaced by Lieutenant (jg) Raymond C. Chaisson, USNR, previously the Executive Officer.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 2 May 1945</ref>\n\nOn 5 May ''PC 598'' was moored port side to the landing craft support ship [[USS LCS-62|''LCS-62'']] in order to take on water.  After the initial landing bombardment, ''LCS-62'' had been assigned to picket ship duty on stations 25\u201380 miles off the main invasion beaches of Okinawa to intercept Japanese planes and to warn the main forces of the approach of enemy aircraft.  Typical of many of the radar picket ships, ''LCS-62'' survived over 150 air raids and went to general quarters over 200 times before the campaign ended.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/05/050062h.htm| title=A Brief History of ''LCS(L) 62 ''| website=NavSource Naval History, Photographic History of the U.S. Navy}}</ref>\n\n=== Mail and taxi service ===\n\nOn 9 May the submarine chaser was ordered to [[Ie Shima]] where she took on the less glamorous role of delivering mail and passengers.  Ie Shima, a small island twenty miles north of the Hagushi landing beaches, had been captured after a six-day battle on 24 April to provide additional airfields for air strikes in Okinawa and Japan.  It is also the final resting place of [[Ernie Pyle]], American journalist and war correspondent, killed there on 18 April 1945.<ref>Appleman, et al., p. 163</ref>\n\nThe sub chaser ran a daily route starting from the amphibious force command ship [[USS Panamint (AGC-13)|''Panamint'']] at Ie Shima to the dock landing ship [[USS Epping Forest (LSD-4)|''Epping Forest'']] at Nago Wan to the amphibious force command ship [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)|''Eldorado'']] at Bisa-Gawa, off the original [[Hagushi]] landing areas, and back to Ie Shima.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', May 1945</ref>  On 14 May while at Ie Shima, ''PC-598'' received water from the tank landing ship [[USS LST-808|''LST-808'']]. While still at Ie Shima four days later, ''LST-808'' was struck by a Japanese aerial torpedo.  Pushed onto a nearby coral reef by U.S. ships, she was attacked a second time on 20 May by a Japanese kamikaze.<ref>Cressman, p. 320-321</ref>\n\nOn 17 May ''PC-598'' was relieved as mail ship by [[USS SC-1278|''SC-1278'']] and returned to Nago Wan.  While there, the ship continued to make regular trips to Hagushi to take on water and deliver mail and passengers to various ships, including the amphibious force command ship [[USS Ancon (AGC-4)|''Ancon'']] on 21 May.  In need of repairs, the ship relocated to the Hagushi anchorage and moored alongside ''Coronis'' on 23 May, remaining until repairs were completed on 30 May.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', May 1945</ref>\n\nDuring May air attacks remained a daily threat to the U.S. fleet at Okinawa, including four major kamikaze attacks involving 550 Japanese planes.<ref>Appleman, et al., p. 364</ref>\n\n=== Iheya and Aguni operations ===\n\n[[File:Operations Chart - Action Report Iheya-Aguni Operation.jpg|thumb|left|Iheya-Aguni Operations Chart]]\n\n[[Iheya Shima]] and [[Aguni Shima]] are two small islands about 30 miles north and west, respectively, of Okinawa.  Because of the heavy damage sustained by the U.S. fleet and especially the radar pickets during kamikaze raids, the decision was made to capture them for long-range radar and fighter director facilities.<ref>Frank, p. 5</ref>  On 3 June, ''PC-598'' accompanied the amphibious landing force to Iheya Shima, providing anti-submarine screening en route to the island and during the landing.  The Aguni Shima landing followed on 9 June, with ''PC-598'' providing similar services.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', June 1945</ref>   Both landings were unopposed.<ref>Frank, p. 5</ref>\n\nAfter Aguni Shima, ''PC-598'' remained in and around Hagushi anchorage including one excursion on 16 June to pick up passengers arriving at seaplane anchorage V-4 at Kerama Retto and deliver them to Hagushi.  On 23 June the PC was ordered to escort the cargo ship [[SS San Bruno|''San Bruno'']] to [[Nakagusuku Wan]].<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', June 1945</ref> This large bay on the southern coast of Okinawa was referred to as [[Buckner Bay]] by American soldiers in honor of [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.|General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]], commander of the [[Tenth United States Army|10th Army]], killed on Okinawa 18 June 1945.<ref>Frank, p. 353</ref>  Buckner was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer lost to enemy fire during World War II.<ref>Sarantakes, p. 129</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nThe invasion of Okinawa was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater.<ref>Frank, et al., p. 793</ref>  About 548,000 men of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps took part, with 318 combatant and 1139 auxiliary vessels.<ref>King, p. 176</ref>  The toll on US ground troops exceeded 12,500 killed, 36,600 wounded and over 26,000 neuropsychiatric \u201cnon-battle\u201d casualties.  These were the highest experienced in any campaign against the Japanese.  The Navy suffered over 4,900 dead and 4,800 wounded, the most in any single operation. The US also lost 36 ships and another 368 damaged, mostly by air attack.  763 carrier based aircraft were lost to all causes.<ref>Appleman, p. 473</ref>  At least 110,000 Japanese troops and native islander defenders were killed and only 7,400 taken prisoner during the battle.<ref>Appleman, p. 473-474</ref>  At least 42,000 civilians on the island also died during the battle, caught between the opposing forces.<ref>Frank, et al., p. 396</ref>\n\nThese casualty figures, as well as those from other island campaigns, were used by U.S. military planners to estimate that [[Operation Downfall]], the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands, would result in well over 1,000,000 U.S. and 5,000,000 Japanese casualties.  These estimates put the decision made to use atomic weapons against the Japanese in context.<ref>Hansen, \u201c...because the Japanese on Okinawa... were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace [unconditionally], without American casualties.\"</ref>\n\n== Goodbye to all that ==\n\nThe next morning in Hagushi anchorage, ''PC-598'' received lube oil, fuel and fresh water from the tanker [[USS Armadillo (IX-111)|''Armadillo'']] and collected guard mail from [[USS PCS-1390|''PCS-1390'']].  By 1030 on 24 June 1945 the ship was en route from Okinawa to Pearl Harbor via [[Eniwetok Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]].<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 24 June 1945</ref>  The convoy took 11 days to travel the 2,145 nautical miles between Okinawa and Eniwetok Atoll, arriving on 5 July.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 5 July 1945</ref>  After the war, this remote atoll was used for nuclear testing as part of the Pacific Proving Grounds. Forty-three nuclear tests were fired at Eniwetok from 1948 to 1958, including [[Ivy Mike]], the first full scale test of a thermonuclear device.<ref>Diehl, Sarah and Moltz, James Clay. Nuclear Weapons and Nonproliferation: A Reference Book. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 208.</ref>\n\nThe convoy of LSTs left the atoll, escorted by ''PC-598'', 3 days later on 8 July. This last leg of the trip to Pearl Harbor was another 2,000 nautical miles.  The journey went smoothly until 12 July when [[USS PCS-1379|''PCS-1379'']] developed engine trouble and was taken under tow by ''PC-598'' and other ships in the convoy.  ''PC-598'' arrived safely at Pearl Harbor at noon 21 July 1945.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', July 1945</ref>  It had left Pearl Harbor 537 days earlier on 31 January 1944.\n\nThe war was over for ''PC-598'' and its crew, but no one knew it at the time. The U.S. Navy and Army were preparing for the invasion of the Japanese home islands and wanted all available ships in good repair.  In late July, the war weary ship was sent for a major overhaul of its engines.  It unloaded its munitions, discharged its fuel at Merry Point and berthed at Baker #8 at the Navy Yard in Pearl Harbor.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 23 July 1945</ref>  On 16 August Lieutenant (jg) Chaisson was relieved of duties as Commanding Officer, replaced by Lieutenant (jg) Edwin J. Adams, Jr. the Executive Officer.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 16 August 1945</ref>\n\nTo the enormous relief of U.S. military personnel in the Pacific, the war ended 14 August 1945 after the [[atomic bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].<ref>Appleman, et al., p. 474, \"...there came the almost unbelievable and joyous news that the war was over. \"</ref><ref>Sledge, p. 312, \"We received the news with quiet disbelief coupled with an indescribable sense of relief.\"</ref>  The engine overhaul was eventually completed and the ship returned to Astoria, Oregon just before Christmas Day, 1945.  Like many of the hundreds of smaller vessels built during the war, ''PC-598'' was quickly decommissioned.  On 16 November 1946 the ship was sold to the Foss Tug and Barge Company of Tacoma, Washington.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/010598.htm| title = Submarine Chaser Photo Archive, PCC-598, ex-PC-598| website = NavSource Naval History, Photographic History of the U.S. Navy}}</ref><ref>Silverstone, p. 186</ref>\n\n=== A China connection? ===\n\nBetween 1946 and 1949, 14 ex-PCs were reportedly transferred to the Kuomintang government of China (Nationalist forces) including ex-PCs ''490, 492, 593, 595, 598, 1088, 1089, 1090, 1091, 1233, 1247, 1549, 1551'', and ''1557''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.navypedia.org/ships/china/ch_es_chien_fang.htm| title=People's Liberation Army Navy (People's Republic of China), Escorts, ''Chien Feng'' submarine chasers (1942-1945/1946-1949)| website=Navypedia}}</ref>  When the Nationalist forces fled the mainland for Taiwan in January 1949, ten of the ex-PCs went with them, including ex-PCs ''490, 492, 593, 598, 1089, 1233, 1247, 1549, 1551'', and ''1557''.

The convoy arrived at Peleliu in the early morning of 15 September.  The invasion plan called for the [[1st Marine Division]] to assault the beachhead with three regiments. The 1st Marine Regiment (under the command of [[Chesty Puller|Colonel \"Chesty\" Puller]]) would be on the left flank, assaulting beaches White 1 and White 2.  In the center would be the 5th Marine Regiment assaulting beaches Orange 1 and Orange 2.

Acting as a guide ship for White Beach 2, the ship advanced from the line of departure and moved toward the beach.  They bombarded the shore with 46 rounds from their [[3\"/50 caliber gun]], then advanced to the transfer line.  The PC remained there as control ship for the [[Landing Craft Infantry|LCIs]] and [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVTs]] of the 1st Marine Division en route to the beachhead.

With its propellers and shafts removed to allow repairs, on 5 November the ship was towed from dry dock to the Destroyer Repair Base Dock at Hollandia.  There she was moored starboard side to [[USS SC-744|''SC-744'']], which would be sunk within a month by a [[kamikaze]] at Leyte Gulf.<ref>Cressman, p. 277</ref>  Eleven days later, on 16 November, the PC returned under tow by [[Landing Craft Mechanized|LCMs]] to ''AFD-24'' for dry docking and underwater repairs which were completed around midnight.  The next day, the ship left dry dock and returned under its own power to the Destroyer Repair Base dock where it remained though the end of November.  Lieutenant (jg) Clarence S. Rose Jr., the ship's Executive Officer, was ordered to take command on 19 November.  Lieutenant Hackney, was detached from duty as commanding officer and left the ship.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 19 November 1944</ref>\n\nDuring the first three weeks of December, the ship lay anchored in Humboldt Bay or moored along Liberty dock #1 in Hollandia.  18 December was spent at the firing range, holding anti-aircraft practice and running the degaussing range.  The ship received replacement crew members and replenished supplies, water and fuel.  Late on 22 December they left Hollandia to proceed to Aitape, New Guinea under orders to join the Seventh Amphibious Force, which was forming for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon in the Philippines.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', December 1944</ref>\n\n=== Exercises off Aitape ===\n\n''PC-598'' arrived at [[Aitape]] the next day and anchored in Ataipe Road.  On the day before Christmas 1944, Captain Stephen G. Barchet, former commanding officer of the submarine [[USS Argonaut (SM-1)|''Argonaut'']], reported aboard to assume the duties of Senior Control Officer for White Beach at the Lingayen Gulf landings. Captain Barchet served as Operations Officer for the 7th Amphibious Force in the Pacific. In this assignment he coordinated planning and supervised operations of approximately 1,000 ships, consisting of cruisers, destroyers, transports and landing craft. These operations included the assault landings at Lingayen Gulf.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fleetsubmarine.com/barchet.html| title=Rear Admiral Stephen G.

On 22 May 1945, while on picket duty near Okinawa, ''Braine'' was struck by two kamikazes. Eight officers and 59 enlisted men were killed.  102 others were wounded, 50 seriously enough to be hospitalized.  ''Braine'' suffered the highest casualty rate of the war for any destroyer that was not actually sunk.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ussbrainedd630.com/okinawa.htm| title=Okinawa - \"A Fiery Sunday Morning\"| website=USS Braine - DD630}}</ref>\n\n==== Naval mine sighted and sunk ====\n\nNew Year's Day 1945 saw ''PC-598'' screening for the San Fabian Attack Force.  At 1756, they sighted a floating mine about 1000 yards off the port bow.  The ship maneuvered to the vicinity of the mine and waited for the convoy to pass.  Firing both [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm]] rounds and .30 caliber rifle bullets, the mine was sunk.  It was a spherical type, judged to weigh 450 pounds and believed to be an enemy mine, as the horns were 10 to 12 inches long.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', January 1945, p.1</ref>\n\n==== Last surface ship engagement of World War II ====\n\nThe San Fabian Attack Force continued on to the Lingayen Gulf during the first week of 1945.  ''PC-598'' screened the convoy and periodically delivered mail among the ships, including officers mail on 6 January to the attack transports ''Fayette'', [[USS Fremont (APA-44)|''Freemont'']] and ''DuPage'', which was struck by a kamikaze four days later, killing 35 and wounding 103.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ussdupage.net/action%20report%20-%201.10.1945.htm| title=10 January 1945 - Action Report - Lingayen Gulf Operation in San Fabian Area| website=USS DuPage (APA-41)Official Web Site}}</ref>  On 7 January ''PC-598'' refueled and took on water from the fleet oiler [[USS Pecos (AO-65)|''Pecos'']], a more fortunate ship.

Released from anti-submarine duties at 0630, ''PC-598'' assumed the duties of Senior Control Vessel, acting as Flagship for CTU 78.1.7 at its assigned position on the line of departure for White Beaches, 4,000 yards off shore.  Naval and Army officers and their staffs came aboard to use the ship as an observation and control center.  Landing operations were controlled by Captain Barchet, who had been on board the ship since New Guinea.\n\n[[File:San Fabian Attack Force.jpg|right|thumb|''PC-598''{{'}}s sister ship, ''PC-623'', depicted acting as White Beach 2 control vessel, 9 January 1945.

By 1840 the PC was anchored 2000 yards off shore near White Beach 2.  The ship's crew sighted three enemy aircraft and fired at one plane which escaped flying very high.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', January 1945, p. 1</ref>\n\n''PC-598'' remained anchored near the White Beaches, occasionally maneuvering to support operations.  Near midnight on 11 January the ship came under fire from beach installations with shrapnel falling nearby from shell bursts in the air.  The enemy guns were silenced within minutes by counter fire from destroyers in the Gulf.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 11 January 1945</ref>  Captain Barchet and his control communications team left the ship on 15 January, replaced by Lieutenant Commander J.B. Avery who had been assisting Barchet since 14 January. The ship continued as flagship for Commander Task Unit 78.1.7 and later 78.1.11 until 28 January.  On 29 January the ship was relieved of its duties and reported alongside the landing craft repair ship [[USS Amycus (ARL-2)|''Amycus'']] for minor repairs, which were completed by the morning of 31 January.  That evening ''PC-598'' reported for duty as a screen vessel for a convoy departing from the Lingayen Gulf to Leyte.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', January 1945, p. 2</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nOver 200,000 soldiers were landed in the Lingayen Gulf during this period.  American naval forces suffered relatively heavy losses, particularly to their convoys, due to kamikaze attacks. During the first two weeks in January, a total of 24 ships were sunk and another 67 were damaged by kamikazes including the battleships {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}, [[USS New Mexico (BB-40)|''New Mexico'']] and [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|''Colorado'']], the Australian heavy cruiser [[HMAS Australia (D84)|''Australia'']], the light cruiser [[USS Columbia (CL-56)|''Columbia'']], and the destroyers [[USS Long (DD-209)|''Long'']] and [[USS Hovey (DD-208)|''Hovey'']].  Following the landings, the Lingayen Gulf became a vast supply depot to support the [[Battle of Luzon]].<ref>[[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf]], Wikipedia</ref>\n\n== Return to the Solomons ==\n\nThe convoy from Lingayen Gulf arrived in San Pedro Bay, near Leyte, on 2 February 1945 where Captain Rose reported to CTF 78 on ''Blue Ridge''.  The ship took on stores, fuel and water and anchored for the night off [[Samar Island]].  The next day the convoy left at 1800 to Guadalcanal via the [[Admiralty Islands]].  On 14 February ''PC-598'' passed the entrance nets to [[Seeadler Harbor]] at [[Manus Island|Manus]] in the Admiralty Islands<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref> where three months earlier the ammunition ship [[USS Mount Hood (AE-11)|''Mount Hood'']] exploded, killing all aboard her, obliterating the ship and sinking or severely damaging 22 other nearby ships.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ships/logs/AE/ae11-Loss.html| title=Selected documents relating to the loss of USS Mount Hood| website=Hyperwar}}</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Mount Hood (AE-11) explodes at Seeadler Harbor on 10 November 1944.jpg|thumb|left|The explosion of the USS Mount Hood (AE-11) in Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralty Islands on 10 November 1944.]]\n\nOnce more the ship's fuel, water and supplies were replenished.  ''PC-598'' was underway again in the company of other patrol craft on 16 February and arrived off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal on 20 February.  At Guadalcanal, Communications team #55 commanded by Lieutenant (jg) P.W. Cochran reported aboard for temporary duty and the ship was ordered by CinCPac to report as a control vessel to ComPhib Group 4.  On 21 February the ship visited the [[Florida Islands]], anchored in Govana Inlet and later made its way to the Egan Bluff water hole at Port Purvis to take on water.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref>\n\n''PC-598'' spent the last eight days of February anchored at various locations at Purvis Bay, Florida Islands in \"nests of ships\" including the tank landing ships [[USS LST-220|''LST-220'']], later used as a target vessel for atomic bomb test \"Able\" during [[Operation Crossroads]] in the summer of 1946,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq76-5.htm| title=Operation Crossroads: Disposition of Target Vessels| website=Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref> LST 213, involved in the rescue of survivors after the sinking of [[USS Gambier Bay (CVE-73)|''Gambier Bay'']] during the [[Battle off Samar]] and [[USS LST-698|''LST-698'']], the subject of the book ''LSTs, the Ships with the BIG MOUTH and what made these ships so essential in island actions of World War II (1944-45)'' written by a crew member, Homer Haswell.

While at Ulithi, the ship replenished stores from the non-self propelled storage barge, [[USS IX-151|''IX-151'']] and took water from the new distilling ship, [[USS Abatan (AW-4)|''Abatan'']], which provided potable water to landing craft, patrol vessels and escort ships unable to produce their own water.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/D/i/Distilling_Ships.htm| title=Distilling Ships (AW)| website=The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia}}</ref> Like many smaller ships, PCs could not produce their own fresh water and were reliant on larger vessels for drinking water.<ref>Veigele, p. 42</ref>\n\nJust before noon on 25 March, Lieutenant Vrooman, Blue Beach Control Officer, came aboard for the last leg of the journey to Okinawa. The submarine chaser then joined the anti-submarine screen for Tractor Group Baker, en route from Ulithi to the [[Ryukyus]].  The Tractor Group arrived at the Ryukyus on 31 March.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref>  Late that afternoon, ''PC-598'' pulled alongside [[USS LST-834|''LST-834'']] refueled and replenished water. ''LST-834'' is the central figure in ''Waddling to War'' by Bob Shannon.\n\nAt 1728, as ''PC-598'' began the transition from anti-submarine screening to control vessel duties, the crew dropped eight [[Mousetrap (weapon)|Mousetraps]] (ASW Mark 20 anti-submarine rockets) and their fuzes overboard.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', February 1945</ref>\n\n== Battle of Okinawa ==\n\n[[File:Okinawa Invasion Beaches, 1 April 1945 - Map.jpg|thumb|left|Okinawa Invasion Beaches, 1 April 1945]]\n\n1 April 1945 was both [[Easter Sunday]] and [[April Fool's Day]], a coincidence not unremarked on by the crew of ''PC-598''.  It also marked the start of Operation Iceberg, the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]].  Released from screening duty at 0405, ''PC-598'' proceeded to the line of departure at Blue Beach to serve as the Control Vessel.  While approaching the line, several Japanese dive bombers, [[Aichi D3A|Aichi D3A \"VALS\"]], were seen attacking the ships.  One VAL approaching from the beach came within range of the ship's guns and the sub chaser opened fire.  Hits were observed and the plane caught fire and crashed into the sea.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', April 1945, p.1</ref>\n \n[[File:Supplying and developing the beachhead.jpg|thumb|right|Purple Beaches, Okinawa 4 April 1945]]\n\n''PC-598'' anchored at its assigned station with Lt. Vrooman acting as Blue Beach Control Officer.  Various Naval and Marine officers came aboard to use the ship as a control center during the landing phase of the operation.  The first assault wave was dispatched at 0800.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', April 1945, p.1</ref> The [[7th Marine Regiment]] (1st Marine Division) was assigned to Blue Beaches 1 and 2, and landed with its 1st and 2nd Battalions abreast followed by the 3rd Battalion.<ref>Frank, et al., p.113</ref> By early afternoon, the ship maneuvered 1000 yards closer to Blue Beach and anchored for the night.  The ship continued to act as Blue Beach Control Vessel until 5 April when it was detached and reassigned as Purple Beach Control Vessel in early afternoon.\n\n=== Kamikaze onslaught begins ===\nThe Japanese kamikaze onslaught against U.S. ships off Okinawa begins in earnest on 6 April.  The ship, anchored and serving as Purple Beach Control Vessel, along with the rest of the fleet, is under attack from numerous airplanes. The ship\u2019s guns fire on two VALS in range, downing one into the sea.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', April 1945, p.2</ref>\n\n[[File:Aichi D3A Type 99.jpg|thumb|Aichi D3A \"VALs\" in flight]]\n\nSuicide attacks by planes at Okinawa sank 26 U.S. war and merchant ships and damaged 225 others.<ref>Rottman, p. 76</ref>  On 6 April alone, six ships were sunk at Okinawa including the destroyers [[USS Bush (DD-529)|''Bush'']] and [[USS Colhoun (DD-801)|''Colhoun'']], the minesweeper [[USS Emmons (DMS-22)|''Emmons'']],  and the cargo ships [[SS Hobbs Victory|Hobbs Victory]] and [[SS Logan Victory|''Logan Victory'']].<ref>Cressman, p. 309-310</ref>  Many more were damaged.  In the midst of this inferno, ''PC-598'' is forced to maneuver to avoid a flaming gasoline barge drifting in the direction of the ship.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 6 April 1945</ref> Kamikaze attacks continued throughout the remainder of the war expending 1,900 Japanese planes and pilots.<ref>Rottman, p. 76</ref>\n\n=== Control Vessel for TransRon 16 ===\n\nExcept for a one-day excursion on 24 April to [[Kerama Retto]],<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 24 April 1945</ref> a protected anchorage to the west, ''PC-598'' remained anchored off the [[Hagushi]] landing beaches on the west coast of Okinawa through most of April, serving as Control Vessel for the unloading of Transportation Squadron 16.  On 9 April, Lieutenant Commander Dawes, USNR came aboard as Control Officer at Purple Beach to supervise the unloading.  Relieved of control duty on 11 April, the ship proceeded to [[USS Coronis (ARL-10)|''Coronis'']] for repairs which were completed 14 April after which the ship returned to its control duties.  On 18 April Commander Quine, USN came aboard as Control Officer. During April, nightly attacks were made by enemy aircraft on the ships lying at anchor off the Hagushi landing areas.  On each occasion the Control Vessel concealed itself in smoke and withheld fire.<ref>''PC-598 War Diary'', April 1945</ref>\n\n=== Nago Bay ===\n\nThe ship was relieved of its Control Vessel assignment on 30 April and ordered to Nago Wan (Nago Bay), Okinawa.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 30 April 1945</ref>  While at Nago Wan on 2 May, Lieutenant (jg) Rose was relieved of command of the ship and replaced by Lieutenant (jg) Raymond C. Chaisson, USNR, previously the Executive Officer.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 2 May 1945</ref>\n\nOn 5 May ''PC 598'' was moored port side to the landing craft support ship [[USS LCS-62|''LCS-62'']] in order to take on water.  After the initial landing bombardment, ''LCS-62'' had been assigned to picket ship duty on stations 25\u201380 miles off the main invasion beaches of Okinawa to intercept Japanese planes and to warn the main forces of the approach of enemy aircraft.  Typical of many of the radar picket ships, ''LCS-62'' survived over 150 air raids and went to general quarters over 200 times before the campaign ended.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/05/050062h.htm| title=A Brief History of ''LCS(L) 62 ''| website=NavSource Naval History, Photographic History of the U.S. Navy}}</ref>\n\n=== Mail and taxi service ===\n\nOn 9 May the submarine chaser was ordered to [[Ie Shima]] where she took on the less glamorous role of delivering mail and passengers.  Ie Shima, a small island twenty miles north of the Hagushi landing beaches, had been captured after a six-day battle on 24 April to provide additional airfields for air strikes in Okinawa and Japan.  It is also the final resting place of [[Ernie Pyle]], American journalist and war correspondent, killed there on 18 April 1945.<ref>Appleman, et al., p. 163</ref>\n\nThe sub chaser ran a daily route starting from the amphibious force command ship [[USS Panamint (AGC-13)|''Panamint'']] at Ie Shima to the dock landing ship [[USS Epping Forest (LSD-4)|''Epping Forest'']] at Nago Wan to the amphibious force command ship [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)|''Eldorado'']] at Bisa-Gawa, off the original [[Hagushi]] landing areas, and back to Ie Shima.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', May 1945</ref>  On 14 May while at Ie Shima, ''PC-598'' received water from the tank landing ship [[USS LST-808|''LST-808'']]. While still at Ie Shima four days later, ''LST-808'' was struck by a Japanese aerial torpedo.  Pushed onto a nearby coral reef by U.S. ships, she was attacked a second time on 20 May by a Japanese kamikaze.<ref>Cressman, p. 320-321</ref>\n\nOn 17 May ''PC-598'' was relieved as mail ship by [[USS SC-1278|''SC-1278'']] and returned to Nago Wan.  While there, the ship continued to make regular trips to Hagushi to take on water and deliver mail and passengers to various ships, including the amphibious force command ship [[USS Ancon (AGC-4)|''Ancon'']] on 21 May.  In need of repairs, the ship relocated to the Hagushi anchorage and moored alongside ''Coronis'' on 23 May, remaining until repairs were completed on 30 May.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', May 1945</ref>\n\nDuring May air attacks remained a daily threat to the U.S. fleet at Okinawa, including four major kamikaze attacks involving 550 Japanese planes.<ref>Appleman, et al., p. 364</ref>\n\n=== Iheya and Aguni operations ===\n\n[[File:Operations Chart - Action Report Iheya-Aguni Operation.jpg|thumb|left|Iheya-Aguni Operations Chart]]\n\n[[Iheya Shima]] and [[Aguni Shima]] are two small islands about 30 miles north and west, respectively, of Okinawa.  Because of the heavy damage sustained by the U.S. fleet and especially the radar pickets during kamikaze raids, the decision was made to capture them for long-range radar and fighter director facilities.<ref>Frank, p. 5</ref>  On 3 June, ''PC-598'' accompanied the amphibious landing force to Iheya Shima, providing anti-submarine screening en route to the island and during the landing.  The Aguni Shima landing followed on 9 June, with ''PC-598'' providing similar services.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', June 1945</ref>   Both landings were unopposed.<ref>Frank, p. 5</ref>\n\nAfter Aguni Shima, ''PC-598'' remained in and around Hagushi anchorage including one excursion on 16 June to pick up passengers arriving at seaplane anchorage V-4 at Kerama Retto and deliver them to Hagushi.  On 23 June the PC was ordered to escort the cargo ship [[SS San Bruno|''San Bruno'']] to [[Nakagusuku Wan]].<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', June 1945</ref> This large bay on the southern coast of Okinawa was referred to as [[Buckner Bay]] by American soldiers in honor of [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.|General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]], commander of the [[Tenth United States Army|10th Army]], killed on Okinawa 18 June 1945.<ref>Frank, p. 353</ref>  Buckner was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer lost to enemy fire during World War II.<ref>Sarantakes, p. 129</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nThe invasion of Okinawa was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater.<ref>Frank, et al., p. 793</ref>  About 548,000 men of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps took part, with 318 combatant and 1139 auxiliary vessels.<ref>King, p. 176</ref>  The toll on US ground troops exceeded 12,500 killed, 36,600 wounded and over 26,000 neuropsychiatric \u201cnon-battle\u201d casualties.  These were the highest experienced in any campaign against the Japanese.  The Navy suffered over 4,900 dead and 4,800 wounded, the most in any single operation. The US also lost 36 ships and another 368 damaged, mostly by air attack.  763 carrier based aircraft were lost to all causes.<ref>Appleman, p. 473</ref>  At least 110,000 Japanese troops and native islander defenders were killed and only 7,400 taken prisoner during the battle.<ref>Appleman, p. 473-474</ref>  At least 42,000 civilians on the island also died during the battle, caught between the opposing forces.<ref>Frank, et al., p. 396</ref>\n\nThese casualty figures, as well as those from other island campaigns, were used by U.S. military planners to estimate that [[Operation Downfall]], the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands, would result in well over 1,000,000 U.S. and 5,000,000 Japanese casualties.  These estimates put the decision made to use atomic weapons against the Japanese in context.<ref>Hansen, \u201c...because the Japanese on Okinawa... were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace [unconditionally], without American casualties.\"</ref>\n\n== Goodbye to all that ==\n\nThe next morning in Hagushi anchorage, ''PC-598'' received lube oil, fuel and fresh water from the tanker [[USS Armadillo (IX-111)|''Armadillo'']] and collected guard mail from [[USS PCS-1390|''PCS-1390'']].  By 1030 on 24 June 1945 the ship was en route from Okinawa to Pearl Harbor via [[Eniwetok Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]].<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 24 June 1945</ref>  The convoy took 11 days to travel the 2,145 nautical miles between Okinawa and Eniwetok Atoll, arriving on 5 July.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 5 July 1945</ref>  After the war, this remote atoll was used for nuclear testing as part of the Pacific Proving Grounds. Forty-three nuclear tests were fired at Eniwetok from 1948 to 1958, including [[Ivy Mike]], the first full scale test of a thermonuclear device.<ref>Diehl, Sarah and Moltz, James Clay. Nuclear Weapons and Nonproliferation: A Reference Book. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 208.</ref>\n\nThe convoy of LSTs left the atoll, escorted by ''PC-598'', 3 days later on 8 July. This last leg of the trip to Pearl Harbor was another 2,000 nautical miles.  The journey went smoothly until 12 July when [[USS PCS-1379|''PCS-1379'']] developed engine trouble and was taken under tow by ''PC-598'' and other ships in the convoy.  ''PC-598'' arrived safely at Pearl Harbor at noon 21 July 1945.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', July 1945</ref>  It had left Pearl Harbor 537 days earlier on 31 January 1944.\n\nThe war was over for ''PC-598'' and its crew, but no one knew it at the time. The U.S. Navy and Army were preparing for the invasion of the Japanese home islands and wanted all available ships in good repair.  In late July, the war weary ship was sent for a major overhaul of its engines.  It unloaded its munitions, discharged its fuel at Merry Point and berthed at Baker #8 at the Navy Yard in Pearl Harbor.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 23 July 1945</ref>  On 16 August Lieutenant (jg) Chaisson was relieved of duties as Commanding Officer, replaced by Lieutenant (jg) Edwin J. Adams, Jr. the Executive Officer.<ref>''PC-598 Log Book'', 16 August 1945</ref>\n\nTo the enormous relief of U.S. military personnel in the Pacific, the war ended 14 August 1945 after the [[atomic bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].<ref>Appleman, et al., p. 474, \"...there came the almost unbelievable and joyous news that the war was over. \"</ref><ref>Sledge, p. 312, \"We received the news with quiet disbelief coupled with an indescribable sense of relief.\"</ref>  The engine overhaul was eventually completed and the ship returned to Astoria, Oregon just before Christmas Day, 1945.  Like many of the hundreds of smaller vessels built during the war, ''PC-598'' was quickly decommissioned.  On 16 November 1946 the ship was sold to the Foss Tug and Barge Company of Tacoma, Washington.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/010598.htm| title = Submarine Chaser Photo Archive, PCC-598, ex-PC-598| website = NavSource Naval History, Photographic History of the U.S. Navy}}</ref><ref>Silverstone, p. 186</ref>\n\n=== A China connection? ===\n\nBetween 1946 and 1949, 14 ex-PCs were reportedly transferred to the Kuomintang government of China (Nationalist forces) including ex-PCs ''490, 492, 593, 595, 598, 1088, 1089, 1090, 1091, 1233, 1247, 1549, 1551'', and ''1557''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.navypedia.org/ships/china/ch_es_chien_fang.htm| title=People's Liberation Army Navy (People's Republic of China), Escorts, ''Chien Feng'' submarine chasers (1942-1945/1946-1949)| website=Navypedia}}</ref>  When the Nationalist forces fled the mainland for Taiwan in January 1949, ten of the ex-PCs went with them, including ex-PCs ''490, 492, 593, 598, 1089, 1233, 1247, 1549, 1551'', and ''1557''.

In the 6th century they joined the lucrative [[spice trade]], since battles elsewhere were diverting [[trade route]]s from dangerous sea routes to more secure overland routes. The [[Byzantine Empire]] had previously controlled the [[Red Sea]], but [[piracy]] had been increasing.

According to early Islamic historians such as [[Ibn Ishaq]], [[Abraha]], the Christian ruler of [[Yemen]], which was subject to the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] of [[Ethiopia]], built a great [[Church (building)|church]] at [[Sanaa]] known as ''al-Qullays'' in honor of the Aksumite king [[Negus]]. It gained widespread fame, even gaining the notice of the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name=\"Hajjah\" /> Abraha attempted to divert the pilgrimage of Arab people from Kaaba to al-Qullays and appointed a man named Muhammad ibn Khuza'i to Mecca and [[Tihamah]] as a king with a message that al-Qullays was both much better than other houses of worship and purer, having not been defiled by the housing of idols.<ref name=\"Hajjah\" /> When Muhammad ibn Khuza'i got as far as the land of [[Banu Kinanah|Kinana]], the people of the lowland, knowing what he had come for, sent a man of [[Banu Hudhayl|Hudhayl]] called \u02bfUrwa bin Hayyad al-Milasi, who shot him with an arrow, killing him. His brother Qays who was with him fled to Abraha and told him the news, which increased his rage and fury and he swore to raid the Kinana tribe and destroy the temple. Ibn Ishaq further states that one of the men of the [[Quraysh]]i tribe was angered by this, and going to Sana'a, slipped into the church at night and defiled it; it is widely assumed that they did so by [[defecation|defecating]] in it.

It was in Mecca, in the nearby mountain cave of Hira on [[Jabal al-Nour]], that, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad began receiving divine [[revelation]]s from God through the [[Archangel]] [[Gabriel]] in 610 AD, and advocated his form of [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheism]] against Meccan paganism. After enduring persecution from the pagan tribes for 13 years, Muhammad emigrated (see [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijrah]]) in 622 with his companions, the ''[[Muhajirun]]'', to Yathrib (later called Medina). The conflict between the Quraysh and the Muslims, however, continued: The two fought in the [[Battle of Badr]], where the Muslims defeated the Quraysh outside Medina; while the [[Battle of Uhud]] ended indecisively. Overall, Meccan efforts to annihilate Islam failed and proved to be costly and unsuccessful. During the [[Battle of the Trench]] in 627, the combined armies of Arabia were unable to defeat Muhammad's forces.<ref name=lapidus-32>[[#Lapidus|Lapidus]], p. 32</ref>\n[[File:Khalili Collection Hajj Mecca panorama.jpg|alt=|thumb]]\nIn 628, Muhammad and his followers wanted to enter Mecca for pilgrimage, but were blocked by the Quraysh. Subsequently, Muslims and Meccans entered into the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], whereby the Quraysh promised to cease fighting Muslims and promised that Muslims would be allowed into the city to perform the pilgrimage the following year. It was meant to be a ceasefire for 10 years. However, just two years later, the Quraysh violated the truce by slaughtering a group of Muslims and their allies. Muhammad and his companions, now 10,000 strong, marched into Mecca. However, instead of continuing their fight, the city of Mecca surrendered to Muhammad, who declared peace and amnesty for its inhabitants. The pagan imagery was destroyed by Muhammad's followers and the location [[Islamization|Islamized]] and rededicated to the worship of God. Mecca was declared as the holiest site in Islam ordaining it as the center of Muslim pilgrimage, one of the faith's [[Five Pillars of Islam|Five Pillars]]. Then, Muhammad returned to Medina, after assigning [[Akib ibn Usaid]] as governor of the city. His other activities in Arabia led to the unification of the peninsula.<ref name = EIE/><ref name=lapidus-32/>\n\nMuhammad died in 632, but with the sense of unity that he had passed on to his [[Ummah]] (Islamic nation), Islam began a rapid expansion, and within the next few hundred years stretched from North Africa into Asia and parts of Europe. As the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] grew, Mecca continued to attract pilgrims from all across the [[Muslim world]] and beyond, as Muslims came to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nMecca also attracted a year-round population of scholars, pious Muslims who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and local inhabitants who served the pilgrims. Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, pilgrims arrived by boat at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq.\n\n===Medieval and pre-modern times===\n[[File:First Saudi State Big.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The [[First Saudi State]]]]\n\nMecca was never the capital of any of the [[caliphate|Islamic states]] but Muslim rulers did contribute to its upkeep. During the reigns of [[Umar]] (634\u2013644 CE) and [[Uthman ibn Affan]] (644\u2013656) concerns of flooding caused the caliphs to bring in Christian engineers to build barrages in the low-lying quarters and construct dykes and embankments to protect the area round the Kaaba.<ref name = EIE>\"Makka \u2013 The pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods\", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n\nMuhammad's [[Muhammad in Medina|migration to Medina]] shifted the focus away from Mecca. This focus moved still more when [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, took power choosing [[Kufa]] as his capital. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] moved the capital to [[Damascus]] in Syria and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to [[Baghdad]], in modern-day Iraq, which remained the center of the Islamic Empire for nearly 500 years. Mecca re-entered Islamic political history during the [[Second Islamic Civil War]], when it was held by [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], an early Muslim who opposed the Umayyad caliphs. The city was twice besieged by the Umayyads, in [[Siege of Mecca (683)|683]] and [[Siege of Mecca (692)|692]]. For some time thereafter the city figured little in politics, remaining a city of devotion and scholarship governed by the Hashemite [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharifs]].\n\nIn 930, Mecca was attacked and sacked by [[Qarmatians]], a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] [[Islamic schools and branches|Muslim sect]] led by [[Ab\u016b-T\u0101hir Al-Jann\u0101b\u012b]] and centered in eastern Arabia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0832430.html |title=Mecca |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=6 April 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817083014/http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0832430.html |archivedate=17 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] hit Mecca in 1349.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/blackDeath.html |title=The Islamic World to 1600: The Mongol Invasions (The Black Death) |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |accessdate=6 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721033845/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/blackDeath.html |archivedate=21 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1517, the Sharif, Barakat bin Muhammed, acknowledged the supremacy of the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Ottoman Caliph]] but retained a great degree of local autonomy.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Mecca|volume=17|page=952}}</ref>\n\nIn 1803 the city was captured by the [[First Saudi State]],<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/7.htm The Saud Family and Wahhabi Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721222356/http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/7.htm |date=21 July 2011 }}\".

This was a massive blow to the prestige of the (Turkish) Ottoman Empire, which had exercised sovereignty over the holy city since 1517. The Ottomans assigned the task of bringing Mecca back under Ottoman control to their powerful ''[[Khedive]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]].

In his travels, he provides us with an important description of the city. Around the year 729, Ibn Battuta arrived in Mecca. Immediately when Battuta arrived in Mecca it felt like a holy sanctuary and thus he started the rites of the pilgrimage. He remained in Mecca for a couple of years. During Battuta's second year there, his caravan arrived \"with a great quantity of alms for the support of those who were staying in Mecca and Medina\" (p.&nbsp;51). Giving these alms to the poor also helped to fulfill another pillar of faith, while he was also fulfilling the pillar of making the Pilgrimage to Mecca. While in Mecca, prayers were made for the King of Irak and then also for El Melik El Nasir. The prayers were made in the Temple of Mecca. This temple is very large, but was also destroyed once and was rebuilt a little bit smaller than the original. The temple also contained images of angels, prophets, Jesus, his mother Mary and many others. This temple is one of the most important parts of Mecca due to the fact that many people make the pilgrimage to Mecca for the purpose of going to the temple. The people of Mecca were also an important aspect of the village. They were described as being humble and kind, also willing to give a part of everything they had to someone who had nothing. The inhabitants of Mecca and the village itself was very clean. There was also a sense of elegance to the village. Ibn Battuta spent about three years in Mecca before he left with intentions of moving on to Yemen. Mecca nowadays is a lot different than Battuta saw it, but it still is a place of holiness. The city has become more advanced with new technology, but along with new skyscrapers and event centers, it still contains temples that are important for the pilgrimages to Mecca.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Travels of Ibn Battuta|last=Battuta|first=Ibn|publisher=Cosimo|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Revolt of the Sharif of Mecca===\nIn [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire was at war with Britain and its allies, having sided with Germany. It had successfully repulsed an attack on Istanbul in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and on Baghdad in the [[Siege of Kut]]. The British agent [[T.E. Lawrence]] conspired with the Ottoman governor [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussain bin Ali]], the Sharif of Mecca. Hussein bin Ali revolted against the Ottoman Empire from Mecca, and it was the first city captured by his forces in the [[Battle of Mecca (1916)]]. Sharif's revolt proved a turning point of the war on the eastern front. Sharif Hussein declared a new state, the [[Kingdom of Hejaz]], and declared Mecca as the capital of the new kingdom.\n\nNews reports in November 1916<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Saturday 25 November 1916, reprinted in ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Friday 25 November 2016 issue (p. 36)</ref> via contact in [[Cairo]] with returning [[Hajj]] pilgrims, said that with the Ottoman Turkish authorities gone, Mecca at Hajj 1916 was thankfully free of the previous massive extortion and illegal money-demanding by Turks who were agents of the Ottoman government.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mecca (1924)|1924 Battle of Mecca]], the Sharif of Mecca was overthrown by the Saud family, and Mecca was incorporated into Saudi Arabia.<ref name=encarta>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028055612/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577367/Mecca.html \"Mecca\"] at [[Encarta]].

As one academic put it, \"[Meccans] have no means of earning a living but by serving the hajjis.\" Income generated from the Hajj, in fact, not only powers the Meccan economy but has historically had far-reaching effects on the economy of the entire Arabian Peninsula. The income was generated in a number of ways. One method was taxing the pilgrims. Taxes especially increased during the [[Great Depression]], and many of these taxes existed as late as 1972. Another way the Hajj generates income is through services to pilgrims. For example, the Saudi [[Flag carrier|national airline]], [[Saudia]], generates 12% of its income from the pilgrimage. Fares paid by pilgrims to reach Mecca by land also generate income; as do the hotels and lodging companies that house them.<ref name = EIModern/>\n\nThe city takes in more than $100 million, while the Saudi government spends about $50 million on services for the Hajj. There are some industries and factories in the city, but Mecca no longer plays a major role in Saudi Arabia's economy, which is mainly based on oil exports.<ref>''Mecca.'' World Book Encyclopedia. 2003 edition. Volume M. p. 353</ref> The few industries operating in Mecca include textiles, furniture, and utensils. The majority of the economy is service-oriented.\n\n[[File:Downtown Makkah Azizia.jpg|thumb|Makkah Azizia district at noon]]\nNevertheless, many industries have been set up in Mecca. Various types of enterprises that have existed since 1970: corrugated iron manufacturing, copper smithies, carpentry shops, upholstering establishments, vegetable oil extraction plants, sweets manufacturies, flour mills, bakeries, poultry farms, frozen food importing, photography processing, secretarial establishments, ice factories, bottling plants for soft drinks, barber shops, book shops, travel agencies and banks.<ref name = EIModern/>\n\nThe city has grown substantially in the 20th and 21st centuries, as the convenience and affordability of [[jet aircraft|jet]] travel has increased the number of pilgrims participating in the [[Hajj]]. Thousands of Saudis are employed year-round to oversee the Hajj and staff the hotels and shops that cater to pilgrims; these workers in turn have increased the demand for housing and services.

As a result of the vast numbers of pilgrims coming to the city each year, Mecca has become by far the most diverse city in the Muslim world. In contrast to the rest of Saudi Arabia, and particularly [[Najd]], Mecca has, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', become \"a striking oasis\" of free thought and discussion and, also, of \"unlikely liberalism\" as \"Meccans see themselves as a bulwark against the creeping extremism that has overtaken much Islamic debate\".<ref name= NYT/>\n\nThe first press was brought to Mecca in 1885 by [[Osman Nuri Pasha]], an Ottoman [[W\u0101li]]. During the Hashemite period, it was used to print the city's official gazette, ''Al-Qibla''. The Saudi regime expanded this press into a larger operation, introducing the new Saudi official gazette ''Umm al-Qur\u0101''. Henceforth presses and printing techniques were introduced in the city from around the [[Middle East]], mostly via Jeddah.<ref name = EIModern/>\n\nMecca owns its hometown paper, ''[[Al Nadwa]]''. However, other Saudi and international newspapers are also provided in Mecca such as the ''[[Saudi Gazette]]'', ''[[Al Madinah]]'', ''[[Okaz]]'' and ''[[Al-Bilad (Saudi newspaper)|Al-Bilad]]''. The first three are Mecca's (and other Saudi cities') primary newspapers focusing mainly on issues that affect the city, with over a million readers.\n\nMany television stations serving the city area include [[Saudi T.V. Channel 1|Saudi TV1]], [[Saudi T.V. Channel II|Saudi TV2]], [[Saudi TV Sports]], [[Al-Ekhbariya]], [[Arab Radio and Television Network]] and various cable, satellite and other specialty television providers.\n\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the most common sports were impromptu wrestling and foot races.<ref name = EIModern/> [[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Mecca, the city hosting some of the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia such as, [[Al-Wahda (Mecca)|Al-Wahda FC]] (established in 1945).

During [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], [[Ful medames|fava beans in olive oil]] and [[samosa]]s are the most popular dishes and are eaten at [[dusk]].

Saadanius is considered to be a primate closely related to the common ancestor of the [[Old World monkey]]s and [[apes]].

King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]] (Ibn Saud) pressed them forward as he saw them as a means of convenience and better governance. While in [[Ali of Hejaz|King Husayn's]] time there were about 20 telephones in the entire city; in 1936 the number jumped to 450, totalling about half the telephones in the country. During that time, telephone lines were extended to Jeddah and Ta\u2019if, but not to the capital [[Riyadh]]. By 1985, Mecca, like other Saudi cities, possessed modern telephone, telex, radio and television communications.<ref name=EIModern>\"Makka \u2013 The Modern City\", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n\nLimited radio communication was established within the Kingdom under the Hashimites. In 1929, wireless stations were set up in various towns of the region, creating a network that would become fully functional by 1932. Soon after World War II, the existing network was greatly expanded and improved. Since then, radio communication has been used extensively in directing the pilgrimage and addressing the pilgrims. This practice started in 1950, with the initiation of broadcasts the [[Day of Arafa]], and increased until 1957, at which time Radio Makka became the most powerful station in the Middle East at 50&nbsp;kW. Later, power was increased to 450&nbsp;kW.

According to early Islamic historians such as [[Ibn Ishaq]], [[Abraha]], the Christian ruler of [[Yemen]], which was subject to the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] of [[Ethiopia]], built a great [[Church (building)|church]] at [[Sanaa]] known as ''al-Qullays'' in honor of the Aksumite king [[Negus]]. It gained widespread fame, even gaining the notice of the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name=\"Hajjah\" /> Abraha attempted to divert the pilgrimage of Arab people from Kaaba to al-Qullays and appointed a man named Muhammad ibn Khuza'i to Mecca and [[Tihamah]] as a king with a message that al-Qullays was both much better than other houses of worship and purer, having not been defiled by the housing of idols.<ref name=\"Hajjah\" /> When Muhammad ibn Khuza'i got as far as the land of [[Banu Kinanah|Kinana]], the people of the lowland, knowing what he had come for, sent a man of [[Banu Hudhayl|Hudhayl]] called \u02bfUrwa bin Hayyad al-Milasi, who shot him with an arrow, killing him. His brother Qays who was with him fled to Abraha and told him the news, which increased his rage and fury and he swore to raid the Kinana tribe and destroy the temple. Ibn Ishaq further states that one of the men of the [[Quraysh]]i tribe was angered by this, and going to Sana'a, slipped into the church at night and defiled it; it is widely assumed that they did so by [[defecation|defecating]] in it.

He was born in a minor faction, the [[Hashemites]], of the ruling [[Quraysh tribe]]. It was in Mecca, in the nearby mountain cave of Hira on [[Jabal al-Nour]], that, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad began receiving divine [[revelation]]s from God through the [[Archangel]] [[Gabriel]] in 610 AD, and advocated his form of [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheism]] against Meccan paganism. After enduring persecution from the pagan tribes for 13 years, Muhammad emigrated (see [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijrah]]) in 622 with his companions, the ''[[Muhajirun]]'', to Yathrib (later called Medina). The conflict between the Quraysh and the Muslims, however, continued: The two fought in the [[Battle of Badr]], where the Muslims defeated the Quraysh outside Medina; while the [[Battle of Uhud]] ended indecisively. Overall, Meccan efforts to annihilate Islam failed and proved to be costly and unsuccessful. During the [[Battle of the Trench]] in 627, the combined armies of Arabia were unable to defeat Muhammad's forces.<ref name=lapidus-32>[[#Lapidus|Lapidus]], p. 32</ref>\n[[File:Khalili Collection Hajj Mecca panorama.jpg|alt=|thumb]]\nIn 628, Muhammad and his followers wanted to enter Mecca for pilgrimage, but were blocked by the Quraysh. Subsequently, Muslims and Meccans entered into the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], whereby the Quraysh promised to cease fighting Muslims and promised that Muslims would be allowed into the city to perform the pilgrimage the following year. It was meant to be a ceasefire for 10 years. However, just two years later, the Quraysh violated the truce by slaughtering a group of Muslims and their allies. Muhammad and his companions, now 10,000 strong, marched into Mecca. However, instead of continuing their fight, the city of Mecca surrendered to Muhammad, who declared peace and amnesty for its inhabitants. The pagan imagery was destroyed by Muhammad's followers and the location [[Islamization|Islamized]] and rededicated to the worship of God. Mecca was declared as the holiest site in Islam ordaining it as the center of Muslim pilgrimage, one of the faith's [[Five Pillars of Islam|Five Pillars]]. Then, Muhammad returned to Medina, after assigning [[Akib ibn Usaid]] as governor of the city. His other activities in Arabia led to the unification of the peninsula.<ref name = EIE/><ref name=lapidus-32/>\n\nMuhammad died in 632, but with the sense of unity that he had passed on to his [[Ummah]] (Islamic nation), Islam began a rapid expansion, and within the next few hundred years stretched from North Africa into Asia and parts of Europe. As the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] grew, Mecca continued to attract pilgrims from all across the [[Muslim world]] and beyond, as Muslims came to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nMecca also attracted a year-round population of scholars, pious Muslims who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and local inhabitants who served the pilgrims. Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, pilgrims arrived by boat at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq.\n\n===Medieval and pre-modern times===\n[[File:First Saudi State Big.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The [[First Saudi State]]]]\n\nMecca was never the capital of any of the [[caliphate|Islamic states]] but Muslim rulers did contribute to its upkeep. During the reigns of [[Umar]] (634\u2013644 CE) and [[Uthman ibn Affan]] (644\u2013656) concerns of flooding caused the caliphs to bring in Christian engineers to build barrages in the low-lying quarters and construct dykes and embankments to protect the area round the Kaaba.<ref name = EIE>\"Makka \u2013 The pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods\", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n\nMuhammad's [[Muhammad in Medina|migration to Medina]] shifted the focus away from Mecca. This focus moved still more when [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, took power choosing [[Kufa]] as his capital. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] moved the capital to [[Damascus]] in Syria and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to [[Baghdad]], in modern-day Iraq, which remained the center of the Islamic Empire for nearly 500 years. Mecca re-entered Islamic political history during the [[Second Islamic Civil War]], when it was held by [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], an early Muslim who opposed the Umayyad caliphs. The city was twice besieged by the Umayyads, in [[Siege of Mecca (683)|683]] and [[Siege of Mecca (692)|692]]. For some time thereafter the city figured little in politics, remaining a city of devotion and scholarship governed by the Hashemite [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharifs]].\n\nIn 930, Mecca was attacked and sacked by [[Qarmatians]], a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] [[Islamic schools and branches|Muslim sect]] led by [[Ab\u016b-T\u0101hir Al-Jann\u0101b\u012b]] and centered in eastern Arabia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0832430.html |title=Mecca |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=6 April 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817083014/http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0832430.html |archivedate=17 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] hit Mecca in 1349.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/blackDeath.html |title=The Islamic World to 1600: The Mongol Invasions (The Black Death) |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |accessdate=6 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721033845/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/blackDeath.html |archivedate=21 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1517, the Sharif, Barakat bin Muhammed, acknowledged the supremacy of the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Ottoman Caliph]] but retained a great degree of local autonomy.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Mecca|volume=17|page=952}}</ref>\n\nIn 1803 the city was captured by the [[First Saudi State]],<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/7.htm The Saud Family and Wahhabi Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721222356/http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/7.htm |date=21 July 2011 }}\".

This was a massive blow to the prestige of the (Turkish) Ottoman Empire, which had exercised sovereignty over the holy city since 1517. The Ottomans assigned the task of bringing Mecca back under Ottoman control to their powerful ''[[Khedive]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]].

In his travels, he provides us with an important description of the city. Around the year 729, Ibn Battuta arrived in Mecca. Immediately when Battuta arrived in Mecca it felt like a holy sanctuary and thus he started the rites of the pilgrimage. He remained in Mecca for a couple of years. During Battuta's second year there, his caravan arrived \"with a great quantity of alms for the support of those who were staying in Mecca and Medina\" (p.&nbsp;51). Giving these alms to the poor also helped to fulfill another pillar of faith, while he was also fulfilling the pillar of making the Pilgrimage to Mecca. While in Mecca, prayers were made for the King of Irak and then also for El Melik El Nasir. The prayers were made in the Temple of Mecca. This temple is very large, but was also destroyed once and was rebuilt a little bit smaller than the original. The temple also contained images of angels, prophets, Jesus, his mother Mary and many others. This temple is one of the most important parts of Mecca due to the fact that many people make the pilgrimage to Mecca for the purpose of going to the temple. The people of Mecca were also an important aspect of the village. They were described as being humble and kind, also willing to give a part of everything they had to someone who had nothing. The inhabitants of Mecca and the village itself was very clean. There was also a sense of elegance to the village. Ibn Battuta spent about three years in Mecca before he left with intentions of moving on to Yemen. Mecca nowadays is a lot different than Battuta saw it, but it still is a place of holiness. The city has become more advanced with new technology, but along with new skyscrapers and event centers, it still contains temples that are important for the pilgrimages to Mecca.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Travels of Ibn Battuta|last=Battuta|first=Ibn|publisher=Cosimo|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Revolt of the Sharif of Mecca===\nIn [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire was at war with Britain and its allies, having sided with Germany. It had successfully repulsed an attack on Istanbul in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and on Baghdad in the [[Siege of Kut]]. The British agent [[T.E. Lawrence]] conspired with the Ottoman governor [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussain bin Ali]], the Sharif of Mecca. Hussein bin Ali revolted against the Ottoman Empire from Mecca, and it was the first city captured by his forces in the [[Battle of Mecca (1916)]]. Sharif's revolt proved a turning point of the war on the eastern front. Sharif Hussein declared a new state, the [[Kingdom of Hejaz]], and declared Mecca as the capital of the new kingdom.\n\nNews reports in November 1916<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Saturday 25 November 1916, reprinted in ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Friday 25 November 2016 issue (p. 36)</ref> via contact in [[Cairo]] with returning [[Hajj]] pilgrims, said that with the Ottoman Turkish authorities gone, Mecca at Hajj 1916 was thankfully free of the previous massive extortion and illegal money-demanding by Turks who were agents of the Ottoman government.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mecca (1924)|1924 Battle of Mecca]], the Sharif of Mecca was overthrown by the Saud family, and Mecca was incorporated into Saudi Arabia.<ref name=encarta>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028055612/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577367/Mecca.html \"Mecca\"] at [[Encarta]].

As one academic put it, \"[Meccans] have no means of earning a living but by serving the hajjis.\" Income generated from the Hajj, in fact, not only powers the Meccan economy but has historically had far-reaching effects on the economy of the entire Arabian Peninsula. The income was generated in a number of ways. One method was taxing the pilgrims. Taxes especially increased during the [[Great Depression]], and many of these taxes existed as late as 1972. Another way the Hajj generates income is through services to pilgrims. For example, the Saudi [[Flag carrier|national airline]], [[Saudia]], generates 12% of its income from the pilgrimage. Fares paid by pilgrims to reach Mecca by land also generate income; as do the hotels and lodging companies that house them.<ref name = EIModern/>\n\nThe city takes in more than $100 million, while the Saudi government spends about $50 million on services for the Hajj. There are some industries and factories in the city, but Mecca no longer plays a major role in Saudi Arabia's economy, which is mainly based on oil exports.<ref>''Mecca.'' World Book Encyclopedia. 2003 edition. Volume M. p. 353</ref> The few industries operating in Mecca include textiles, furniture, and utensils. The majority of the economy is service-oriented.\n\n[[File:Downtown Makkah Azizia.jpg|thumb|Makkah Azizia district at noon]]\nNevertheless, many industries have been set up in Mecca. Various types of enterprises that have existed since 1970: corrugated iron manufacturing, copper smithies, carpentry shops, upholstering establishments, vegetable oil extraction plants, sweets manufacturies, flour mills, bakeries, poultry farms, frozen food importing, photography processing, secretarial establishments, ice factories, bottling plants for soft drinks, barber shops, book shops, travel agencies and banks.<ref name = EIModern/>\n\nThe city has grown substantially in the 20th and 21st centuries, as the convenience and affordability of [[jet aircraft|jet]] travel has increased the number of pilgrims participating in the [[Hajj]]. Thousands of Saudis are employed year-round to oversee the Hajj and staff the hotels and shops that cater to pilgrims; these workers in turn have increased the demand for housing and services.

As a result of the vast numbers of pilgrims coming to the city each year, Mecca has become by far the most diverse city in the Muslim world. In contrast to the rest of Saudi Arabia, and particularly [[Najd]], Mecca has, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', become \"a striking oasis\" of free thought and discussion and, also, of \"unlikely liberalism\" as \"Meccans see themselves as a bulwark against the creeping extremism that has overtaken much Islamic debate\".<ref name= NYT/>\n\nThe first press was brought to Mecca in 1885 by [[Osman Nuri Pasha]], an Ottoman [[W\u0101li]]. During the Hashemite period, it was used to print the city's official gazette, ''Al-Qibla''. The Saudi regime expanded this press into a larger operation, introducing the new Saudi official gazette ''Umm al-Qur\u0101''. Henceforth presses and printing techniques were introduced in the city from around the [[Middle East]], mostly via Jeddah.<ref name = EIModern/>\n\nMecca owns its hometown paper, ''[[Al Nadwa]]''. However, other Saudi and international newspapers are also provided in Mecca such as the ''[[Saudi Gazette]]'', ''[[Al Madinah]]'', ''[[Okaz]]'' and ''[[Al-Bilad (Saudi newspaper)|Al-Bilad]]''. The first three are Mecca's (and other Saudi cities') primary newspapers focusing mainly on issues that affect the city, with over a million readers.\n\nMany television stations serving the city area include [[Saudi T.V. Channel 1|Saudi TV1]], [[Saudi T.V. Channel II|Saudi TV2]], [[Saudi TV Sports]], [[Al-Ekhbariya]], [[Arab Radio and Television Network]] and various cable, satellite and other specialty television providers.\n\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the most common sports were impromptu wrestling and foot races.<ref name = EIModern/> [[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Mecca, the city hosting some of the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia such as, [[Al-Wahda (Mecca)|Al-Wahda FC]] (established in 1945).

During [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], [[Ful medames|fava beans in olive oil]] and [[samosa]]s are the most popular dishes and are eaten at [[dusk]].

Saadanius is considered to be a primate closely related to the common ancestor of the [[Old World monkey]]s and [[apes]].

King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]] (Ibn Saud) pressed them forward as he saw them as a means of convenience and better governance. While in [[Ali of Hejaz|King Husayn's]] time there were about 20 telephones in the entire city; in 1936 the number jumped to 450, totalling about half the telephones in the country. During that time, telephone lines were extended to Jeddah and Ta\u2019if, but not to the capital [[Riyadh]]. By 1985, Mecca, like other Saudi cities, possessed modern telephone, telex, radio and television communications.<ref name=EIModern>\"Makka \u2013 The Modern City\", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n\nLimited radio communication was established within the Kingdom under the Hashimites. In 1929, wireless stations were set up in various towns of the region, creating a network that would become fully functional by 1932. Soon after World War II, the existing network was greatly expanded and improved. Since then, radio communication has been used extensively in directing the pilgrimage and addressing the pilgrims. This practice started in 1950, with the initiation of broadcasts the [[Day of Arafa]], and increased until 1957, at which time Radio Makka became the most powerful station in the Middle East at 50&nbsp;kW. Later, power was increased to 450&nbsp;kW.

It is a [[List of International Cricket Council members#Full Member|Full Member]] of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) with [[Test cricket|Test]] , [[One-Day International]] (ODI) and [[T20 International]] (T20I) status. It played [[Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2000\u201301|its first Test match]] in November 2000 against [[India national cricket team|India]] in [[Dhaka]], becoming the tenth Test-playing nation.\n\nBangladesh's first official foray into international cricket came in the [[1979 ICC Trophy]] in England. On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played its first ODI match, against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] in the [[1986 Asia Cup|Asia Cup]]. For a long time, [[Association football|football]] was the most popular sport in Bangladesh, but cricket gradually became very popular \u2013 particularly in urban areas \u2013 and by the late 1990s had surpassed football. [[File:Bangladesh national cricket team 1986.jpg|260x260px|thumb|Bangladesh made its full debut in international cricket in the 1986 Asia Cup.|alt=]]\n\nIn 1997, Bangladesh won the [[1997 ICC Trophy|ICC Trophy]] in Malaysia and thus qualified for its first [[Cricket World Cup]] to participate in England in [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]]. There, it defeated [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] \u2013 causing much upset \u2013 and also [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. On 26 June 2000, Bangladesh was granted full ICC membership.\n\nBangladesh holds the record for most consecutive losses in Tests (21, between 2000 and 2002) and ODIs (23, between 2001 and 2004). After gaining Full Member status with the ICC, Bangladesh had to wait until 2004 for its first ODI win since the 1999 World Cup. The team on the losing side on that occasion was [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], who also participated in Bangladesh's maiden Test victory in 2005; by securing a draw in the second match, Bangladesh won their first Test series. In 2009 Bangladesh toured the West Indies for two Tests and by winning both secured their first overseas Test series victory.\n\nAs of 20 June 2019, Bangladesh has played 114 Tests, winning thirteen. Its first victory was against team Zimbabwe, and the next two came against the West Indian team. Results have improved predominantly at home with draws earned against New Zealand, Pakistan, India and South Africa and wins against England, Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref name=\"Testlist\">{{citation |url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/team/25.html?class=1;template=results;type=team;view=results |title=Statsguru&nbsp;\u2013 Bangladesh&nbsp;\u2013 Test matches&nbsp;\u2013 Team analysis |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref> They played their 100th Test when they [[Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016\u201317|toured Sri Lanka]] in March 2017.<ref name=\"Bang100\">{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/story/1083021.html |title=Bangladesh to play 100th Test in March |work=ESPNcricinfo |date=17 February 2017 |accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe team has been more successful in ODIs, having won 124 of its 367 matches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/team/25.html?class=2;template=results;type=team;view=results |title=Statsguru&nbsp;\u2013 Bangladesh&nbsp;\u2013 ODI matches&nbsp;\u2013 Team analysis |work=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref> It has also played 85 [[Twenty20 International]]s, winning 26.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/team/25.html?class=3;template=results;type=team;view=results |title=Statsguru&nbsp;\u2013 Bangladesh&nbsp;\u2013 T20I matches&nbsp;\u2013 Team analysis |work=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nBangladesh is currently ranked 9th in Tests, 7th in ODIs and 9th in T20Is by the ICC.<ref name=\"ICCrankings\">{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/page/211271.html |title=ICC rankings \u2013 ICC Test, ODI and Twenty20 rankings |work=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of cricket in Bangladesh}}\n\n===20th century===\nSeveral [[East Pakistan]]-based sides played in Pakistani domestic cricket prior to Bangladesh's declaration of independence of 1971\u2014the [[East Pakistan cricket team]] fielded [[List of East Pakistan first-class cricketers|three players]] who later played [[ICC Trophy]] matches.

It is a [[List of International Cricket Council members#Full Member|Full Member]] of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) with [[Test cricket|Test]] , [[One-Day International]] (ODI) and [[T20 International]] (T20I) status. It played [[Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2000\u201301|its first Test match]] in November 2000 against [[India national cricket team|India]] in [[Dhaka]], becoming the tenth Test-playing nation.\n\nBangladesh's first official foray into international cricket came in the [[1979 ICC Trophy]] in England. On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played its first ODI match, against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] in the [[1986 Asia Cup|Asia Cup]]. For a long time, [[Association football|football]] was the most popular sport in Bangladesh, but cricket gradually became very popular \u2013 particularly in urban areas \u2013 and by the late 1990s had surpassed football. [[File:Bangladesh national cricket team 1986.jpg|260x260px|thumb|Bangladesh made its full debut in international cricket in the 1986 Asia Cup.|alt=]]\n\nIn 1997, Bangladesh won the [[1997 ICC Trophy|ICC Trophy]] in Malaysia and thus qualified for its first [[Cricket World Cup]] to participate in England in [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]]. There, it defeated [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] \u2013 causing much upset \u2013 and also [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. On 26 June 2000, Bangladesh was granted full ICC membership.\n\nBangladesh holds the record for most consecutive losses in Tests (21, between 2000 and 2002) and ODIs (23, between 2001 and 2004). After gaining Full Member status with the ICC, Bangladesh had to wait until 2004 for its first ODI win since the 1999 World Cup. The team on the losing side on that occasion was [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], who also participated in Bangladesh's maiden Test victory in 2005; by securing a draw in the second match, Bangladesh won their first Test series. In 2009 Bangladesh toured the West Indies for two Tests and by winning both secured their first overseas Test series victory.\n\nAs of 20 June 2019, Bangladesh has played 114 Tests, winning thirteen. Its first victory was against team Zimbabwe, and the next two came against the West Indian team. Results have improved predominantly at home with draws earned against New Zealand, Pakistan, India and South Africa and wins against England, Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref name=\"Testlist\">{{citation |url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/team/25.html?class=1;template=results;type=team;view=results |title=Statsguru&nbsp;\u2013 Bangladesh&nbsp;\u2013 Test matches&nbsp;\u2013 Team analysis |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref> They played their 100th Test when they [[Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2016\u201317|toured Sri Lanka]] in March 2017.<ref name=\"Bang100\">{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/story/1083021.html |title=Bangladesh to play 100th Test in March |work=ESPNcricinfo |date=17 February 2017 |accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe team has been more successful in ODIs, having won 124 of its 367 matches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/team/25.html?class=2;template=results;type=team;view=results |title=Statsguru&nbsp;\u2013 Bangladesh&nbsp;\u2013 ODI matches&nbsp;\u2013 Team analysis |work=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref> It has also played 85 [[Twenty20 International]]s, winning 26.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/team/25.html?class=3;template=results;type=team;view=results |title=Statsguru&nbsp;\u2013 Bangladesh&nbsp;\u2013 T20I matches&nbsp;\u2013 Team analysis |work=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nBangladesh is currently ranked 9th in Tests, 7th in ODIs and 9th in T20Is by the ICC.<ref name=\"ICCrankings\">{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/page/211271.html |title=ICC rankings \u2013 ICC Test, ODI and Twenty20 rankings |work=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of cricket in Bangladesh}}\n\n===20th century===\nSeveral [[East Pakistan]]-based sides played in Pakistani domestic cricket prior to Bangladesh's declaration of independence of 1971\u2014the [[East Pakistan cricket team]] fielded [[List of East Pakistan first-class cricketers|three players]] who later played [[ICC Trophy]] matches.
