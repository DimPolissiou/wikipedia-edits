Nothing is spelt out, but each character and its relevance in the plot is unveiled through the narrative that revolves around Shreyas Talwalkar ([[Swapnil Joshi]]). He is thrown into college in Pune on his mother's insistence. Under circumstances which are reminiscent of college life in the Hindi cinema of the 80s, Shreyas makes friends with DSP aka Digya ([[Ankush Choudhary]]) and his Katta gang. A do-gooder standing tall for friendships in the face of a creepy Saai ([[Jitendra Joshi]]), Shreyas becomes the voice of reason for the rustic gang.\n\nHe finds himself attracted to Shirin, but Meenu ([[Urmila Kanetkar]]) get attracted to Shreyas which creates a love triangle. Shirin is a student of Medical college and sister of Pritam. They are children of an MLA from Kolhapur, who hates Shirin, his own daughter. Shreyas accepts Meenu's proposal out of spite for Shirin (as she repeatedly turns down his advances) but is not sure about their future. Saai fixes his marriage with Shirin against her wish. Meenu later understands that Shreyas is deeply in love with Shirin. On Saai and Shirin's wedding day, Shreyas and his friends fight with Saai's gang. Finally Shirin marries Shreyas. She is aware that Shreyas is a patient of a deadly disease (probably blood cancer) and has only few remaining months of life.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is the sequel to ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the third film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] and written by [[Justin Theroux]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Six months after ''Iron Man'', Tony Stark resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of ''Iron Man'' in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from ''Iron Man'', while Cheadle was brought in to replace [[Terrence Howard]] in the role of [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]. In the early months of 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast. Filming took place from April to July of 2009, mostly in [[California]] like the first film except for a key sequence in [[Monaco]]. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical effects, the sequel primarily relied on [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the Iron Man suits.\n\n''Iron Man 2'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews for Downey's performance as well as the action sequences, musical score, and visual effects, but many critics deemed it to be inferior to the first film and criticized the villain and pacing. The sequel grossed over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. It received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A third installment of the series, ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', was released on May 3, 2013.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father, [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]], has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" />}} Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy.\n\nLater, Stark learns that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] as CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, wielding electrified whips. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force.\n\n[[Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing that \"Rushman\" is Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Stark invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. Tony discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo; it proves to be a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns that Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.\n\nAt the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor. Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, but Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of Rhodes' armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits [[suicide]] by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (comics)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.{{refn|name=Thor|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 150\n| footer = Downey, Johansson and Rockwell promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International\n| image1 = Robert Downey Jr SDCC 2009 3.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Scarlett Johansson SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Sam Rockwell SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| align = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />A billionaire who escaped captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with a suit of armor he created, he now struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands.

And the common denominator was really his friendship with Tony, and that's what we really tried to track in this one.

Can I run in it? Can I like throw myself over things with this?' And I think just the prep, you just have to put in the hours. That's what I realized is that just putting in the hours and doing the training and repetition and basically just befriending the stunt team and spending all day, every day, just over and over and over and over until you sell it.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonComicCon\" />\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Justin Hammer]]: <br />A rival weapons manufacturer.

After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including [[Mark Millar]], Stane became the main villain in ''Iron Man''. Millar argued the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical.<ref name=\"MarkMillar\" /> Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in ''[[Star Wars]]'' you had the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but [[Darth Vader]] is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' happen in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. You just can't do it.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarWars\" /> Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.<ref name=\"chat\" />\n\nDuring development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be \"the '[[Demon in a Bottle]]' version\".<ref name=\"chat\" /> While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend.<ref name=\"black\" /> Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the \"interim space\" between the origin and the \"Demon\" story arc.<ref name=\"et\" /> [[Shane Black]] gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on [[J.

The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard's representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating.<ref name=\"EWHoward\" /> Theroux denied the part of the report which claimed the size of the role had fluctuated.<ref name=\"TherouxNov2008\" /> In November 2013, Howard stated that, going into the film, the studio offered him far less than was in his three-picture contract, claiming they told him the second will be successful, \"with or without you,\" and, without mentioning him by name, said Downey \"took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out.\"<ref name=\"HowardInterview2\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered negotiations to play a pair of villains.<ref name=\"RourkeRockwell\" /> A few days later, Rockwell confirmed he would take the role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer.<ref name=\"RockwellAccepts\" /> Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S.<ref name=\"BettanyJARVIS\" /> Marvel entered into early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play the Black Widow,<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> Samuel L.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is the sequel to ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the third film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] and written by [[Justin Theroux]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Six months after ''Iron Man'', Tony Stark resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of ''Iron Man'' in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from ''Iron Man'', while Cheadle was brought in to replace [[Terrence Howard]] in the role of [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]. In the early months of 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast. Filming took place from April to July of 2009, mostly in [[California]] like the first film except for a key sequence in [[Monaco]]. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical effects, the sequel primarily relied on [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the Iron Man suits.\n\n''Iron Man 2'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews for Downey's performance as well as the action sequences, musical score, and visual effects, but many critics deemed it to be inferior to the first film and criticized the villain and pacing. The sequel grossed over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. It received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A third installment of the series, ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', was released on May 3, 2013.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father, [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]], has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" />}} Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy.\n\nLater, Stark learns that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] as CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, wielding electrified whips. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force.\n\n[[Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing that \"Rushman\" is Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Stark invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. Tony discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo; it proves to be a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns that Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.\n\nAt the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor. Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, but Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of Rhodes' armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits [[suicide]] by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (comics)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.{{refn|name=Thor|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 150\n| footer = Downey, Johansson and Rockwell promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International\n| image1 = Robert Downey Jr SDCC 2009 3.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Scarlett Johansson SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Sam Rockwell SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| align = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />A billionaire who escaped captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with a suit of armor he created, he now struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands.

So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man\u2013' that he's now really wondering what that means.

Can I run in it? Can I like throw myself over things with this?' And I think just the prep, you just have to put in the hours. That's what I realized is that just putting in the hours and doing the training and repetition and basically just befriending the stunt team and spending all day, every day, just over and over and over and over until you sell it.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonComicCon\" />\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Justin Hammer]]: <br />A rival weapons manufacturer.

This was [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] made as the introduction of a young [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to the MCU, as confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], Feige and ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' director [[Jon Watts]].<ref name=\"PeterParker\" /><ref name=\"PeterParker2\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Jon Favreau at Edwards Air Force Base.JPG|thumb|right|Jon Favreau meeting with members of the U.S. Air Force while filming at Edwards Air Force Base]]\nJon Favreau said it was originally his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man,<ref name=\"Eric Vespe\" /> with Obadiah Stane ([[Jeff Bridges]]) becoming [[Iron Monger]] during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including [[Mark Millar]], Stane became the main villain in ''Iron Man''. Millar argued the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical.<ref name=\"MarkMillar\" /> Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in ''[[Star Wars]]'' you had the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but [[Darth Vader]] is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' happen in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. You just can't do it.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarWars\" /> Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.<ref name=\"chat\" />\n\nDuring development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be \"the '[[Demon in a Bottle]]' version\".<ref name=\"chat\" /> While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend.<ref name=\"black\" /> Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the \"interim space\" between the origin and the \"Demon\" story arc.<ref name=\"et\" /> [[Shane Black]] gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], who became depressed with being \"the destroyer of worlds\" after working on the [[Manhattan Project]].<ref name=\"black\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nImmediately following ''Iron Man''{{'}}s release, Marvel Studios announced that they were developing a sequel, with an intended release date of April 30, 2010.<ref name=\"MarvelAnnouncesIM2\" /> In July 2008, after several months of negotiating, Favreau officially signed on to direct.<ref name=\"FavreauSignsIM2\" /> That same month, [[Justin Theroux]] signed to write the script, which would be based on a story written by Favreau and Downey.<ref name=\"TherouxWriting\" /> Theroux co-wrote ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'', which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel.<ref name=\"TherouxNov2008\" /> [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] [[storyboard]]ed the film,<ref name=\"Tartakovsky\" /> and [[Adi Granov]] returned to supervise the designs for [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|Iron Man's armor]].<ref name=\"chat\" />\n\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios came to an agreement to film ''Iron Man 2'', as well as their next three films, at Raleigh Studios in [[Manhattan Beach, California]].<ref name=\"FilmingRaleigh\" /> A few days later, Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard.<ref name=\"CheadleReplaces\" /> On being replaced, Howard stated, \"There was no explanation, apparently the contracts that we write and sign aren't worth the paper that they're printed on sometimes.

So, Legacy created what we called the \"football suits\" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the second film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Louis Leterrier]] from a screenplay by [[Zak Penn]], and stars [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] alongside [[Liv Tyler]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Ty Burrell]], and [[William Hurt]]. In the film, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the [[Weapon Plus|\"Super-Soldier\" program]] through gamma radiation. Banner goes on the run from the military while attempting to cure himself of the Hulk.\n\nAfter the mixed reception to Universal's 2003 film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character though Universal retained distribution rights. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' for Marvel, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a script that would be much closer to the comics and the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|1978 television series of the same name]]. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay. His script positioned the film as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, distancing it from the 2003 film to give the new version its own identity. Norton was ultimately not credited for his writing. Filming took place from July to November 2007, primarily in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], with additional filming in [[New York City]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of [[motion capture]] and [[computer-generated imagery]] to complete the film.\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' premiered at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in [[Universal City, California]], on June 8, 2008, and was released in the United States on June 13, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It was widely considered to be an improvement over the 2003 film, with praise for its visuals, action sequences, and portrayal of the title character. The film grossed $264.8 million worldwide, making it the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Reception|lowest-grossing film]] of the MCU. Norton disputed with Marvel over the final edit of the film and chose not to promote it. He was replaced in the role of Banner by [[Mark Ruffalo]] for future MCU films starting with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAt Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] meets with Dr. [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment\u2014part of a [[World War II]]-era [[Weapon Plus|\"super soldier\" program]] that Ross hopes to recreate\u2014fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the [[Hulk]] for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, killing several people inside, and injuring the General and Betty, along with others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.\n\nFive years later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed.<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the former of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Banner works at a bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the internet, he anonymously collaborates with a colleague known only as \"Mr. Blue\". He is learning [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, which is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impairs his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson, causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves futile for Ross' forces and they retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is faltering, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]], who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.\n\nA recovered Blonsky joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. The experiment mutates Blonsky into [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. In his new monstrous form, Blonsky rampages through [[Harlem]].\n\nRealizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a battle throughout Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky by nearly strangling him to death with a chain, but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea, and leaves Blonsky for Ross and his forces to arrest. After having a peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees New York.\n\nA month later, Banner is in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]]. Instead of suppressing his transformation, he begins to transform in a controlled manner with a slight smirk. [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him that a team{{refn|group=N|Identified offscreen as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].}} is being put together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]: <!-- Do NOT put \"/ Hulk\" here -- unless there's a reliable source which states he voiced the character. --> <br />A [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] and [[biochemist]] at Culver University who, because of exposure to [[gamma radiation]], transforms into an enormous green humanoid monster when enraged or agitated. [[David Duchovny]] was a front-runner for the film before Norton's casting,<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> while Louis Leterrier's original choice for the role was [[Mark Ruffalo]], who would later play Banner in future [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films.<ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who played Banner in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|TV series]].<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project. Thus, Norton rewrote the script.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> \"Edward's script has given Bruce's story real gravitas,\" Leterrier said. \"Admittedly I'm not the most adult director, but just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]].\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" />\n** [[Lou Ferrigno]] provides vocal performance as the [[Hulk]]. During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> This marks the third time Ferrigno portrayed the Hulk, having also voiced the character in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|1996 animated series]]. Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word. Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally, and added \"Leave me alone!\" and \"Hulk smash!\" The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended.<ref name=\"IGNDirectorSpeaks\" /> Ferrigno also has a cameo in the film as a security guard who is bribed by Banner with a pizza.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" />\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as [[Betty Ross]]: <br />A [[cellular biology|cellular biologist]] and Bruce's former girlfriend, from whom he is separated as a result of his condition. Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script and was a fan of the TV show because of the \"humanity and what [Banner] is going through\".<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> She was called about the role while driving to her home and she accepted the part after a day without reading the script.<ref name=\"TylerTimes\" /> Tyler and Norton spent hours discussing Bruce and Betty's life before he became the Hulk.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> She said filming the part \"was very physical, which was fun\",<ref name=\"TylerUSAToday\" /> and compared her performance to \"a deer caught in the headlights\", because of Betty's shock at Bruce's unexpected return into her life.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Roth]] as [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky / Abomination]]: <br />A Russian-born officer in the United Kingdom's [[Royal Marines Commandos]] loaned to Ross who, lusting for the Hulk's power, is injected with various serums that transforms him into a near-skeletal humanoid monster more powerful than the Hulk himself. Roth said he took the part to please his sons, who are comic-book superhero fans. As a teenager, Roth was a fan of the 1970s TV series, and he also found Leterrier's ideas \"very dark and very interesting\". Roth started watching the 2003 film to prepare for the part, but stopped as he did not want to be caught up in the controversy over its quality, and to compare himself to it.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> It was Roth who suggested Blonsky be a soldier, whereas in the comics he was a [[KGB]] agent.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Leterrier was a fan of Roth's work, and felt \"it's great watching a normal [[Cockney]] boy become a superhero!\",<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> but Marvel and Norton were initially reluctant to cast him.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> Before he was cast in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]'', [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] was in discussions for the role.<ref name=\"RayStevenson\" /> Roth prepared for the part by learning to fire guns and break into rooms with two experts.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Roth found it tough shooting the chases, because to show Blonsky's aging he could not work out.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He especially found it difficult to run while pulled with a harness, which was used to show the injected Blonsky's 30\u201340 mile per hour running abilities.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> [[Cyril Raffaelli]] performed some of Roth's stunts.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Roth enjoyed the [[motion capture]], which reminded him of [[fringe theatre]], and he hired his trainer from ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' to aid him in portraying the monster's movement.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]: The cellular biologist who develops a possible antidote to Banner's condition. Towards the end of the film, Sterns is exposed to some substance that begins his transformation into [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as [[Doc Samson|Leonard Samson]]: <br />A psychiatrist who is in a relationship with Betty during Bruce's absence. Burrell had performed with Norton in the [[off Broadway]] play ''[[Burn This]]'' in 2003, and when Leterrier met him, he recognized Burrell as the \"jerk\" from the 2004 ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' remake,<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> which was how Samson was characterized in the script before Norton rewrote it.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]]: <br />Betty's father and a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General (United States)|general]] who has dedicated himself to capturing the Hulk. Leterrier cast Hurt because \"Ross is more physical, more explosive in this movie, and no actor goes from zero to 100 as well as William.\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> He compared Ross to [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]].<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The Hulk is Hurt's favorite superhero, and his son is also a big fan of the character. Hurt found production very different from the typical \"pure anxiety\" of a studio film, finding it more akin to an independent film.<ref name=\"HurtMTV\" /> He described Ross as \"humiliated by Hulk's conscience: he actually sees and recognizes that it's more developed than his own, even though he's a patriot and a warrior for his country. He's sacrificed [much] for that purpose, but at the expense at times of his humanity \u2013 which he occasionally recovers.\"<ref name=\"HurtCalgary\" /> In June 2015, when reflecting on how his reprisal in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' was different from this film, Hurt said, \"What I created [for ''The Incredible Hulk''] was a Ross who was right out of the graphic novel type of thing, where he was as much of a cartoon, in a way, as the monsters were. His ego was just as big and his problems were just as big. I really did do that consciously. I created a General Ross before which created a verisimilitude for the monsters, by making him a human monster. I worked really hard on the makeup and the exaggerated behavior and things like that and a controlled psychosis.\"<ref name=\"HurtLATimesJune2015\" /> [[Sam Elliott]] had expressed interest in reprising the role from the first ''Hulk'' film.<ref name=\"ElliottMTV\" />\n\n[[Robert Downey Jr.]] has an uncredited cameo as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] at the end of the film. Downey appeared as a favor to [[Marvel Studios]], which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production.<ref name=\"DowneyCameo\" /> Hulk co-creator [[Stan Lee]] cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. [[Michael K. Williams]] appears as a Harlem bystander, a role that was written for him by Norton, who is a fan of ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]''.<ref name=\"MichaelKWilliams\" /> [[Paul Soles]], who voiced Banner in the 1966 ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' animated series, appears as Stanley, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner. Additionally, the late Bill Bixby appears, in a scene on his TV comedy-drama ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'' on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. [[Rickson Gracie]] has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor; despite Gracie's [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] background, he is credited as an [[Aikido]] instructor. Brazilian actress [[D\u00e9bora Nascimento]] makes a cameo as Martina, Banner's colleague at a beverage factory. [[Peter Mensah]] plays a small role as General Joe Gellar, one of General Ross' military friends/associates. Christina Cabot portrays Major Kathleen Sparr, General Ross' personal aid.<ref name=\"ChristinaCabot\" /> Hulk supporting characters, [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] and Jack McGee, make cameo appearances as Culver University students played by P.J. Kerr and Nicholas Rose, respectively.<ref name=\"WilsonMcGee\" /> [[Martin Starr]] plays a college student, credited as \"Computer Nerd\". This character was [[retcon|retroactively]] revealed to be [[Roger Harrington]], Starr's role in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), as confirmed in May 2019 by Feige.<ref name=\"FeigeStarr\" />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:IncredibleHulkTVreference.jpg|thumb|The writers of the film were influenced by the TV series of the same name. Example shown above: Norton (top) sitting in a more modern version of the machine Bill Bixby (below) sat in.]]\nAfter the release of [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', screenwriter [[James Schamus]] was planning a sequel which would continue the story featuring the Grey Hulk. He was also considering the Leader and the Abomination as villains.<ref name=\"AngHulkSequel\" /> Marvel wanted the Abomination because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk, unlike General Ross.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> During the filming of ''Hulk'', producer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date.<ref name=\"AradMay2005\" /> On January 18, 2006 Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money for ''The Incredible Hulk''{{'}}s production budget, with Universal distributing,<ref name=\"AICNHulk2\" /> because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a sequel.<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> Marvel felt it would be better to deviate from Ang Lee's style to continue the franchise, arguing his film was like a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book, and their next film needed to be, in Kevin Feige's words, \"''really'' starting the Marvel Hulk franchise\". Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet what \"everyone expects to see from having read the comics and seen the TV series\".<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nLouis Leterrier, who enjoyed the TV series as a child and liked the first film,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /><ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> had expressed interest in directing the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' film adaptation. [[Jon Favreau]] had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier's primary inspiration was [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]]'s ''Hulk: Gray'' (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him,<ref name=\"IGNJuly2006\" /> while Feige added the film would explore \"that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize you had in yourself\".<ref name=\"FeigeWish\" /> Arad also said the film would be \"a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross\".<ref name=\"May2006Empire\" />\n\n[[Zak Penn]], who wrote a draft of the first film in 1996, said the film would follow up ''Hulk'', but stressed it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]]' [[Hulk#Bibliography|run on the comic]]. He compared his script to ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', which was a very different film from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', but still in the same continuity.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film ''[[The Grand (film)|The Grand]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand.<ref name=\"TimesSquare\" /> Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> Feige commented, \"we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made ''Incredible Hulk'' was to get Hulk into the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> canon.\"<ref name=\"FeigeIGNApr2014\" />\n\nShortly after the release of ''The Incredible Hulk'', Gale Anne Hurd commented on the uncertainty of its relationship with Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' film. \"We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel.\" Hurd said that \"requel\", a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"reboot\" and \"sequel\", was a \"perfect\" description for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderHurdInt\" /> Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: \"I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> \"Audiences know this story,\" he added, \"[so] deal with it artfully.\" He wanted to \"have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion\".<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> The new origin story references [[Ultimate Marvel]]'s take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers.<ref name=\"ScifiWeekly\" /> Norton removed [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and toned down [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s presence.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns,<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> which references Bruce Jones' story.<ref name=\"ColliderFeige\" /> Norton rewrote scenes every day.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> Ultimately, the [[Writers Guild of America]] decided to credit the script solely to Penn,<ref name=\"PennSoleCredit\" /> who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]] explained \"The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue.\"<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> Penn said in 2008, \"I wasn't happy with [Norton] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script.\"<ref name=\"PennUnhappy\" /> Before either Penn or Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" />\n\n===Filming===\nLeterrier had to direct four [[second unit|units]] with a broken foot.<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting primarily took place in [[Toronto]], because mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing [[Yonge Street]] for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Morningside Park (Toronto)|Morningside Park]]. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> There was also shooting in the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]].<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> A factory in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], which was due for demolition, was the interior of the Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a [[backlot]] in Hamilton.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Other Canadian locations included [[CFB Trenton]] and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in [[New York City]] and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name=\"FilmingCFB\" /> While there, the crew shot at [[Rocinha]], [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]], [[Tijuca Forest]] and [[Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro)|Santa Teresa]]. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut [[carbon emissions]] and waste created during filming.<ref name=\"TorontoStar\" /> Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, was a popular environmental analogy, and Norton himself is an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced [[pinus echinata|yellow pine]] instead of [[Decorative plywood|lauan]] for the sets, and also used zero-or low-[[Volatile Organic Compounds|VOC]] paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> ''The Incredible Hulk'' became the first blockbuster film to receive the [[Environmental Media Association]]'s Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.<ref name=\"EMAGreenSeal\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n====Editing====\nSeventy minutes of footage, mostly dealing with the origin, were not included in the final cut.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Editor [[Kyle Cooper]], creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to ''Hulk'', had resulted in compressing these to the film's start.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the [[Arctic]] to commit [[suicide]]. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n\nNorton and Leterrier disputed with the producers over the final running time: they wanted it to be near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton \"made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product\".<ref name=\"NYTimesRuntime\" /> Norton dismissed this: \"Our healthy process [of collaboration], which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted to such a degree that it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them.\"<ref name=\"EWbtsDrama\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:MovieAbomination.jpg|thumb|Leterrier's finished redesign of the Abomination]]\nLeterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard he was aiming for.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effects company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> Many of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the climactic fight.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" /> Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of \"an [[\u00fcber]]-human\" like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones, creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> The character also shares Roth's tattoos.<ref name=\"RothMTV\" /> A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II#Match|example]] of [[Mike Tyson]] when he fought [[Evander Holyfield]]), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.<ref name=\"AbombEars\" />\n\nLeterrier had planned to use [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[animatronic]]s to complement the [[computer-generated imagery]] that was solely used in the previous film.<ref name=\"Animatronic\" /> The make-up artists who worked on ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation,<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky \"not [being] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [It's all about] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [them].\"<ref name=\"PennBlonsky\" /> Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films since ''[[Alien 3]]'') was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic.<ref name=\"Woodruff\" /> An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and [[dry ice]] for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|The Incredible Hulk (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nThe score for the film was composed by [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]], who was the [[arrangement|arranger]] for [[Massive Attack]], a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film ''[[Unleashed (2005 film)|Unleashed]]''. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not knowing if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'').<ref name=\"MusicEye\" /> At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.<ref name=\"MusicHidden\" /> The film's score borrows [[Joe Harnell]]'s theme \"The Lonely Man\" from the 1978 ''Incredible Hulk'' television series.<ref name=harnell>{{cite web |url= http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |title= The Incredible Hulk: Music From the Television Pilot Movies |website= joeharnell.com |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141229232212/http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |archivedate= December 29, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Louis-Leterrier-Incroyable-Hulk-2.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Louis Leterrier]] promoting the film in [[Paris]] in July 2008]]\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=\"We know the Hulk from 2003 didn't satisfy the fans, and we had to acknowledge that.

Norton attended the premiere, took part in a ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' sketch and would also promote the film in Japan.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> However, during the film's release he chose to do charity work in Africa.<ref name=\"NortonAfrica\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' premiered on June 8, 2008 at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in [[Universal City, California]]<ref name=\"Premiere\" /> and was released in theaters on June 13 in the United States,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> where it opened in 3,505 theaters.<ref name=\"BOMWeekends\" /> The film is part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseOne\" /> ''The Incredible Hulk'' was formatted and screened in [[IMAX]] for the first time on August 30, 2018, as part of Marvel Studios' 10 year anniversary IMAX festival.<ref name=\"IMAX10thAnniversaryFestival\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' was released by [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on October 21, 2008. It includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening.<ref name=\"DVDDetails\" /><ref name=\"BRDDetails\" /> The film was number one in sales when released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 21, 2008, in the United States (having been available in the United Kingdom since October 13). There are widescreen and fullscreen single-disc editions; a three-disc special edition; and a two-disc Blu-ray package. The first disc contains an audio commentary by Leterrier and Roth, while the second comes with special features and deleted scenes, and the third with a [[Digital Copy|digital copy]] of the film. The Blu-ray edition combines the content of the first two DVDs onto a single disc, while the second disc contains the digital copy.\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"BriefcaseSet\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"BriefcaseDelayed\" /> Universal released the film on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on April 10, 2018.<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $134.8 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $128.6 million from other territories, for a worldwide total of $263.4 million.<ref name=\"BOMIncredibleHulk\" /> The film, even though it barely passed its predecessor, and only equalled it if the smaller budget of the first film is taken into account, was still considered successful. Entertainment analyst David Davis told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', \"The first Hulk had such high expectations after the [[NBC Universal]] merger and was supposed to be critical favorite Ang Lee's breakout commercial blockbuster. Then with the new Hulk film, Marvel was able to underplay the importance of the success after the great success of ''Iron Man'' this summer. So the new one overdelivered, relative to its underpromise.\"<ref name=\"THRBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $55.4 million in its opening weekend, becoming the top film at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMWeekends\" /> Behind ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', it was the second-highest gross for a film released over the [[Father's Day]] weekend.<ref name=\"VarietyBO\" /> This surpassed industry expectations of a $45 million opening, following the disappointing response to the 2003 film. Universal believed [[word of mouth]] would contribute to the film breaking even eventually.<ref name=\"LATimesBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' also opened in 38 other countries, adding $31 million to the total opening. The film outgrossed the 2003 film in South Korea, while its openings in [[Mexico]] and Russia created records for Universal.<ref name=\"VarietyOverseasBO\" /> The film grossed 24 million [[Renminbi|yuan]] (roughly $3.4 million) in its Chinese opening on August 26, outgrossing the previous film's overall gross of 10 million yuan.<ref name=\"ChineseBO\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 67% approval rating with an average score of 6.17/10 based on 231 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' may not be quite the smashing success that fans of Marvel's raging behemoth might hope for, but it offers more than enough big green action to make up for its occasionally puny narrative.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Incredible Hulk (2008)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_incredible_hulk/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> A [[CinemaScore]] poll indicated the majority of viewers were male and graded the film an A-, and 82% of them had seen the 2003 film.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" />\n\nTodd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of a big screen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in ''The Incredible Hulk''.\" He emphasized \"it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm,\" and \"penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three\u2014actually six\u2014hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements.\"<ref name=\"McCarthyReview\" /> Rene Rodriguez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' applauded that the film \"does a lot of things [Ang] Lee's ''Hulk'' didn't: it's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity\".<ref name=\"RodriguezReview\" /> Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> [[Lou Lumenick]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said, \"What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [Ang] Lee took\".<ref name=\"LumenickReview\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] was not a fan of the film stating, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" />\n\nConversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" /> [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, \"'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean\".<ref name=\"ScottReview\" /> [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this \"Hulk\" sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The movie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Sterns\".<ref name=\"AnsenReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award association\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\"| {{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" | 2008\n| [[2008 Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Awards]]\n| Choice Summer Movie: Action\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| <ref name=\"TeenChoice\" />\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[National Movie Awards]]\n| Best Superhero\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"NationalMovieAwards\" />\n|-\n| Best Performance \u2013 Male\n| Edward Norton\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\"|[[2008 Scream Awards|Scream Awards]]\n| Best Fantasy Movie\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"6\"|<ref name=\"ScreamAwards\" /> \n|-\n| Best Fantasy Actor\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Edward Norton\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Superhero\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Remake\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Line\n| \"Hulk Smash\"\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Comic Book Movie\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 2009\n| [[35th Saturn Awards|Saturn Awards]]\n| [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"SaturnAwards\" />\n|}\n\n==Future==\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\nOf a potential sequel, Norton said, \"The whole thing was to envision it in multiple parts. We left a lot out on purpose. [''The Incredible Hulk'' is] definitely intended as chapter one\".<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> Leterrier made the film's final shot of Banner ambiguous; the thought being if there is a sequel, it would mean Banner finally masters control over his anger; if there is not a sequel, the shot indicates instead that he becomes a menace in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"MTVHulkVillainAvengers\" /> Leterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky, human once more, imprisoned and chained in a box.<ref name=\"DVDCommentary\" /> The character of Samuel Sterns, played by [[Tim Blake Nelson]], was introduced to set him up as a villain in a possible future film, where he would become the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /><ref name=\"NelsonMTV\" /> Aaron Sims, the lead designer on ''The Incredible Hulk'', also took time to work on concepts for the Leader.<ref name=\"LeaderDesigns\" /> Nelson is \"signed on\" to reprise the role.<ref name=\"MTVHulk2\" /> [[Ty Burrell]] wants to portray the superpowered Doc Samson faithfully to the comics.<ref name=\"MTVHulk2\" />\n\nLeterrier and Roth were originally contracted to return. Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed on,<ref name=\"NortonNotSigned\" /> but in October 2008, Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role.<ref name=\"MTVHurdSequel\" /> The film had outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated interest in a sequel,<ref name=\"VarietyOutperform\" /> though Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office return.<ref name=\"LeterrierDH\" /> Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would return, but after the crossover.<ref name=\"MTVFeigeHulkAgain\" /> Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series, the second and third film of which had a 12-year gap.<ref name=\"MTVHurdSequel\" /> Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel had signed him for three more films.<ref name=\"RothSequels\" /> Leterrier, after having previously said he did not want to direct a sequel,<ref name=\"LeterrierNo\" /> said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now amenable.<ref name=\"LeterrierYes\" />\n\n[[Mark Ruffalo]] (Leterrier's first choice before casting Norton<ref name=\"HuffPost\" />) began his role as Banner / Hulk in ''The Avengers'', after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton.<ref name=\"NortonReplaced\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineRuffalo\" /> In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name=\"NortonTHR\" /> In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to [[Collider (website)|Collider]] that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film.<ref name=\"April2012NoSequel\" /> In a Q&A session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions were underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"SequelPossible\" /> In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" and \"[[World War Hulk]]\" storylines, stated, \"everything [in terms of stories from the comics] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" /> In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said, \"We'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> films\".<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name=\"RuffaloApril2015\" /> and reiterated this in October 2015<ref name=\"RuffaloUSAToday\" /> and July 2017.<ref name=\"RuffaloJuly2017\" /> Marvel regained the film production rights for the character since February 2006,<ref name=\"HulkRightsFeb2006\" /> but Universal retained the distribution rights for ''The Incredible Hulk'' as well as the [[right of first refusal]] to pick up the distribution rights to each of any future Marvel-produced Hulk films.<ref name=\"HulkRights\" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name=\"THRJulyl2015\" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooDec2015\" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, \"We\u2019ve worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will \u2013 when it\u2019s all added up \u2013 will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" />\n\nMCU director [[James Gunn]] expressed interest in doing a film featuring both Hulk and Red Hulk, but the project never entered development due to conflicts with Universal.<ref name=\"GunnRedHulk\" /> At the 2019 D23 Expo, Marvel Studios confirmed that a series centered around [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters / She-Hulk]] is in development for exclusive release on [[Disney+]]. The miniseries will revolve around Bruce Banner's cousin, who gains superpowers after receiving a blood transfusion from him.<ref name=\"SheHulk\" /> By April 2020, Ruffalo was in talks to appear in ''[[She-Hulk (TV series)|She-Hulk]]''. He also hoped a solo Hulk film could still happen, and have it centered on the character's life between his other film appearances \"to fill in all the blanks about what happened to him\".<ref name=\"RuffaloApr2020Variety\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\">''Anatomy of a Hulk-out'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\">''Becoming the Hulk'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDCommentary\">[[Louis Leterrier]] and [[Tim Roth]]'s [[audio commentary]], 2008 DVD</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\">''Becoming the Abomination'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDMaking\">''The Making of Incredible'', 2008 DVD documentary</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BRDPicture\">''Picture in Picture'', 2008 [[Blu-ray Disc]] feature</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"May2006Empire\">{{Cite news |title=Make Ours Marvel |date=May 26, 2006 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |page=66}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"April2008Empire\">{{Cite news |title=News Etc. |date=April 2008 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |pages=15\u201316}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"June2008Empire\">{{Cite news |title=Fight Club <!-- yes, they were joking--> |last=de Semlyen |first=Nick |date=June 2008 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |pages=66\u201372}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AradMay2005\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.mania.com/arad-talks-bispiderman-2ib-bihulk-2ib_article_87918.html |title=Arad Talks ''Spider-Man 2'', ''Hulk 2'' |last=Worley |first=Rob |date=March 22, 2002 |access-date=June 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EdkuDWVf?url=http://www.mania.com/arad-talks-bispiderman-2ib-bihulk-2ib_article_87918.html |archive-date=February 23, 2013 |publisher=Mania.com |author-link=Rob Worley}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AngHulkSequel\">{{Cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2003-06-18-hulk_x.htm |title=Busting out: 'Hulk' stars aglow for the premiere |last=Keck |first=William |date=June 18, 2003 |work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=August 18, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Edkf9up3?url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2003-06-18-hulk_x.htm |archive-date=February 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AICNHulk2\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/22216 |title=Hulk 2-story BS!

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the second film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Louis Leterrier]] from a screenplay by [[Zak Penn]], and stars [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] alongside [[Liv Tyler]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Ty Burrell]], and [[William Hurt]]. In the film, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the [[Weapon Plus|\"Super-Soldier\" program]] through gamma radiation. Banner goes on the run from the military while attempting to cure himself of the Hulk.\n\nAfter the mixed reception to Universal's 2003 film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character though Universal retained distribution rights. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' for Marvel, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a script that would be much closer to the comics and the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|1978 television series of the same name]]. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay. His script positioned the film as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, distancing it from the 2003 film to give the new version its own identity. Norton was ultimately not credited for his writing. Filming took place from July to November 2007, primarily in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], with additional filming in [[New York City]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of [[motion capture]] and [[computer-generated imagery]] to complete the film.\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' premiered at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in [[Universal City, California]], on June 8, 2008, and was released in the United States on June 13, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It was widely considered to be an improvement over the 2003 film, with praise for its visuals, action sequences, and portrayal of the title character. The film grossed $264.8 million worldwide, making it the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Reception|lowest-grossing film]] of the MCU. Norton disputed with Marvel over the final edit of the film and chose not to promote it. He was replaced in the role of Banner by [[Mark Ruffalo]] for future MCU films starting with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAt Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] meets with Dr. [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment\u2014part of a [[World War II]]-era [[Weapon Plus|\"super soldier\" program]] that Ross hopes to recreate\u2014fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the [[Hulk]] for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, killing several people inside, and injuring the General and Betty, along with others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.\n\nFive years later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed.<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the former of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Banner works at a bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the internet, he anonymously collaborates with a colleague known only as \"Mr. Blue\". He is learning [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, which is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impairs his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson, causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves futile for Ross' forces and they retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is faltering, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]], who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.\n\nA recovered Blonsky joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. The experiment mutates Blonsky into [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. In his new monstrous form, Blonsky rampages through [[Harlem]].\n\nRealizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a battle throughout Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky by nearly strangling him to death with a chain, but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea, and leaves Blonsky for Ross and his forces to arrest. After having a peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees New York.\n\nA month later, Banner is in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]]. Instead of suppressing his transformation, he begins to transform in a controlled manner with a slight smirk. [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him that a team{{refn|group=N|Identified offscreen as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].}} is being put together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]: <!-- Do NOT put \"/ Hulk\" here -- unless there's a reliable source which states he voiced the character. --> <br />A [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] and [[biochemist]] at Culver University who, because of exposure to [[gamma radiation]], transforms into an enormous green humanoid monster when enraged or agitated. [[David Duchovny]] was a front-runner for the film before Norton's casting,<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> while Louis Leterrier's original choice for the role was [[Mark Ruffalo]], who would later play Banner in future [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films.<ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who played Banner in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|TV series]].<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project. Thus, Norton rewrote the script.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> \"Edward's script has given Bruce's story real gravitas,\" Leterrier said. \"Admittedly I'm not the most adult director, but just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]].\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" />\n** [[Lou Ferrigno]] provides vocal performance as the [[Hulk]]. During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> This marks the third time Ferrigno portrayed the Hulk, having also voiced the character in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|1996 animated series]]. Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word. Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally, and added \"Leave me alone!\" and \"Hulk smash!\" The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended.<ref name=\"IGNDirectorSpeaks\" /> Ferrigno also has a cameo in the film as a security guard who is bribed by Banner with a pizza.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" />\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as [[Betty Ross]]: <br />A [[cellular biology|cellular biologist]] and Bruce's former girlfriend, from whom he is separated as a result of his condition. Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script and was a fan of the TV show because of the \"humanity and what [Banner] is going through\".<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> She was called about the role while driving to her home and she accepted the part after a day without reading the script.<ref name=\"TylerTimes\" /> Tyler and Norton spent hours discussing Bruce and Betty's life before he became the Hulk.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> She said filming the part \"was very physical, which was fun\",<ref name=\"TylerUSAToday\" /> and compared her performance to \"a deer caught in the headlights\", because of Betty's shock at Bruce's unexpected return into her life.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Roth]] as [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky / Abomination]]: <br />A Russian-born officer in the United Kingdom's [[Royal Marines Commandos]] loaned to Ross who, lusting for the Hulk's power, is injected with various serums that transforms him into a near-skeletal humanoid monster more powerful than the Hulk himself. Roth said he took the part to please his sons, who are comic-book superhero fans. As a teenager, Roth was a fan of the 1970s TV series, and he also found Leterrier's ideas \"very dark and very interesting\". Roth started watching the 2003 film to prepare for the part, but stopped as he did not want to be caught up in the controversy over its quality, and to compare himself to it.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> It was Roth who suggested Blonsky be a soldier, whereas in the comics he was a [[KGB]] agent.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Leterrier was a fan of Roth's work, and felt \"it's great watching a normal [[Cockney]] boy become a superhero!\",<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> but Marvel and Norton were initially reluctant to cast him.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> Before he was cast in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]'', [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] was in discussions for the role.<ref name=\"RayStevenson\" /> Roth prepared for the part by learning to fire guns and break into rooms with two experts.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Roth found it tough shooting the chases, because to show Blonsky's aging he could not work out.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He especially found it difficult to run while pulled with a harness, which was used to show the injected Blonsky's 30\u201340 mile per hour running abilities.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> [[Cyril Raffaelli]] performed some of Roth's stunts.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Roth enjoyed the [[motion capture]], which reminded him of [[fringe theatre]], and he hired his trainer from ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' to aid him in portraying the monster's movement.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]: The cellular biologist who develops a possible antidote to Banner's condition. Towards the end of the film, Sterns is exposed to some substance that begins his transformation into [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as [[Doc Samson|Leonard Samson]]: <br />A psychiatrist who is in a relationship with Betty during Bruce's absence. Burrell had performed with Norton in the [[off Broadway]] play ''[[Burn This]]'' in 2003, and when Leterrier met him, he recognized Burrell as the \"jerk\" from the 2004 ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' remake,<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> which was how Samson was characterized in the script before Norton rewrote it.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]]: <br />Betty's father and a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General (United States)|general]] who has dedicated himself to capturing the Hulk. Leterrier cast Hurt because \"Ross is more physical, more explosive in this movie, and no actor goes from zero to 100 as well as William.\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> He compared Ross to [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]].<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The Hulk is Hurt's favorite superhero, and his son is also a big fan of the character. Hurt found production very different from the typical \"pure anxiety\" of a studio film, finding it more akin to an independent film.<ref name=\"HurtMTV\" /> He described Ross as \"humiliated by Hulk's conscience: he actually sees and recognizes that it's more developed than his own, even though he's a patriot and a warrior for his country. He's sacrificed [much] for that purpose, but at the expense at times of his humanity \u2013 which he occasionally recovers.\"<ref name=\"HurtCalgary\" /> In June 2015, when reflecting on how his reprisal in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' was different from this film, Hurt said, \"What I created [for ''The Incredible Hulk''] was a Ross who was right out of the graphic novel type of thing, where he was as much of a cartoon, in a way, as the monsters were. His ego was just as big and his problems were just as big. I really did do that consciously. I created a General Ross before which created a verisimilitude for the monsters, by making him a human monster. I worked really hard on the makeup and the exaggerated behavior and things like that and a controlled psychosis.\"<ref name=\"HurtLATimesJune2015\" /> [[Sam Elliott]] had expressed interest in reprising the role from the first ''Hulk'' film.<ref name=\"ElliottMTV\" />\n\n[[Robert Downey Jr.]] has an uncredited cameo as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] at the end of the film. Downey appeared as a favor to [[Marvel Studios]], which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production.<ref name=\"DowneyCameo\" /> Hulk co-creator [[Stan Lee]] cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. [[Michael K. Williams]] appears as a Harlem bystander, a role that was written for him by Norton, who is a fan of ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]''.<ref name=\"MichaelKWilliams\" /> [[Paul Soles]], who voiced Banner in the 1966 ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' animated series, appears as Stanley, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner. Additionally, the late Bill Bixby appears, in a scene on his TV comedy-drama ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'' on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. [[Rickson Gracie]] has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor; despite Gracie's [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] background, he is credited as an [[Aikido]] instructor. Brazilian actress [[D\u00e9bora Nascimento]] makes a cameo as Martina, Banner's colleague at a beverage factory. [[Peter Mensah]] plays a small role as General Joe Gellar, one of General Ross' military friends/associates.

Kerr and Nicholas Rose, respectively.<ref name=\"WilsonMcGee\" /> [[Martin Starr]] plays a college student, credited as \"Computer Nerd\". This character was [[retcon|retroactively]] revealed to be [[Roger Harrington]], Starr's role in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), as confirmed in May 2019 by Feige.<ref name=\"FeigeStarr\" />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:IncredibleHulkTVreference.jpg|thumb|The writers of the film were influenced by the TV series of the same name. Example shown above: Norton (top) sitting in a more modern version of the machine Bill Bixby (below) sat in.]]\nAfter the release of [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', screenwriter [[James Schamus]] was planning a sequel which would continue the story featuring the Grey Hulk. He was also considering the Leader and the Abomination as villains.<ref name=\"AngHulkSequel\" /> Marvel wanted the Abomination because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk, unlike General Ross.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> During the filming of ''Hulk'', producer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date.<ref name=\"AradMay2005\" /> On January 18, 2006 Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money for ''The Incredible Hulk''{{'}}s production budget, with Universal distributing,<ref name=\"AICNHulk2\" /> because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a sequel.<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> Marvel felt it would be better to deviate from Ang Lee's style to continue the franchise, arguing his film was like a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book, and their next film needed to be, in Kevin Feige's words, \"''really'' starting the Marvel Hulk franchise\". Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet what \"everyone expects to see from having read the comics and seen the TV series\".<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nLouis Leterrier, who enjoyed the TV series as a child and liked the first film,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /><ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> had expressed interest in directing the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' film adaptation. [[Jon Favreau]] had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier's primary inspiration was [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]]'s ''Hulk: Gray'' (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him,<ref name=\"IGNJuly2006\" /> while Feige added the film would explore \"that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize you had in yourself\".<ref name=\"FeigeWish\" /> Arad also said the film would be \"a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross\".<ref name=\"May2006Empire\" />\n\n[[Zak Penn]], who wrote a draft of the first film in 1996, said the film would follow up ''Hulk'', but stressed it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]]' [[Hulk#Bibliography|run on the comic]]. He compared his script to ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', which was a very different film from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', but still in the same continuity.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film ''[[The Grand (film)|The Grand]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand.<ref name=\"TimesSquare\" /> Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> Feige commented, \"we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made ''Incredible Hulk'' was to get Hulk into the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> canon.\"<ref name=\"FeigeIGNApr2014\" />\n\nShortly after the release of ''The Incredible Hulk'', Gale Anne Hurd commented on the uncertainty of its relationship with Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' film. \"We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel.\" Hurd said that \"requel\", a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"reboot\" and \"sequel\", was a \"perfect\" description for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderHurdInt\" /> Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: \"I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> \"Audiences know this story,\" he added, \"[so] deal with it artfully.\" He wanted to \"have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion\".<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> The new origin story references [[Ultimate Marvel]]'s take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers.<ref name=\"ScifiWeekly\" /> Norton removed [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and toned down [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s presence.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns,<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> which references Bruce Jones' story.<ref name=\"ColliderFeige\" /> Norton rewrote scenes every day.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> Ultimately, the [[Writers Guild of America]] decided to credit the script solely to Penn,<ref name=\"PennSoleCredit\" /> who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]] explained \"The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue.\"<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> Penn said in 2008, \"I wasn't happy with [Norton] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script.\"<ref name=\"PennUnhappy\" /> Before either Penn or Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" />\n\n===Filming===\nLeterrier had to direct four [[second unit|units]] with a broken foot.<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting primarily took place in [[Toronto]], because mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing [[Yonge Street]] for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Morningside Park (Toronto)|Morningside Park]]. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> There was also shooting in the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]].<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> A factory in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], which was due for demolition, was the interior of the Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a [[backlot]] in Hamilton.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Other Canadian locations included [[CFB Trenton]] and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in [[New York City]] and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name=\"FilmingCFB\" /> While there, the crew shot at [[Rocinha]], [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]], [[Tijuca Forest]] and [[Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro)|Santa Teresa]]. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut [[carbon emissions]] and waste created during filming.<ref name=\"TorontoStar\" /> Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, was a popular environmental analogy, and Norton himself is an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced [[pinus echinata|yellow pine]] instead of [[Decorative plywood|lauan]] for the sets, and also used zero-or low-[[Volatile Organic Compounds|VOC]] paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> ''The Incredible Hulk'' became the first blockbuster film to receive the [[Environmental Media Association]]'s Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.<ref name=\"EMAGreenSeal\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n====Editing====\nSeventy minutes of footage, mostly dealing with the origin, were not included in the final cut.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Editor [[Kyle Cooper]], creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to ''Hulk'', had resulted in compressing these to the film's start.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the [[Arctic]] to commit [[suicide]]. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n\nNorton and Leterrier disputed with the producers over the final running time: they wanted it to be near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton \"made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product\".<ref name=\"NYTimesRuntime\" /> Norton dismissed this: \"Our healthy process [of collaboration], which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted to such a degree that it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them.\"<ref name=\"EWbtsDrama\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:MovieAbomination.jpg|thumb|Leterrier's finished redesign of the Abomination]]\nLeterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard he was aiming for.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effects company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> Many of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the climactic fight.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" /> Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of \"an [[\u00fcber]]-human\" like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones, creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> The character also shares Roth's tattoos.<ref name=\"RothMTV\" /> A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II#Match|example]] of [[Mike Tyson]] when he fought [[Evander Holyfield]]), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.<ref name=\"AbombEars\" />\n\nLeterrier had planned to use [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[animatronic]]s to complement the [[computer-generated imagery]] that was solely used in the previous film.<ref name=\"Animatronic\" /> The make-up artists who worked on ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation,<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky \"not [being] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [It's all about] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [them].\"<ref name=\"PennBlonsky\" /> Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films since ''[[Alien 3]]'') was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic.<ref name=\"Woodruff\" /> An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and [[dry ice]] for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|The Incredible Hulk (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nThe score for the film was composed by [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]], who was the [[arrangement|arranger]] for [[Massive Attack]], a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film ''[[Unleashed (2005 film)|Unleashed]]''. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not knowing if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'').<ref name=\"MusicEye\" /> At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.<ref name=\"MusicHidden\" /> The film's score borrows [[Joe Harnell]]'s theme \"The Lonely Man\" from the 1978 ''Incredible Hulk'' television series.<ref name=harnell>{{cite web |url= http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |title= The Incredible Hulk: Music From the Television Pilot Movies |website= joeharnell.com |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141229232212/http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |archivedate= December 29, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Louis-Leterrier-Incroyable-Hulk-2.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Louis Leterrier]] promoting the film in [[Paris]] in July 2008]]\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=\"We know the Hulk from 2003 didn't satisfy the fans, and we had to acknowledge that.

It includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening.<ref name=\"DVDDetails\" /><ref name=\"BRDDetails\" /> The film was number one in sales when released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 21, 2008, in the United States (having been available in the United Kingdom since October 13). There are widescreen and fullscreen single-disc editions; a three-disc special edition; and a two-disc Blu-ray package. The first disc contains an audio commentary by Leterrier and Roth, while the second comes with special features and deleted scenes, and the third with a [[Digital Copy|digital copy]] of the film. The Blu-ray edition combines the content of the first two DVDs onto a single disc, while the second disc contains the digital copy.\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"BriefcaseSet\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"BriefcaseDelayed\" /> Universal released the film on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on April 10, 2018.<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $134.8 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $128.6 million from other territories, for a worldwide total of $263.4 million.<ref name=\"BOMIncredibleHulk\" /> The film, even though it barely passed its predecessor, and only equalled it if the smaller budget of the first film is taken into account, was still considered successful. Entertainment analyst David Davis told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', \"The first Hulk had such high expectations after the [[NBC Universal]] merger and was supposed to be critical favorite Ang Lee's breakout commercial blockbuster. Then with the new Hulk film, Marvel was able to underplay the importance of the success after the great success of ''Iron Man'' this summer. So the new one overdelivered, relative to its underpromise.\"<ref name=\"THRBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $55.4 million in its opening weekend, becoming the top film at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMWeekends\" /> Behind ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', it was the second-highest gross for a film released over the [[Father's Day]] weekend.<ref name=\"VarietyBO\" /> This surpassed industry expectations of a $45 million opening, following the disappointing response to the 2003 film. Universal believed [[word of mouth]] would contribute to the film breaking even eventually.<ref name=\"LATimesBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' also opened in 38 other countries, adding $31 million to the total opening.

The website's consensus reads, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' may not be quite the smashing success that fans of Marvel's raging behemoth might hope for, but it offers more than enough big green action to make up for its occasionally puny narrative.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Incredible Hulk (2008)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_incredible_hulk/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> A [[CinemaScore]] poll indicated the majority of viewers were male and graded the film an A-, and 82% of them had seen the 2003 film.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" />\n\nTodd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of a big screen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in ''The Incredible Hulk''.\" He emphasized \"it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm,\" and \"penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three\u2014actually six\u2014hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements.\"<ref name=\"McCarthyReview\" /> Rene Rodriguez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' applauded that the film \"does a lot of things [Ang] Lee's ''Hulk'' didn't: it's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity\".<ref name=\"RodriguezReview\" /> Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> [[Lou Lumenick]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said, \"What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [Ang] Lee took\".<ref name=\"LumenickReview\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] was not a fan of the film stating, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" />\n\nConversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" /> [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, \"'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean\".<ref name=\"ScottReview\" /> [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this \"Hulk\" sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ...

[''The Incredible Hulk'' is] definitely intended as chapter one\".<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> Leterrier made the film's final shot of Banner ambiguous; the thought being if there is a sequel, it would mean Banner finally masters control over his anger; if there is not a sequel, the shot indicates instead that he becomes a menace in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"MTVHulkVillainAvengers\" /> Leterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky, human once more, imprisoned and chained in a box.<ref name=\"DVDCommentary\" /> The character of Samuel Sterns, played by [[Tim Blake Nelson]], was introduced to set him up as a villain in a possible future film, where he would become the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /><ref name=\"NelsonMTV\" /> Aaron Sims, the lead designer on ''The Incredible Hulk'', also took time to work on concepts for the Leader.<ref name=\"LeaderDesigns\" /> Nelson is \"signed on\" to reprise the role.<ref name=\"MTVHulk2\" /> [[Ty Burrell]] wants to portray the superpowered Doc Samson faithfully to the comics.<ref name=\"MTVHulk2\" />\n\nLeterrier and Roth were originally contracted to return. Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed on,<ref name=\"NortonNotSigned\" /> but in October 2008, Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role.<ref name=\"MTVHurdSequel\" /> The film had outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated interest in a sequel,<ref name=\"VarietyOutperform\" /> though Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office return.<ref name=\"LeterrierDH\" /> Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would return, but after the crossover.<ref name=\"MTVFeigeHulkAgain\" /> Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series, the second and third film of which had a 12-year gap.<ref name=\"MTVHurdSequel\" /> Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel had signed him for three more films.<ref name=\"RothSequels\" /> Leterrier, after having previously said he did not want to direct a sequel,<ref name=\"LeterrierNo\" /> said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now amenable.<ref name=\"LeterrierYes\" />\n\n[[Mark Ruffalo]] (Leterrier's first choice before casting Norton<ref name=\"HuffPost\" />) began his role as Banner / Hulk in ''The Avengers'', after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton.<ref name=\"NortonReplaced\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineRuffalo\" /> In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name=\"NortonTHR\" /> In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to [[Collider (website)|Collider]] that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film.<ref name=\"April2012NoSequel\" /> In a Q&A session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions were underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"SequelPossible\" /> In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" and \"[[World War Hulk]]\" storylines, stated, \"everything [in terms of stories from the comics] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" /> In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said, \"We'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> films\".<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name=\"RuffaloApril2015\" /> and reiterated this in October 2015<ref name=\"RuffaloUSAToday\" /> and July 2017.<ref name=\"RuffaloJuly2017\" /> Marvel regained the film production rights for the character since February 2006,<ref name=\"HulkRightsFeb2006\" /> but Universal retained the distribution rights for ''The Incredible Hulk'' as well as the [[right of first refusal]] to pick up the distribution rights to each of any future Marvel-produced Hulk films.<ref name=\"HulkRights\" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name=\"THRJulyl2015\" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooDec2015\" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, \"We\u2019ve worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will \u2013 when it\u2019s all added up \u2013 will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" />\n\nMCU director [[James Gunn]] expressed interest in doing a film featuring both Hulk and Red Hulk, but the project never entered development due to conflicts with Universal.<ref name=\"GunnRedHulk\" /> At the 2019 D23 Expo, Marvel Studios confirmed that a series centered around [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters / She-Hulk]] is in development for exclusive release on [[Disney+]]. The miniseries will revolve around Bruce Banner's cousin, who gains superpowers after receiving a blood transfusion from him.<ref name=\"SheHulk\" /> By April 2020, Ruffalo was in talks to appear in ''[[She-Hulk (TV series)|She-Hulk]]''. He also hoped a solo Hulk film could still happen, and have it centered on the character's life between his other film appearances \"to fill in all the blanks about what happened to him\".<ref name=\"RuffaloApr2020Variety\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\">''Anatomy of a Hulk-out'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\">''Becoming the Hulk'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDCommentary\">[[Louis Leterrier]] and [[Tim Roth]]'s [[audio commentary]], 2008 DVD</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\">''Becoming the Abomination'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDMaking\">''The Making of Incredible'', 2008 DVD documentary</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BRDPicture\">''Picture in Picture'', 2008 [[Blu-ray Disc]] feature</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"May2006Empire\">{{Cite news |title=Make Ours Marvel |date=May 26, 2006 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |page=66}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"April2008Empire\">{{Cite news |title=News Etc. |date=April 2008 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |pages=15\u201316}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"June2008Empire\">{{Cite news |title=Fight Club <!-- yes, they were joking--> |last=de Semlyen |first=Nick |date=June 2008 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |pages=66\u201372}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AradMay2005\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.mania.com/arad-talks-bispiderman-2ib-bihulk-2ib_article_87918.html |title=Arad Talks ''Spider-Man 2'', ''Hulk 2'' |last=Worley |first=Rob |date=March 22, 2002 |access-date=June 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EdkuDWVf?url=http://www.mania.com/arad-talks-bispiderman-2ib-bihulk-2ib_article_87918.html |archive-date=February 23, 2013 |publisher=Mania.com |author-link=Rob Worley}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AngHulkSequel\">{{Cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2003-06-18-hulk_x.htm |title=Busting out: 'Hulk' stars aglow for the premiere |last=Keck |first=William |date=June 18, 2003 |work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=August 18, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Edkf9up3?url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2003-06-18-hulk_x.htm |archive-date=February 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AICNHulk2\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/22216 |title=Hulk 2-story BS!

The VSO's current music director is [[JoAnn Falletta]], since 1991.  The VSO's current president and chief executive officer is Karen Philion.\n\nThe VSO performs concerts in various venues in Virginia, including:\n* [[Chrysler Hall]], [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]\n* The [[Sandler Center for the Performing Arts]], Virginia Beach\n*[[Ferguson Center for the Arts]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]]\n* [[Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall]] at the [[College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]\n* [[Regent University]] in [[Virginia Beach]]\nThe VSO also works closely with [[Virginia Opera]] and the [[Virginia Arts Festival]].\n\nThe orchestra was founded in 1920 as the Norfolk Civic Symphony Orchestra, and gave its first concert on 21 April 1921, conducted by Walter Edward Howe, who was the first music director of the orchestra.  At the time, the Norfolk Civic Symphony Orchestra was the only American orchestra between [[Baltimore]] and [[Atlanta]].\n\nIn 1949, during the music directorship of Edgar Schenkman, the Norfolk Civic Symphony Orchestra merged with the Civic Chorus to form the Norfolk Symphony and Choral Association.  During the subsequent music directorship of Russell Stanger, the orchestra hired its first African-American musician, and took up residency in Chrysler Hall, which had opened in 1972.  During the 1970s, the orchestra began collaboration with the Virginia Opera.  During the US economic crisis and recession of the 1970s, the Virginia Symphony assumed its present form in 1979 with the merger of the Norfolk Symphony, Peninsula Symphony Orchestra, and the Virginia Beach Pops Symphony.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E3DD123FF934A25757C0A961958260 | title= A Consolidated Orchestra That's Thriving | work=New York Times | author=Allan Kozinn | date=17 April 1997 | accessdate=2008-09-28}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1991, [[JoAnn Falletta]] was appointed the orchestra's eleventh music director, the first female conductor to be named music director of the VSO.

At the time, the Norfolk Civic Symphony Orchestra was the only American orchestra between [[Baltimore]] and [[Atlanta]].\n\nIn 1949, during the music directorship of Edgar Schenkman, the Norfolk Civic Symphony Orchestra merged with the Civic Chorus to form the Norfolk Symphony and Choral Association.  During the subsequent music directorship of Russell Stanger, the orchestra hired its first African-American musician, and took up residency in Chrysler Hall, which had opened in 1972.  During the 1970s, the orchestra began collaboration with the Virginia Opera.  During the US economic crisis and recession of the 1970s, the Virginia Symphony assumed its present form in 1979 with the merger of the Norfolk Symphony, Peninsula Symphony Orchestra, and the Virginia Beach Pops Symphony.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E3DD123FF934A25757C0A961958260 | title= A Consolidated Orchestra That's Thriving | work=New York Times | author=Allan Kozinn | date=17 April 1997 | accessdate=2008-09-28}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1991, [[JoAnn Falletta]] was appointed the orchestra's eleventh music director, the first female conductor to be named music director of the VSO.

Uniquely among the four mutually recognised [[Royal College of Surgeons|royal surgical colleges]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it also incorporates a [[medical school]], which is now Ireland's largest with over 3,000 students from 60 countries. Since 2019 the body has had full [[university]] status, making it the first [[private university]] in Ireland.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/royal-college-of-surgeons-becomes-state-s-ninth-university-1.4111146?mode=amp</ref>\n\nRCSI's main campus is situated on [[St. Stephen's Green]] in [[Dublin]], having received its [[royal charter]] in 1784. At present, it incorporates schools of [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[physiotherapy]] and [[nursing]], and thus provides both undergraduate and postgraduate levels of education and research activities in a number of healthcare fields.\n\n==History==\n===Guild===\nSince medieval times, the practice of surgery was licensed by the Barber-Surgeons' [[Guild]], also known at the time as the Guild of St [[Mary Magdalene]]. The guild chapel was in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]]. Guild membership at that time was obtained by a 3-year [[apprenticeship]] followed by 2 years as a master. In fact the College of Surgeons maintained a mandatory period of apprenticeship to a qualified surgeon until 1828.\n\nIn 1446, the Guild of St Mary Magdelene (of Barbers) was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by royal decree of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], becoming the first medical [[Livery Company|corporation]] in Britain or Ireland.\n\n===Towards a College of Surgeons===\n[[File:DUBLIN(1837) p049 THE COLLEGE OF SURGEONS.jpg|thumb|\"The College of Surgeons, Dublin\". 1837.<ref>''Dublin delineated in twenty-six views, etc''. Dublin: G. Tyrrell, 1937. p. 49.</ref>]]\nIn 1765 [[Sylvester O'Halloran]], a surgeon from [[Limerick]], proposed a College of Surgeons along the lines of the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been regulating French surgeons since it had been created by Royal Charter by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1255, to train and regulate surgeons.<ref>The ''Proposals for the Advancement of Surgery in Ireland''.</ref> The Dublin Society of Surgeons was founded in 1780 at the Elephant public house on Essex street (now Parliament street). [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] did not teach surgery as a subject until 1851, so Ireland was entirely without a school focused on surgery.\n\nTo have a separate organisation focused on providing standardised surgical education became one of the goals of the society and they lobbied for a Royal Charter, in 1781 presenting the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]] a petition to be incorporated separately from the [[barbers]].  The awaited [[charter]] was granted by [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] on 11 February 1784. The governing body, including the first president [[Samuel Croker-King]] and [[William Dease]], first professor of surgery, met in the boardroom of the [[Rotunda Hospital]] for the first time on 2 March. Importantly, admission or employment was not discriminated against on sectarian grounds. Two of its chief founders, Sylvester O'Halloran and William Dease, as well as eleven out of its first 57 presidents, were Catholics. The college also recognised the medical qualifications given by the Catholic university from 1856, which gave legitimacy to their diplomas.  The first candidate for examination was John Birch, in August 1784.\n\n===York Street===\nThe current location, at the corner of York Street, was acquired in September 1805, with additional land at Glover's Alley bought in 1809. It was previously an abandoned [[Quaker]] [[Friends Burial Ground, Dublin|burial ground]]. The Duke of Bedford laid the first stone of the new building on St. Patrick's Day, 1806 and building reached completion in March 1810.\n\nA supplemental charter was granted by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1844, dividing medical graduates into [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiates]] and Fellows. Initially, physicians were trained alongside surgeons.  In 1886 these two disciplines were merged, and the medical school began operation. As a result of this historical legacy, graduates of medicine still receive Licentiate diplomas from the two Royal Colleges as well as now being awarded MB ([[Bachelor of Medicine]]) BCh ([[Bachelor of Surgery]]) and BAO ([[Obstetrics|Bachelor of the Art of Obstetrics]]) degrees by the [[National University of Ireland]].\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[1916 Rising]], the main college building on [[St Stephen's Green]] was occupied by [[Irish Citizen Army]] forces, led by Commandant [[Michael Mallin]] and [[Constance Markievicz|Countess Markievicz]]. After surrendering, both were tried and sentenced to death. Mallin was executed while Markievicz's sentence was commuted due to her gender.\n\nRCSI was the first [[medical school|medical institution of learning]] to offer a [[Graduate Medical Program (GMP)|4-year graduate entry programme]] for medicine in Ireland.  Now defunct subjects taught include: Logic (1852\u20131862), Military Surgery (1851\u20131860), [[Botany]] (1792\u20131889) and Hygiene or Political Medicine (1841\u20131921, then united with chair of Medical Jurisprudence).\n\n[[File:R.C.S.I Disease Research Centre.jpg|thumb|The RCSI Disease and Research centre in Beaumont Hospital|right]]\nSince the 1980s [[Beaumont Hospital, Dublin]] has been the principal centre for medical training. Other affiliated hospitals include teaching hospitals such as [[Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown|Connolly Hospital]], [[Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital]], and [[St. Joseph's Hospital, Dublin]], and there is now a group within the HSE hospital management structure, the [[RCSI Hospitals]] group.\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2010, [[Eilis McGovern|Prof. Eilis McGovern]] became President of RCSI and thereby the first female President of any [[Royal College of Surgeons|surgical Royal College]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/7800861/Irish-doctor-becomes-first-female-president-of-Royal-College-of-Surgeons-in-Ireland.html|title=Irish doctor becomes first female president of Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|date=3 June 2010|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/medicine/ourcommunity/ouralumni/alumniprofilesinterviews/profeilismcgovern/|title=Prof Eilis McGovern|website=UCD School of Medicine & Medical Science}}</ref>\n\n===Motto===\nThe RCSI [[motto]], \"Consilio Manuque\" (''Scholarship and Dexterity''), was adopted from the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been afforded the motto by [[Louis XIV]].

It describes its values as innovation, excellence, independence, academic freedom, diversity, tolerance and community. It champions a patient-centric approach to all its activities and endeavours. \n\nRCSI now offers undergraduate degrees in Medicine, Pharmacy and Physiotherapy and is the largest Irish medical school. Its primary purpose is the education and training of healthcare professionals and health sciences research. More than 3,800 students representing 60 nations are currently enrolled in its Medicine (1,800), Pharmacy (200) and Physiotherapy (100) programmes. There are 17,000 RCSI alumni working as medical doctors or in allied disciplines around the world.\n\n==Student life==\nStudents at RCSI are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities that promote service in the community and cultural awareness.  A complete list of current student societies and clubs can be found on the RCSI website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcsi.ie/clubs_societies|title=Clubs & Societies|work=rcsi.ie}}</ref>\n\nThe Students' Union (SU) is an annually elected body, consisting of 8 officers. The SU is the college's bridge between faculty and the student body and is invited to most meetings, ensuring that student voices are heard on a variety of topics. The SU works closely with the Student Council, which consists of representatives from all classes at RCSI.\n\nThe Biological Society (BioSoc) is the official student society of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and claims to be the oldest student medical society in the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==International aspects and operations==\n[[File:Flag of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.svg|thumb|Flag of RCSI]]\nAs a leading international medical institution, RCSI is active in all medically related sectors of education around the globe.

The programme hosts up to 100 students per year on its 5-year undergraduate medical programme, the first cohort graduated in 2016.\n\n[[RCSI-Bahrain]] is a fully owned constituent university of RCSI and already has nearly 450 registered students. The first cohort commenced medical studies in October 2004 and graduates are entitled to a Degree of Bachelor of Medicine, NUI, Bachelor of Surgery, Bachelor of Obstetrics MB, BCh, BAO (NUI, RCSI) degree.  In 2006 the Medical University of Bahrain established a new School of [[Nursing]] which took its first cohort of students in September 2006. Since 2009 students can also obtain the degrees conferred upon RCSI graduates from the [[National University of Ireland]].\n\nFor students at the home institution of RCSI, options may be taken abroad as a result of collaborative agreements with other medical schools around the world. In 2007, these medical schools included [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University]], [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine|University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Tufts University School of Medicine|Tufts University]]. There are also informal agreements with other institutions such as the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Mayo Clinic]].\n\nMore than 60 countries from each continent are represented in the RCSI student body.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Abraham Colles]] (1773 - 1843) \u2013 Professor of Anatomy; first person to characterise the injury that was later on known as [[Colles' fracture]]\n*[[William Wilde|Sir William Wilde]] (1815 - 1876) \u2013 Surgeon, Author and father of [[Oscar Wilde]]\n*[[William Stokes (surgeon)|Sir William Stokes]] (1838 - 1900) \u2013 knighted for his contribution in the field of surgery\n*[[Emily Winifred Dickson]] (1866 \u2013 1944) was the first woman Fellow of any Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland or Great Britain\n*[[Mary Strangman]] (1872 \u2013 1943) was the second woman Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the first woman elected to local government in Waterford.\n*[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Surgeon Captain]] [[Thomas Crean]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (1873 - 1923).

In fact the College of Surgeons maintained a mandatory period of apprenticeship to a qualified surgeon until 1828.\n\nIn 1446, the Guild of St Mary Magdelene (of Barbers) was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by royal decree of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], becoming the first medical [[Livery Company|corporation]] in Britain or Ireland.\n\n===Towards a College of Surgeons===\n[[File:DUBLIN(1837) p049 THE COLLEGE OF SURGEONS.jpg|thumb|\"The College of Surgeons, Dublin\". 1837.<ref>''Dublin delineated in twenty-six views, etc''. Dublin: G. Tyrrell, 1937. p. 49.</ref>]]\nIn 1765 [[Sylvester O'Halloran]], a surgeon from [[Limerick]], proposed a College of Surgeons along the lines of the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been regulating French surgeons since it had been created by Royal Charter by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1255, to train and regulate surgeons.<ref>The ''Proposals for the Advancement of Surgery in Ireland''.</ref> The Dublin Society of Surgeons was founded in 1780 at the Elephant public house on Essex street (now Parliament street). [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] did not teach surgery as a subject until 1851, so Ireland was entirely without a school focused on surgery.\n\nTo have a separate organisation focused on providing standardised surgical education became one of the goals of the society and they lobbied for a Royal Charter, in 1781 presenting the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]] a petition to be incorporated separately from the [[barbers]].  The awaited [[charter]] was granted by [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] on 11 February 1784. The governing body, including the first president [[Samuel Croker-King]] and [[William Dease]], first professor of surgery, met in the boardroom of the [[Rotunda Hospital]] for the first time on 2 March. Importantly, admission or employment was not discriminated against on sectarian grounds. Two of its chief founders, Sylvester O'Halloran and William Dease, as well as eleven out of its first 57 presidents, were Catholics. The college also recognised the medical qualifications given by the Catholic university from 1856, which gave legitimacy to their diplomas.  The first candidate for examination was John Birch, in August 1784.\n\n===York Street===\nThe current location, at the corner of York Street, was acquired in September 1805, with additional land at Glover's Alley bought in 1809. It was previously an abandoned [[Quaker]] [[Friends Burial Ground, Dublin|burial ground]]. The Duke of Bedford laid the first stone of the new building on St. Patrick's Day, 1806 and building reached completion in March 1810.\n\nA supplemental charter was granted by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1844, dividing medical graduates into [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiates]] and Fellows. Initially, physicians were trained alongside surgeons.  In 1886 these two disciplines were merged, and the medical school began operation. As a result of this historical legacy, graduates of medicine still receive Licentiate diplomas from the two Royal Colleges as well as now being awarded MB ([[Bachelor of Medicine]]) BCh ([[Bachelor of Surgery]]) and BAO ([[Obstetrics|Bachelor of the Art of Obstetrics]]) degrees by the [[National University of Ireland]].\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[1916 Rising]], the main college building on [[St Stephen's Green]] was occupied by [[Irish Citizen Army]] forces, led by Commandant [[Michael Mallin]] and [[Constance Markievicz|Countess Markievicz]]. After surrendering, both were tried and sentenced to death. Mallin was executed while Markievicz's sentence was commuted due to her gender.\n\nRCSI was the first [[medical school|medical institution of learning]] to offer a [[Graduate Medical Program (GMP)|4-year graduate entry programme]] for medicine in Ireland.  Now defunct subjects taught include: Logic (1852\u20131862), Military Surgery (1851\u20131860), [[Botany]] (1792\u20131889) and Hygiene or Political Medicine (1841\u20131921, then united with chair of Medical Jurisprudence).\n\n[[File:R.C.S.I Disease Research Centre.jpg|thumb|The RCSI Disease and Research centre in Beaumont Hospital|right]]\nSince the 1980s [[Beaumont Hospital, Dublin]] has been the principal centre for medical training. Other affiliated hospitals include teaching hospitals such as [[Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown|Connolly Hospital]], [[Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital]], and [[St. Joseph's Hospital, Dublin]], and there is now a group within the HSE hospital management structure, the [[RCSI Hospitals]] group.\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2010, [[Eilis McGovern|Prof. Eilis McGovern]] became President of RCSI and thereby the first female President of any [[Royal College of Surgeons|surgical Royal College]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/7800861/Irish-doctor-becomes-first-female-president-of-Royal-College-of-Surgeons-in-Ireland.html|title=Irish doctor becomes first female president of Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|date=3 June 2010|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/medicine/ourcommunity/ouralumni/alumniprofilesinterviews/profeilismcgovern/|title=Prof Eilis McGovern|website=UCD School of Medicine & Medical Science}}</ref>\n\n===Motto===\nThe RCSI [[motto]], \"Consilio Manuque\" (''Scholarship and Dexterity''), was adopted from the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been afforded the motto by [[Louis XIV]].

It describes its values as innovation, excellence, independence, academic freedom, diversity, tolerance and community. It champions a patient-centric approach to all its activities and endeavours. \n\nRCSI now offers undergraduate degrees in Medicine, Pharmacy and Physiotherapy and is the largest Irish medical school. Its primary purpose is the education and training of healthcare professionals and health sciences research. More than 3,800 students representing 60 nations are currently enrolled in its Medicine (1,800), Pharmacy (200) and Physiotherapy (100) programmes. There are 17,000 RCSI alumni working as medical doctors or in allied disciplines around the world.\n\n==Student life==\nStudents at RCSI are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities that promote service in the community and cultural awareness. 80% of the student population is from outside the [[European Union]], with a significant portion coming from North America, the Middle East and Asia. A complete list of current student societies and clubs can be found on the RCSI website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcsi.ie/clubs_societies|title=Clubs & Societies|work=rcsi.ie}}</ref>\n\nThe Students' Union (SU) is an annually elected body, consisting of 8 officers. The SU is the college's bridge between faculty and the student body and is invited to most meetings, ensuring that student voices are heard on a variety of topics. The SU works closely with the Student Council, which consists of representatives from all classes at RCSI.\n\nThe Biological Society (BioSoc) is the official student society of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and claims to be the oldest student medical society in the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==International aspects and operations==\n[[File:Flag of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.svg|thumb|Flag of RCSI]]\nAs a leading international medical institution, RCSI is active in all medically related sectors of education around the globe.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. It was directed by [[Jon Favreau]] from a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]], and [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]], and stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Terrence Howard]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Shaun Toub]], and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. In the film, following his escape captivity from a terrorist group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|mechanized suit of armor]] and becomes the superhero Iron Man.\n\nA film featuring the character was in development at [[Universal Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[New Line Cinema]] at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by [[Stan Winston]]'s company, were mixed with [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the title character.\n\n''Iron Man'' premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million on its $140 million budget, becoming the [[2008 in film|eighth-highest grossing film of 2008]]. The film was praised by critics for its acting (particularly Downey's), screenplay, direction, visual effects, and action sequences. It was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' in 2010 and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], who has inherited the defense contractor [[Stark Industries]] from his father [[Howard Stark]], is in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]], a fellow captive doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototype [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|suit of powered armor]] to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit fully charges. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest. Personal assistant [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]] places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.\n\nAt a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter [[Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is attacked by two fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been [[arms trafficking|trafficking arms]] to criminals worldwide and has staged a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent [[Phil Coulson]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an [[intelligence agency]], to inform him of Stane's activities.\n\nStane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being \"Iron Man.\"\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]]<!-- NOT Ultimate Nick Fury; the similarity between Ultimate and Movie Fury is covered elsewhere in the article --> visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not \"the only superhero in the world\", and explaining that he wants to discuss the \"[[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] Initiative\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|width=170\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg\n|caption1=Downey promoting the film at the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]\n|image2=Terrence Howard, USAF.jpg\n|caption2=Howard preparing for the role by riding an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] flight simulator\n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />An [[industrialist]], genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of [[Stark Industries]] and chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]].

Bridges [[google (verb)|googled]] the [[Book of Obadiah]], and was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that book of the Bible, something that Stane represents.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Many of Stane's scenes were cut to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridges's performance allowed the application of \"less is more\" when editing the film.<ref name=\"BridgesCut\" />\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as [[Ho Yinsen]]: Stark's fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest \"to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him\" and helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit.<ref name=\"Toub\" /><ref name=\"Yinsen\" />\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts]]: <br />Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest.

When the film did have a script, even the requests for rewrites met with many refusals.<ref name=\"MCUDocumentary\" /> In order to build the general public's awareness of Iron Man and elevate him to the same level of popularity as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Hulk]], Marvel conducted [[focus group]]s, trying to find a way to remove the general perception that the character is a robot. The information Marvel received from the focus groups was used to  formulate an awareness-building plan, which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release.

The success of ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' without being star-driven pieces reassures [executives] that the film does have an upside commercially.\"<ref name=\"DowneyUnknown\" /> However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role.<ref name=\"DowneyCast\" /> Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining \"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark.\"<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, \"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.\"<ref name=\"FavreauFight\" /> Downey earned $500,000 for the role.<ref name=\"DowneyPay\" /> While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by [[Elon Musk]]. Downey said, \"Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\"<ref name=\"Musk\" />\n\nAdditional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: [[Terrence Howard]] was announced in the role of Stark's best friend [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]] in October 2006;<ref name=\"HowardCast\" /> Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as love interest Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts in January 2007;<ref name=\"PaltrowCast\" /> and Jeff Bridges was cast in an undisclosed role in February.<ref name=\"BridgesCast\" /> [[Don Cheadle]] had also been approached for the role of Rhodes, and would eventually replace Howard in the role starting with the sequel, ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref name=\"CheadleRhodes\" /> Choosing a character to be the villain of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> He felt only in a sequel, with an altered tone, would the fantasy of the Mandarin's rings be appropriate.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> The decision to push him into the background is comparable to [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref name=\"sauron\" /> or [[Palpatine]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in that role,<ref name=\"depth\" /> with Stane originally intended to become a villain in the sequel.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The [[Crimson Dynamo]] was also a villain in early drafts of the script.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Favreau felt it was important to include intentional [[in-joke|inside references]] for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the [[call sign]]s of \"Whiplash 1\" and \"Whiplash 2\", a reference to the comic book villain [[Blacklash|Whiplash]], and including [[Captain America's shield]] in Stark's workshop.<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" />\n\n[[File:Ironmonger 2008film.jpg|thumb|left|A scale model of the \"Iron Monger\" suit]]\nFavreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Stan Winston]], a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on ''[[Zathura (film)|Zathura]]'', built metal and rubber versions of the armor.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single {{convert|90|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to have only its top half worn at times.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Stan Winston Studios built a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on|disp=flip}}, {{convert|800|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} animatronic version of \"Iron Monger\" (Obadiah Stane),<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a [[gimbal]] to simulate walking.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A [[scale model]] was used for the shots of it being built.<ref name=\"depth\" /> The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.<ref name=\"depth\" /> Iron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.<ref name=\"GranovSaunders\" /> Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.<ref name=\"sauron\" /> Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"<ref name=\"WarMachine\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"PlayaVista\" /> [[Howard Hughes]] was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]] was built.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Favreau rejected the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.<ref name=\"trilogy\" />\n\nFilming began on March 12, 2007,<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /> with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"FirstWeeks\" /> The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a {{convert|150|to(-)|200|yd|adj=on}} long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Production designer]] [[J. Michael Riva]] saw footage of a [[Taliban]] fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at [[Olancha]] Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|mph|adj=on}} winds.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] began in mid-April,<ref name=\"EdwardsBegins\" /> and ended on May 2.<ref name=\"EdwardsEnds\" /> Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of [[Point Dume]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]],<ref name=\"depth\" /> while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more \"[[wikt:grease monkey|grease monkey]]\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, \"I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs\". He hired \"people who are good at creating action\", so \"the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre\".<ref name=\"pump\" />\n\nThere was much [[improvization]] in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvization would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time.<ref name=\"depth\" /> It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a [[news conference]] on the floor,<ref name=\"pump\" /> and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Bridges described this approach as \"a $200&nbsp;million student film\", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded.<ref name=\"BridgesImprovisation\" /> The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.<ref name=\"CameoRemoved\" /> An alternate version of the Nick Fury post-credits scene was filmed in which he specifically said \"As if gamma accidents, radioactive bugs and assorted [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] weren't enough\" referencing Hulk, Spider-Man and the [[X-Men]] but this was cut due to legal problems with [[Sony Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] who at the time had full ownership of the characters until their reacquisition much later in the mid to late 2010s.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/09/14/deleted-iron-man-post-credits-scene-kevin-feige/ |title=Deleted Iron Man post-credits scene references Spider-Man, X-Men |last=Bucksbaum |first=Sydney |date=September 14, 2019 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nFavreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious.<ref name=\"FavreauEffectsConcerns\" /> He hired [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' and ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''. [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]] and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]] did additional work,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor.<ref name=\"Embassy\" /> To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a [[motion capture]] suit,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and skydivers were filmed in a vertical [[wind tunnel]] to study the physics of flying.<ref name=\"WindTunnel\" /> For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly.

The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes\".<ref name=\"Franklin\" />\n\nAmong major metropolitan weeklies, [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine called the film \"a shapely piece of mythmaking ... Favreau doesn't go in for stylized comic-book frames, at least in the first half. He gets real with it \u2013 you'd think you were watching a military thriller\",<ref name=\"Edelstein\" /> while conversely, [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' gave a negative review, claiming \"a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show ... [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's [[Girl Friday (idiom)|girl Friday]], who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted\".<ref name=\"Denby\" /> [[IGN]]'s Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as \"the best thing\" in a film that \"functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles\".<ref name=\"Gilchrist\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"|

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. It was directed by [[Jon Favreau]] from a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]], and [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]], and stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Terrence Howard]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Shaun Toub]], and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. In the film, following his escape captivity from a terrorist group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|mechanized suit of armor]] and becomes the superhero Iron Man.\n\nA film featuring the character was in development at [[Universal Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[New Line Cinema]] at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by [[Stan Winston]]'s company, were mixed with [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the title character.\n\n''Iron Man'' premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million on its $140 million budget, becoming the [[2008 in film|eighth-highest grossing film of 2008]]. The film was praised by critics for its acting (particularly Downey's), screenplay, direction, visual effects, and action sequences. It was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' in 2010 and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], who has inherited the defense contractor [[Stark Industries]] from his father [[Howard Stark]], is in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]], a fellow captive doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototype [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|suit of powered armor]] to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit fully charges. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest. Personal assistant [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]] places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.\n\nAt a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter [[Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is attacked by two fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been [[arms trafficking|trafficking arms]] to criminals worldwide and has staged a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent [[Phil Coulson]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an [[intelligence agency]], to inform him of Stane's activities.\n\nStane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being \"Iron Man.\"\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]]<!-- NOT Ultimate Nick Fury; the similarity between Ultimate and Movie Fury is covered elsewhere in the article --> visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not \"the only superhero in the world\", and explaining that he wants to discuss the \"[[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] Initiative\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|width=170\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg\n|caption1=Downey promoting the film at the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]\n|image2=Terrence Howard, USAF.jpg\n|caption2=Howard preparing for the role by riding an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] flight simulator\n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />An [[industrialist]], genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of [[Stark Industries]] and chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]]. Director [[Jon Favreau]] felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> and that the actor could not only make Stark a \"likable asshole,\u201d but also portray an authentic emotional journey, once he had won over the audience.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]].'' Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name=\"KissKissBangBang\" /> Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process,<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> especially when it came to adding humor to the film.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Downey explained, \"What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into [[Dudley Do-Right]], and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That [[Eliot Ness]]-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarkQuote\" /> To get into shape, Downey spent five days a week [[weight training]] and practiced martial arts,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> which he said benefited him because \"it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ... after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day.\"<ref name=\"pump\" />\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]]: <br />A friend of Stark's and the liaison between Stark Industries and the [[United States Air Force]] in the department of acquisitions, specifically weapons development. Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|War Machine]] in a sequel.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> Howard prepared for the role by visiting [[Nellis Air Force Base]] on March 16, 2007, where he ate with the pilots and observed [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]] rescue helicopters and [[F-22 Raptor]]s.<ref name=\"HowardNellis\" /> While Rhodes is roguish in the comics after he meets Stark, his previous role as a disciplinarian creates a dynamic tension with Stark's character. He is unsure whether Stark's actions are acceptable. \"Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life, but at a certain point he realizes that perhaps there is a different way,\u201d Howard said. \"Whose life is the right way: Is it the strict military life, or the life of an independent?\"<ref name=\"pump\" /> Howard and his father are Iron Man fans, partly because Rhodes was one of the few black superheroes when Howard was a child.<ref name=\"RhodesFirst\" /> He has been a Downey fan since he saw him in ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]];'' the two competed physically on set.<ref name=\"HowardCompete\" />\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger]]: <br />Stark's business second-in-command, mentor, and friend, who turns on him to take over the company, eventually building a giant exosuit to fight Stark. Bridges read the comics as a boy and liked Favreau's modern, realistic approach. He shaved his head, something he had wanted to do for some time, and grew a beard for the role. Bridges [[google (verb)|googled]] the [[Book of Obadiah]], and was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that book of the Bible, something that Stane represents.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Many of Stane's scenes were cut to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridges's performance allowed the application of \"less is more\" when editing the film.<ref name=\"BridgesCut\" />\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as [[Ho Yinsen]]: Stark's fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest \"to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him\" and helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit.<ref name=\"Toub\" /><ref name=\"Yinsen\" />\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts]]: <br />Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest. Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, levelheaded, and grounded. She said she liked \"the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant.\u201d Favreau wanted Potts' and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an \"innocent yet sexy\" way.<ref name=\"Paltrow\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Faran Tahir]] appears as [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]], the leader of the Ten Rings; [[Paul Bettany]] voices [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark's personal [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] system; [[Leslie Bibb]] portrays [[Christine Everhart]], a reporter for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''; and [[Clark Gregg]] appears as [[Phil Coulson]], an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref name=\"IMEbertReview\" /> [[Will Lyman]] provides the voice-over during the opening award ceremony.<ref name=\"Lyman\" /> Director [[Jon Favreau]] plays [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]], Stark's [[bodyguard]] and [[chauffeur]],<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> and [[Samuel L.

It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured [[MODOK]] as the villain. [[Tom Rothman]], President of Production at Fox, credited the screenplay with finally making him understand the character. In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script.<ref name=\"archive\" /> That October, [[Quentin Tarantino]] was approached to write and direct the film.<ref name=\"Tarantino\" /> Fox sold the rights to [[New Line Cinema]] the following December, reasoning that although the Vintar/Lee script was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and \"we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"NewLine\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote= We worked with [[Michael Crichton]]'s researchers to find a grounded realistic way to deal with the suit.

After two years of unsuccessful development, the deal with Cassavetes fell through, and New Line Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel.<ref name=\"NewLineScreenplays\" />\n\nIn November 2005, [[Marvel Studios]] worked to start development from scratch,<ref name=\"MarvelDevelopment\" /> and announced ''Iron Man'' as their first independent feature, because the character was their only major one not already depicted in live action.<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> According to associate producer Jeremy Latcham, \"we went after about 30 writers and they all passed,\u201d saying they were uninterested in the project due to both the relative obscurity of the character and the fact that it was solely a Marvel production. When the film did have a script, even the requests for rewrites met with many refusals.<ref name=\"MCUDocumentary\" /> In order to build the general public's awareness of Iron Man and elevate him to the same level of popularity as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Hulk]], Marvel conducted [[focus group]]s, trying to find a way to remove the general perception that the character is a robot. The information Marvel received from the focus groups was used to  formulate an awareness-building plan, which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release. The shorts were called \"Iron Man Advertorials,\u201d and were produced by [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] and [[Blur Studio]].<ref name=\"Adventorials\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nJon Favreau was hired to direct the film in April 2006,<ref name=\"FavreauMarcumHolloway\" /> celebrating getting the job by going on a diet, losing {{convert|70|lb|kg}}.<ref name=\"pump\" /> Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer [[Avi Arad]] on another film after they both worked on ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''.<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious \"ultimate spy movie\" in ''Iron Man'', citing inspiration from [[Tom Clancy]], [[James Bond]], and ''[[RoboCop]]'',<ref name=\"Inspiration\" /> and compared his approach to an [[independent film]]\u2014\"[i]f [[Robert Altman]] had directed ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''\"\u2014and ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /><ref name=\"sauron\" /> Favreau wanted to make ''Iron Man'' a story of an adult man literally reinventing himself after discovering the world is far more complex than he originally believed.<ref name=\"FavreauWants\" /> He changed the [[Vietnam War]] origin of the character to Afghanistan, as he did not want to do a [[period piece]].<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway|Art Marcum & Matt Holloway]] were hired to write the script,<ref name=\"FavreauMarcumHolloway\" /> while [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby|Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby]] wrote another version, with Favreau compiling both teams' scripts,<ref name=\"FergusOstby\" /> and [[John August]] then \"polishing\" the combined version.<ref name=\"August\" /> Comic book staff [[Mark Millar]], [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Tom Brevoort]], [[Axel Alonso]], and [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]] were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script.<ref name=\"thinktank\" />\n\nFavreau planned to cast a newcomer in the title role, as \"those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' without being star-driven pieces reassures [executives] that the film does have an upside commercially.\"<ref name=\"DowneyUnknown\" /> However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role.<ref name=\"DowneyCast\" /> Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining \"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark.\"<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, \"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.\"<ref name=\"FavreauFight\" /> Downey earned $500,000 for the role.<ref name=\"DowneyPay\" /> While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by [[Elon Musk]]. Downey said, \"Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\"<ref name=\"Musk\" />\n\nAdditional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: [[Terrence Howard]] was announced in the role of Stark's best friend [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]] in October 2006;<ref name=\"HowardCast\" /> Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as love interest Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts in January 2007;<ref name=\"PaltrowCast\" /> and Jeff Bridges was cast in an undisclosed role in February.<ref name=\"BridgesCast\" /> [[Don Cheadle]] had also been approached for the role of Rhodes, and would eventually replace Howard in the role starting with the sequel, ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref name=\"CheadleRhodes\" /> Choosing a character to be the villain of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> He felt only in a sequel, with an altered tone, would the fantasy of the Mandarin's rings be appropriate.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> The decision to push him into the background is comparable to [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref name=\"sauron\" /> or [[Palpatine]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in that role,<ref name=\"depth\" /> with Stane originally intended to become a villain in the sequel.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The [[Crimson Dynamo]] was also a villain in early drafts of the script.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Favreau felt it was important to include intentional [[in-joke|inside references]] for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the [[call sign]]s of \"Whiplash 1\" and \"Whiplash 2\", a reference to the comic book villain [[Blacklash|Whiplash]], and including [[Captain America's shield]] in Stark's workshop.<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" />\n\n[[File:Ironmonger 2008film.jpg|thumb|left|A scale model of the \"Iron Monger\" suit]]\nFavreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Stan Winston]], a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on ''[[Zathura (film)|Zathura]]'', built metal and rubber versions of the armor.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single {{convert|90|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to have only its top half worn at times.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Stan Winston Studios built a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on|disp=flip}}, {{convert|800|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} animatronic version of \"Iron Monger\" (Obadiah Stane),<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a [[gimbal]] to simulate walking.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A [[scale model]] was used for the shots of it being built.<ref name=\"depth\" /> The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.<ref name=\"depth\" /> Iron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.<ref name=\"GranovSaunders\" /> Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.<ref name=\"sauron\" /> Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"<ref name=\"WarMachine\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"PlayaVista\" /> [[Howard Hughes]] was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]] was built.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Favreau rejected the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.<ref name=\"trilogy\" />\n\nFilming began on March 12, 2007,<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /> with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"FirstWeeks\" /> The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a {{convert|150|to(-)|200|yd|adj=on}} long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Production designer]] [[J. Michael Riva]] saw footage of a [[Taliban]] fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at [[Olancha]] Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|mph|adj=on}} winds.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] began in mid-April,<ref name=\"EdwardsBegins\" /> and ended on May 2.<ref name=\"EdwardsEnds\" /> Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of [[Point Dume]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]],<ref name=\"depth\" /> while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more \"[[wikt:grease monkey|grease monkey]]\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, \"I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs\". He hired \"people who are good at creating action\", so \"the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre\".<ref name=\"pump\" />\n\nThere was much [[improvization]] in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvization would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time.<ref name=\"depth\" /> It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a [[news conference]] on the floor,<ref name=\"pump\" /> and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Bridges described this approach as \"a $200&nbsp;million student film\", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded.<ref name=\"BridgesImprovisation\" /> The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.<ref name=\"CameoRemoved\" /> An alternate version of the Nick Fury post-credits scene was filmed in which he specifically said \"As if gamma accidents, radioactive bugs and assorted [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] weren't enough\" referencing Hulk, Spider-Man and the [[X-Men]] but this was cut due to legal problems with [[Sony Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] who at the time had full ownership of the characters until their reacquisition much later in the mid to late 2010s.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/09/14/deleted-iron-man-post-credits-scene-kevin-feige/ |title=Deleted Iron Man post-credits scene references Spider-Man, X-Men |last=Bucksbaum |first=Sydney |date=September 14, 2019 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nFavreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious.<ref name=\"FavreauEffectsConcerns\" /> He hired [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' and ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''. [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]] and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]] did additional work,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor.<ref name=\"Embassy\" /> To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a [[motion capture]] suit,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and skydivers were filmed in a vertical [[wind tunnel]] to study the physics of flying.<ref name=\"WindTunnel\" /> For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses.<ref name=\"MarkIIIFlying\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Iron Man (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nComposer [[Ramin Djawadi]] had been a fan of the character [[Iron Man]] as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes \"that actually don't have any superpowers\". After Favreau's previous collaborator [[John Debney]] was unavailable to score the film,<ref name=\"DebneyIM1\" /> Djawadi sought out the role himself.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Favreau had a clear vision of [[heavy metal music]] and guitars for the project,<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero.<ref name=\"DjawadiDoG\" /> Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Remote Control Productions (American company)|Remote Control Productions]],<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> and [[Rage Against the Machine]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]], who makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.<ref name=\"Morello\" /> The film also features a [[big band]]-style [[arrangement]] of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]].<ref name=\"O\" /> A soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate Records]] on April 29, 2008.<ref name=\"release\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Robert Downey Jr-2008.JPG|thumb|upright|Downey promoting the film in [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nMarvel and Paramount modeled their marketing campaign for ''Iron Man'' on that of ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> In May 2008, [[Sega]] released an official tie-in [[Iron Man (video game)|video game based on the film]] on multiple gaming platforms. Downey, Howard and Toub reprise their roles from the film.<ref name=\"VideoGame\" /> A 30-second spot for the film aired during a [[Super Bowl XLII]] break.<ref name=\"SuperBowl\" /> 6,400 [[7-Eleven]] stores in the United States helped promote the film, and [[LG Group]] also made a deal with Paramount.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> [[Hasbro]] created figures of armor from the film, as well as [[Titanium Man]] (who appears in the video game) and the [[Hulkbuster Armor MK II|armor from the ''World War Hulk'' comics]].<ref name=\"Hasbro\" /> Worldwide, [[Burger King]] and [[Audi]] promoted the film. Jon Favreau was set to direct a commercial for the fast-food chain, as [[Michael Bay]] did for ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> In the film, Tony Stark drives an [[Audi R8 (road car)|Audi R8]], and also has an \"American cheeseburger\" from Burger King after his rescue from Afghanistan, as part of the studio's [[product placement]] deal with the respective companies.
