The <code>Display</code> structure of the Xlib library contains information about the display, but more importantly it contains information relative to the channel between the client and the server. For example, in a [[Unix-like]] operating system, the <code>Display</code> structure contains the file handle of the [[Unix domain socket|socket]] of this channel (this can be retrieved using the <code>ConnectionNumber</code> macro.) Most Xlib functions have a <code>Display</code> structure as an argument because they either operate on the channel or are relative to a specific channel. In particular, all Xlib functions that interact with the server need this structure for accessing the channel. Some other functions need this structure, even if they operate locally, because they operate on data relative to a specific channel. Operations of this kind include for example operations on the event queue, which is described below.\n\nWindows, colormaps, etc. are managed by the server, which means that the data about their actual implementation is all stored in the server. The client operates on these objects by using their ''identifiers''. The client cannot directly operate on an object, but can only request the server to perform the operation specifying the identifier of the object.\n\nThe types <code>Windows</code>, <code>Pixmap</code>, <code>Font</code>, <code>Colormap</code>, etc. are all identifiers, which are 32-bit integers (just as in the X11 protocol itself). A client 'creates' a window by requesting that the server create a window. This is done via a call to an Xlib function that returns an identifier for the window, that is, a number. This identifier can then be used by the client for requesting other operations on the same window to the server.\n\nThe identifiers are unique to the server. Most of them can be used by different applications to refer to the same objects. For example, two applications connecting with the same server use the same identifier to refer to the same window. These two applications use two different channels, and therefore have two different <tt>Display</tt> structures; however, when they request operations on the same identifier, these operations will be done on the same object.\n\n==Protocol and events==\nThe Xlib functions that send requests to the server usually do not send these requests immediately but store them in a buffer, called the ''request buffer''. The term ''request'' in this case refers to the request from the client that is directed to the server: the request buffer can contain all kinds of requests to the server, not only those having a visible effect on the screen. The request buffer is guaranteed to be flushed (i.e., all requests done so far are sent to the server) after a call to the functions <code>XSync</code> or <code>XFlush</code>, after a call to a function that returns a value from the server (these functions block until the answer is received), and in some other conditions. <!-- e.g. operations on the queue when they block; maybe other ones -->\n\nXlib stores the received events in a queue. The client application can inspect and retrieve events from the queue. While the X server sends events asynchronously, applications using the Xlib library are required to explicitly call Xlib functions for accessing the events in the queue. Some of these functions may block; in this case, they also flush the request buffer.\n\nErrors are instead received and treated asynchronously: the application can provide an error handler that will be called whenever an error message from the server is received.\n\nThe content of a window is not guaranteed to be preserved if the window or one of its parts are made not visible. In this case, the application are sent an <code>Expose</code> event when the window of one part of it is made visible again. The application is then supposed to draw the window content again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe functions in the Xlib library can be grouped in:\n# operations on the connection (<code>XOpenDisplay</code>, <code>XCloseDisplay</code>, ...);\n# requests to the server, including requests for operations (<code>XCreateWindow</code>, <code>XCreateGC</code>,...) and requests for information (<code>XGetWindowProperty</code>, ...); and\n# operations that are local to the client: operations on the event queue (<code>XNextEvent</code>, <code>XPeekEvent</code>, ...) and other operations on local data (<code>XLookupKeysym</code>, <code>XParseGeometry</code>, <code>XSetRegion</code>, <code>XCreateImage</code>, <code>XSaveContext</code>, ...)\n\n==Example==\n[[Image:Xlib square example.png|frame|Simple Xlib application drawing a box and text in a window. Without [[window manager]] decorations.]]\n[[Image:Xlib square example with ICEWM decorations.png|frame|Simple Xlib application drawing a box and text in a window. With [[IceWM]] [[window manager]] decorations.]]\n\nThe following program creates a window with a little black square in it:\n<source lang=C>\n/*\n    Simple Xlib application for creating a window and drawing a box in it.\n    gcc input.c -o output -lX11\n*/\n \n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n \nint main(void)\n{\n    Display *display;\n    Window window;\n    XEvent event;\n    char *msg = \"Hello, World!\";\n    int s;\n \n    // open connection to the server\n    display = XOpenDisplay(NULL);\n    if (display == NULL)\n    {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Cannot open display\\n\");\n        exit(1);\n    }\n \n    s = DefaultScreen(display);\n \n    // create window\n    window = XCreateSimpleWindow(display, RootWindow(display, s), 10, 10, 200, 200, 1,\n                                 BlackPixel(display, s), WhitePixel(display, s));\n \n    // select kind of events we are interested in\n    XSelectInput(display, window, ExposureMask | KeyPressMask);\n \n    // map (show) the window\n    XMapWindow(display, window);\n \n    // event loop\n    for (;;)\n    {\n        XNextEvent(display, &event);\n \n        // draw or redraw the window\n        if (event.type == Expose)\n        {\n            XFillRectangle(display, window, DefaultGC(display, s), 20, 20, 10, 10);\n            XDrawString(display, window, DefaultGC(display, s), 50, 50, msg, strlen(msg));\n        }\n        // exit on key press\n        if (event.type == KeyPress)\n            break;\n    }\n \n    // close connection to the server\n    XCloseDisplay(display);\n \n    return 0;\n }\n</source>\n\nThe client creates a connection with the server by calling <code>XOpenDisplay</code>. It then requests the creation of a window with <code>XCreateSimpleWindow</code>. A separate call to <code>XMapWindow</code> is necessary for mapping the window, that is, for making it visible on the screen.\n\nThe square is drawn by calling <code>XFillRectangle</code>. This operation can only be performed after the window is created. However, performing it once may not be enough. Indeed, the content of the window is not always guaranteed to be preserved. For example, if the window is covered and then uncovered again, its content might require being redrawn. The program is informed that the window or a part of it has to be drawn by the reception of an <code>Expose</code> event.\n\nThe drawing of the window content is therefore made inside the [[Event loop|loop handling the events]]. Before entering this loop, the events the application is interested in are selected, in this case with <code>XSelectInput</code>. The event loop waits for an incoming event: if this event is a key press, the application exits; if it is an expose event, the window content is drawn. The function <code>XNextEvent</code> blocks and flushes the request buffer if there is no event in the queue.\n\n==Other libraries==\nXlib does not provide support for buttons, menus, scrollbars, etc. Such [[widget (computing)|widget]]s are provided by other libraries, which in turn use Xlib. There are two kinds of such libraries:\n* libraries built atop of the [[X Toolkit Intrinsics]] library (Xt), which provides support for widgets but does not provide any particular widget; specific widgets are provided by [[widget set]] libraries that use Xt, such as [[Xaw]] and [[Motif (software)|Motif]];\n* libraries that provide widget sets using Xlib directly, without the Xt library, such as the X versions of [[GTK]], [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]], [[FLTK]] and [[fpGUI]].\n\nApplications using any of these widget libraries typically specify the content of the window before entering the main loop and do not need to explicitly handle <code>Expose</code> events and redraw the window content.\n\nThe [[XCB]] library is an alternative to Xlib. Its two main aims are: reduction in library size and direct access to the X11 protocol. A modification of Xlib has been produced to use XCB as a low-level layer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikibooks|X Window Programming|XLib}}\n* [http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/ProgrammingDocumentation/ X.Org Foundation's official programming documentation], including most recent version of [http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.pdf Xlib - C Language X Interface] in several formats.\n* [https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib-tutorial/ A short tutorial on Xlib]\n* [https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/function-index.html Manual pages for all Xlib functions]\n* [http://www.rahul.net/kenton/bib.html Kenton Lee's pages on X Window and Motif]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060923165147/http://users.actcom.co.il/~choo/lupg/tutorials/xlib-programming/xlib-programming.html A longer tutorial on Xlib]\n* [http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/%7eliberato/screensaver Using Xlib for creating a screensaver module]\n\n{{XWinSys}}\n{{Widget toolkits}}\n\n[[Category:Application programming interfaces]]\n[[Category:C libraries]]\n[[Category:X Window System]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C code]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = Xlib\n| title                  = Xlib\n| logo                   = <!-- [[File: ]] -->\n| logo caption           = \n| screenshot             = <!-- [[File: ]] -->\n| caption                = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = \n| developer              = [[X.Org Foundation]]\n| released               = ~1985 {{citation needed|reason=Adrian Nye's Xlib book mentions earliest years of 1986 for X10 and 1987 for X11.|date=June 2015}} <!-- {{Start date|1985|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = \n| latest release date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| programming language   = [[C (programming language)|C]]\n| operating system       = \n| platform               = \n| size                   = \n| language               = \n| genre                  = [[Library (computing)|Library]]\n| license                = \n| website                = {{URL|https://www.x.org}}, documentation: {{URL|https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html}}\n}}\n\n[[File:X11 display server protocol.svg|thumb|X11-clients use xlib to communicate with the [[display server]].]]\n\n'''Xlib''' (also known as '''libX11''') is an [[X Window System]] protocol client [[library (computer science)|library]] written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].

A modification of Xlib has been produced to use XCB as a low-level layer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikibooks|X Window Programming|XLib}}\n* [http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/ProgrammingDocumentation/ X.Org Foundation's official programming documentation], including most recent version of [http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.pdf Xlib - C Language X Interface] in several formats.\n* [https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib-tutorial/ A short tutorial on Xlib]\n* [https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/function-index.html Manual pages for all Xlib functions]\n* [http://www.rahul.net/kenton/bib.html Kenton Lee's pages on X Window and Motif]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060923165147/http://users.actcom.co.il/~choo/lupg/tutorials/xlib-programming/xlib-programming.html A longer tutorial on Xlib]\n* [http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/%7eliberato/screensaver Using Xlib for creating a screensaver module]\n\n{{XWinSys}}\n{{Widget toolkits}}\n\n[[Category:Application programming interfaces]]\n[[Category:C libraries]]\n[[Category:X Window System]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C code]]\n", "name_user": "Delta (G400)", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleaned up the comments in the C example", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib"}

The party was centrist, though elements of the far-right and the left also joined.<ref name=\"Clogg39\u201340\"/> The party fractured following its leader Georgios Papandreou's resignation after a disagreement with [[King Constantine II]] who clashed with Papandreou on how to handle the armed forces. Papandreou was succeeded by several shaky governments which relied on the votes of the opposition and defectors from the Centre Union. The turmoil surrounding Papandreou's resignation became known as the 'Apostasy' which led directly to the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]].<ref name=\"Gallant273\u2013274\">Gallant, 2015, pp. 273\u2013274</ref>\n\n===Establishment and Goals===\n\nThe Centre Union was founded in September 1961, six weeks before the elections of the same year. The forces of the centre, chiefly consisting of the Liberal Democratic Party (Fileleftheron Dimokratikon Komma), a splinter party from the Liberal Party surrounding [[Georgios Papandreou]], the [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] (Komma Fileleftheron) of [[Sofoklis Venizelos]] and the [[New Political Forces]] (Nea Politiki Kinisis. These parties appeared in the wake of the 1958 Legislative Election which resulted in the Liberal Party under the joint leadership of Venizelos and Papandreou, coming third, having been eclipsed by the socialist [[United Democratic Left]] (Eniaa Dimokratiki Aristera). On the centre-left was added the [[National Progressive Centre Union]] (Ethniki Proodeftiki Enosis Kentrou) and the [[Party of Peasants and Workers]] (Komma Agrotikon kai Ergazomenon), [[Ilias Tsirimokos]]\u2019 [[Democratic Union (Greece, 1950s)|Democratic Union]] party (Dimokratiki Enosis) and on the right, [[Stefanos Stefanopoulos\u2019]] [[Popular Social Party]] (Laikon Koinonikon Komma), a breakaway group from the [[Greek Rally]], and the [[Party of the Nationally Minded]] (Komma Ethnikiphronon). Smaller, less influential figures were brought into the fold, namely [[Stylianos Allamanis]] and [[Pafsanias Katsotas]]. All constituent parts recognised the sole leadership of Georgios Papandreou.<ref name=\"Clogg39\u201340\"/>\n\nUpon receiving the leadership of the Centre Union, Georgios Papandreou declared his immediate objective to be the reduction of the EDA vote to less than 20% so that the two \u2018nationally-minded\u2019 parties, EK and the ruling [[National Radical Union]] (Ethniki Rizospastiki Enosis, ERE), could contest the elections within the framework of democracy.<ref name=\"Clogg39\u201340\"/>\n\nOf the two major parties, the Centre Union had a more cohesive party structure. It had an official constitution, membership provisions, professional cadres, national conventions, a youth wing and formal procedures for the succession of leaders. However, not a single meeting of the highest authority in the party, the congress, ever took place.<ref name=\"Clogg39\u201340\"/><ref name=\"Close102\">Close, 2002, pp. 102</ref>[[File:Georgios_Papandreu_(Papandreou).jpg|thumb|right|Prime Minister (1963-1965, 1944-1945) and Centre Union leader Georgios Papandreou.]]\n\n===The \u2018Unrelenting Struggle\u2019===\n\nIn anticipation of the next elections, the government of Prime Minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] announced intentions of enacting a new electoral law: the proposed law was set before parliament and on 6 May, after lengthy debate, it was passed. A system of \u2018reinforced\u2019 proportional representation was introduced which gave minor parties a slight advantage in comparison with the previous law.<ref name=\"Hourmouzios318-321\">Hourmouzios, 1972, pp. 318-321</ref><ref name=\"Clogg40\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 40</ref>\n\n[[Paul of Greece|King Paul]], in accordance with political traditions in Greece, appointed a \u2018service' government headed by the chief of the royal household, General [[Konstantinos Dovas]], to oversee the campaign period to ensure impartial conduct of the election as it was feared that the ruling party may try and tamper with the results.<ref name=\"Clogg40\"/>\n\nOn 29 September the results were fully counted: the ERE received 50.8 per cent of votes cast equating to 176 seats; the Centre Union in collaboration with [[Spyros Markezinis|Spyros Markezinis\u2019]] [[Progressive Party (Greece)|Progressive Party]], garnered 33.7 per cent of the popular vote translating to 100 seats. The majority of the remaining votes went to the left-wing [[All-Democratic Agricultural Front|Pandemocratic Agrarian Front of Greece]]. Immediately the results were denounced by the extreme left and the Centre Union as illegitimate - Papandreou proclaimed that the results were \u2018a product of violence and fraud\u2019 thus inaugurating Papandreou's \u2018unrelenting struggle\u2019 for free and fair elections.<ref name=\"Clogg42-44\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 42-44</ref><ref name=\"Hourmouzios318-321\"/> Meanwhile, several days after the election, deputy leader of the EK, Sofoklis Venizelos, declared that the EK was fighting more than just the ERE, but also \u2018the General Staff of the Army, the Central Intelligence Agency, the gendarmerie, the National Security Battalions and other dark forces\u2019. General Dovas complained that all of Papandreou's demands prior to the election had been satisfied and pointed out that abstentions had been at a fifteen-year low.<ref name=\"Clogg42-44\"/><ref name=\"Hourmouzios318-321\"/>\n\nOn 2 December, the socialist parties and all but nine Centre Union deputies were absent from the State opening of Parliament in order to protest what they believed to be an illegal administration. Accordingly, on 7 December, without any Centre Union votes, Karamanlis received his vote of confidence by 174 votes to 21. The next stage of the EK's war against the establishment was waged against the King involving a boycott of all official functions. Duly he declined an invitation to a Court Ball celebrating King Paul's sixtieth birthday on 14 December 1961, replying \u2018Mr Georgios Papandreou will not be attending\u2019. Likewise, Sofoklis Venizelos and Spyros Markezinis excused themselves by informing the King that they could not come due to being abroad.<ref name=\"Hourmouzios318-321\"/>\n\nKaramanlis\u2019 position was undermined further when, on 27 May 1963, [[Grigorios Lambrakis]], a left-wing deputy from Piraeus, was murdered by two men wielding clubs in the course of a peaceful protest. The Lambrakis assassination revealed a right-wing underworld when it was revealed the two killers had close links to the local gendarmerie, therefore roping in Karamanlis. While it is unlikely Karamanlis had any ties to the assassination, it placed the idea of an illegal \u2018para-state\u2019 on firmer ground.<ref name=\"Gallant271\">Gallant, 2015, pp. 271</ref><ref name=\"Close105\">Close, 2002, pp. 105</ref>\n\nThe crisis atmosphere was heightened when Karamanlis began having spats with King Paul over a state visit to England set to take place in the Summer of 1963. Karamanlis, after reaching no agreement with the King regarding the matter, submitted his resignation,<ref name=\"Hourmouzios334-335\">Hourmouzios, 1972, pp. 334-335</ref> and suggested that diplomatist and outgoing ERE minister, [[Panagiotis Pipinelis]], should be entrusted with the premiership and that elections should be held immediately. Paul also favoured Pipinelis because he, unlike Karamanlis, would support the proposed state visit to England. Paul refused immediate elections on the basis that he must not be abroad on the state visit in the midst of an election. Paul then summoned Papandreou and Markezinis who both agreed that a \u2018service\u2019 government enjoying the confidence of parliament should be appointed to prepare the ground for an election, as opposed to Karamanlis\u2019 view that elections should be held as soon as possible. Eventually, after five days of consultations, the King called on Pipienlis, who he knew would enjoy the support of all 180 ERE deputies (thus constituting a majority), to form a government. This was not what the Centre Union had bargained for. Papandreou denounced the new government as \u2018inspiring no confidence in its ability to hold fair elections\u2019. The customary confidence vote was therefore boycotted by the Centre Union deputies who all arose from their seats and walked out. All but Sofoklis Venizelos, having promised to cast his vote for the government after two offending ministers were replaced, who informed the teller that he was giving the government a \u2018vote of tolerance\u2019. He then followed his fellow deputies and walked out.<ref name=\"Hourmouzios337-339\">Hourmouzios, 1972, pp. 337-339</ref>\n\n===Centre Union in power===\n\nWith the state visit safely behind, Pipinelis demanded and obtained a second confidence vote, and shortly thereafter a new electoral bill was introduced to the chamber providing for another system of \u2018reinforced\u2019 proportional representation. The EK, repudiating the bill, abstained from the final vote and the bill was passed on the votes of the ERE alone.The EK threatened to boycott the upcoming elections if Pipinelis remained in power for the duration of the electoral process. Markezinis also expressed his desire for a change in government, while Karamanlis, communicating from a temporary self-imposed exile in Paris, conveyed his strong desire for Pipinelis to remain in office for the time being. On 26 September Prime Minister Pipinelis was summoned by King Paul who handed him the Royal Decree dissolving Parliament and ordering elections for 3 November. The following day Pipinelis was replaced by [[Stylianos Mavromichalis|Stelio Mavromichales]] as not to agitate the EK's threats.<ref name=\"Hourmouzios344-346\">Hourmouzios, 1972, pp. 344-346</ref>\n\nThe [[1963 Greek legislative election|Legislative Election of 3 November 1963]] resulted in the Centre Union, albeit narrowly, carrying the day: the Centre Union managed to take 138 out of the 300 seats in parliament with the ERE coming second with 132 seats. The EDA took 28.<ref name=\"Clogg45\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 45</ref> On 6 November the King called on Papandreou to form a government. Georgios Papandreou was now Prime Minister. The Centre Union's victory can largely be credited to the subsiding of anti-Communism which had flared up in the years following the Civil War and the growing unemployment.<ref name=\"Gallant271\">Gallant, 2015, pp. 271</ref>\n\nPapandreou dispelled any hopes that King Paul initially held that Papandreou might seek a coalition with the ERE and announced he would only seek backing from his party and those disaffected with others. By 24 December, however, when he obtained a confidence vote, it turned out he was wrong. The ERE voted solidly against the new government, therefore, Papandreou relied on the votes of his party and the socialist EDA.<ref name=\"Hourmouzios344-346\"/> Despite his party not occupying the majority of seats in Parliament, he still flatly refused any deals with the EDA which he believed to be a front for the illegal [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] (KKE). This view was shared by many politicians of the two \u2018nationally-minded\u2019 parties.<ref name=\"Clogg47\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 47</ref>\n\nGeorgios Papandreou headed to the polls again after laying out a vote-catching program before parliament in 1964. The 16 February Legislative Election yielded a landslide victory for Papandreou. The EK secured 52.7 per cent of the popular vote equating to 171 seats in parliament.<ref name=\"Clogg49\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 49</ref> The Centre Union were especially large in more prosperous agricultural regions, where the police's grip on power had been much weakened. The EK attracted lower middle-class voters too. The 1964-1965 government headed by Papandreou enacted overdue reforms catered towards the lower and middle class by increasing pensions and prices for farmers; the system in which elections take place in the General Confederation of Greek Workers was made fairer. The government put a lot of emphasis on education by abolishing fees for universities and secondary schools; additional university teachers were appointed; a larger intake into universities was accepted; the period of compulsory education was extended to nine years from six; primary education was to be conducted completely in demotic (common) Greek which was also to have equal status to katharevousa (purified) in secondary schools. New subjects were introduced and more emphasis was put on others. Sociology and economics were added to the curriculum subjects, while importance was put on modern languages. In total, educational expenditure increased by a third in one year, and by 1967 11.6 per cent of the budget was dedicated to education.<ref name=\"Close107\">Close, 2002, pp. 107</ref> And although Papandreou viewed the left with some hostility, he released several thousands of prisoners still behind bars from the Civil War. Only about 1000 Communists remained in prison, a large decrease from its peak of about 20,000 in the early 1960s and 50s.<ref name=\"Clogg48\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 48</ref>\n\n===The July events===\n\n{{see also|Apostasia of 1965}}\n\nThe lack of cohesion between EK deputies and the leadership resulted in the collapse of the Centre Union government.<ref name=\"Clogg50-53\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 50-53</ref> A leading cause for the schism in the party was the accusation of nepotism and lust for power on the part of Georgios Papandreou. [[Andreas Papandreou]], the son of Georgios Papandreou, was appointed First Minister of State and Minister of Coordination in 1964 the same year he was elected to Parliament. Rising stars in the party, including future premier [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]], felt as though the younger Papandreou had not served his time in the party required to garner him the role of what is effectively the assistant Prime Minister. Disdain of Andreas Papandreou came to a head when in May 1965, a report written by EK deputies opposed to the Papandreous accused Andreas of collaborating with ASPIDA, a grouping of left-leaning military officers.<ref name=\"Gallant273-274\">Gallant, 2015, pp. 273-274</ref><ref name=\"Clogg50-53\"/>[[File:Andreas_Papandreou_1968.jpg|thumb|left|Andreas Papandreou.]]<ref name=\"Close107-109\">Close, 2002, pp. 107-109</ref>\n\nPapandreou and [[King Constantine II]]\u2019s (Paul died in March 1964) relationship began to break down over disagreements on the handling of the armed forces.<ref name=\"Gallant273-274\"/> [[Petros Garoufalias]], a royalist Centre Union deputy, enjoyed the King\u2019s support as Minister of National Defence. In turn, Garoufalias appointed officers loyal to both the King and himself. This was not acceptable to Papandreou, whose primary goal at that point was to purge the armed forces of conspiratorial elements which were vehemently against Papandreou and even more violently against his son holding far more radical views than his aging father.<ref name=\"Gallant273-274\"/> Initially Papandreou retaliated against politically active officers by moving them as far away as possible from Athens, blocking their promotions or forcing their retirement,<ref name=\"Close107-109\"/> but he could only do so much without occupying the Defence Ministry as well as that of Premier. Papandreou, enjoying a healthy parliamentary majority, came to the King and demanded that he be made Defence Minister while holding the Premiership as well which was a prerequisite of replacing the Chief of Staff. The King refused on the grounds that Papandreou\u2019s son Andreas had yet to prove himself innocent in the ASPIDA case. In disgust, Papandreou resigned, kicking off the \u2018July events\u2019 , also known as the 'Apostasy', a stormy political crisis revolving around the resignation of Papandreou.\n\nImmediately after Papandreou's resignation, a new government headed by EK defectors disaffected with the Papandreous (the \u2018Apostates\u2019), ERE deputies and 8 deputies belonging to the Progressive Party, all loyal to the standard of Apostate Speaker [[Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas]] was formed. This government fell in August and was replaced by a new one headed by Ilias Tsirimokos which fell a few weeks later in September when it failed to receive the mandatory vote of confidence. Stefanos Stefanopoulos was then appointed who obtained a confidence vote. In total, there were 45 \u2018Apostates\u2019.<ref name=\"Clogg51\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 51</ref><ref name=\"Clogg52\"/>\n\nThe 'Apostasy' had a radicalising effect on the centre-left of the EK. This segment increasingly looked to Andreas Papandreou and at one point an abandonment from the elected leadership of Georgios Papndreou by the centre-left seemed possible.<ref name=\"Clogg52\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 52</ref>\n\nAn end to the crisis seemed in sight when on 20 December 1966, Papandreou, ERE leader [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]] and the King reached a resolution: elections would be held under a straightforward system of proportional representation where all parties participating agreed to compete, and that, in any outcome, the command structure of the army would not be altered.<ref name=\"Clogg52\"/> In the leadup to the election scheduled for 28 May 1967, the EK introduced a bill extending parliamentary immunity for the duration of the campaign aimed at protecting Andreas Papandreou who was still under scrutiny for his potential involvement in ASPIDA and in March 1967 fifteen officers charged with being involved in the ASPIDA affair were convicted.<ref name=\"Clogg52\"/> Interim Prime Minister Ioannis Paraskevopoulos resigned in the ensuing row and Kanellopoulos stepped in to fill the role of the Prime Minister until the May Election.<ref name=\"Clogg53\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 53</ref>\n\nDespite the crisis subsiding early on, on 21 April 1967, a month before the scheduled elections, a clique of relatively junior officers headed by Georgios Papadopoulos took over in a coup d'\u00e9tat. Senior officials including the two Papandreous were arrested.<ref name=\"Clogg53\"/> Georgios Papandreou died on 1 November 1968 and the Centre Union, now illegal, was placed under the titular leadership of [[Georgios Mavros]].<ref name=\"Clogg56\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 56</ref>\n\n===Post-Junta===\n\nMavros reconstituted the Centre Union in 1974 as the [[Centre Union - New Forces]] (Enosi Kentrou - Nees Dynameis, EK - ND).<ref name=\"Clogg64\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 64</ref> The leadership was offered to Andreas Papandreou, however, he declined the offer.<ref name=\"Clogg56\"/> Papandreou instead formed the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Panellinio Sosialistiko Kinima, PASOK)<ref name=\"Clogg64\"/> and in the 1977 election, it eclipsed the centrists as the second largest party in parliament.<ref name=\"Clogg71\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 71</ref> The Centre Union rebranded as the [[Union of the Democratic Centre]] (Enosi Dimokratikou Kentrou, EDIK) in 1976, though it failed to re-enter parliament after 1985.<ref name=\"Clogg74\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 74</ref><ref name=\"Clogg102\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 102</ref>\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n=== Hellenic Parliament elections ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[Hellenic Parliament]]\n!Election\n!Party Leader\n!'''Votes'''\n!'''%'''\n!'''Seats'''\n!+/\u2013\n!'''Position'''\n!Government\n|-\n|[[1961 Greek legislative election|1961]]\n|[[Georgios Papandreou]]\n|1,555,442\n\n{{Small|(In alliance with [[Progressive Party (Greece)|PP]])}}\n|33.66%\n|{{Composition bar|100|300|hex=orange}}\n|{{increase}} 54\n|{{increase}} 2nd\n|{{Color|red|Opposition}}\n|-\n|[[1963 Greek legislative election|1963]]\n|[[Georgios Papandreou]]\n|1,962,074\n|42.04%\n|{{Composition bar|138|300|hex=orange}}\n|{{increase}} 38\n|{{increase}} 1st\n|{{Color|purple|Minority government}}\n|-\n|[[1964 Greek legislative election|1964]]\n|[[Georgios Papandreou]]\n|2,424,477\n|35.3%\n|{{Composition bar|171|300|hex=orange}}\n|{{increase}} 33\n|{{steady}} 1st\n|{{Color|green|Government}}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Georgios Papandreou Party]]\n* [[Savas Papapolitis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n* Hourmouzios, Stelio (1972).

The party was centrist, though elements of the far-right and the left also joined.<ref name=\"Clogg39\u201340\"/> The party fractured following its leader Georgios Papandreou's resignation after a disagreement with [[King Constantine II]] who clashed with Papandreou on how to handle the armed forces. Papandreou was succeeded by several shaky governments which relied on the votes of the opposition and defectors from the Centre Union. The turmoil surrounding Papandreou's resignation became known as the 'Apostasy' which led directly to the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]].<ref name=\"Gallant273\u2013274\">Gallant, 2015, pp. 273\u2013274</ref>\n\n===Establishment and Goals===\n\nThe Centre Union was founded in September of 1961, six weeks before the elections of the same year. The forces of the centre, chiefly consisting of the Liberal Democratic Party (Fileleftheron Dimokratikon Komma), a splinter party from the Liberal Party surrounding [[Georgios Papandreou]], the [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] (Komma Fileleftheron) of [[Sofoklis Venizelos]] and the [[New Political Forces]] (Nea Politiki Kinisis. These parties appeared in the wake of the 1958 Legislative Election which resulted in the Liberal Party under the joint leadership of Venizelos and Papandreou, coming third, having been eclipsed by the socialist [[United Democratic Left]] (Eniaa Dimokratiki Aristera). On the centre-left was added the [[National Progressive Centre Union]] (Ethniki Proodeftiki Enosis Kentrou) and the [[Party of Peasants and Workers]] (Komma Agrotikon kai Ergazomenon), [[Ilias Tsirimokos|Ilias Tsirimokos]]\u2019 [[Democratic Union (Greece, 1950s)|Democratic Union]] party (Dimokratiki Enosis) and on the right, [[Stefanos Stefanopoulos\u2019]] [[Popular Social Party]] (Laikon Koinonikon Komma), a breakaway group from the [[Greek Rally]], and the [[Party of the Nationally Minded]] (Komma Ethnikiphronon). Smaller, less influential figures were brought into the fold, namely [[Stylianos Allamanis]] and [[Pafsanias Katsotas]]. All constituent parts recognised the sole leadership of Georgios Papandreou.<ref name=\"Clogg39\u201340\"/>\n\nUpon receiving the leadership of the Centre Union, Georgios Papandreou declared his immediate objective to be the reduction of the EDA vote to less than 20% so that the two \u2018nationally-minded\u2019 parties, EK and the ruling [[National Radical Union]] (Ethniki Rizospastiki Enosis, ERE), could contest the elections within the framework of democracy.<ref name=\"Clogg39\u201340\"/>\n\nOf the two major parties, the Centre Union had a more cohesive party structure. It had an official constitution, membership provisions, professional cadres, national conventions, a youth wing and formal procedures for the succession of leaders. However, not a single meeting of the highest authority in the party, the congress, ever took place.<ref name=\"Clogg39\u201340\"/><ref name=\"Close102\">Close, 2002, pp. 102</ref>[[File:Georgios_Papandreu_(Papandreou).jpg|thumb|right|Prime Minister (1963-1965, 1944-1945) and Centre Union leader Georgios Papandreou.]]\n\n===The \u2018Unrelenting Struggle\u2019===\n\nIn anticipation of the next elections, the government of Prime Minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] announced intentions of enacting a new electoral law: the proposed law was set before parliament and on 6 May, after lengthy debate, it was passed. A system of \u2018reinforced\u2019 proportional representation was introduced which gave minor parties a slight advantage in comparison with the previous law.<ref name=\"Hourmouzios318-321\">Hourmouzios, 1972, pp. 318-321</ref><ref name=\"Clogg40\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 40</ref>\n\n[[Paul of Greece|King Paul]], in accordance with political traditions in Greece, appointed a \u2018service' government headed by the chief of the royal household, General [[Konstantinos Dovas]], to oversee the campaign period to ensure impartial conduct of the election as it was feared that the ruling party may try and tamper with the results.<ref name=\"Clogg40\"/>\n\nOn 29 September the results were fully counted: the ERE received 50.8 per cent of votes cast equating to 176 seats; the Centre Union in collaboration with [[Spyros Markezinis|Spyros Markezinis\u2019]] [[Progressive Party (Greece)|Progressive Party]], garnered 33.7 per cent of the popular vote translating to 100 seats. The majority of the remaining votes went to the left-wing [[All-Democratic Agricultural Front|Pandemocratic Agrarian Front of Greece]]. Immediately the results were denounced by the extreme left and the Centre Union as illegitimate - Papandreou proclaimed that the results were \u2018a product of violence and fraud\u2019 thus inaugurating Papandreou\u2019s \u2018unrelenting struggle\u2019 for free and fair elections.<ref name=\"Clogg42-44\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 42-44</ref><ref name=\"Hourmouzios318-321\"/> Meanwhile, several days after the election, deputy leader of the EK, Sofoklis Venizelos, declared that the EK was fighting more than just the ERE, but also \u2018the General Staff of the Army, the Central Intelligence Agency, the gendarmerie, the National Security Battalions and other dark forces\u2019. General Dovas complained that all of Papandreou\u2019s demands prior to the election had been satisfied and pointed out that abstentions had been at a fifteen year low.<ref name=\"Clogg42-44\"/><ref name=\"Hourmouzios318-321\"/>\n\nOn 2 December, the socialist parties and all but nine Centre Union deputies were absent from the State opening of Parliament in order to protest what they believed to be an illegal administration. Accordingly, on 7 December, without any Centre Union votes, Karamanlis received his vote of confidence by 174 votes to 21. The next stage of the EK\u2019s war against the establishment was waged against the King involving a boycott of all official functions. Duly he declined an invitation to a Court Ball celebrating King Paul\u2019s sixtieth birthday on 14 December 1961, replying \u2018Mr Georgios Papandreou will not be attending\u2019. Likewise, Sofoklis Venizelos and Spyros Markezinis excused themselves by informing the King that they could not come due to being abroad.<ref name=\"Hourmouzios318-321\"/>\n\nKaramanlis\u2019 position was undermined further when, on 27 May 1963, [[Grigorios Lambrakis]], a left-wing deputy from Piraeus, was murdered by two men wielding clubs in the course of a peaceful protest. The Lambrakis assasination revealed a right-wing underworld when it was revealed the two killers had close links to the local gendarmerie, therefore roping in Karamanlis. While it is unlikely Karamanlis had any ties to the assassination, it placed the idea of an illegal \u2018para-state\u2019 on firmer ground.<ref name=\"Gallant271\">Gallant, 2015, pp. 271</ref><ref name=\"Close105\">Close, 2002, pp. 105</ref>\n\nThe crisis atmosphere was heightened when Karamanlis began having spats with King Paul over a state visit to England set to take place in the Summer of 1963. Karamanlis, after reaching no agreement with the King regarding the matter, submitted his resignation<ref name=\"Hourmouzios334-335\">Hourmouzios, 1972, pp. 334-335</ref>, and suggested that diplomatist and outgoing ERE minister, [[Panagiotis Pipinelis]], should be entrusted with the premiership and that elections should be held immediately. Paul also favoured Pipinelis because he, unlike Karamanlis, would support the proposed state visit to England. Paul refused immediate elections on the basis that he must not be abroad on the state visit in the midst of an election. Paul then summoned Papandreou and Markezinis who both agreed that a \u2018service\u2019 government enjoying the confidence of parliament should be appointed to prepare the ground for an election, as opposed to Karamanlis\u2019 view that elections should be held as soon as possible.

The 1964-1965 government headed by Papandreou enacted overdue reforms catered towards the lower and middle class by increasing pensions and prices for farmers; the system in which elections take place in the General Confederation of Greek Workers was made fairer. The government put a lot of emphasis on education by abolishing fees for universities and secondary schools; additional university teachers were appointed; a larger intake into universities was accepted; the period of compulsory education was extended to nine years from six; primary education was to be conducted completely in demotic (common) Greek which was also to have equal status to katharevousa (purified) in secondary schools. New subjects were introduced and more emphasis was put on others. Sociology and economics were added to the curriculum subjects, while importance was put on modern languages. In total, educational expenditure increased by a third in one year, and by 1967 11.6 per cent of the budget was dedicated to education<ref name=\"Close107\">Close, 2002, pp. 107</ref>. And although Papandreou viewed the left with some hostility, he released several thousands of prisoners still behind bars from the Civil War. Only about 1000 Communists remained in prison, a large decrease from its peak of about 20,000 in the early 1960s and 50s.<ref name=\"Clogg48\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 48</ref>\n\n===The July events===\n\n{{see also|Apostasia of 1965}}\n\nThe lack of cohesion between EK deputies and the leadership resulted in the collapse of the Centre Union government<ref name=\"Clogg50-53\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 50-53</ref>. A leading cause for the schism in the party was the accusation of nepotism and lust for power on the part of Georgios Papandreou. [[Andreas Papandreou]], the son of Georgios Papandreou, was appointed First Minister of State and Minister of Coordination in 1964 the same year he was elected to Parliament. Rising stars in the party, including future premier [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]], felt as though the younger Papandreou had not served his time in the party required to garner him the role of what is effectively the assistant Prime Minister. Disdain of Andreas Papandreou came to a head when in May 1965, a report written by EK deputies opposed to the Papandreous accused Andreas of collaborating with ASPIDA, a grouping of left-leaning military officers.<ref name=\"Gallant273-274\">Gallant, 2015, pp. 273-274</ref><ref name=\"Clogg50-53\"/>[[File:Andreas_Papandreou_1968.jpg|thumb|left|Andreas Papandreou.]]<ref name=\"Close107-109\">Close, 2002, pp. 107-109</ref>\n\nPapandreou and [[King Constantine II|King Constantine II]]\u2019s (Paul died in March 1964) relationship began to break down over disagreements on the handling of the armed forces<ref name=\"Gallant273-274\"/>. [[Petros Garoufalias]], a royalist Centre Union deputy, enjoyed the King\u2019s support as Minister of National Defence. In turn, Garoufalias appointed officers loyal to both the King and himself. This was not acceptable to Papandreou, whose primary goal at that point was to purge the armed forces of conspiratorial elements which were vehemently against Papandreou and even more violently against his son holding far more radical views than his aging father<ref name=\"Gallant273-274\"/>. Initially Papandreou retaliated against politically active officers by moving them as far away as possible from Athens, blocking their promotions or forcing their retirement<ref name=\"Close107-109\"/>, but he could only do so much without occupying the Defence Ministry as well as that of Premier. Papandreou, enjoying a healthy parliamentary majority, came to the King and demanded that he be made Defence Minister while holding the Premiership as well which was a prerequisite of replacing the Chief of Staff. The King refused on the grounds that Papandreou\u2019s son Andreas had yet to prove himself innocent in the ASPIDA case. In disgust, Papandreou resigned, kicking off the \u2018July events\u2019 , also known as the 'Apostasy', a stormy political crisis revolving around the resignation of Papandreou.\n\nImmediately after Papandreou\u2019s resignation, a new government headed by EK defectors disaffected with the Papandreous (the \u2018Apostates\u2019), ERE deputies and 8 deputies belonging to the Progressive Party, all loyal to the standard of Apostate Speaker [[Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas]] was formed. This government fell in August and was replaced by a new one headed by Ilias Tsirimokos which fell a few weeks later in September when it failed to receive the mandatory vote of confidence. Stefanos Stefanopoulos was then appointed who obtained a confidence vote. In total, there were 45 \u2018Apostates\u2019.<ref name=\"Clogg51\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 51</ref><ref name=\"Clogg52\"/>\n\nThe 'Apostasy' had a radicalising effect on the centre-left of the EK. This segment increasingly looked to Andreas Papandreou and at one point an abandonment from the elected leadership of Georgios Papndreou by the centre-left seemed possible.<ref name=\"Clogg52\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 52</ref>\n\nAn end to the crisis seemed in sight when on 20 December 1966, Papandreou, ERE leader [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]] and the King reached a resolution: elections would be held under a straightforward system of proportional representation where all parties participating agreed to compete, and that, in any outcome, the command structure of the army would not be altered.<ref name=\"Clogg52\"/> In the leadup to the election scheduled for 28 May 1967, the EK introduced a bill extending parliamentary immunity for the duration of the campaign aimed at protecting Andreas Papandreou who was still under scrutiny for his potential involvement in ASPIDA and in March 1967 fifteen officers charged with being involved in the ASPIDA affair were convicted.<ref name=\"Clogg52\"/> Interim Prime Minister Ioannis Paraskevopoulos resigned in the ensuing row and Kanellopoulos stepped in to fill the role of the Prime Minister until the May Election.<ref name=\"Clogg53\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 53</ref>\n\nDespite the crisis subsiding early on, on 21 April 1967, a month before the scheduled elections, a clique of relatively junior officers headed by Georgios Papadopoulos took over in a coup d'etat. Senior officials including the two Papandreous were arrested.<ref name=\"Clogg53\"/> Georgios Papandreou died on 1 November 1968 and the Centre Union, now illegal, was placed under the titular leadership of [[Georgios Mavros]].<ref name=\"Clogg56\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 56</ref>\n\n===Post-Junta===\n\nMavros reconstituted the Centre Union in 1974 as the [[Centre Union - New Forces|Centre Union - New Forces]] (Enosi Kentrou - Nees Dynameis, EK - ND).<ref name=\"Clogg64\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 64</ref> The leadership was offered to Andreas Papandreou, however, he declined the offer.<ref name=\"Clogg56\"/> Papandreou instead formed the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Panellinio Sosialistiko Kinima, PASOK)<ref name=\"Clogg64\"/> and in the 1977 election, it eclipsed the centrists as the second largest party in parliament.<ref name=\"Clogg71\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 71</ref> The Centre Union rebranded as the [[Union of the Democratic Centre]] (Enosi Dimokratikou Kentrou, EDIK) in 1976, though it failed to re-enter parliament after 1985.<ref name=\"Clogg74\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 74</ref><ref name=\"Clogg102\">Clogg, 1987, pp. 102</ref>\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n=== Hellenic Parliament elections ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[Hellenic Parliament]]\n!Election\n!Party Leader\n!'''Votes'''\n!'''%'''\n!'''Seats'''\n!+/\u2013\n!'''Position'''\n!Government\n|-\n|[[1961 Greek legislative election|1961]]\n|[[Georgios Papandreou]]\n|1,555,442\n\n{{Small|(In alliance with [[Progressive Party (Greece)|PP]])}}\n|33.66%\n|{{Composition bar|100|300|hex=orange}}\n|{{increase}} 54\n|{{increase}} 2nd\n|{{Color|red|Opposition}}\n|-\n|[[1963 Greek legislative election|1963]]\n|[[Georgios Papandreou]]\n|1,962,074\n|42.04%\n|{{Composition bar|138|300|hex=orange}}\n|{{increase}} 38\n|{{increase}} 1st\n|{{Color|purple|Minority government}}\n|-\n|[[1964 Greek legislative election|1964]]\n|[[Georgios Papandreou]]\n|2,424,477\n|35.3%\n|{{Composition bar|171|300|hex=orange}}\n|{{increase}} 33\n|{{steady}} 1st\n|{{Color|green|Government}}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Georgios Papandreou Party]]\n* [[Savas Papapolitis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n* Hourmouzios, Stelio (1972).

He started his career at the age of 17 on the Carolina [[independent circuit]] wrestling both under his real name and as \"Crusher Gray.\" He then moved on to wrestle in the Kentucky/Tennessee area, including for [[International Championship Wrestling]] (ICW), under the [[ring name]] Crusher Broomfield. Gray went in as part of a package along with Bragg, Westbrooks, and Ric Starr. One of Broomfield's major angles was that his contract was owned by ICW Champion [[Randy Savage]] and Savage's nemesis [[Ron Garvin]] defeated Savage in a match to set Broomfield free.<ref name=FieldGuide>{{cite book|last=Pope |first=Kristian |title=Tuff Stuff - Professional wrestling field guide |year=2005 |publisher=KP Books |chapter=One Man Gang (1970s-2000s) |pages=336 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-267-0}}</ref> He later worked for several [[National Wrestling Alliance]]-affiliated promotions, [[Mid-South Wrestling]], and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as One Man Gang, billed as being from [[Chicago]]'s Halsted Street on the South Side.<ref name=FieldGuide/> He was managed by [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], [[Theodore Long]], Gentleman Jim Holiday, and Sir [[Oliver Humperdink]] in various territories.\n\n===Various territories (1983\u20131986)===\nGang worked for many territories during this time for three years. His biggest success was in [[Championship Wrestling From Florida|Florida]] where he had a feud with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] from 1983 to 1984. Also he feuded with [[Blackjack Mulligan]] and [[Mike Rotunda]]. He teamed up with [[Ron Bass]] and won the [[NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version)|tag team titles]] defeating Rhodes and [[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]]. Two months alter they dropped the titles to Rotunda and Davis. In November 1984 as Panama Gang, he became the last [[NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Florida version)]] defeating Mulligan. Later the title was abandoned when Gang left the territory in 1985.\n\nThen Gang worked for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] from 1983 to 1984 and 1986 feuding with [[Giant Baba]], [[Genichiro Tenryu]] and [[Jumbo Tsuruta]]. He temaed with [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Killer Tim Brooks]] and [[Stan Hansen]]. In 1984 he teamed with Goro Tsurumi. Then in 1986 he teamed with [[Jerry Blackwell]], [[Harley Race]] an [[Tiger Jeet Singh]].\n\nDuring these years he also worked in Canada, Central States and Texas.\n\n===World Class Championship Wrestling (1985\u20131986)===\nIn the regional territories, he was a member of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s \"Devastation Inc.\" as well as working with [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW). He would feud with [[Von Erich family|The Von Erichs]] teaming with [[Rick Rude]]. Also he feuded in singles competition against [[Kerry Von Erich]], [[King Parsons]], [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], and [[Bruiser Brody]].\n\nOn May 5, 1985 he lost to Kerry Von Erich in a hair vs hair match at the [[2nd Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions]] where he started sporting a mohawk.

Making his debut in the territory by interfering in matches and assaulting the [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], Mid-South announcer [[Bill Watts]] would say about the then-unnamed assailant \"He's a one-man gang!\".<ref name=FieldGuide/> The Gang worked on-and-off in Mid-South in between tours of [[Florida]], [[Toronto]], [[Japan]], and [[Texas]]. He would also return to his hometown territory, the Carolinas, to work for [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], where he was initially billed as \"The One Man Gang, George Gray.\" He worked in Texas All Star wrestling where he feuded with Big Bubba. It was on his last tour for Mid-South when the promotion renamed itself the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], with Gang one of its top [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], feuding at the main-event level with UWF top fan favorite [[Jim Duggan]]. In late 1986, Gang won the UWF Heavyweight Championship in an angle where the champion [[Terry Gordy]] was injured earlier in the evening by a revenge-minded [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Gang, scheduled to face Gordy later on the card, was awarded the belt via forfeit. He held that title for six months, mostly facing Duggan, Williams, and [[Ted DiBiase]].<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\nIn May 1987, Gray began receiving enquiries from the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] about coming up to wrestle for them. He promptly agreed to terms, but returned to the UWF in order to drop the title to [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Bubba Rogers]], who was there from his normal place in the NWA due to the recent sale of the UWF to [[Jim Crockett]].<ref name=UWFWorld/>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n\n====One Man Gang (1987\u20131988)====\nGray made his debut in the WWF on May 12, 1987, being managed by [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], in a match against Jesse Cortez. He spent much of his early WWF run defeating enhancement talent in extremely short matches in order to build him up, most notably in a match where he [[Suplex#Inverted suplex slam|Gourdbustered]] his opponent after the bell and then did the same to the referee, thus being ([[kayfabe]]) fined [[United States dollar|$]]10,000 for his actions. While the Gang often defeated enhancement talent and other lower card wrestlers with ease, he was often on the end of defeat when main eventing against bigger stars such as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]], although Gang was a major part of the angle regarding [[Superstar Billy Graham|Billy Graham]] being forced into retirement.<ref name=FieldGuide/> One Man Gang participated in the first ever [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] [[pay-per-view]] as a member of [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]]'s team, fighting a team led by Hulk Hogan.

An episode of ''WWF Superstars'', which aired on September 24, 1988, featured a vignette with [[Gene Okerlund]] on-location in an American ghetto that was dubbed \"The Deepest Darkest Parts Of Africa,\" where dancers dressed as tribal Africans danced and chanted around a fire; Slick then announced that Gang would be known by his new name, \"Akeem, the African Dream\", though Okerlund immediately called him out as the One Man Gang.

They were also strongly involved in the storyline which would eventually cause Randy Savage to become a villain and defend his title against Hulk Hogan at [[WrestleMania V]].<ref name=WM5>{{cite news|title=2008 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards: WrestleMania V| publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2008|page=116}}</ref> In the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|Royal Rumble]], Randy Savage was accidentally eliminated by teammate Hogan, allowing both Akeem and Bossman to double team Hogan and eliminate him.

During the match, Savage's manager (and real life wife) [[Miss Elizabeth]] was injured after Savage was thrown through the ropes and knocked her to the ground, which led Hogan to abandon his partner and carry Elizabeth back to the locker room for medical help.

He started his career at the age of 17 on the Carolina [[independent circuit]] wrestling both under his real name and as \"Crusher Gray.\" He then moved on to wrestle in the Kentucky/Tennessee area, including for [[International Championship Wrestling]] (ICW), under the [[ring name]] Crusher Broomfield. Gray went in as part of a package along with Bragg, Westbrooks, and Ric Starr. One of Broomfield's major angles was that his contract was owned by ICW Champion [[Randy Savage]] and Savage's nemesis [[Ron Garvin]] defeated Savage in a match to set Broomfield free.<ref name=FieldGuide>{{cite book|last=Pope |first=Kristian |title=Tuff Stuff - Professional wrestling field guide |year=2005 |publisher=KP Books |chapter=One Man Gang (1970s-2000s) |pages=336 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-267-0}}</ref> He later worked for several [[National Wrestling Alliance]]-affiliated promotions, [[Mid-South Wrestling]], and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as One Man Gang, billed as being from [[Chicago]]'s Halsted Street on the South Side.<ref name=FieldGuide/> He was managed by [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], [[Theodore Long]], Gentleman Jim Holiday, and Sir [[Oliver Humperdink]] in various territories.\n\n===Various territories (1983\u20131986)===\nGang worked for many territories during this time for three years. His biggest success was in [[Championship Wrestling From Florida|Florida]] where he had a feud with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] from 1983 to 1984. Also he feuded with [[Blackjack Mulligan]] and [[Mike Rotunda]]. He teamed up with [[Ron Bass]] and won the [[NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version)|tag team titles]] defeating Rhodes and [[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]]. Two months alter they dropped the titles to Rotunda and Davis. In November 1984 as Panama Gang, he became the last [[NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Florida version)]] defeating Mulligan. Later the title was abandoned when Gang left the territory in 1985.\n\nThen Gang worked for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] from 1983 to 1984 and 1986 feuding with [[Giant Baba]], [[Genichiro Tenryu]] and [[Jumbo Tsuruta]]. He temaed with [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Killer Tim Brooks]] and [[Stan Hansen]]. In 1984 he teamed with Goro Tsurumi. Then in 1986 he teamed with [[Jerry Blackwell]], [[Harley Race]] an [[Tiger Jeet Singh]].\n\nDuring these years he also worked in Canada, Central States and Texas.\n\n===World Class Championship Wrestling (1985\u20131986)===\nIn the regional territories, he was a member of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s \"Devastation Inc.\" as well as working with [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW). He would feud with [[Von Erich family|The Von Erichs]] teaming with [[Rick Rude]]. Also he feuded in singles competition against [[Kerry Von Erich]], [[King Parsons]], [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], and [[Bruiser Brody]].\n\nOn May 5, 1985 he lost to Kerry Von Erich in a hair vs hair match at the [[2nd Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions]] where he started sporting a mohawk.

Making his debut in the territory by interfering in matches and assaulting the [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], Mid-South announcer [[Bill Watts]] would say about the then-unnamed assailant \"He's a one-man gang!\".<ref name=FieldGuide/> The Gang worked on-and-off in Mid-South in between tours of [[Florida]], [[Toronto]], [[Japan]], and [[Texas]]. He would also return to his hometown territory, the Carolinas, to work for [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], where he was initially billed as \"The One Man Gang, George Gray.\" He worked in Texas All Star wrestling where he feuded with Big Bubba. It was on his last tour for Mid-South when the promotion renamed itself the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], with Gang one of its top [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], feuding at the main-event level with UWF top fan favorite [[Jim Duggan]]. In late 1986, Gang won the UWF Heavyweight Championship in an angle where the champion [[Terry Gordy]] was injured earlier in the evening by a revenge-minded [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Gang, scheduled to face Gordy later on the card, was awarded the belt via forfeit. He held that title for six months, mostly facing Duggan, Williams, and [[Ted DiBiase]].<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\nIn May 1987, Gray began receiving enquiries from the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] about coming up to wrestle for them. He promptly agreed to terms, but returned to the UWF in order to drop the title to [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Bubba Rogers]], who was there from his normal place in the NWA due to the recent sale of the UWF to [[Jim Crockett]].<ref name=UWFWorld/>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n\n====One Man Gang (1987\u20131988)====\nGray made his debut in the WWF on May 12, 1987, being managed by [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], in a match against Jesse Cortez. He spent much of his early WWF run defeating enhancement talent in extremely short matches in order to build him up, most notably in a match where he [[Suplex#Inverted suplex slam|Gourdbustered]] his opponent after the bell and then did the same to the referee, thus being ([[kayfabe]]) fined [[United States dollar|$]]10,000 for his actions. While the Gang often defeated enhancement talent and other lower card wrestlers with ease, he was often on the end of defeat when main eventing against bigger stars such as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]], although Gang was a major part of the angle regarding [[Superstar Billy Graham|Billy Graham]] being forced into retirement.<ref name=FieldGuide/> One Man Gang participated in the first ever [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] [[pay-per-view]] as a member of [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]]'s team, fighting a team led by Hulk Hogan.

An episode of ''WWF Superstars'', which aired on September 24, 1988, featured a vignette with [[Gene Okerlund]] on-location in an American ghetto that was dubbed \"The Deepest Darkest Parts Of Africa,\" where dancers dressed as tribal Africans danced and chanted around a fire; Slick then announced that Gang would be known by his new name, \"Akeem, the African Dream\", though Okerlund immediately called him out as the One Man Gang.

During the match, Savage's manager (and real life wife) [[Miss Elizabeth]] was injured after Savage was thrown through the ropes and knocked her to the ground, which led Hogan to abandon his partner and carry Elizabeth back to the locker room for medical help.

He was promoted to be part of the infamous \"Chamber of Horrors\" match at [[Halloween Havoc (1991)|Halloween Havoc '91]] in October, but was fired by [[Jim Herd]] in September for refusing to lose to [[P.N.
