Another reason the church has gained greater acceptance is that it has taken on several universally accepted causes such as the importance of family values in society and the formation of the Interreligious and International Peace Council.

Another reason the church has gained greater acceptance is that it has taken on several universally accepted causes such as the importance of family values in society and the formation of the Interreligious and International Peace Council.

There was also a second Armenian church, and two Armenian schools which served the Armenian community, which numbered about 3,000 in the census of 1913.\n\nExcavations on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea, opposite to Derbent, revealed the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]], the eastern counterpart to the wall and fortifications of Derbent. Similar [[Sassanian]] defensive fortifications there\u2014massive forts, garrison towns, long walls\u2014also run from the sea to the mountains.\n\nThe Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] lived in Derbent and brought it into great repute as a seat of the arts and commerce. According to Arab historians, Derbent, with population exceeding 50,000, was the largest city of the 9th century Caucasus. In the 10th century, with the collapse of the Arab Caliphate, Derbent became the capital of an emirate. This emirate often fought losing wars with the neighboring Christian state of [[Sarir]], allowing Sarir to manipulate Derbent's politics on occasion. Despite that, the emirate outlived its rival and continued to flourish at the time of the [[Mongol]] invasion in 1239. In the 14th century, Derbent was occupied by [[Timur]]'s armies.\n\n===Shirvanshah era===\nThe [[Shirvanshah]]s dynasty existed as independent or a [[vassal]] state, from 861 until 1538; longer than any other dynasty in the [[Islamic world]]. They were renowned for their cultural achievements and geopolitical pursuits. The rulers of Shirvan, called the Shirvanshahs, had attempted, and on numerous times, succeeded, to conquer Derbend since the 18th Shirvanshah king, [[Afridun I]], was appointed as the governor of the city. Over the centuries the city changed hands often. The 21st Shirvanshah king, [[Akhsitan I]], briefly reconquered the city. However, the city was lost once again to the northern [[Kipchaks]].\n\nAfter the Timurud invasion, [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan]], the 33rd Shirvanshah, managed to keep the kingdom of Shirvan independent. Ibrahim I revived Shirvan's fortunes, and through his cunning politics managed to continue without paying tribute. Furthermore, Ibrahim also greatly increased the limits of his state. He conquered the city of Derbend in 1437. The Shirvanshahs integrated the city so closely with their political structure that a new branch of the Shirvan dynasty emerged from Derbend, the Derbenid dynasty. The Derbenid dynasty, being a cadet dynasty of Shirvan, inherited the throne of Shirvan in the 15th century.\n\nIn the early 16th century the kingdom of Shirvan was conquered by [[Shah Ismail]] of the Safavid dynasty. As Shah Ismail incorporated all the Shirvan possessions, he also inherited Derbend.\n\n===Russian annexation===\nDerbent stayed under [[History of Iran|Iranian]] rule, while occasionally briefly taken by the [[Ottoman Turks]] such as in 1583 after the [[Battle of Torches]] and the [[Treaty of Istanbul (1590)|Treaty of Istanbul]], till the course of the 19th century, when the Russians occupied the city and wider Iranian-ruled swaths of Dagestan.<ref name=\"Swietochowski Borderland\">{{cite book |last=Swietochowski |first=Tadeusz |authorlink=Tadeusz Swietochowski |year=1995 |title=Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition |pages=69, 133 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfRYRwAACAAJ&dq=Russia+and+Iran+in+the+great+game:+travelogues+and+orientalism |isbn=978-0-231-07068-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=L.

The fortress was built under direction of the Sassanid emperor [[Khosrow I|Khosrow (Chosroes) I]].<ref name=\"The Jews of Khazatia\"/>\n\nA large portion of the walls and several watchtowers still remain in reasonable shape. The walls, reaching to the sea, date from the 6th century, [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid dynasty]] period. The city has a well-preserved citadel (Narin-kala), enclosing an area of {{convert|4.5|ha}}, enclosed by strong walls. Historical attractions include the baths, the cisterns, the old cemeteries, the caravanserai, the 18th-century Khan's mausoleum, as well as several mosques. The oldest mosque is the Juma Mosque, built over a 6th-century Christian basilica; it has a 15th-century [[madrasa]].

There was also a second Armenian church, and two Armenian schools which served the Armenian community, which numbered about 3,000 in the census of 1913.\n\nExcavations on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea, opposite to Derbent, revealed the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]], the eastern counterpart to the wall and fortifications of Derbent. Similar [[Sassanian]] defensive fortifications there\u2014massive forts, garrison towns, long walls\u2014also run from the sea to the mountains.\n\nThe Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] lived in Derbent and brought it into great repute as a seat of the arts and commerce. According to Arab historians, Derbent, with population exceeding 50,000, was the largest city of the 9th century Caucasus. In the 10th century, with the collapse of the Arab Caliphate, Derbent became the capital of an emirate. This emirate often fought losing wars with the neighboring Christian state of [[Sarir]], allowing Sarir to manipulate Derbent's politics on occasion. Despite that, the emirate outlived its rival and continued to flourish at the time of the [[Mongol]] invasion in 1239. In the 14th century, Derbent was occupied by [[Timur]]'s armies.\n\n===Shirvanshah era===\nThe [[Shirvanshah]]s dynasty existed as independent or a [[vassal]] state, from 861 until 1538; longer than any other dynasty in the [[Islamic world]]. They were renowned for their cultural achievements and geopolitical pursuits. The rulers of Shirvan, called the Shirvanshahs, had attempted, and on numerous times, succeeded, to conquer Derbend since the 18th Shirvanshah king, [[Afridun I]], was appointed as the governor of the city. Over the centuries the city changed hands often. The 21st Shirvanshah king, [[Akhsitan I]], briefly reconquered the city. However, the city was lost once again to the northern [[Kipchaks]].\n\nAfter the Timurud invasion, [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan]], the 33rd Shirvanshah, managed to keep the kingdom of Shirvan independent. Ibrahim I revived Shirvan's fortunes, and through his cunning politics managed to continue without paying tribute. Furthermore, Ibrahim also greatly increased the limits of his state. He conquered the city of Derbend in 1437. The Shirvanshahs integrated the city so closely with their political structure that a new branch of the Shirvan dynasty emerged from Derbend, the Derbenid dynasty. The Derbenid dynasty, being a cadet dynasty of Shirvan, inherited the throne of Shirvan in the 15th century.\n\nIn the early 16th century the kingdom of Shirvan was conquered by [[Shah Ismail]] of the Safavid dynasty. As Shah Ismail incorporated all the Shirvan possessions, he also inherited Derbend.\n\n===Russian annexation===\nDerbent stayed under [[History of Iran|Iranian]] rule, while occasionally briefly taken by the [[Ottoman Turks]] such as in 1583 after the [[Battle of Torches]] and the [[Treaty of Istanbul (1590)|Treaty of Istanbul]], till the course of the 19th century, when the Russians occupied the city and wider Iranian-ruled swaths of Dagestan.<ref name=\"Swietochowski Borderland\">{{cite book |last=Swietochowski |first=Tadeusz |authorlink=Tadeusz Swietochowski |year=1995 |title=Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition |pages=69, 133 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfRYRwAACAAJ&dq=Russia+and+Iran+in+the+great+game:+travelogues+and+orientalism |isbn=978-0-231-07068-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=L.

Nadir Shah of Persia forced many Jews to adopt Islam. After the Russian conquest, many Jews of rural Dagestan fled to Derbent, which became the spiritual center of the [[Mountain Jews]]. The Jewish population numbered 2,200 in 1897 (15% of total population) and 3,500 in 1903.

It is the center of Russian [[brandy]] production. The educational infrastructure includes a university as well as several technical schools. On the cultural front, there is a Lezgin drama theater (named after S. Stalsky). About two kilometers ({{convert|2|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from the city is the vacation colony of Chayka (Seagull).\n\nThe Soviet novelist [[Yury Krymov]] named a fictional motor tanker after the city in his book ''[[Yury Krymov#Tanker \"Derbent\"|The Tanker \"Derbent\"]]''.\n\n===Citadel of Derbend===\n{{main|Fortifications of Derbent}}\n[[File:\u041a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u041d\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d-\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430. \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0442.jpg|thumb|Sassanid Fortress Naryn-Kala (Derbent).]]\nDerbent resembles a huge museum and has magnificent mountains and shore nearby, and therefore possesses much touristic potential, further increased by [[UNESCO]]'s classification of the citadel, ancient city and fortress as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2003; however, instability in the region has halted development.\n\nThe current fortification and walls were built by the Persian [[Sassanian Empire]] as a defensive structure against hostile nomadic people in the north, and continuously repaired or improved by later Arab, Mongol, Timurid, Shirvan and Iranian kingdoms until the early course of the 19th century, as long as its military function lasted. The fortress was built under direction of the Sassanid emperor [[Khosrow I|Khosrow (Chosroes) I]].<ref name=\"The Jews of Khazatia\"/>\n\nA large portion of the walls and several watchtowers still remain in reasonable shape. The walls, reaching to the sea, date from the 6th century, [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid dynasty]] period. The city has a well-preserved citadel (Narin-kala), enclosing an area of {{convert|4.5|ha}}, enclosed by strong walls. Historical attractions include the baths, the cisterns, the old cemeteries, the caravanserai, the 18th-century Khan's mausoleum, as well as several mosques. The oldest mosque is the Juma Mosque, built over a 6th-century Christian basilica; it has a 15th-century [[madrasa]]. Other shrines include the 17th-century Kyrhlyar mosque, the Bala mosque and the 18th-century Chertebe mosque.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Shahriyar of Derbent]], Sasanian commander\n*[[Bella Nisan]], ophthalmologist\n*[[Igor Yusufov]], politician\n*[[Israel Tsvaygenbaum]], artist\n*[[Mushail Mushailov]], artist and teacher\n*[[Sergey Izgiyayev]], poet, playwright, and translator of Mountain Jewish descent\n*[[Suleyman Kerimov]], businessman, investor, and politician\n*[[Tamara Musakhanova]], sculptor and ceramist\n*[[Yagutil Mishiev]], writer\n*[[Sevil Novruzova]], lawyer\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Russia}}\n\nDerbent is [[sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u044b|url=http://derbent.ru/city/pobratimy/|website=derbent.ru|publisher=Derbent|language=ru|accessdate=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|AZE}} [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], Azerbaijan\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]], United States\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Hadera]], Israel\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Kronstadt]], Russia\n<!--Pskov - not twining-->\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:\u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f (\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0442).jpg|The old Armenian Church, now used as a venue and Museum\nFile:\u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435.png|Russian Orthodox Church of the Intercession\nFile:\u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438. \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0442.jpg|Memorial of the grieving mother\nFile:\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d-\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430. \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0442.jpg|Walls of the [[Naryn-Kala|Citadel]]\nFile:\u0428\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u2116 15 \u0432 \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435.png|School number 15\nFile:Vladimir Putin and Ramazan Abdulatipov (2015-11-03) 02.jpg|Putin visiting an exhibition dedicated to the 2000th anniversary of Derbent in the State Historical Museum\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{RussiaAdmMunRef|da|adm|law}}\n*{{RussiaAdmMunRef|da|mun|list}}\n*''Some text used with permission from [http://www.travel-images.com www.travel-images.com].

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8{{nbsp}}million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels.

The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations.

showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8{{nbsp}}million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

{"title_page": "Adam LeBor", "text_new": "{{Third-party|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n\n'''Adam LeBor''' is a British author, journalist, writing coach and editorial trainer. Born in London in 1961, LeBor has worked as a foreign correspondent since 1991. He covered the collapse of Communism and the Yugoslav wars for ''The Independent ''and ''The Times'' and has worked in more than thirty countries. He currently contributes to the ''Economist'', the ''Financial Times'', the ''New York Times'', ''Monocle'' and numerous other publications. He works as an editorial trainer and writing coach at the ''Financial Times, Citywire, Monocle'' and several financial institutions including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He teaches creative writing, focusing on the thriller genre, for the Arvon Foundation.\n\nLeBor has written eight critically acclaimed non-fiction books, including ''Hitler's Secret Bankers'', which exposed Swiss complicity with the Nazis and which was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize, a biography of Slobodan Milosevic, and ''City of Oranges'', an account of Jewish and Arab families in Jaffa, which was shortlisted for the Jewish Quarterly Prize. He has written six novels including ''District VIII'' and ''Kossuth Square'', the first two volumes of a series featuring Balthazar Kovacs, a Gypsy detective in the Budapest police murder squad, and a trilogy of thrillers featuring Yael Azoulay, a former Mossad agent who works as the secret negotiator for the United Nations Secretary General. His books have been published in fourteen languages.\n\n==The Balthazar Kovacs Gypsy detective Budapest noir crime series==\nLeBor is currently writing a series of novels featuring Balthazar Kovacs, a Gypsy detective in the Budapest murder squad. The first volume, ''District VIII,'' was published in 2017 by Head of Zeus. It unfolds over three days during the summer 2015 migrant crisis. A Syrian refugee who was camping out at Keleti station is murdered, then his body disappears. Kovacs is warned off the case by a former police colleague now working for the Gendarmerie, a new paramilitary police force. But he refuses to take heed and works off the books to track down the killer. Kovacs is soon drawn into a dangerous web of people-traffickers, high-level corruption and Islamic radicals using the refugee crisis to transit through Hungary - a dark web in which his brother Gaspar, the city's most powerful pimp, is deeply implicated.\n\nThe second volume, ''Kossuth Square'', was published in April 2019 by Head of Zeus. It follows straight on from ''District VIII'' and the story unfolds over the following weekend. The sinister forces that Kovacs defeated in ''District VIII'' are back and are now planning to wreak a terrible revenge, not just on Kovacs, but all of downtown Budapest. Once again, Kovacs has to choose: between the rule of law and justice and his loyalty to his own family. The ''Daily Mail'' described Kossuth Square as 'an elegant, atmospheric tale that twists and surprises at every turn.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-6888261/CRIME.html|title=CRIME|last=Wansell|first=Geoffrey|date=4 April 2019|website=Mail Online|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Balthazar Kovacs series has been optioned for television by Kindle Entertainment, a London-based television production company. LeBor is now working on the third volume, provisionally titled ''Margaret Bridge''.\n\n==The Yael Azoulay international thriller series==\nLeBor has written a trilogy of thrillers set in the United Nations featuring Yael Azoulay, a former Mossad agent.  Yael works as the covert negotiator for the secretary-general, brokering the secret deals that keep the wheels of superpower diplomacy turning - and the global corporations in business. The series was inspired by the Biblical character of Yael, who killed the Canaanite general Sisera, and LeBor's time as a reporter covering the Yugoslav wars when he encountered U.N. officials and peacekeeping troops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/a-biblical-inspiration-for-a-modern-thriller/|title=A modern thriller with biblical roots|last=Lebor|first=Adam|date=13 May 2013|website=[[Times of Israel]]|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Yael Azoulay series also draws on LeBor's non-fiction book ''Complicity with Evil: The United Nations in the Age of Modern Genocide'', which investigates the U.N.'s failure to stop the genocides in Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur. ''Complicity with Evil'' takes its title from a U.N. report examining the organisation's role during these crises. The book focuses on the role of U.N. officials. The Yael Azoulay series explores the ethical and political dilemmas faced by U.N. officials under conditions of extreme stress and pressure.\n\nThe first volume in the Yael Azoulay series, ''The Geneva Option'', was published in summer 2013 by HarperCollins in the United States and by Telegram in Britain. The plot is based on a conspiracy by French, German and Israeli companies to take over global supplies of Coltan, a mineral essential for the production of computers and mobile telephones. Yael discovers that the corporations plan to use the United Nations as a front to foment a new genocide in Africa.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Geneva Option|last=LeBor|first=Adam|publisher=Harper Paperbacks|year=2013|isbn=9780062208552|series=Yael Azoulay Series|volume=1}}</ref>\n\n''The Washington Stratagem'', the second volume, was published by HarperCollins US in November 2014 and was published by Head of Zeus in Britain in spring 2015. The story unfolds in Washington D.C. and Istanbul. Yael is tasked by the secretary-general with negotiating with the man at the centre of the American military industrial complex. Instead she discovers a complex conspiracy that reaches from Washington D.C. to Tehran, one that aims to assassinate Renee Freshwater, the first female president of the USA.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Washington Stratagem|last=LeBor|first=Adam|publisher=Bourbon Street Books|year=2014|isbn=9780062330017|series=Yael Azoulay Series|volume=2}}</ref>\n\n''The Istanbul Exchange'', a free downloadable e-book novella, was published by HarperCollins US in spring 2013.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Istanbul Exchange: A Yael Azoulay Short Story|last=LeBor|first=Adam|publisher=Bourbon Street Books|year=2013|isbn=9780062301932}}</ref>\n\nThe third volume, ''The Reykjavik Assignment'', was published by HarperCollins US and Head of Zeus in 2016. Yael is sent to Reykjavik to broker a secret meeting between President Freshwater and her Iranian counterpart, in an attempt to head off a new war in the Middle East. Both leaders want peace but they have powerful enemies in their own countries who are determined that conflict will keep them in power and riches. The series has been highly praised for the complexity of its characters, Yael most of all, and the grey ethical areas in which she is forced to operate.\n\n==The Budapest Protocol==\nLeBor's first novel, ''The Budapest Protocol'', was first published in 2009 by Reportage Press and republished by Beautiful Books in 2011. The book opens in the Budapest ghetto in the winter of 1944 as the Red Army advances, then jumps to the present day during the election campaign for the first President of Europe. The story features Alex Farkas, a foreign correspondent based in Budapest, who discovers that the European election campaign is the culmination of a secret conspiracy by the Nazis in the dying days of the war to regroup and take power decades later.\n\nThe book was partly inspired by a US military intelligence document, Intelligence Report EW-Pa 128, dated 27 November 1944, datelined London, which was declassified by the US National Archives in 1996. The document, known as the Red House Report, also featured in LeBor's non-fiction work, ''Hitler's Secret Bankers''. The Red House Report is based on information supplied by an agent of French intelligence, who attended a meeting of Nazi officials and German industrialists at the Maison Rouge (Red House) hotel in Strasbourg on 10 August 1944. The report, a copy of which is included in ''The Budapest Protocol'', outlines the industrialists' plans for the post-war resurrection of Germany. While some have questioned the document's authenticity, it includes the date of declassification, 6 May 1996, and the authorisation code: NND765055.\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration archivist Tom McAnear identified the series (NND 765055) noting that it refers to over 2,000 boxes and declared that without more information in the way of a citation there is no way to easily locate this document or verify authenticity.\n\n== Non-fiction works ==\n''Tower of Basel: The Shadowy History of the Secret Bank that Runs the World,'' published in 2013, is the first investigative history of the [[Bank for International Settlements]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Tower of Basel|url=http://www.adamlebor.com/books/tower_of_basel/|accessdate=29 December 2013|edition=Hardcover|year=2013|publisher=[[PublicAffairs]]|location=New York City|isbn=161039254X}}</ref>\n\nLeBor co-wrote and presented ''Jaffa Stories'', a [[documentary]] for the [[BBC]] based on his book ''City of Oranges''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/authors/adam-lebor/|title=Adam LeBor|website=The Nation|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://adamlebor.com}}\n{{external links|date=November 2012}}\n*[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179902/Revealed-The-secret-report-shows-Nazis-planned-Fourth-Reich--EU.html Daily Mail article]\n*[http://www.newcriterion.com/posts.cfm/The-Red-House-Report-5863 The New Criterion article]\n{{Clear}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lebor, Adam}}\n[[Category:English writers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1961 births]]\n", "text_old": "{{Third-party|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n\n'''Adam LeBor''' is a British author, journalist, writing coach and editorial trainer.
