He is also a Senior Scholar with the [[Levy Economics Institute]] of [[Bard College]] and part of the executive committee of the World Economics Association, created in 2011.\n\n== Background ==\nGalbraith is a son of the renowned economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and  [[Catherine Galbraith|Catherine (Kitty) Atwater Galbraith]] and is the brother of the former diplomat, commentator and 2016 Vermont gubernatorial candidate [[Peter W.

Galbraith heads up the ''University of Texas Inequality Project'' (''UTIP''), which has been described by economic historian [[Robert Skidelsky|Lord Skidelsky]] as \"pioneering inequality measurement\".<ref name = \"return\">{{cite book | author-link = Robert Skidelsky | first = Robert | last = Skidelsky | title = Keynes: The return of the Master | year = 2009 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/keynesreturnofma0000skid/page/124 124, 125] | isbn = 978-1-84614-258-1 | publisher = Allen Lane | url = https://archive.org/details/keynesreturnofma0000skid/page/124 }}</ref> ''UTIP'' is also noted for replacing the established [[Gini coefficient]] with the [[Theil index]] as the measurement of choice for comparing inequality between groups, regions and countries.<ref name = \"return\" />\n\nIn March 2008 Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack on the [[Washington Consensus]] on [[free market]] policies, especially the [[monetarism|monetarist]] version.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://utip.gov.utexas.edu/papers/CollapseofMonetarismdelivered.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | title = The Collapse of Monetarism and the Irrelevance of the New Monetary Consensus | publisher = The University of Texas | first = James K | last = Galbraith | accessdate =February 29, 2009}}</ref> He argued strongly that Keynesian economics offered a solution to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|financial crisis that started in 2007]] whereas monetarist policies would deepen the recession. Towards the end of 2008 policy makers around the world began acting in line with Galbraith\u2019s recommendations, as part of the  [[2008\u20132009 Keynesian resurgence|Keynesian resurgence]] described  by the ''Financial Times'' as \"a stunning reversal of the orthodoxy of the past several decades\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ft.com/content/8a3d8122-d5da-11dd-a9cc-000077b07658 | title = The undeniable shift to Keynes | publisher = The Financial Times | first1 = Chris | last1 = Giles | first2 = Ralph | last2 = Atkins | first3 = Krishna | last3 = Guha | location = London, Frankfurt, Washington | accessdate =January 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 he edited an edition of his father's works for the  [[Library of America]] series.<ref>{{Citation | first = John Kenneth | last = Galbraith | title = The Affluent Society and Other Writings 1952\u20131967 | editor-first = James K | editor-last = Galbraith | place = New York | publisher = The Library of America | year = 2010 | ISBN = 978-1-59853-077-3}}</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nGalbraith's books include {{Citation | title = Balancing Acts: Technology, Finance and the American Future | year = 1989}}; {{Citation | title = Created Unequal: The Crisis in American Pay | year = 1998}}; {{Citation | title = Inequality and Industrial Change: A Global View | year = 2001}}, co-edited with Maureen Berner; and {{Citation | title = [[The Predator State]] | year = 2008}}.

His op-ed pieces have appeared in {{Citation | title = [[The New York Times]]}}, {{Citation | title = The [[Washington Post]]}}, {{Citation | title = [[Boston Globe]]}} and other  newspapers.\n\nGalbraith argues that modern America has fallen prey to a wealthy, government-controlling \"predatory class\":\n{{quote |Today, the signature of modern American capitalism is neither benign competition, nor class struggle, nor an inclusive middle-class utopia. Instead, predation has become the dominant feature \u2014 a system wherein the rich have come to feast on decaying systems built for the middle class. The predatory class is not the whole of the wealthy; it may be opposed by many others of similar wealth. But it is the defining feature, the leading force. And its agents are in full control of the government under which we live.<ref>{{cite web | first = James K | last = Galbraith |url= https://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2006/05/predator_state.html | title= Predator State |date=June 2006 |publisher=Mother Jones |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nGalbraith is also highly critical of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration's foreign policy apropos of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq invasion]]:\n{{quote |There is a reason for the vulnerability of empires. To maintain one against opposition requires war \u2014 steady, unrelenting, unending war. And war is ruinous \u2014 from a legal, moral and economic point of view. It can ruin the losers, such as Napoleonic France, or Imperial Germany in 1918. And it can ruin the victors, as it did the British and the Soviets in the 20th century. Conversely, Germany and Japan recovered well from World War II, in part because they were spared reparations and did not have to waste national treasure on defense in the aftermath of defeat...  The real economic cost of Bush's empire building is twofold: It diverts attention from pressing economic problems at home and it sets the United States on a long-term imperial path that is economically ruinous.}}\n\nMuch like [[John Kenneth Galbraith|his father]] in writing ''[[A Tenured Professor]]'', the junior Galbraith is also a critic of his own profession:\n{{Quote |Leading active members of today's economics profession, the generation presently in their 40s and 50s, have joined together into a kind of politburo for correct economic thinking. As a general rule \u2014 as one might expect from a gentleman's club \u2014 this has placed them on the wrong side of every important policy issue, and not just recently but for decades. They predict disaster where none occurs.  They deny the possibility of events that then happen. They offer a \"rape is like the weather\" fatalism about an \"inevitable\" problem (pay inequality) that then starts to recede.  They oppose the most basic, decent, and sensible reforms, while offering placebos instead.  They are always surprised when something untoward (like a recession) actually occurs. And when finally they sense that some position cannot be sustained, they do not re-examine their ideas. Instead, they simply change the subject.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_economists_got_it_wrong | title = How the Economists got it wrong | publisher = Prospect | date = November 30, 2002 | accessdate = May 6, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810202347/http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_economists_got_it_wrong | archive-date = August 10, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>}}\n\n== Humanitarian initiatives ==\nGalbraith is the Chairman of [[Economists for Peace and Security]], formerly known as Economists Against the Arms Race and later Economists Allied for Arms Reduction (ECAAR), an international association of professional economists concerned with peace and security issues.\n\nIn 2009, he joined the project for ''[[Steve Killelea|Soldiers of Peace]]'', a documentary for global peace and against all wars,  which has won various awards in film festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofpeacemovie.com/about/the-cast/23/james-galbraith/ |title=James K.

Instead, predation has become the dominant feature \u2014 a system wherein the rich have come to feast on decaying systems built for the middle class. The predatory class is not the whole of the wealthy; it may be opposed by many others of similar wealth. But it is the defining feature, the leading force. And its agents are in full control of the government under which we live.<ref>{{cite web | first = James K | last = Galbraith |url= https://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2006/05/predator_state.html | title= Predator State |date=June 2006 |publisher=Mother Jones |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nGalbraith is also highly critical of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration's foreign policy apropos of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq invasion]]:\n{{quote |There is a reason for the vulnerability of empires. To maintain one against opposition requires war \u2014 steady, unrelenting, unending war. And war is ruinous \u2014 from a legal, moral and economic point of view. It can ruin the losers, such as Napoleonic France, or Imperial Germany in 1918. And it can ruin the victors, as it did the British and the Soviets in the 20th century. Conversely, Germany and Japan recovered well from World War II, in part because they were spared reparations and did not have to waste national treasure on defense in the aftermath of defeat...  The real economic cost of Bush's empire building is twofold: It diverts attention from pressing economic problems at home and it sets the United States on a long-term imperial path that is economically ruinous.}}\n\nMuch like [[John Kenneth Galbraith|his father]] in writing ''[[A Tenured Professor]]'', the junior Galbraith is also a critic of his own profession:\n{{Quote |Leading active members of today's economics profession, the generation presently in their 40s and 50s, have joined together into a kind of politburo for correct economic thinking. As a general rule \u2014 as one might expect from a gentleman's club \u2014 this has placed them on the wrong side of every important policy issue, and not just recently but for decades. They predict disaster where none occurs.  They deny the possibility of events that then happen. They offer a \"rape is like the weather\" fatalism about an \"inevitable\" problem (pay inequality) that then starts to recede.  They oppose the most basic, decent, and sensible reforms, while offering placebos instead.  They are always surprised when something untoward (like a recession) actually occurs. And when finally they sense that some position cannot be sustained, they do not re-examine their ideas. Instead, they simply change the subject.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_economists_got_it_wrong | title = How the Economists got it wrong | publisher = Prospect | date = November 30, 2002 | accessdate = May 6, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810202347/http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_economists_got_it_wrong | archive-date = August 10, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>}}\n\n== Humanitarian initiatives ==\nGalbraith is the Chairman of [[Economists for Peace and Security]], formerly known as Economists Against the Arms Race and later Economists Allied for Arms Reduction (ECAAR), an international association of professional economists concerned with peace and security issues.\n\nIn 2009, he joined the project for ''[[Steve Killelea|Soldiers of Peace]]'', a documentary for global peace and against all wars,  which has won various awards in film festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofpeacemovie.com/about/the-cast/23/james-galbraith/ |title=James K.

{"title_page": "Somers Isles Company", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe '''Somers Isles Company''' (fully, the '''Company of the City of London for the Plantacion of The Somers Isles''' or the '''Company of The Somers Isles''') was formed in 1615 to operate the [[English colonial empire|English colony]] of the Somers Isles, also known as [[Bermuda]], as a commercial venture. It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier. Somers had deliberately driven the ship onto the reefs to prevent its foundering, thereby saving all aboard.<ref>Woodward, Hobson. ''A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest''. Viking (2009) pp. 32\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610.

As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

It features [[dual ignition|dual]] [[capacitor discharge ignition]], liquid-cooled cylinder heads and air-cooled cylinder barrels, an electric starter, a built in propeller [[reduction gearbox]], [[dry sump]] forced oil lubrication and has a separate oil tank. It has hydraulic values that include automatic adjustment.

This requires a novel [[Walk-around|preflight inspection]] procedure: before checking the oil level with the [[dipstick]], the engine is \"burped\" by removing the oil filler cap and turning the propeller until a gurgling sound is heard, which indicates that all oil has been forced into the tank and the oil level can now be checked accurately.<ref name=AOPA_2017/>\n\nThe 914 is more fuel efficient and lighter than similarly sized traditional engines, but originally had a shorter [[time between overhaul]] (TBO), restricting its market potential. On introduction, the TBO was only 600 hours, which was double that of previous Rotax engines but far short of existing engines of comparable size and power.
