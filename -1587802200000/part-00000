Its area is composed of 3% standing and running water, 95% [[Land development|improved]] [[grassland]] and 2% [[woody plant]]s. The primary reason for site selection for SAC designation is the [[Northern crested newt|great crested newt]] which breeds in a pond with wildly fluctuating levels, so that sometimes it is large, and sometimes nearly dried out. In spite of the lack of [[Aquatic plant|pondweed]], there is nevertheless a \"large population\" laying eggs and recruiting more newts to the site, \"demonstrating this species' ability to thrive in temporary pond sites.\"<ref name=\"JNCC Kirk Deighton\" >{{cite web |title=Kirk Deighton |url=https://sac.jncc.gov.uk/site/UK0030178 |website=sac.jncc.gov.uk |publisher=Joing Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Significant site content==\n===Fauna===\nFeeding in the pasture, and [[Hibernation|hibernating]] under the hedgerows, stone wall and woodpiles are [[Northern crested newt|great crested newt]] and [[smooth newt]].

Good water quality and protection from [[water pollution]] is essential. Potential pollution in this case would include increased [[soil#Nutrients|nutrient]] levels due to local land management, increased presence of [[algae]], and local [[Water extraction|groundwater abstraction]]. Inappropriate plant growth should be removed. The pond should remain unshaded, or at least with the trees on the northern side only. The pond should have sloping sides and shallow areas for sunlit warmth, and deeper areas for hiding in. [[Aquatic plant]]s are useful for cover in the deeper sections of the pond, but if the pond dries out occasionally, that is good too because [[predatory fish]] cannot survive there.<ref name=\"ME Kirk Deighton management\" />\n\n===Foraging, hibernation and movement habitat===\nEarly winter is a favourable time for management works, while the newts are in [[hibernation]] but before the surrounding field becomes too [[bog]]gy. The grassland must be maintained in suitable condition as habitat for the newts. A variety of vegetation is appropriate to the site, because the newts then have a choice of foraging and hibernating places. Newts can hibernate in tree roots, in the bases of hedges and [[Dry stone|drystone]] walls, under [[Wood fuel|logpiles]] and below rubble or stone heaps. [[Hedge]]rows and [[ditch]]es with vegetation provide [[Wildlife corridor|travel corridors]] for newts. Because the newts on this site use neighbouring sites too, there should be no barriers to them around the borders of this site.<ref name=\"ME Kirk Deighton management\" >{{cite web |title=English Nature, views about management |url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/VAM/2000441.pdf |website=designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=16 February 2020 |date=6 October 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=European Site Conservation Objectives for Kirk Deighton SAC (UK0030178) |url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/4695122595807232 |website=publications.naturalengland.org.uk |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=11 March 2020 |date=14 July 2014}} (includes clear satellite image of the site)</ref>\n\n==Development and risk assessment==\nThe situation of the great crested newt on this site was assessed in 2013 by the [[Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust]],<ref name=\"CGO Ecology 2013\" >{{cite web |title=Amphibian & Reptile Conservation Trust |url=https://www.cgoecology.com/client-list/amphibian-a-reptile-conservation-trust |website=cgoecology.com |publisher=CGO Ecology |accessdate=16 February 2020 |date=2013}}</ref> as \"unfavourable and recovering\" and at medium risk,<ref name=\"NE Kirk Deighton unit list\" /><ref name=\"NE Kirk Deighton features\" >{{cite web |title=Kirk Deighton SSSI - Features from overlapping sites |url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/sitedetail.aspx?SiteCode=S2000441&SiteName=kirk&countyCode=&responsiblePerson=&unitId=&SeaArea=&IFCAArea= |website=designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> The problem was that both ponds needed fencing to protect them from livestock.

Its area is composed of 3% standing and running water, 95% [[Land development|improved]] [[grassland]] and 2% [[woody plant]]s. The primary reason for site selection for SAC designation is the [[Northern crested newt|great crested newt]] which breeds in a pond with wildly fluctuating levels, so that sometimes it is large, and sometimes nearly dried out. In spite of the lack of [[Aquatic plant|pondweed]], there is nevertheless a \"large population\" laying eggs and recruiting more newts to the site, \"demonstrating this species' ability to thrive in temporary pond sites.\"<ref name=\"JNCC Kirk Deighton\" >{{cite web |title=Kirk Deighton |url=https://sac.jncc.gov.uk/site/UK0030178 |website=sac.jncc.gov.uk |publisher=Joing Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Significant site content==\n===Fauna===\nFeeding in the pasture, and [[Hibernation|hibernating]] under the hedgerows, stone wall and woodpiles are [[Northern crested newt|great crested newt]] and [[smooth newt]].

Good water quality and protection from [[water pollution]] is essential. Potential pollution in this case would include increased [[soil#Nutrients|nutrient]] levels due to local land management, increased presence of [[algae]], and local [[Water extraction|groundwater abstraction]]. Inappropriate plant growth should be removed. The pond should remain unshaded, or at least with the trees on the northern side only. The pond should have sloping sides and shallow areas for sunlit warmth, and deeper areas for hiding in. [[Aquatic plant]]s are useful for cover in the deeper sections of the pond, but if the pond dries out occasionally, that is good too because [[predatory fish]] cannot survive there.<ref name=\"ME Kirk Deighton management\" />\n\n===Foraging, hibernation and movement habitat===\nEarly winter is a favourable time for management works, while the newts are in [[hibernation]] but before the surrounding field becomes too [[bog]]gy. The grassland must be maintained in suitable condition as habitat for the newts. A variety of vegetation is appropriate to the site, because the newts then have a choice of foraging and hibernating places. Newts can hibernate in tree roots, in the bases of hedges and [[Dry stone|drystone]] walls, under [[Wood fuel|logpiles]] and below rubble or stone heaps. [[Hedge]]rows and [[ditch]]es with vegetation provide [[Wildlife corridor|travel corridors]] for newts. Because the newts on this site use neighbouring sites too, there should be no barriers to them around the borders of this site.<ref name=\"ME Kirk Deighton management\" >{{cite web |title=English Nature, views about management |url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/VAM/2000441.pdf |website=designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=16 February 2020 |date=6 October 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=European Site Conservation Objectives for Kirk Deighton SAC (UK0030178) |url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/4695122595807232 |website=publications.naturalengland.org.uk |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=11 March 2020 |date=14 July 2014}} (includes clear satellite image of the site)</ref>\n\n==Development and risk assessment==\nThe situation of the great crested newt on this site was assessed in 2013 by the [[Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust]],<ref name=\"CGO Ecology 2013\" >{{cite web |title=Amphibian & Reptile Conservation Trust |url=https://www.cgoecology.com/client-list/amphibian-a-reptile-conservation-trust |website=cgoecology.com |publisher=CGO Ecology |accessdate=16 February 2020 |date=2013}}</ref> as \"unfavourable and recovering\" and at medium risk,<ref name=\"NE Kirk Deighton unit list\" /><ref name=\"NE Kirk Deighton features\" >{{cite web |title=Kirk Deighton SSSI - Features from overlapping sites |url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/sitedetail.aspx?SiteCode=S2000441&SiteName=kirk&countyCode=&responsiblePerson=&unitId=&SeaArea=&IFCAArea= |website=designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> The problem was that both ponds needed fencing to protect them from livestock.

NBC held broadcast rights from [[1954\u201355 NBA season|1955]] to [[1961\u201362 NBA season|1962]] and again from [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990]] (when it obtained the rights from [[NBA on CBS|CBS]]) to [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2002]]. During NBC's partnership with the NBA in the 1990s, the league rose to unprecedented popularity, with [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] surpassing the days of [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Larry Bird]] in the mid-1980s.\n\n==Overview==\n===1954\u201362 incarnation===\nNBC's first tenure with the National Basketball Association<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_3|title=The NBA on NBC|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.fcla.edu/fcla/etd/amd0039|title=The NBA on Network Television: Historical Analysis|first=Mario R.|last=Sarmento}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rec.sport.basketball.pro/NBA$20on$20NBC$20schedules%7Csort:date/rec.sport.basketball.pro/yiiWioHy9RQ/bgvxbY4wCgAJ|title=NBA on NBC regular season and playoff schedules|last= |first= |date= |website=rec.sport.basketball.pro |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> began on October 30, 1954 and lasted until April 7, 1962. NBC's very first NBA telecast was a game between the [[1954\u201355 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] and [[1954\u201355 Rochester Royals season|Rochester Royals]] in [[Edgerton Park Arena|Rochester]].\n\nFor the [[1954\u201355 NBA season|1954\u201355 season]], [[Marty Glickman]] and [[Lindsey Nelson]] called all games except on April 9 ([[1954\u201355 Fort Wayne Pistons season|Fort Wayne]] @ [[1954\u201355 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]] during the [[1954 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]), when Glickman worked with [[Jim Gordon (sportscaster)|Jim Gordon]]. Nelson would later write in his autobiography, ''Hello Everybody, I'm Lindsey Nelson''<ref>{{cite book |last=Nelson|first=Lindsay|date= |title=Hello everybody, I'm Lindsey Nelson|url=https://books.google.com/books?newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&id=g_uBAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hello+Everybody%2C+I%27m+Lindsey+Nelson&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Maurice+Podoloff|location= |publisher=Beech Tree Books|page=260|isbn= |author-link=}}</ref> that [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA commissioner]] [[Maurice Podoloff]] would travel to the televised games and, when NBC needed to get in a commercial, he would go up to one of the coaches and say, \"Call a timeout,\" and they had to, since the commissioner ordered it. On March 19, 1955 during the [[1955 NBA playoffs|playoffs]], NBC gave the national spotlight to the [[1954\u201355 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] and rising [[1954\u201355 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]. \n\nFor the first year of NBC's tenure, the first five weeks of coverage followed a [[CFL on NBC|Canadian Football League]] game. That contract decreed that the network show 13 games (along with presumably the [[1954 Grey Cup|Grey Cup]]) on Saturday afternoons beginning in late August, and was signed one week after NBC had lost the [[NBC College Football Game of the Week|rights]] to NCAA football to [[ESPN College Football on ABC|ABC]].\n\nThe [[1955\u201356 NBA season|following year]], Lindsey Nelson was paired with [[Curt Gowdy]] on commentary for all games except on February 25 ([[1955\u201356 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]] @ [[1955\u201356 New York Knicks season|New York]]), March 3 ([[1955\u201356 Minneapolis Lakers season|Minneapolis]] @ [[1955\u201356 Rochester Royals season|Rochester]] with Nelson working with [[Joe Lapchick]]), and March 24 ([[1955\u201356 Fort Wayne Pistons season|Fort Wayne]] @ St. Louis with Nelson working alone). On March 31, 1956, NBC broadcast the first nationally televised [[List of NBA Finals broadcasters|NBA Finals]] game, which was Game 1 of the [[1955\u201356 Philadelphia Warriors season|Philadelphia]]-[[1955\u201356 Fort Wayne Pistons season|Fort Wayne]] [[1956 NBA Finals|series]].\n\nGowdy and Nelson were retained as the primary broadcast team for NBC in [[1956\u201357 NBA season|1956\u201357]] except on March 23 and March 30 ([[1956\u201357 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]] @ [[1956\u201357 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]), when Nelson worked by himself. While the team of Gowdy and Nelson again did most games in [[1957\u201358 NBA season|1957\u201358]], Nelson worked the December 14 telecast ([[1957\u201358 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]] @ [[1957\u201358 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]]) with [[Chick Hearn]], who in return, worked the January 11 telecast (Syracuse @ [[1957\u201358 Cincinnati Royals season|Cincinnati]]) with Gowdy. For the January 18 telecast ([[1957\u201358 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]] @ [[1957\u201358 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]]), Nelson worked alone while on February 1 (Syracuse @ [[1957\u201358 Minneapolis Lakers season|Minneapolis]]), Nelson was paired with [[Bill O'Donnell (sportscaster)|Bill O'Donnell]]. Meanwhile, Gowdy worked alone on March 1 (Cincinnati @ [[1957\u201358 Philadelphia Warriors season|Philadelphia]]).\n\nNBC also during the 1957\u201358 season, broadcast a game in Detroit between Cincinnati and the Pistons on March 15. It was after this game, on the flight home to [[Cincinnati]], that [[Maurice Stokes]] became ill and later suffered a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]], fell into a coma and was left permanently paralyzed. This was the delayed reaction from having hit his head in a game three days earlier. Stokes died in April 1970.\n\nIn the [[1958\u201359 NBA season|1958-59 season]], Curt Gowdy worked alone on all games except on March 15 ([[1958\u201359 New York Knicks season|New York]] @ [[1958\u201359 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]], when Gowdy worked with [[Bud Palmer]]), April 5 ([[1958\u201359 Minneapolis Lakers season|Minneapolis]] @ [[1958\u201359 Boston Celtics season|Boston]] with Lindsey Nelson). The [[1959 NBA All-Star Game]]<ref>{{Cite news|title=NBA Coaches Add Their Choices To East-West Squad|date=January 6, 1959|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|page=24}}</ref> marked the first time that the [[List of NBA All-Star Game broadcasters|All-Star Game]] was nationally televised. However, NBC only broadcast the second half<ref>{{cite news|title=Sports Fans in For Big Afternoon|date=January 17, 1959|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|page=2B}}</ref> at 10 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], in lieu of its ''[[Gillette Cavalcade of Sports|Friday Night Fights]]'' telecast. The fact that the All-Star Game prior to this, was almost always played on a Tuesday night meant that NBC would have had to sacrifice most, if not all, of their evening programming. In the first few years, that would have meant taking off [[Milton Berle]]'s [[Texaco Star Theatre|program]], which was starting to slide, but still would have made more money for the network than a pro basketball game.

NBC aired the [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] every year (with the exception of [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1999]], when the game was canceled due to the lockout), usually at 6:00&nbsp;p.m., Eastern Time. In 2002, NBC aired the game an hour earlier (at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Eastern) due to the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] later that evening. Starting in [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]], during the NBA Playoffs, NBC would air tripleheaders on Saturdays and Sundays during the first two weeks of the playoffs. Prior to 2000, NBC would air a doubleheader on Saturday, followed by a tripleheader on Sunday.\n\nOn December 30, 2000, NBC aired a rare second December game. The Saturday match was the only time that NBC aired a game between Christmas Day and the start of the regular run of games in February. In [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001]], NBC was scheduled to air an October preseason game involving an NBA team playing an international team; that game was canceled due to the [[September 11 attacks]]. During the 2001\u201302 NBA season, NBC added a significant number of Washington Wizards games to its schedule (due to the aforementioned return of Michael Jordan). When Jordan became injured during the middle of the season, the network replaced the added Wizards games with the games that had been originally on the schedule (for example, a March 2002 game between the Wizards and [[2001\u201302 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] was replaced at the last minute with an [[2001\u201302 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]\u2013[[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]] game).\n\n=====Music=====\n[[Image:Nba on nbc old logo.jpg|right|thumb|''NBA on NBC'' logo used from [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990]] to [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]].]]\nThe theme music for the ''NBA on NBC'' broadcasts, \"[[Roundball Rock]]\", was composed by [[New-age music|new-age]] artist [[John Tesh]]. The instrumental piece, which NBC used for every telecast during the network's twelve-year tenure.

From [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] to [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]], several contemporary music pieces were used for the montage (including, in 1997, [[R. Kelly]]'s song \"[[I Believe I Can Fly]]\", which coincidentally came from a basketball film \u2013 ''[[Space Jam]]'', which starred Michael Jordan and [[Pat Benatar]]'s song \"[[Wide Awake in Dreamland|All Fired Up]]\" from [[1999 NBA Finals|1999]] to [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]]). After the 1999 Finals, NBC used \"[[Fly Away (Lenny Kravitz song)|Fly Away]]\" by [[Lenny Kravitz]] for their montage. \n\nIn [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], after NBC's final broadcast, the network aired a montage of memorable moments from every year of coverage, using music from \"Titans Spirit\" (from the film ''[[Remember the Titans]]'') to \"Winning It All\" and most notably, \"To The Flemish Cap\" from the 2000 film ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]''. The song composed by [[James Horner]] is played at the beginning of the montage as well as the end featuring footage from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] dynasty era. This theme song has made a brief comeback as part of NBC's Olympic basketball coverage in 2008, and again in 2016. In December 2018, [[Fox Sports]] acquired the rights to \"Roundball Rock\" for use during [[college basketball]] games.\n\n=====Segments=====\nThe pre-game show for NBC's NBA telecasts was ''[[NBA Showtime]]'', a title that was used from [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990]] until [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000]], with the pre-game being unbranded afterward. ''Showtime'' was originally hosted by [[Bob Costas]] from the inaugural season of the 1990 contract to the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]; [[Hannah Storm]] took over as host beginning with the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], who in turn was replaced by [[Ahmad Rash\u0101d]] in 2001 when Storm went on [[parental leave|maternity leave]]. The video game ''[[NBA Showtime NBA on NBC|NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC]]'', by [[Midway Games]], was named after the pregame show.\n\nDuring the NBA Finals, additional coverage would be immediately available on [[CNBC]], in which the panelists provided an additional half-hour of in-depth game discussions, after the NBC broadcast network's coverage concluded.\n\nThe halftime show was sponsored by [[Prudential Financial]] (''Prudential Halftime Report''), and later [[NetZero]] (''NetZero at the Half'') and [[Verizon Wireless]] (''Verizon Wireless at the Half''). The broadcasts also featured a segment during the live games called ''[[Miller Brewing|Miller]] Genuine Moments'', which provided a brief retrospective on a particular historically significant and/or dramatic moment in NBA history; this segment was discontinued towards the end of NBC's coverage. For a brief period in 2001\u201302, NBC aired a studio segment called ''24'', in which each analyst (at that time, [[Pat Croce]], [[Jayson Williams]] or Mike Fratello) would have 24 seconds to talk about issues concerning the NBA. NBC (in conjunction with completely revamping the pregame show) discontinued the segment in February 2002, after Williams was arrested on murder charges.\n\n=====Ratings=====\n{{details|topic=NBC's NBA ratings|National Basketball Association Nielsen ratings#The NBC Era 1990\u20132002}}\nDuring its twelve-year run, the ''NBA on NBC'' experienced ratings highs and lows for the NBA. In the 1990s, the NBA Finals ratings were stellar, with the exception of [[1999 NBA Finals|1999 Finals]]. In [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]], the NBA set a Finals ratings record, with an 18.7 household rating for the second [[1997\u201398 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]]\u2013[[1997\u201398 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] series, the last championship run by the Michael Jordan-led Bulls. The very next year (after a lockout which erased part of the season), the ratings for the 1999 Finals plummeted, marking the beginning of an ongoing period of lower viewership for the league's game telecasts.<ref name=\"slump\">{{cite news|title=Basketball Ratings Hit a Slump at NBC And That Is Costly|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/20/business/basketball-ratings-hit-a-slump-at-nbc-and-that-is-costly.html?pagewanted=all|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=March 20, 2000|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, NBC set a record for the highest-rated [[2002 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference Final]], including a 14.2 rating for Game 7 of the series between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings.\n\nNBC's highest-rated regular season game was Michael Jordan's first game back from playing [[minor league baseball]]; the March [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1995]] game between the Chicago Bulls and Indiana Pacers scored a 10.9 rating (higher than all but three NBA telecasts on [[NBA on ABC|ABC]]). As a comparison, the first game in Jordan's second comeback (a game against the [[2001\u201302 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] that aired on [[NBA on TBS|TBS]] opposite the [[2001 World Series]]) scored a rating between a 3.0 and 4.0. NBC's first game of Jordan's second comeback scored ratings similar to that number.\n\n=====Criticisms=====\n{{details|topic=NBA on NBC accusations of bias|National Basketball Association criticisms and controversies}}\nSeveral NBA observers accused NBC and the NBA of being biased with only certain teams and individual players. NBC benefited from having [[List of NBA Finals broadcasters#1990s|all of the Finals]] it televised involve the large-market Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks, [[New Jersey Nets]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]] or [[Houston Rockets]]; however, smaller-market teams such as those in San Antonio, Sacramento, [[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]], [[Seattle SuperSonics|Seattle]], [[Portland Trail Blazers|Portland]], Utah, Indiana, Orlando and [[Miami Heat|Miami]] all made regular appearances on NBC games during its run.\n\n=====The end of ''The NBA on NBC''=====\nUpon the expiration of NBC Sports' contract with the NBA in [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2002]], the league signed a broadcast television rights agreement with [[NBA on ABC|ABC]], which began airing games in the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]]. NBC had made a four-year, US $1.3 billion bid in the spring of 2002 to renew its NBA rights, but the league instead made six-year deals worth $4 billion with [[ESPN]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cable Is Said to Muscle Out NBC for N.B.A. Rights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/sports/basketball-nbc-will-live-without-nba-and-without-losses-from-it.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=January 9, 2002|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref> \n\nSimply put, NBC could not compete with the combined broadcast and cable<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=December 15, 2001|title=PRO BASKETBALL; Cable Is Said to Muscle Out NBC for N.B.A. Rights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/15/sports/pro-basketball-cable-is-said-to-muscle-out-nbc-for-nba-rights.html|work=The New York Times|location= |access-date= }}</ref> deal that [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] had with ESPN and ABC.

According to [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]], the reduced number of network telecasts was at the league's own request since the NBA believed that they would get a higher audience for a single game (in contrast to NBC's tripleheaders). From 2002 to [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2006]], the NBA's ratings on broadcast television (ABC) dropped almost a full ratings point (from nearly a 3.0 average rating to just above a 2.0 rating). NBC averaged a 5.5 average rating during the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]]. ABC averaged a 3.3 average rating for the [[2005 NBA Playoffs]].\n\nIn response to the impending loss of NBA coverage, NBC Entertainment president [[Jeff Zucker]] said:\n\n{{cquote|We lost [[NFL on NBC|football]] two years ago, and we stayed a strong No. 1.

Other broadcasters at the time included [[Dick Enberg]] and [[Steve Jones (basketball)|Steve \"Snapper\" Jones]]. Aside from Rashad, [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] and Hannah Storm also handled sideline reporting duties; before becoming the television voice of the Spurs, Lakers and [[New Orleans Pelicans|Pelicans]], [[Joel Meyers]] also started as a sideline reporter for NBC. Bob Costas presided as host of the network's pre-game show, ''NBA Showtime''.\n\nIn 1992, shortly after announcing his retirement, basketball legend Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson became a top game analyst (alongside the likes of Enberg, Albert and Fratello); however, his performance was heavily criticized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magic's Act|url=http://static.espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/020927.html|author=Bill Simmons|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=September 27, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210143159/http://static.espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/020927.html|archivedate=December 10, 2002}}</ref> Among the complaints were his apparently poor [[diction]] skills, his tendency for \"stating the obvious\", his habitual references to his playing days, and an overall lackluster chemistry with his broadcasting partners. Johnson would ultimately be slowly phased out of the ''NBA on NBC'' after helping commentate the [[1993 NBA Finals]].\n\nIn 1994, Mike Fratello left the booth (in order to become the head coach of the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]) and was replaced with [[Matt Guokas]]. Albert and Guokas broadcast the [[1994 NBA Finals]] and were joined for the [[1995 NBA Finals]] by [[Bill Walton]]. Albert, Guokas and Walton, while not working regular season games together (Walton usually worked games with Steve Jones and play-by-play announcers [[Dick Enberg]], [[Tom Hammond]] or [[Greg Gumbel]]), broadcast the next two Finals ([[1996 NBA Finals|1996]] and [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]]) together in a three-man booth.\n\n===1998\u20132000===\n1997 was the last time Marv Albert would call the NBA Finals for NBC during the decade, as an embarrassing [[Marv Albert#Sexual assault charges|sex scandal]] forced NBC to fire Albert before the start of the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u20131998 season]]. To replace Albert, NBC tapped studio host Bob Costas for play-by-play. Matt Guokas did not return to his post as main color commentator, and was replaced by NBA legend [[Isiah Thomas]]; Costas was replaced on the pre-game show by Hannah Storm. Midway through the season, Costas and Thomas were joined by recently fired [[Detroit Pistons]] coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. Collins served to take some weight off Thomas, who was considered by some to be uncomfortable in the role of lead analyst. Thomas, in particular, was singled out for his soft voice and often stammered analysis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Sports Media Busts|url=http://www.awfulannouncing.com/2012-articles/january/top-10-sports-media-busts.html|author=Ryan Yoder|work=Awful Announcing|date=January 25, 2012|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe team of Costas, Thomas and Collins worked the major games that season including the 1998 NBA Finals (which set an all-time ratings record for the NBA). [[Mike Breen]], who played second fiddle to Albert on [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]]'s New York Knicks broadcasts, was hired to do select playoff games that year and was later promoted to backup announcer status. For the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], Thomas was moved to the studio, while Costas and Collins made up the lead team. The 1998\u20131999 season, which was marred by a lengthy [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] (which resulted in the regular season being shortened to 50 games) included the low-rated [[1999 NBA Finals]] between the San Antonio Spurs and the New York Knicks. Albert was brought back for the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], making a return which included calling that year's lead Christmas Day game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers from [[Staples Center]].\n\n===2000\u20132001===\nThe 2000\u20132001 season brought to an end to Bob Costas' direct role with the ''NBA on NBC'' (although Costas would work playoff games for the next two seasons and would return to host NBC's coverage for the [[2002 NBA Finals]]). Costas deferred to Marv Albert, allowing Albert to again be the lead broadcaster for the NBA, and stayed on only to deliver interviews and special features. On the studio front, Hannah Storm left her position as studio host to go on [[parental leave|maternity leave]], with Ahmad Rash\u0101d taking over for Storm; Isiah Thomas left NBC to become coach of the Indiana Pacers. Joining Ahmad Rash\u0101d were former [[Phoenix Suns]] player [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]] and former NBA coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]]. Marv Albert joined Doug Collins as the primary broadcast team, and the two broadcast the [[2001 NBA Finals]], which had the highest ratings for a Finals match since [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]. After the season, Collins was hired away from NBC by the Washington Wizards, which forced the network to move the longtime secondary color duo of Steve Jones and Bill Walton to the lead broadcast team with Albert.\n\nDuring the 2001 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], NBC decided to cross-promote its NBA coverage with its then-popular quiz show ''[[The Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]''. Two 10-minute editions of ''The Weakest Link'' aired during halftime of Games 2 and 3, featuring Bob Costas, Bill Walton and Steve Jones as contestants, along with [[Charlotte Hornets]] guard [[Baron Davis]] and [[WNBA]] team [[Los Angeles Sparks]]'s center, [[Lisa Leslie]].\n\n===2001\u20132002===\nThe [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u20132002]] season featured several anomalies, as NBC started their coverage on the first Saturday of the season, for the first time since 1991. The reason for this was NBA legend Michael Jordan's return to playing, this time for the Washington Wizards. NBC covered an early December game featuring Jordan's Wizards as well, which marked the first time a broadcast television network aired more than one pre-Christmas NBA game since [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] in the 1980s.\n\nThat year also marked the return of Hannah Storm from maternity leave, with her and Ahmad Rash\u0101d alternating as studio hosts throughout the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2002]] season. That year, NBC's studio team consisted of Rashad and Storm with former Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce, the returning Mike Fratello, and former player Jayson Williams. The tandem stayed together through the [[2002 NBA All-Star Game]]. During the week between the All-Star Game and NBC's next scheduled telecast, Williams was arrested after shooting and killing his limousine driver. He was promptly fired by NBC, which also did not return Croce or Fratello to studio coverage. Instead, the network brought in [[Tom Tolbert]], who had only recently been added to NBC Sports as a third-string analyst paired with Mike Breen. Tolbert stayed on as the lone studio analyst through the end of the season, and won acclaim by several in the media, including ''[[USA Today]]'' sports columnist Rudy Martzke. Hannah Storm was not able to anchor the [[2002 NBA All-Star Game]] as she was on assignment at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]] serving as daytime studio host; Rash\u0101d solo anchored from the studio.\n\nIn June 2002, Ahmad Rash\u0101d told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in an interview conducted before the [[2002 NBA Finals]] began, that he would be ending his 20-year run with NBC Sports, after hosting the pre-game show for Game 3 of the Finals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walton Delivers the Jabs, O'Neal the Knockout|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jun-10-sp-tvcolumn10-story.html|author=Larry Stewart|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=June 10, 2002|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> Hannah Storm, meanwhile, covered the 2002 NBA Finals as host of the CNBC post-game show.\n\nTwo days before NBC was to begin its playoff coverage, both Marv Albert and Mike Fratello, returning from working a Philadelphia 76ers\u2013Indiana Pacers game on [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], were seriously injured in a limousine accident. That week, NBC juggled its announcing teams, which resulted in Bob Costas and [[Paul Sunderland]] working some early-round playoff games. Fratello would return to TNT after several days, and Albert returned to NBC for Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals between the [[Dallas Mavericks]] and Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe season would also turn out to be [[NBA on ABC#Backstory|NBC's last with the NBA]]. In January 2002, the league announced a six-year agreement with [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[WarnerMedia|AOL Time Warner]], which resulted in the broadcast television rights being acquired by ABC. That year, NBC's playoff ratings were much higher than in previous years, including tallying record-high ratings for the [[NBA Conference Finals#Conference Finals 2|2002 Western Conference Finals]]. Those high ratings did not translate to the [[2002 NBA Finals|Finals]], which scored their lowest ratings in over two decades.\n\n===List of broadcasters===\n* [[Marv Albert]] \u2013 lead play-by-play (1990\u20131997 and 2001\u20132002)\n* [[Mike Breen]] \u2013 play-by-play\n* [[Quinn Buckner]] \u2013 studio analyst\n* [[P.

NBC held broadcast rights from [[1954\u201355 NBA season|1955]] to [[1961\u201362 NBA season|1962]] and again from [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990]] (when it obtained the rights from [[NBA on CBS|CBS]]) to [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2002]]. During NBC's partnership with the NBA in the 1990s, the league rose to unprecedented popularity, with [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] surpassing the days of [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Larry Bird]] in the mid-1980s.\n\n==Overview==\n===1954\u201362 incarnation===\nNBC's first tenure with the National Basketball Association<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_3|title=The NBA on NBC|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.fcla.edu/fcla/etd/amd0039|title=The NBA on Network Television: Historical Analysis|first=Mario R.|last=Sarmento}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rec.sport.basketball.pro/NBA$20on$20NBC$20schedules%7Csort:date/rec.sport.basketball.pro/yiiWioHy9RQ/bgvxbY4wCgAJ|title=NBA on NBC regular season and playoff schedules|last= |first= |date= |website=rec.sport.basketball.pro |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> began on October 30, 1954 and lasted until April 7, 1962. NBC's very first NBA telecast was a game between the [[1954\u201355 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] and [[1954\u201355 Rochester Royals season|Rochester Royals]] in [[Edgerton Park Arena|Rochester]].\n\nFor the [[1954\u201355 NBA season|1954\u201355 season]], [[Marty Glickman]] and [[Lindsey Nelson]] called all games except on April 9 ([[1954\u201355 Fort Wayne Pistons season|Fort Wayne]] @ [[1954\u201355 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]] during the [[1954 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]), when Glickman worked with [[Jim Gordon (sportscaster)|Jim Gordon]].

On March 19, 1955 during the [[1955 NBA playoffs|playoffs]], NBC gave the national spotlight to the [[1954\u201355 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] and rising [[1954\u201355 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]. \n\nFor the first year of NBC's tenure, the first five weeks of coverage followed a [[CFL on NBC|Canadian Football League]] game. That contract decreed that the network show 13 games (along with presumably the [[1954 Grey Cup|Grey Cup]]) on Saturday afternoons beginning in late August, and was signed one week after NBC had lost the [[NBC College Football Game of the Week|rights]] to NCAA football to [[ESPN College Football on ABC|ABC]].\n\nThe [[1955\u201356 NBA season|following year]], Lindsey Nelson was paired with [[Curt Gowdy]] on commentary for all games except on February 25 ([[1955\u201356 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]] @ [[1955\u201356 New York Knicks season|New York]]), March 3 ([[1955\u201356 Minneapolis Lakers season|Minneapolis]] @ [[1955\u201356 Rochester Royals season|Rochester]] with Nelson working with [[Joe Lapchick]]), and March 24 ([[1955\u201356 Fort Wayne Pistons season|Fort Wayne]] @ St. Louis with Nelson working alone). On March 31, 1956, NBC broadcast the first nationally televised [[List of NBA Finals broadcasters|NBA Finals]] game, which was Game 1 of the [[1955\u201356 Philadelphia Warriors season|Philadelphia]]-[[1955\u201356 Fort Wayne Pistons season|Fort Wayne]] [[1956 NBA Finals|series]].\n\nGowdy and Nelson were retained as the primary broadcast team for NBC in [[1956\u201357 NBA season|1956\u201357]] except on March 23 and March 30 ([[1956\u201357 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]] @ [[1956\u201357 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]), when Nelson worked by himself. While the team of Gowdy and Nelson again did most games in [[1957\u201358 NBA season|1957\u201358]], Nelson worked the December 14 telecast ([[1957\u201358 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]] @ [[1957\u201358 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]]) with [[Chick Hearn]], who in return, worked the January 11 telecast (Syracuse @ [[1957\u201358 Cincinnati Royals season|Cincinnati]]) with Gowdy. For the January 18 telecast ([[1957\u201358 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]] @ [[1957\u201358 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]]), Nelson worked alone while on February 1 (Syracuse @ [[1957\u201358 Minneapolis Lakers season|Minneapolis]]), Nelson was paired with [[Bill O'Donnell (sportscaster)|Bill O'Donnell]]. Meanwhile, Gowdy worked alone on March 1 (Cincinnati @ [[1957\u201358 Philadelphia Warriors season|Philadelphia]]).\n\nNBC also during the 1957\u201358 season, broadcast a game in Detroit between Cincinnati and the Pistons on March 15. It was after this game, on the flight home to [[Cincinnati]], that [[Maurice Stokes]] became ill and later suffered a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]], fell into a coma and was left permanently paralyzed. This was the delayed reaction from having hit his head in a game three days earlier. Stokes died in April 1970.\n\nIn the [[1958\u201359 NBA season|1958-59 season]], Curt Gowdy worked alone on all games except on March 15 ([[1958\u201359 New York Knicks season|New York]] @ [[1958\u201359 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]], when Gowdy worked with [[Bud Palmer]]), April 5 ([[1958\u201359 Minneapolis Lakers season|Minneapolis]] @ [[1958\u201359 Boston Celtics season|Boston]] with Lindsey Nelson). The [[1959 NBA All-Star Game]]<ref>{{Cite news|title=NBA Coaches Add Their Choices To East-West Squad|date=January 6, 1959|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|page=24}}</ref> marked the first time that the [[List of NBA All-Star Game broadcasters|All-Star Game]] was nationally televised. However, NBC only broadcast the second half<ref>{{cite news|title=Sports Fans in For Big Afternoon|date=January 17, 1959|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|page=2B}}</ref> at 10 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], in lieu of its ''[[Gillette Cavalcade of Sports|Friday Night Fights]]'' telecast. The fact that the All-Star Game prior to this, was almost always played on a Tuesday night meant that NBC would have had to sacrifice most, if not all, of their evening programming. In the first few years, that would have meant taking off [[Milton Berle]]'s [[Texaco Star Theatre|program]], which was starting to slide, but still would have made more money for the network than a pro basketball game. Plus, NBA owners weren't terribly savvy when it came to working with TV in this era, so they probably refused network requests to put it in a weekend afternoon slot. \n\nDuring the [[1959\u201360 NBA season|1959\u201360 season]], Curt Gowdy worked alone most on Saturday games while Lindsey Nelson worked alone on most Sunday games. Nelson also worked on Saturday April 2 ([[1959\u201360 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]] @ [[1959\u201360 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]) during the [[1960 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Marty Glickman meanwhile, worked alone on December 6 (St. Louis @ [[1959\u201360 Cincinnati Royals season|Cincinnati]]), January 2-3 ([[1959\u201360 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] @ Cincinnati and Boston @ [[1959\u201360 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]]), February 28 ([[1959\u201360 Philadelphia Warriors season|Philadelphia]] @ [[1959\u201360 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]]), March 13 (Philadelphia @ Syracuse), 20 (Boston @ Philadelphia), and 27 (St. Louis @ Boston), and April 3 (Boston @ St. Louis). Finally, Bill O'Donnell worked alone on March 12 ([[1959\u201360 Minneapolis Lakers season|Minneapolis]] @ [[1959\u201360 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]]), 19 (St. Louis @ Minneapolis), and 26 (Minneapolis @ St. Louis).\n \nIn the [[1960\u201361 NBA season|1960-61 season]], Lindsey Nelson was alone on all games except when he worked with Bud Palmer on October 22 ([[1960\u201361 New York Knicks season|New York]] @ [[1960\u201361 Cincinnati Royals season|Cincinnati]]) and 29 (New York @ [[1960\u201361 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]]), November 26 ([[1960\u201361 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]] @ [[1960\u201361 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]), December 3 (New York @ Syracuse), 10 (Syracuse @ Detroit), and 24 (Detroit @ Boston). [[Jerry Doggett]] helped call games on November 5 (Syracuse @ [[1960\u201361 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles]]) and 19 (Detroit @ Los Angeles). Marty Glickman contributed to commentary on January 8 (Boston @ [[1960\u201361 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]]), 15 ([[1960\u201361 Philadelphia Warriors season|Philadelphia]] @ Syracuse), 22 (St. Louis @ Cincinnati), and 29 (Philadelphia @ Boston), February 19 (Boston @ Syracuse) and 26 (Boston @ Detroit), March 12 (Boston @ Syracuse), 19 (Syracuse @ Boston), and 26 (Syracuse @ Boston), and April 2 (St. Louis @ Boston).\n\nFor NBC's [[1961\u201362 NBA season|final season]] of their first stint with the NBA, Bud Palmer worked alone on commentary on all games except for on February 3 ([[1961\u201362 Cincinnati Royals season|Cincinnati]] @ [[1961\u201362 New York Knicks season|New York]]) and April 7 ([[1961\u201362 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles]] @ [[1961\u201362 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]), when he was paired with [[Bob Wolff]].\n\nNBC's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]<ref>[[#pomerantz|Pomerantz 2005]], pp.10\u201311</ref> during this time period were lukewarm at best.

On possible factor for the dipping ratings the fact that NBC's 1960\u201361 schedule placed the three weakest teams--[[1960\u201361 Cincinnati Royals season|Cincinnati]], [[1960\u201361 Syracuse Nationals season|Syracuse]], and [[1960\u201361 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]] on television a total of 14 times. In comparison, three of the NBA's best teams--[[1960\u201361 Boston Celtics season|Boston]], [[1960\u201361 St. Louis Hawks season|St. Louis]], and [[1960\u201361 Philadelphia Warriors season|Philadelphia]]--appeared on NBC a total of only seven times.\n\n===1990\u201302 iteration===\n====Background====\nOn November 9, 1989, the NBA reached an agreement with the network worth US$600 million contract to broadcast the league's games for four years, beginning with the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]]. On April 28, 1993, NBC extended its exclusive broadcast rights to the NBA with a four-year, $750 million contract.<ref>{{cite news|title=November 9, 1989: The NBA signs a lucrative 4-year television deal with NBC.|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2009/11/this-day-in-history.html|work=Sports Media Watch}}</ref>\n\n====Coverage====\nNBC's coverage of the NBA<ref>{{cite web|title=\"NBA on NBC\" Regular Season TV Schedules \u2013 1990\u20132002|url=http://the506.com/yabb/YaBB.pl?num=1231539314|work=The506.com}}</ref> began on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] each season, with the exception of the inaugural season in 1990 (which featured a game on November 3<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_7|title=NBA on NBC introduces \"Roundball Rock\" theme song|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> between the [[1990\u201391 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[1990\u201391 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]]), the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] (which included a [[1997 McDonald's Championship| preseason tournament]] featuring the [[1997\u201398 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]]), the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] (as no Christmas games were played due to the [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout]]), and the final season of the network's contract in [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]] (which included two early season games featuring the return of [[Michael Jordan]] with the [[2001\u201302 Washington Wizards season|Washington Wizards]]). NBC aired the [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] every year (with the exception of [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1999]], when the game was canceled due to the lockout), usually at 6:00&nbsp;p.m., Eastern Time. In 2002, NBC aired the game an hour earlier (at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Eastern) due to the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] later that evening. Starting in [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]], during the NBA Playoffs, NBC would air tripleheaders on Saturdays and Sundays during the first two weeks of the playoffs. Prior to 2000, NBC would air a doubleheader on Saturday, followed by a tripleheader on Sunday.\n\nOn December 30, 2000, NBC aired a rare second December game. The Saturday match was the only time that NBC aired a game between Christmas Day and the start of the regular run of games in February. In [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001]], NBC was scheduled to air an October preseason game involving an NBA team playing an international team; that game was canceled due to the [[September 11 attacks]]. During the 2001\u201302 NBA season, NBC added a significant number of Washington Wizards games to its schedule (due to the aforementioned return of Michael Jordan). When Jordan became injured during the middle of the season, the network replaced the added Wizards games with the games that had been originally on the schedule (for example, a March 2002 game between the Wizards and [[2001\u201302 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] was replaced at the last minute with an [[2001\u201302 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]\u2013[[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]] game).\n\n=====Music=====\n[[Image:Nba on nbc old logo.jpg|right|thumb|''NBA on NBC'' logo used from [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990]] to [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]].]]\nThe theme music for the ''NBA on NBC'' broadcasts, \"[[Roundball Rock]]\", was composed by [[New-age music|new-age]] artist [[John Tesh]]. The instrumental piece, which NBC used for every telecast during the network's twelve-year tenure. Although Tesh offered the theme to [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] when it took over the rights to the league, the network declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/10/john-tesh-nba-on-nbc-roundball-rock-origin-kawhi-snl-interview|title=John Tesh on the enduring legacy of 'Roundball Rock': 'It's fun for me to watch it take on its own life'|date=2018-10-26|work=For The Win|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, \"The Dream is Still Alive\" by [[Wilson Phillips]] was played during the end of the season montage. Afterwards, until [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], NBC would play the [[rock and roll|rock song]] \"Winning It All\" by [[The Outfield]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to THEOUTFIELD.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.theoutfield.com/|work=TheOutfield.com}}</ref> during its end-of-season montage. From [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] to [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]], several contemporary music pieces were used for the montage (including, in 1997, [[R. Kelly]]'s song \"[[I Believe I Can Fly]]\", which coincidentally came from a basketball film \u2013 ''[[Space Jam]]'', which starred Michael Jordan and [[Pat Benatar]]'s song \"[[Wide Awake in Dreamland|All Fired Up]]\" from [[1999 NBA Finals|1999]] to [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]]). After the 1999 Finals, NBC used \"[[Fly Away (Lenny Kravitz song)|Fly Away]]\" by [[Lenny Kravitz]] for their montage. \n\nIn [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], after NBC's final broadcast, the network aired a montage of memorable moments from every year of coverage, using music from \"Titans Spirit\" (from the film ''[[Remember the Titans]]'') to \"Winning It All\" and most notably, \"To The Flemish Cap\" from the 2000 film ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]''. The song composed by [[James Horner]] is played at the beginning of the montage as well as the end featuring footage from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] dynasty era. This theme song has made a brief comeback as part of NBC's Olympic basketball coverage in 2008, and again in 2016. In December 2018, [[Fox Sports]] acquired the rights to \"Roundball Rock\" for use during [[college basketball]] games.\n\n=====Segments=====\nThe pre-game show for NBC's NBA telecasts was ''[[NBA Showtime]]'', a title that was used from [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990]] until [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000]], with the pre-game being unbranded afterward. ''Showtime'' was originally hosted by [[Bob Costas]] from the inaugural season of the 1990 contract to the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]; [[Hannah Storm]] took over as host beginning with the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], who in turn was replaced by [[Ahmad Rash\u0101d]] in 2001 when Storm went on [[parental leave|maternity leave]]. The video game ''[[NBA Showtime NBA on NBC|NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC]]'', by [[Midway Games]], was named after the pregame show.\n\nDuring the NBA Finals, additional coverage would be immediately available on [[CNBC]], in which the panelists provided an additional half-hour of in-depth game discussions, after the NBC broadcast network's coverage concluded.\n\nThe halftime show was sponsored by [[Prudential Financial]] (''Prudential Halftime Report''), and later [[NetZero]] (''NetZero at the Half'') and [[Verizon Wireless]] (''Verizon Wireless at the Half''). The broadcasts also featured a segment during the live games called ''[[Miller Brewing|Miller]] Genuine Moments'', which provided a brief retrospective on a particular historically significant and/or dramatic moment in NBA history; this segment was discontinued towards the end of NBC's coverage. For a brief period in 2001\u201302, NBC aired a studio segment called ''24'', in which each analyst (at that time, [[Pat Croce]], [[Jayson Williams]] or Mike Fratello) would have 24 seconds to talk about issues concerning the NBA. NBC (in conjunction with completely revamping the pregame show) discontinued the segment in February 2002, after Williams was arrested on murder charges.\n\n=====Ratings=====\n{{details|topic=NBC's NBA ratings|National Basketball Association Nielsen ratings#The NBC Era 1990\u20132002}}\nDuring its twelve-year run, the ''NBA on NBC'' experienced ratings highs and lows for the NBA. In the 1990s, the NBA Finals ratings were stellar, with the exception of [[1999 NBA Finals|1999 Finals]]. In [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]], the NBA set a Finals ratings record, with an 18.7 household rating for the second [[1997\u201398 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]]\u2013[[1997\u201398 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] series, the last championship run by the Michael Jordan-led Bulls. The very next year (after a lockout which erased part of the season), the ratings for the 1999 Finals plummeted, marking the beginning of an ongoing period of lower viewership for the league's game telecasts.<ref name=\"slump\">{{cite news|title=Basketball Ratings Hit a Slump at NBC And That Is Costly|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/20/business/basketball-ratings-hit-a-slump-at-nbc-and-that-is-costly.html?pagewanted=all|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=March 20, 2000|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, NBC set a record for the highest-rated [[2002 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference Final]], including a 14.2 rating for Game 7 of the series between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings.\n\nNBC's highest-rated regular season game was Michael Jordan's first game back from playing [[minor league baseball]]; the March [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1995]] game between the Chicago Bulls and Indiana Pacers scored a 10.9 rating (higher than all but three NBA telecasts on [[NBA on ABC|ABC]]). As a comparison, the first game in Jordan's second comeback (a game against the [[2001\u201302 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] that aired on [[NBA on TBS|TBS]] opposite the [[2001 World Series]]) scored a rating between a 3.0 and 4.0. NBC's first game of Jordan's second comeback scored ratings similar to that number.\n\n=====Criticisms=====\n{{details|topic=NBA on NBC accusations of bias|National Basketball Association criticisms and controversies}}\nSeveral NBA observers accused NBC and the NBA of being biased with only certain teams and individual players. NBC benefited from having [[List of NBA Finals broadcasters#1990s|all of the Finals]] it televised involve the large-market Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks, [[New Jersey Nets]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]] or [[Houston Rockets]]; however, smaller-market teams such as those in San Antonio, Sacramento, [[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]], [[Seattle SuperSonics|Seattle]], [[Portland Trail Blazers|Portland]], Utah, Indiana, Orlando and [[Miami Heat|Miami]] all made regular appearances on NBC games during its run.\n\n=====The end of ''The NBA on NBC''=====\nUpon the expiration of NBC Sports' contract with the NBA in [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2002]], the league signed a broadcast television rights agreement with [[NBA on ABC|ABC]], which began airing games in the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]]. NBC had made a four-year, US $1.3 billion bid in the spring of 2002 to renew its NBA rights, but the league instead made six-year deals worth $4 billion with [[ESPN]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cable Is Said to Muscle Out NBC for N.B.A. Rights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/sports/basketball-nbc-will-live-without-nba-and-without-losses-from-it.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=January 9, 2002|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref> \n\nSimply put, NBC could not compete with the combined broadcast and cable<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=December 15, 2001|title=PRO BASKETBALL; Cable Is Said to Muscle Out NBC for N.B.A. Rights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/15/sports/pro-basketball-cable-is-said-to-muscle-out-nbc-for-nba-rights.html|work=The New York Times|location= |access-date= }}</ref> deal that [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] had with ESPN and ABC.

According to [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]], the reduced number of network telecasts was at the league's own request since the NBA believed that they would get a higher audience for a single game (in contrast to NBC's tripleheaders). From 2002 to [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2006]], the NBA's ratings on broadcast television (ABC) dropped almost a full ratings point (from nearly a 3.0 average rating to just above a 2.0 rating). NBC averaged a 5.5 average rating during the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]]. ABC averaged a 3.3 average rating for the [[2005 NBA Playoffs]].\n\nIn response to the impending loss of NBA coverage, NBC Entertainment president [[Jeff Zucker]] said:\n\n{{cquote|We lost [[NFL on NBC|football]] two years ago, and we stayed a strong No. 1.

TNT also airs most of the big games during the regular season (TNT aired a [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|Lakers-Heat]] game for the third straight year in [[2006-07 NBA season|2007]]), and TNT studio content is streamed to [[NBA.com]] via the ''TNT Overtime'' section.\n\nMany NBA games currently air with NBC Sports branding as part of the various [[NBC Sports Regional Networks|NBC Sports Regional Networks']] (formerly known as Comcast SportsNet) broadcast rights with individual NBA teams.\n\n=====Statistics=====\n{{NBAonNBC}}\n\n==Announcers==\n\n===1954\u20131962===\nAs previously mentioned, NBC Sports first broadcast the NBA from the [[1954\u201355 NBA season|1954\u201355]] through [[1961\u201362 NBA season|1961\u201362 seasons]].

Other broadcasters at the time included [[Dick Enberg]] and [[Steve Jones (basketball)|Steve \"Snapper\" Jones]]. Aside from Rashad, [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] and Hannah Storm also handled sideline reporting duties; before becoming the television voice of the Spurs, Lakers and [[New Orleans Pelicans|Pelicans]], [[Joel Meyers]] also started as a sideline reporter for NBC. Bob Costas presided as host of the network's pre-game show, ''NBA Showtime''.\n\nIn 1992, shortly after announcing his retirement, basketball legend Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson became a top game analyst (alongside the likes of Enberg, Albert and Fratello); however, his performance was heavily criticized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magic's Act|url=http://static.espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/020927.html|author=Bill Simmons|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=September 27, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210143159/http://static.espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/020927.html|archivedate=December 10, 2002}}</ref> Among the complaints were his apparently poor [[diction]] skills, his tendency for \"stating the obvious\", his habitual references to his playing days, and an overall lackluster chemistry with his broadcasting partners. Johnson would ultimately be slowly phased out of the ''NBA on NBC'' after helping commentate the [[1993 NBA Finals]].\n\nIn 1994, Mike Fratello left the booth (in order to become the head coach of the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]) and was replaced with [[Matt Guokas]]. Albert and Guokas broadcast the [[1994 NBA Finals]] and were joined for the [[1995 NBA Finals]] by [[Bill Walton]]. Albert, Guokas and Walton, while not working regular season games together (Walton usually worked games with Steve Jones and play-by-play announcers [[Dick Enberg]], [[Tom Hammond]] or [[Greg Gumbel]]), broadcast the next two Finals ([[1996 NBA Finals|1996]] and [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]]) together in a three-man booth.\n\n===1998\u20132000===\n1997 was the last time Marv Albert would call the NBA Finals for NBC during the decade, as an embarrassing [[Marv Albert#Sexual assault charges|sex scandal]] forced NBC to fire Albert before the start of the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u20131998 season]]. To replace Albert, NBC tapped studio host Bob Costas for play-by-play. Matt Guokas did not return to his post as main color commentator, and was replaced by NBA legend [[Isiah Thomas]]; Costas was replaced on the pre-game show by Hannah Storm. Midway through the season, Costas and Thomas were joined by recently fired [[Detroit Pistons]] coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. Collins served to take some weight off Thomas, who was considered by some to be uncomfortable in the role of lead analyst. Thomas, in particular, was singled out for his soft voice and often stammered analysis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Sports Media Busts|url=http://www.awfulannouncing.com/2012-articles/january/top-10-sports-media-busts.html|author=Ryan Yoder|work=Awful Announcing|date=January 25, 2012|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe team of Costas, Thomas and Collins worked the major games that season including the 1998 NBA Finals (which set an all-time ratings record for the NBA). [[Mike Breen]], who played second fiddle to Albert on [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]]'s New York Knicks broadcasts, was hired to do select playoff games that year and was later promoted to backup announcer status. For the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], Thomas was moved to the studio, while Costas and Collins made up the lead team. The 1998\u20131999 season, which was marred by a lengthy [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] (which resulted in the regular season being shortened to 50 games) included the low-rated [[1999 NBA Finals]] between the San Antonio Spurs and the New York Knicks. Albert was brought back for the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], making a return which included calling that year's lead Christmas Day game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers from [[Staples Center]].\n\n===2000\u20132001===\nThe 2000\u20132001 season brought to an end to Bob Costas' direct role with the ''NBA on NBC'' (although Costas would work playoff games for the next two seasons and would return to host NBC's coverage for the [[2002 NBA Finals]]). Costas deferred to Marv Albert, allowing Albert to again be the lead broadcaster for the NBA, and stayed on only to deliver interviews and special features. On the studio front, Hannah Storm left her position as studio host to go on [[parental leave|maternity leave]], with Ahmad Rash\u0101d taking over for Storm; Isiah Thomas left NBC to become coach of the Indiana Pacers. Joining Ahmad Rash\u0101d were former [[Phoenix Suns]] player [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]] and former NBA coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]]. Marv Albert joined Doug Collins as the primary broadcast team, and the two broadcast the [[2001 NBA Finals]], which had the highest ratings for a Finals match since [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]. After the season, Collins was hired away from NBC by the Washington Wizards, which forced the network to move the longtime secondary color duo of Steve Jones and Bill Walton to the lead broadcast team with Albert.\n\nDuring the 2001 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], NBC decided to cross-promote its NBA coverage with its then-popular quiz show ''[[The Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]''. Two 10-minute editions of ''The Weakest Link'' aired during halftime of Games 2 and 3, featuring Bob Costas, Bill Walton and Steve Jones as contestants, along with [[Charlotte Hornets]] guard [[Baron Davis]] and [[WNBA]] team [[Los Angeles Sparks]]'s center, [[Lisa Leslie]].\n\n===2001\u20132002===\nThe [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u20132002]] season featured several anomalies, as NBC started their coverage on the first Saturday of the season, for the first time since 1991. The reason for this was NBA legend Michael Jordan's return to playing, this time for the Washington Wizards. NBC covered an early December game featuring Jordan's Wizards as well, which marked the first time a broadcast television network aired more than one pre-Christmas NBA game since [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] in the 1980s.\n\nThat year also marked the return of Hannah Storm from maternity leave, with her and Ahmad Rash\u0101d alternating as studio hosts throughout the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2002]] season. That year, NBC's studio team consisted of Rashad and Storm with former Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce, the returning Mike Fratello, and former player Jayson Williams. The tandem stayed together through the [[2002 NBA All-Star Game]]. During the week between the All-Star Game and NBC's next scheduled telecast, Williams was arrested after shooting and killing his limousine driver. He was promptly fired by NBC, which also did not return Croce or Fratello to studio coverage. Instead, the network brought in [[Tom Tolbert]], who had only recently been added to NBC Sports as a third-string analyst paired with Mike Breen. Tolbert stayed on as the lone studio analyst through the end of the season, and won acclaim by several in the media, including ''[[USA Today]]'' sports columnist Rudy Martzke. Hannah Storm was not able to anchor the [[2002 NBA All-Star Game]] as she was on assignment at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]] serving as daytime studio host; Rash\u0101d solo anchored from the studio.\n\nIn June 2002, Ahmad Rash\u0101d told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in an interview conducted before the [[2002 NBA Finals]] began, that he would be ending his 20-year run with NBC Sports, after hosting the pre-game show for Game 3 of the Finals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walton Delivers the Jabs, O'Neal the Knockout|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jun-10-sp-tvcolumn10-story.html|author=Larry Stewart|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=June 10, 2002|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> Hannah Storm, meanwhile, covered the 2002 NBA Finals as host of the CNBC post-game show.\n\nTwo days before NBC was to begin its playoff coverage, both Marv Albert and Mike Fratello, returning from working a Philadelphia 76ers\u2013Indiana Pacers game on [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], were seriously injured in a limousine accident. That week, NBC juggled its announcing teams, which resulted in Bob Costas and [[Paul Sunderland]] working some early-round playoff games. Fratello would return to TNT after several days, and Albert returned to NBC for Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals between the [[Dallas Mavericks]] and Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe season would also turn out to be [[NBA on ABC#Backstory|NBC's last with the NBA]]. In January 2002, the league announced a six-year agreement with [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[WarnerMedia|AOL Time Warner]], which resulted in the broadcast television rights being acquired by ABC. That year, NBC's playoff ratings were much higher than in previous years, including tallying record-high ratings for the [[NBA Conference Finals#Conference Finals 2|2002 Western Conference Finals]]. Those high ratings did not translate to the [[2002 NBA Finals|Finals]], which scored their lowest ratings in over two decades.\n\n===List of broadcasters===\n* [[Marv Albert]] \u2013 lead play-by-play (1990\u20131997 and 2001\u20132002)\n* [[Mike Breen]] \u2013 play-by-play\n* [[Quinn Buckner]] \u2013 studio analyst\n* [[P.

It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] and denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[lambda]] (\u03bb). [[meridian (geography)|Meridians]] (lines running from [[geographical pole|pole]] to pole) connect points with the same longitude. By convention, one of these, the [[Prime Meridian]], which passes through the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], England, was allocated the position of 0\u00b0 longitude. The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian, ranging from 0\u00b0 at the Prime Meridian to +180\u00b0 eastward and \u2212180\u00b0 westward. Specifically, it is the angle between a plane through the Prime Meridian and a plane through both poles and the location in question. (This forms a [[right-handed coordinate system]] with the {{mvar|z}}-axis (right hand thumb) pointing from the Earth's center toward the [[North Pole]] and the {{mvar|x}}-axis (right hand index finger) extending from the Earth's center through the [[Equator]] at the Prime Meridian.)\n\nA location's [[north]]\u2013[[south]] position along a meridian is given by its [[latitude]], which is approximately the angle between the local vertical and the equatorial plane.\n\nIf the Earth were perfectly spherical and radially homogeneous, then the longitude at a point would be equal to the angle between a vertical north\u2013south plane through that point and the plane of the Greenwich meridian. Everywhere on Earth the vertical north\u2013south plane would contain the Earth's axis. But the Earth is not radially homogeneous and has rugged [[terrain]], which affect [[gravity]] and so can shift the vertical plane away from the Earth's axis. The vertical north\u2013south plane still intersects the plane of the Greenwich meridian at some angle; that angle is the [[right ascension|astronomical longitude]], calculated from [[celestial sphere|star observations]]. The longitude shown on maps and GPS devices is the angle between the Greenwich plane and a not-quite-vertical plane through the point; the not-quite-vertical plane is [[perpendicular]] to the surface of the spheroid chosen to approximate the Earth's [[sea level|sea-level]] surface, rather than perpendicular to the sea-level surface itself.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of longitude}}\n[[File:Longitude Vespucci.png|thumb|left|Amerigo Vespucci's means of determining longitude]]\n\nThe measurement of longitude is important both to [[cartography]] and for ocean [[navigation]]. [[sailor|Mariners]] and [[explorer]]s for most of history struggled to determine longitude. Finding a method of determining longitude took centuries, resulting in the history of longitude recording requiring the effort of some of the greatest scientific minds.\n\nLatitude was calculated by observing with [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] or [[astrolabe]] the altitude of the sun or of charted stars above the horizon, but longitude is harder.\n\n[[Amerigo Vespucci]] was perhaps the first European to proffer a solution, after devoting a great deal of time and energy studying the problem during his sojourns in the [[New World]]:\n<blockquote>As to longitude, I declare that I found so much difficulty in determining it that I was put to great pains to ascertain the east-west distance I had covered. The final result of my labours was that I found nothing better to do than to watch for and take observations at night of the conjunction of one planet with another, and especially of the conjunction of the moon with the other planets, because the moon is swifter in her course than any other planet. I compared my observations with an almanac. After I had made experiments many nights, one night, the twenty-third of August 1499, there was a conjunction of the moon with Mars, which according to the almanac was to occur at midnight or a half hour before. I found that...at midnight Mars's position was three and a half degrees to the east.<ref>Vespucci, Amerigo. \"Letter from Seville to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici, 1500.\" Pohl, Frederick J. '''Amerigo Vespucci: Pilot Major'''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1945. 76\u201390. Page 80.</ref></blockquote>[[File:John Harrison Uhrmacher.jpg|thumb|upright|left|John Harrison solved the greatest problem of his day.<ref name=\"Harrison\"/>]]\nBy comparing the positions of the moon and Mars with their anticipated positions, Vespucci was able to crudely deduce his longitude. But this method had several limitations: First, it required the occurrence of a specific astronomical event (in this case, Mars passing through the same [[right ascension]] as the moon), and the observer needed to anticipate this event via an astronomical [[almanac]]. One needed also to know the precise time, which was difficult to ascertain in foreign lands. Finally, it required a stable viewing platform, rendering the technique useless on the rolling deck of a ship at sea. See [[Lunar distance (navigation)]].\n\nIn 1612 [[Galileo Galilei]] demonstrated that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of the orbits of the moons of Jupiter one could use their positions as a universal clock and this would make possible the determination of longitude, but the method he devised was impracticable for navigators on ships because of their instability.<ref>{{citation|title=The Science of Navigation: From Dead Reckoning to GPS|first=Mark|last=Denny|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2012|isbn=9781421405605|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttDB6nnTBG8C&pg=PR105|quote=in 1610, Galileo thought he might win the Spanish longitude prize with his idea of measuring time by observing the moons of Jupiter ... The trouble with the method was in making accurate measurements of the four moons while on the deck of a moving ship at sea. This problem proved intractable, and the method was therefore not adopted}}.</ref> In 1714 the British government passed the [[Longitude Act]] which offered large financial rewards to the first person to demonstrate a practical method for determining the longitude of a ship at sea. These rewards motivated many to search for a solution.\n[[File:Longitude (PSF).png|thumb|Drawing of Earth with longitudes but without latitudes.]]\n[[John Harrison]], a self-educated [[England|English]] [[clockmaker]], invented the [[marine chronometer]], the key piece in solving the problem of accurately establishing longitude at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long distance sea travel.<ref name=\"Harrison\">\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1864737.stm Longitude clock comes alive]\".

Finally, the combination of the availability of marine chronometers and [[wireless telegraph]] time signals put an end to the use of lunars in the 20th century.\n\nUnlike latitude, which has the equator as a natural starting position, there is no natural starting position for longitude. Therefore, a reference meridian had to be chosen. It was a popular practice to use a nation's capital as the starting point, but other locations were also used. While [[Great Britain|British]] cartographers had long used the Greenwich meridian in London, other references were used elsewhere, including [[El Hierro]], [[Rome]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Pisa]], [[Paris]] (see the article ''[[Paris meridian]]''), [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington D.C.]] In 1884 the [[International Meridian Conference]] adopted the Greenwich meridian as the ''universal Prime Meridian'' or ''zero point of longitude''.<ref name=imc>{{cite web|title=International Conference Held at Washington for the Purpose of Fixing a Prime Meridian and a Universal Day.

Snyder, ''[https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/usgspubs/pp/pp1395 Map Projections, A Working Manual]'', [[USGS]] Professional Paper 1395, page ix</ref> is used to denote the location of a place on Earth east or west of the Prime Meridian.\n\nEach degree of longitude is sub-divided into 60 [[minute of arc|minutes]], each of which is divided into 60 [[arcsecond|seconds]]. A longitude is thus specified in [[sexagesimal]] notation as 23\u00b0&nbsp;27\u2032&nbsp;30\u2033&nbsp;E. For higher precision, the seconds are specified with a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]. An alternative representation uses degrees and minutes, where parts of a minute are expressed in decimal notation with a fraction, thus: 23\u00b0&nbsp;27.5\u2032&nbsp;E. Degrees may also be expressed as a decimal fraction: 23.45833\u00b0&nbsp;E. For calculations, the angular measure may be converted to [[radian]]s, so longitude may also be expressed in this manner as a signed fraction of {{pi}} ([[pi]]), or an unsigned fraction of 2{{pi}}.\n\nFor calculations, the West/East suffix is replaced by a negative sign in the [[western hemisphere]]. The preferred convention\u2014that East is positive\u2014is consistent with a right-handed [[Cartesian coordinate system]], with the North Pole up. A specific longitude may then be combined with a specific latitude (usually positive in the [[northern hemisphere]]) to give a precise position on the Earth's surface. Confusingly, the convention of negative for East is also sometimes seen, most commonly in the [[United States]]; the [[Earth System Research Laboratory]] notes that, while it differs from the international standard, it \"make(s) coordinate entry less awkward\" for applications confined to the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref>[https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/sunrise.html NOAA ESRL Sunrise/Sunset Calculator] (deprecated). ''[[Earth System Research Laboratory]]''. Retrieved October 18, 2019.</ref>\n\nThere is no other physical principle determining longitude directly but with time. Longitude at a point may be determined by calculating the time difference between that at its location and [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Since there are 24 hours in a day and 360 degrees in a circle, the sun moves across the sky at a rate of 15 degrees per hour (360\u00b0 \u00f7 24 hours = 15\u00b0 per hour). So if the [[time zone]] a person is in is three hours ahead of UTC then that person is near 45\u00b0 longitude (3 hours \u00d7 15\u00b0 per hour = 45\u00b0). The word ''near'' is used because the point might not be at the center of the time zone; also the time zones are defined politically, so their centers and boundaries often do not lie on meridians at multiples of 15\u00b0. In order to perform this calculation, however, a person needs to have a [[marine chronometer|chronometer]] (watch) set to UTC and needs to determine local time by solar or astronomical observation. The details are more complex than described here: see the articles on [[Universal Time]] and on the [[equation of time]] for more details.\n\n===Singularity and discontinuity of longitude===\nNote that the longitude is [[mathematical singularity|singular]] at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]] and calculations that are sufficiently accurate for other positions may be inaccurate at or near the Poles. Also the [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] at the \u00b1[[180th meridian|180\u00b0 meridian]] must be handled with care in calculations. An example is a calculation of east displacement by subtracting two longitudes, which gives the wrong answer if the two positions are on either side of this meridian. To avoid these complexities, consider replacing latitude and longitude with another [[horizontal position representation]] in calculation.\n\n==Plate movement and longitude== <!-- http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&oldid=231745680#Plate_movement_and_longitude -->\nThe Earth's [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] move relative to one another in different directions at speeds on the order of {{cvt|50 to 100|mm}} per year.<ref>{{cite book |author=Read HH, Watson Janet |title=Introduction to Geology |place=New York |publisher=Halsted |year=1975 |pages=13\u201315}}</ref> <!-- Adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plate_tectonics&oldid=226650343 --> So points on the Earth's surface on different plates are always in motion relative to one another. For example, the longitudinal difference between a point on the Equator in Uganda, on the [[African Plate]], and a point on the Equator in Ecuador, on the [[South American Plate]], is increasing by about 0.0014 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcseconds]] per year. These tectonic movements likewise affect latitude.\n\nIf a [[geodetic datum|global reference frame]] (such as [[WGS84]], for example) is used, the longitude of a place on the surface will change from year to year. To minimize this change, when dealing just with points on a single plate, a different reference frame can be used, whose coordinates are fixed to a particular plate, such as \"[[NAD83]]\" for North America or \"[[ETRS89]]\" for Europe.\n\n==Length of a degree of longitude==\nThe length of a degree of longitude (east-west distance) depends only on the radius of a circle of latitude. For a sphere of radius {{mvar|a}} that radius at latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} is {{math|''a'' [[cosine|cos]] ''\u03c6''}}, and the length of a one-degree (or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|180}} [[radian]]) arc along a circle of latitude is\n:<math>\\Delta^1_{\\rm long}= \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}a \\cos \\phi </math>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:1em; text-align:right;\"\n!{{mvar|\u03c6}}||{{math|\u0394{{su|p=1|b=lat}}}}||{{math|\u0394{{su|p=1|b=long}}}}\n|-\n|  0\u00b0 || 110.574&nbsp;km || 111.320&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 15\u00b0 || 110.649&nbsp;km || 107.551&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 30\u00b0 || 110.852&nbsp;km || 96.486&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 45\u00b0 || 111.133&nbsp;km || 78.847&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 60\u00b0 || 111.412&nbsp;km || 55.800&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 75\u00b0 || 111.618&nbsp;km || 28.902&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 90\u00b0 || 111.694&nbsp;km || 0.000&nbsp;km\n|}\n{{WGS84_angle_to_distance_conversion.svg}}\nWhen the Earth is modelled by an [[ellipsoid]] this arc length becomes<ref name=osborne>{{Cite book |last=Osborne |first=Peter |year=2013 |url=http://www.mercator99.webspace.virginmedia.com/mercator.pdf |doi=10.5281/zenodo.35392 |title=The Mercator Projections: The Normal and Transverse Mercator Projections on the Sphere and the Ellipsoid with Full Derivations of all Formulae |chapter=Chapter 5: The geometry of the ellipsoid |location=Edinburgh |access-date=2016-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509180529/http://www.mercator99.webspace.virginmedia.com/mercator.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=rapp>{{cite book |last=Rapp |first=Richard H. |date=April 1991 |title=Geometric Geodesy Part I |chapter=Chapter 3: Properties of the Ellipsoid |publisher=Department of Geodetic Science and Surveying, Ohio State University |location=Columbus, Ohio. |hdl=1811/24333 }}</ref>\n:<math>\\Delta^1_{\\rm long}=\\frac{\\pi a\\cos\\phi}{180^\\circ \\sqrt{1 - e^2 \\sin^2 \\phi}}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|e}}, the eccentricity of the ellipsoid, is related to the major and minor axes (the equatorial and polar radii respectively) by\n:<math>e^2=\\frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2}</math>\n\nAn alternative formula is\n:<math>\\Delta^1_{\\rm long}= \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}a \\cos \\psi \\quad \\mbox{where }\\tan \\psi = \\frac{b}{a} \\tan \\phi</math>\n\nCos {{mvar|\u03c6}} decreases from 1 at the equator to 0 at the poles, which measures how circles of latitude shrink from the equator to a point at the pole, so the length of a degree of longitude decreases likewise. This contrasts with the small (1%) increase in the [[length of a degree of latitude]] (north-south distance), equator to pole. The table shows both for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid with {{mvar|a}} = {{val|6378137.0|u=m}} and {{mvar|b}} = {{val|6356752.3142|u=m}}. Note that the distance between two points 1 degree apart on the same circle of latitude, measured along that circle of latitude, is slightly more than the shortest ([[geodesic]]) distance between those points (unless on the equator, where these are equal); the difference is less than {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nA [[geographical mile]] is defined to be the length of one [[minute of arc]] along the equator (one equatorial minute of longitude), therefore a degree of longitude along the equator is exactly 60 geographical miles or 111.3 kilometers, as there are 60 minutes in a degree. The length of 1 minute of longitude along the equator is 1 geographical mile or {{convert|1.855|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=in}}, while the length of 1 second of it is 0.016 geographical mile or {{convert|30.916|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=in}}.\n\n==Longitude on bodies other than Earth{{anchor|Planets}}==<!-- This section is linked from [[Viking 2]] -->\n{{see also|Prime meridian (planets)}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n[[Planet]]ary co-ordinate systems are defined relative to their mean [[axis of rotation]] and various definitions of longitude depending on the body. The longitude systems of most of those bodies with observable rigid surfaces have been defined by references to a surface feature such as a [[Impact crater|crater]]. The [[north pole]] is that pole of rotation that lies on the north side of the [[invariable plane]] of the solar system (near the [[ecliptic]]). The location of the prime meridian as well as the position of the body's north pole on the celestial sphere may vary with time due to precession of the axis of rotation of the planet (or satellite). If the position angle of the body's prime meridian increases with time, the body has a direct (or [[direct motion|prograde]]) rotation; otherwise the rotation is said to be [[retrograde motion|retrograde]].\n\nIn the absence of other information, the axis of rotation is assumed to be normal to the mean [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and most of the satellites are in this category. For many of the satellites, it is assumed that the rotation rate is equal to the mean [[orbital period]]. In the case of the [[gas giant|giant planets]], since their surface features are constantly changing and moving at various rates, the rotation of their [[magnetic field]]s is used as a reference instead. In the case of the [[Sun]], even this criterion fails (because its magnetosphere is very complex and does not really rotate in a steady fashion), and an agreed-upon value for the rotation of its equator is used instead.\n\nFor ''planetographic longitude'', west longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the west) are used when the rotation is prograde, and east longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the east) when the rotation is retrograde. In simpler terms, imagine a distant, non-orbiting observer viewing a planet as it rotates. Also suppose that this observer is within the plane of the planet's equator. A point on the Equator that passes directly in front of this observer later in time has a higher planetographic longitude than a point that did so earlier in time.\n\nHowever, ''planetocentric longitude'' is always measured positively to the east, regardless of which way the planet rotates. ''East'' is defined as the counter-clockwise direction around the planet, as seen from above its north pole, and the north pole is whichever pole more closely aligns with the Earth's north pole. Longitudes traditionally have been written using \"E\" or \"W\" instead of \"+\" or \"\u2212\" to indicate this polarity. For example, \u221291\u00b0, 91\u00b0W, +269\u00b0 and 269\u00b0E all mean the same thing.\n\nThe reference surfaces for some planets (such as Earth and [[Mars]]) are [[ellipsoid]]s of revolution for which the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius, such that they are [[oblate spheroid]]s. Smaller bodies ([[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], etc.) tend to be better approximated by [[triaxial ellipsoid]]s; however, triaxial ellipsoids would render many computations more complicated, especially those related to [[map projection]]s. Many projections would lose their elegant and popular properties. For this reason spherical reference surfaces are frequently used in mapping programs.\n\nThe modern standard for maps of Mars (since about 2002) is to use planetocentric coordinates. Guided by the works of historical astronomers, [[Merton E. Davies]] established the meridian of Mars at [[Airy-0]] crater.<ref>[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEM0VQV4QWD_0.html Where is zero degrees longitude on Mars?] \u2013 Copyright 2000 \u2013 2010 \u00a9 European Space Agency.

It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] and denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[lambda]] (\u03bb). [[meridian (geography)|Meridians]] (lines running from [[geographical pole|pole]] to pole) connect points with the same longitude. By convention, one of these, the [[Prime Meridian]], which passes through the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], England, was allocated the position of 0\u00b0 longitude. The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian, ranging from 0\u00b0 at the Prime Meridian to +180\u00b0 eastward and \u2212180\u00b0 westward. Specifically, it is the angle between a plane through the Prime Meridian and a plane through both poles and the location in question. (This forms a [[right-handed coordinate system]] with the {{mvar|z}}-axis (right hand thumb) pointing from the Earth's center toward the [[North Pole]] and the {{mvar|x}}-axis (right hand index finger) extending from the Earth's center through the [[Equator]] at the Prime Meridian.)\n\nA location's [[north]]\u2013[[south]] position along a meridian is given by its [[latitude]], which is approximately the angle between the local vertical and the equatorial plane.\n\nIf the Earth were perfectly spherical and radially homogeneous, then the longitude at a point would be equal to the angle between a vertical north\u2013south plane through that point and the plane of the Greenwich meridian. Everywhere on Earth the vertical north\u2013south plane would contain the Earth's axis. But the Earth is not radially homogeneous and has rugged [[terrain]], which affect [[gravity]] and so can shift the vertical plane away from the Earth's axis. The vertical north\u2013south plane still intersects the plane of the Greenwich meridian at some angle; that angle is the [[right ascension|astronomical longitude]], calculated from [[celestial sphere|star observations]]. The longitude shown on maps and GPS devices is the angle between the Greenwich plane and a not-quite-vertical plane through the point; the not-quite-vertical plane is [[perpendicular]] to the surface of the spheroid chosen to approximate the Earth's [[sea level|sea-level]] surface, rather than perpendicular to the sea-level surface itself.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of longitude}}\n[[File:Longitude Vespucci.png|thumb|left|Amerigo Vespucci's means of determining longitude]]\n\nThe measurement of longitude is important both to [[cartography]] and for ocean [[navigation]]. [[sailor|Mariners]] and [[explorer]]s for most of history struggled to determine longitude. Finding a method of determining longitude took centuries, resulting in the history of longitude recording requiring the effort of some of the greatest scientific minds.\n\nLatitude was calculated by observing with [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] or [[astrolabe]] the altitude of the sun or of charted stars above the horizon, but longitude is harder.\n\n[[Amerigo Vespucci]] was perhaps the first European to proffer a solution, after devoting a great deal of time and energy studying the problem during his sojourns in the [[New World]]:\n<blockquote>As to longitude, I declare that I found so much difficulty in determining it that I was put to great pains to ascertain the east-west distance I had covered. The final result of my labours was that I found nothing better to do than to watch for and take observations at night of the conjunction of one planet with another, and especially of the conjunction of the moon with the other planets, because the moon is swifter in her course than any other planet. I compared my observations with an almanac. After I had made experiments many nights, one night, the twenty-third of August 1499, there was a conjunction of the moon with Mars, which according to the almanac was to occur at midnight or a half hour before. I found that...at midnight Mars's position was three and a half degrees to the east.<ref>Vespucci, Amerigo. \"Letter from Seville to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici, 1500.\" Pohl, Frederick J. '''Amerigo Vespucci: Pilot Major'''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1945. 76\u201390. Page 80.</ref></blockquote>[[File:John Harrison Uhrmacher.jpg|thumb|upright|left|John Harrison solved the greatest problem of his day.<ref name=\"Harrison\"/>]]\nBy comparing the positions of the moon and Mars with their anticipated positions, Vespucci was able to crudely deduce his longitude. But this method had several limitations: First, it required the occurrence of a specific astronomical event (in this case, Mars passing through the same [[right ascension]] as the moon), and the observer needed to anticipate this event via an astronomical [[almanac]]. One needed also to know the precise time, which was difficult to ascertain in foreign lands. Finally, it required a stable viewing platform, rendering the technique useless on the rolling deck of a ship at sea. See [[Lunar distance (navigation)]].\n\nIn 1612 [[Galileo Galilei]] demonstrated that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of the orbits of the moons of Jupiter one could use their positions as a universal clock and this would make possible the determination of longitude, but the method he devised was impracticable for navigators on ships because of their instability.<ref>{{citation|title=The Science of Navigation: From Dead Reckoning to GPS|first=Mark|last=Denny|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2012|isbn=9781421405605|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttDB6nnTBG8C&pg=PR105|quote=in 1610, Galileo thought he might win the Spanish longitude prize with his idea of measuring time by observing the moons of Jupiter ... The trouble with the method was in making accurate measurements of the four moons while on the deck of a moving ship at sea. This problem proved intractable, and the method was therefore not adopted}}.</ref> In 1714 the British government passed the [[Longitude Act]] which offered large financial rewards to the first person to demonstrate a practical method for determining the longitude of a ship at sea. These rewards motivated many to search for a solution.\n[[File:Longitude (PSF).png|thumb|Drawing of Earth with longitudes but without latitudes.]]\n[[John Harrison]], a self-educated [[England|English]] [[clockmaker]], invented the [[marine chronometer]], the key piece in solving the problem of accurately establishing longitude at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long distance sea travel.<ref name=\"Harrison\">\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1864737.stm Longitude clock comes alive]\".

Finally, the combination of the availability of marine chronometers and [[wireless telegraph]] time signals put an end to the use of lunars in the 20th century.\n\nUnlike latitude, which has the equator as a natural starting position, there is no natural starting position for longitude. Therefore, a reference meridian had to be chosen. It was a popular practice to use a nation's capital as the starting point, but other locations were also used. While [[Great Britain|British]] cartographers had long used the Greenwich meridian in London, other references were used elsewhere, including [[El Hierro]], [[Rome]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Pisa]], [[Paris]] (see the article ''[[Paris meridian]]''), [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington D.C.]] In 1884 the [[International Meridian Conference]] adopted the Greenwich meridian as the ''universal Prime Meridian'' or ''zero point of longitude''.<ref name=imc>{{cite web|title=International Conference Held at Washington for the Purpose of Fixing a Prime Meridian and a Universal Day.

Snyder, ''[https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/usgspubs/pp/pp1395 Map Projections, A Working Manual]'', [[USGS]] Professional Paper 1395, page ix</ref> is used to denote the location of a place on Earth east or west of the Prime Meridian.\n\nEach degree of longitude is sub-divided into 60 [[minute of arc|minutes]], each of which is divided into 60 [[arcsecond|seconds]]. A longitude is thus specified in [[sexagesimal]] notation as 23\u00b0&nbsp;27\u2032&nbsp;30\u2033&nbsp;E. For higher precision, the seconds are specified with a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]. An alternative representation uses degrees and minutes, where parts of a minute are expressed in decimal notation with a fraction, thus: 23\u00b0&nbsp;27.5\u2032&nbsp;E. Degrees may also be expressed as a decimal fraction: 23.45833\u00b0&nbsp;E. For calculations, the angular measure may be converted to [[radian]]s, so longitude may also be expressed in this manner as a signed fraction of {{pi}} ([[pi]]), or an unsigned fraction of 2{{pi}}.\n\nFor calculations, the West/East suffix is replaced by a negative sign in the [[western hemisphere]]. The preferred convention\u2014that East is positive\u2014is consistent with a right-handed [[Cartesian coordinate system]], with the North Pole up. A specific longitude may then be combined with a specific latitude (usually positive in the [[northern hemisphere]]) to give a precise position on the Earth's surface. Confusingly, the convention of negative for East is also sometimes seen, most commonly in the [[United States]]; the [[Earth System Research Laboratory]] notes that, while it differs from the international standard, it \"make(s) coordinate entry less awkward\" for applications confined to the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref>[https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/sunrise.html NOAA ESRL Sunrise/Sunset Calculator] (deprecated). ''[[Earth System Research Laboratory]]''. Retrieved October 18, 2019.</ref>\n\nThere is no other physical principle determining longitude directly but with time. Longitude at a point may be determined by calculating the time difference between that at its location and [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Since there are 24 hours in a day and 360 degrees in a circle, the sun moves across the sky at a rate of 15 degrees per hour (360\u00b0 \u00f7 24 hours = 15\u00b0 per hour). So if the [[time zone]] a person is in is three hours ahead of UTC then that person is near 45\u00b0 longitude (3 hours \u00d7 15\u00b0 per hour = 45\u00b0). The word ''near'' is used because the point might not be at the center of the time zone; also the time zones are defined politically, so their centers and boundaries often do not lie on meridians at multiples of 15\u00b0. In order to perform this calculation, however, a person needs to have a [[marine chronometer|chronometer]] (watch) set to UTC and needs to determine local time by solar or astronomical observation. The details are more complex than described here: see the articles on [[Universal Time]] and on the [[equation of time]] for more details.\n\n===Singularity and discontinuity of longitude===\nNote that the longitude is [[mathematical singularity|singular]] at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]] and calculations that are sufficiently accurate for other positions may be inaccurate at or near the Poles. Also the [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] at the \u00b1[[180th meridian|180\u00b0 meridian]] must be handled with care in calculations. An example is a calculation of east displacement by subtracting two longitudes, which gives the wrong answer if the two positions are on either side of this meridian. To avoid these complexities, consider replacing latitude and longitude with another [[horizontal position representation]] in calculation.\n\n==Plate movement and longitude== <!-- http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&oldid=231745680#Plate_movement_and_longitude -->\nThe Earth's [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] move relative to one another in different directions at speeds on the order of {{cvt|50 to 100|mm}} per year.<ref>{{cite book |author=Read HH, Watson Janet |title=Introduction to Geology |place=New York |publisher=Halsted |year=1975 |pages=13\u201315}}</ref> <!-- Adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plate_tectonics&oldid=226650343 --> So points on the Earth's surface on different plates are always in motion relative to one another. For example, the longitudinal difference between a point on the Equator in Uganda, on the [[African Plate]], and a point on the Equator in Ecuador, on the [[South American Plate]], is increasing by about 0.0014 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcseconds]] per year. These tectonic movements likewise affect latitude.\n\nIf a [[geodetic datum|global reference frame]] (such as [[WGS84]], for example) is used, the longitude of a place on the surface will change from year to year. To minimize this change, when dealing just with points on a single plate, a different reference frame can be used, whose coordinates are fixed to a particular plate, such as \"[[NAD83]]\" for North America or \"[[ETRS89]]\" for Europe.\n\n==Length of a degree of longitude==\nThe length of a degree of longitude (east-west distance) depends only on the radius of a circle of latitude. For a sphere of radius {{mvar|a}} that radius at latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} is {{math|''a'' [[cosine|cos]] ''\u03c6''}}, and the length of a one-degree (or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|180}} [[radian]]) arc along a circle of latitude is\n:<math>\\Delta^1_{\\rm long}= \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}a \\cos \\phi </math>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:1em; text-align:right;\"\n!{{mvar|\u03c6}}||{{math|\u0394{{su|p=1|b=lat}}}}||{{math|\u0394{{su|p=1|b=long}}}}\n|-\n|  0\u00b0 || 110.574&nbsp;km || 111.320&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 15\u00b0 || 110.649&nbsp;km || 107.551&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 30\u00b0 || 110.852&nbsp;km || 96.486&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 45\u00b0 || 111.133&nbsp;km || 78.847&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 60\u00b0 || 111.412&nbsp;km || 55.800&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 75\u00b0 || 111.618&nbsp;km || 28.902&nbsp;km\n|-\n| 90\u00b0 || 111.694&nbsp;km || 0.000&nbsp;km\n|}\n{{WGS84_angle_to_distance_conversion.svg}}\nWhen the Earth is modelled by an [[ellipsoid]] this arc length becomes<ref name=osborne>{{Cite book |last=Osborne |first=Peter |year=2013 |url=http://www.mercator99.webspace.virginmedia.com/mercator.pdf |doi=10.5281/zenodo.35392 |title=The Mercator Projections: The Normal and Transverse Mercator Projections on the Sphere and the Ellipsoid with Full Derivations of all Formulae |chapter=Chapter 5: The geometry of the ellipsoid |location=Edinburgh |access-date=2016-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509180529/http://www.mercator99.webspace.virginmedia.com/mercator.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=rapp>{{cite book |last=Rapp |first=Richard H. |date=April 1991 |title=Geometric Geodesy Part I |chapter=Chapter 3: Properties of the Ellipsoid |publisher=Department of Geodetic Science and Surveying, Ohio State University |location=Columbus, Ohio. |hdl=1811/24333 }}</ref>\n:<math>\\Delta^1_{\\rm long}=\\frac{\\pi a\\cos\\phi}{180^\\circ \\sqrt{1 - e^2 \\sin^2 \\phi}}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|e}}, the eccentricity of the ellipsoid, is related to the major and minor axes (the equatorial and polar radii respectively) by\n:<math>e^2=\\frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2}</math>\n\nAn alternative formula is\n:<math>\\Delta^1_{\\rm long}= \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}a \\cos \\psi \\quad \\mbox{where }\\tan \\psi = \\frac{b}{a} \\tan \\phi</math>\n\nCos {{mvar|\u03c6}} decreases from 1 at the equator to 0 at the poles, which measures how circles of latitude shrink from the equator to a point at the pole, so the length of a degree of longitude decreases likewise. This contrasts with the small (1%) increase in the [[length of a degree of latitude]] (north-south distance), equator to pole. The table shows both for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid with {{mvar|a}} = {{val|6378137.0|u=m}} and {{mvar|b}} = {{val|6356752.3142|u=m}}. Note that the distance between two points 1 degree apart on the same circle of latitude, measured along that circle of latitude, is slightly more than the shortest ([[geodesic]]) distance between those points (unless on the equator, where these are equal); the difference is less than {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nA [[geographical mile]] is defined to be the length of one [[minute of arc]] along the equator (one equatorial minute of longitude), therefore a degree of longitude along the equator is exactly 60 geographical miles or 111.3 kilometers, as there are 60 minutes in a degree. The length of 1 minute of longitude along the equator is 1 geographical mile or {{convert|1.855|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=in}}, while the length of 1 second of it is 0.016 geographical mile or {{convert|30.916|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=in}}.\n\n==Longitude on bodies other than Earth{{anchor|Planets}}==<!-- This section is linked from [[Viking 2]] -->\n{{see also|Prime meridian (planets)}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n[[Planet]]ary co-ordinate systems are defined relative to their mean [[axis of rotation]] and various definitions of longitude depending on the body. The longitude systems of most of those bodies with observable rigid surfaces have been defined by references to a surface feature such as a [[Impact crater|crater]]. The [[north pole]] is that pole of rotation that lies on the north side of the [[invariable plane]] of the solar system (near the [[ecliptic]]). The location of the prime meridian as well as the position of the body's north pole on the celestial sphere may vary with time due to precession of the axis of rotation of the planet (or satellite). If the position angle of the body's prime meridian increases with time, the body has a direct (or [[direct motion|prograde]]) rotation; otherwise the rotation is said to be [[retrograde motion|retrograde]].\n\nIn the absence of other information, the axis of rotation is assumed to be normal to the mean [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and most of the satellites are in this category. For many of the satellites, it is assumed that the rotation rate is equal to the mean [[orbital period]]. In the case of the [[gas giant|giant planets]], since their surface features are constantly changing and moving at various rates, the rotation of their [[magnetic field]]s is used as a reference instead. In the case of the [[Sun]], even this criterion fails (because its magnetosphere is very complex and does not really rotate in a steady fashion), and an agreed-upon value for the rotation of its equator is used instead.\n\nFor ''planetographic longitude'', west longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the west) are used when the rotation is prograde, and east longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the east) when the rotation is retrograde. In simpler terms, imagine a distant, non-orbiting observer viewing a planet as it rotates. Also suppose that this observer is within the plane of the planet's equator. A point on the Equator that passes directly in front of this observer later in time has a higher planetographic longitude than a point that did so earlier in time.\n\nHowever, ''planetocentric longitude'' is always measured positively to the east, regardless of which way the planet rotates. ''East'' is defined as the counter-clockwise direction around the planet, as seen from above its north pole, and the north pole is whichever pole more closely aligns with the Earth's north pole. Longitudes traditionally have been written using \"E\" or \"W\" instead of \"+\" or \"\u2212\" to indicate this polarity. For example, \u221291\u00b0, 91\u00b0W, +269\u00b0 and 269\u00b0E all mean the same thing.\n\nThe reference surfaces for some planets (such as Earth and [[Mars]]) are [[ellipsoid]]s of revolution for which the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius, such that they are [[oblate spheroid]]s. Smaller bodies ([[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], etc.) tend to be better approximated by [[Triaxial ellipsoid|triaxial ellipsoids]]; however, triaxial ellipsoids would render many computations more complicated, especially those related to [[map projection]]s. Many projections would lose their elegant and popular properties. For this reason spherical reference surfaces are frequently used in mapping programs.\n\nThe modern standard for maps of Mars (since about 2002) is to use planetocentric coordinates. Guided by the works of historical astronomers, [[Merton E. Davies]] established the meridian of Mars at [[Airy-0]] crater.<ref>[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEM0VQV4QWD_0.html Where is zero degrees longitude on Mars?] \u2013 Copyright 2000 \u2013 2010 \u00a9 European Space Agency.

Despite family financial struggle, his parents worked two jobs to support his musical talent.\n\nHe studied in primary school in Chongwen District in Beijing. He went to Children's Cultural Palace to practice singing, where his musical talent was fully nurtured. At the age of 10, he won the first prize in the Chongwen District singing competition, and the Beijing Middle School and Primary School Students Singing Competition.\n\nIn Fourth Grade, Zhang Wei and his fellow singers in the Children\u2019 Cultural Palace attended the Children's Choir competition in Russia and won the Second Prize. In the Fifth Grade, Zhang Wei passed the audition and became a member of Central China TV station (CCTV) Yinhe Teenage Art Troupe, a birthplace of many superstars in contemporary Chinese pop world, including Faye Wong(link), Cai Guoqing, WANG Xuechun, Liu Chunyan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%A7%E5%BC%A0%E4%BC%9F|title=\u5927\u5f20\u4f1f|last=|first=|date=|website=Baidu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== 1998 \u2013 2009 ===\n\nIn February 1998, when Zhang Wei and his friends performed in a pub, they got to know artist agent Hong Feng. That is when the band the Flowers (Link) was established. In June, he was chosen as the Six Most Talented Teenagers of China. As Zhang Wei is a rather common name in the Chinese language, he was then better known by his stage name Da Zhang Wei (the big Zhang Wei, \u5927\u5f20\u4f1f). \n\nThe Flowers was China's first teenage band. This band was credited for helping to give Chinese youths a voice, as many of them felt that the band's lyrics reflected their own life experiences.\n\nIn January 1999, the Flowers were signed to a small Beijing-based Chinese independent label, New Bees Music and released their first album, ''On the Other Side of Happiness''. The album turned out to be a success with many hit songs like Stillness, Disillusion and the School's Out. \n\nIn December 2001, they released their second album the Strawberry Statement.\n\nIn 2002, they won the Media Award in the 2nd Chinese Pop Music\n\nIn 2004, they won the Most Popular Band in the 4th Global Mandarin Pop Chart and the Chinese Music Pioneer Chart. The same year, the band was signed with EMI. In June, they released ''You Are My Romeo.''\n\nFrom 2004 to 2005, the band experimented with various musical styles including hip hop and techno. In 2005, the band released \"Xi Shua Shua\"(\u563b\u5530\u5530).<ref>{{Citation|title=\u563b\u5530\u5530 by \u82b1\u513f\u4e50\u961f|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW047XUVeKI|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> This is a milestone in Zhang Wei's career as the song make him a household name. Xi Shua Shua became an instant hit in the mainland China and it is still a must-have in parties, square dancing (\u5e7f\u573a\u821e) and karaoke up till today. The song made Zhang Wei a permanent place in Mandarin Pop history. This popular song is even used in parties in other countries, such as Malaysia.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tarian Xi Shua Shua UNIMAS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIDeDGg5gs8|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\nXi Shua Shua was included on the band's fourth studio album, Hua Ji Wang Chao, or Blooming Dynasty, released in July 2005. The album won numerous awards around China and sold some 200,000 copies in the forty days after its release and was considered a great success in the country's pop music scene.\n\n=== 2009 to present ===\n\nThe Flowers was disbanded in 2009 because band members had different personal goal. Da Zhang Wei embarked on his solo career. Since 2009, he released 5 albums and over 13 singles, achieving a record sales of over 5 million copies.\n\nLast decade was a time when China's variety shows (\u7efc\u827a\u8282\u76ee) became a popular form of entertainment. China's entertainment industry purchased many foreign reality show franchise, such as the Voice or the Masked Singers. Da Zhang Wei's career also experienced diversification as he made appearances on TV and internet shows.\n\nHe is increasingly popular with his humour and eloquence that he became known to younger audience as a host and TV personality. In 2016, Da Zhang Wei became a co-host for China's top talk show [[Day Day Up]].\n\nAfter he went solo, he continued his humorous, fun-loving, crazy party rock style and made singles that are both critically and commercially acclaimed. Many songs are top trending on video sharing websites, such as Tik Tok and Bilibili. The happy melody, straightforward lyrics and healthy, motivating content made his music Chinese people's favourite at parties and festivals.\n\nIn 2014, he released \"Beier Shuang\", meaning Super Euphoric. He performed the song in China Central TV's Spring Festival Gala, a show viewed by hundreds of millions of Chinese audiences at home and abroad since 1988. The song became an instant national sensation. It is the most popular song for square dance ladies for its exciting beats and straightforward lyrics. Even the internet sensation Psy used \"Beier Shuang\" when he performed with Chinese girl band SNH48 in China.<ref>{{Citation|title=\u9e1f\u53d4\u3001SNH48\u300a\u6c5f\u5357style+\u500d\u513f\u723d\u300b\uff08SNH48\u7b2c\u4e09\u5c4a\u5e74\u5ea6\u603b\u51b3\u9009\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\uff09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1VAVPrCBqQ|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> The music video of this song has been viewed over 2 million times on YouTube, even though Chinese internet users do not have access to YouTube.\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n=== Musical style ===\n\n=== Influences ===\nDa Zhang Wei's early influence came from [[Green Day]] and [[Sex Pistols]], punk/rock guru influencing generations of new rockers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huxiu.com/article/280908.html|title=\u5927\u5f20\u4f1f\uff1a\u53db\u9006\u672a\u9042|last=\u8d35\u5708\u00a9|website=www.huxiu.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> After he went solo, he turned his interest to EDM. He and his musical partner Cheng Zhen Xin would spend hours on YouTube, learning to do EDM and looking for inspiration. He also tries to incorporate elements of traditional Chinese art forms into his music. \n\n'''Punk/rock'''\n\nOne of Da Zhang Wei's musical memories is the radio cassettes bought with his parents\u2019 hard-earned money. His early music contained elements of rock and punk. At the age of 15, Da Zhang Wei performed in support act for the concert of popular band The Catcher in the Rye in the Busy Bee Bar in Beijing. He was immediately signed by manager Hong Feng and formed the first teenage rock band in China. His gongs were mainly about pains in adolescence life.\n\nIn July 2019, an internet variety show Summer of Band ([[:zh:\u6a02\u968a\u7684\u590f\u5929|\u6a02\u968a\u7684\u590f\u5929]]) revive people's memory of the rocker side of Da Zhang Wei when he appeared on the show and performed with the rock bands. Once again, he made rock music a popular genre among Chinese audience.\n\n'''Dance music'''\n\nAfter Da Zhang Wei discovered rock was too rebellious for Chinese audience, he changed to a happier, lighter genre \u2013 dance music. He wrote catchy lyrics, including many fun Beijing dialect slangs. Their songs are commercially acclaimed and made him and his band a household name.\n\n'''Electronic dance music'''\n\nSince 2015, Da Zhang Wei's latest music interest shifted to electronic dance music (EDM). Like his other endeavours, he is not content with following others so he created a unique EDM style with his distinct style: incorporateing Chinese ethnic music and EDM.\n\nFor example, in 2016, he created a theme song for the advertisement of AliPay's new function. Da Zhang Wei combines Beijing Opera with EDM which makes the song traditional yet incredibly fashionable. His 2018 hit song ''I Am a Popping Candy'' combines EDM with traditional Yunan ethnic style and Shangdong clapper talk, an ancient storytelling music performance dating back thousands of years ago.\n\nTo popularise EDM for Chinese audience, Da Zhang Wei uses his influence to create EDM songs in every possible opportunity. \n\nIn 2016, he performed in ''Heroes of Remix'' (Link) as a guest performer where he demonstrated his extraordinary talent in remixing different elements and producing catchy and fun party music. For example, he remixed Beijing Opera, Beijing folk song the ''Beijing Chick'' and a 1980s rock classic\u2014the ''Long March''. The final result is a fun and ground-breaking ''New Beijing Chick'' (\u300a\u5317\u4eac\u5c0f\u599e\u300b).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huxiu.com/article/280908.html|title=\u5927\u5f20\u4f1f\uff1a\u53db\u9006\u672a\u9042|last=\u8d35\u5708\u00a9|website=www.huxiu.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> In the same show, he also remixed the theme song of 80s cartoon ''Hulu Brothers''(\u300a\u846b\u82a6\u5a03\u300b), bringing back many people's childhood memories and giving this classic song new life.<ref>{{Citation|title=wowkie zhang \u5927\u5f20\u4f1f-\u76d6\u4e16\u97f3\u96c4-\u846b\u82a6\u5a03 -\u672a\u4fee\u97f3\u7248|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiYWaTrFayw|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\nIn this show he brought forward the concept of CDM\u2014China Dance Music. He gave a short speech, appealing for all musicians to create music with their own ethnic style, rather than forgetting their own cultural identity by following the international trend. In 2018 Da Zhang Wei appeared as a judge in [[Rave Now]]. One of the co-stars on the show is Norwegian DJ Alan Walker, ranked 36th on DJ Mag's Top 100 DJs list of 2018. In the show, Da Zhang Wei scouted the winning performer\u2014JIANG Liang. He also scouted a team of EDM musicians who were mainly performing in underground pubs and bars in China.\n\nIn the show, he and his team created many songs that remix ethnic music with EDM. For example, he created Nezha, which tells the story of a famous hero from traditional Chinese myth Nezha. In the form of EDM, young generation of music lovers can review this traditional story thus preserving China's culture.\n\n=== Song writing ===\nUnlike many other singers in mandarin pop, Da Zhang Wei writes his own songs. He has written 190 songs so far.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the Flowers period, he was the writer of all songs in the band's albums. Still a teenager, his lyrics and rhythm was highly regarded by many adult singers so they have a cover of Da Zhang Wei's songs, including\n\nStillness ( \u9759\u6b62)-- Yang Naiwen / Faith Yang ([[:zh:\u694a\u4e43\u6587|\u6768\u4e43\u6587]])\n\nSodagreen ([[:zh:\u8607\u6253\u7da0|\u82cf\u6253\u7eff]])\n\nJing Chang([[:zh:\u5f35\u82b8\u4eac|\u5f20\u82b8\u4eac]])\n\nShattered (\u7834\u706d) -- Karen Mok ([[:zh:\u83ab\u6587\u851a|\u83ab\u6587\u851a]])\n\nHe is one of the most hard working songwriters in China. For example, when writing his hit song Xi Shua Shua, he listened to 5 gygabite of music looking for inspiration, that was almost 100 albums. He said, \"I am very hard-working when it comes to learning music. For the past 20 years, I listened to over 500 songs per month to sharpen my craft.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Reality TV appearances ===\nDa Zhang Wei became a popular guest star on reality TV shows, music talent show and game shows. His signature chatterbox image, humour and witty comments made him popular figure in these shows.

Some even jokingly said they wanted to adopt him.\n\n==== Glam rock on stage vs comedian offstage ====\nIn the 2000s, Da Zhang Wei believed China's social reality is not suitable for rock music. So he terminated the contract with New Bees Music and signed with EMI in 2004. His focus was more on commercial success and public popularity. The album You are my Romeo was an album with completely different style from the previous ones. The band \u2018s image was not the angry teenage boy next door, but rather a mixture of punk, and Japanese street style \u2013 with unusual hair styles, striking hair colour, flamboyant costumes, similar to Japanese Visual Kei, or Western glam rock [[Japanese street fashion]].\n\nDespite his fierce looks, Da Zhang Wei\u2019s music was not fierce, but rather very entertaining. His songs were mainly about happy themes with energetic beats and catch lyrics. Da Zhang Wei was determined to reestablish himself as an entertainer rather than a rocker.\n\nIn the late 2000s, China\u2019s entertainment industry experience a drastic change where talk shows, talent shows, variety shows gained increasing popularity. At the same time, Da Zhang Wei became a solo artist. To maintain his profile, he attended many TV shows of differing categories.\n\nAttending the Chinese version of Your Face Sound Familiar was a milestone in this solo career as his talent was discovered. The show invited celebrities to impersonate famous people in China pop, western world or in history. Da Zhang Wei\u2019s impression was so good he was a regular to the show.\n\n==== Youthful looks vs an old soul ====\nDa Zhang Wei sticks to his signature party rock fashion style both on stage and off stage, which makes him the one-an-only Da Zhang Wei that no one can replace. Even in his mid-thirties, he still feels like a young boy. He remains youthful in his looks, and pure in his heart, with bright smile and clear eyes. \nAge did not wear him down, but increases his wit. He offers unique insights into many problems in life, which became his famous quotes widely cited by Chinese people. His remarks are funny, but worth pondering over. The internet called him \u201cTeacher Da\u201d because of his witty remarks.\n\n==== Famous quotes ====\n\u4eba\u751f\u5c31\u662f\u4e2a\u88e4\u8869\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\u5c41\u90fd\u5f97\u515c\u7740\n\nLife is like underpants, it gotta hold all the shit.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://kknews.cc/entertainment/ez9ogm4.html|title=\u5927\u5f20\u4f1f\uff1a\u5f53\u4f60\u51fa\u8d70\u534a\u751f\uff0c\u5f52\u6765\u4ecd\u662f\u5c11\u5e74|language=zh-sg|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n\u9752\u6625\u5c31\u50cf\u536b\u751f\u7eb8\uff0c\u770b\u7740\u633a\u591a\u7684\uff0c\u7528\u7740\u7528\u7740\u5c31\u4e0d\u591f\u4e86\n\nYouth is like toilet roll: looks like there is a lot, but runs out before you know it.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u601c\u60af\u60b2\u4f24\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e26\u7740\u60b2\u4f24\u4e00\u5757\u513f\u73a9\u513f\n\nWe don't pity sadness.

This band was credited for helping to give Chinese youths a voice, as many of them felt that the band's lyrics reflected their own life experiences.\n\nIn January 1999, the Flowers were signed to a small Beijing-based Chinese independent label, New Bees Music and released their first album, ''On the Other Side of Happiness''.

He and his musical partner Cheng Zhen Xin would spend hours on YouTube, learning to do EDM and looking for inspiration. He also tries to incorporate elements of traditional Chinese art forms into his music. \n\n'''Punk/Rock'''\n\nOne of Da Zhang Wei's musical memories is the radio cassettes bought with his parents\u2019 hard-earned money. His early music contained elements of rock and punk. At the age of 15, Da Zhang Wei performed in support act for the concert of popular band The Catcher in the Rye in the Busy Bee Bar in Beijing. He was immediately signed by manager Hong Feng and formed the first teenage rock band in China. His gongs were mainly about pains in adolescence life.\n\nIn July 2019, an internet variety show Summer of Band ([[:zh:\u6a02\u968a\u7684\u590f\u5929|\u6a02\u968a\u7684\u590f\u5929]]) revive people's memory of the rocker side of Da Zhang Wei when he appeared on the show and performed with the rock bands. Once again, he made rock music a popular genre among Chinese audience.\n\n'''Dance music'''\n\nAfter Da Zhang Wei discovered rock was too rebellious for Chinese audience, he changed to a happier, lighter genre \u2013 dance music. He wrote catchy lyrics, including many fun Beijing dialect slangs. Their songs are commercially acclaimed and made him and his band a household name.\n\n'''Electronic Dance music'''\n\nSince 2015, Da Zhang Wei's latest music interest shifted to electronic dance music (EDM). Like his other endeavours, he is not content with following others so he created a unique EDM style with his distinct style: incorporateing Chinese ethnic music and EDM.\n\nFor example, in 2016, he created a theme song for the advertisement of AliPay's new function. Da Zhang Wei combines Beijing Opera with EDM which makes the song traditional yet incredibly fashionable. His 2018 hit song ''I Am a Popping Candy'' combines EDM with traditional Yunan ethnic style and Shangdong clapper talk, an ancient storytelling music performance dating back thousands of years ago.\n\nTo popularise EDM for Chinese audience, Da Zhang Wei uses his influence to create EDM songs in every possible opportunity. \n\nIn 2016, he performed in ''Heroes of Remix'' (Link) as a guest performer where he demonstrated his extraordinary talent in remixing different elements and producing catchy and fun party music. For example, he remixed Beijing Opera, Beijing folk song the ''Beijing Chick'' and a 1980s rock classic\u2014the ''Long March''. The final result is a fun and ground-breaking ''New Beijing Chick'' (\u300a\u5317\u4eac\u5c0f\u599e\u300b).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huxiu.com/article/280908.html|title=\u5927\u5f20\u4f1f\uff1a\u53db\u9006\u672a\u9042|last=\u8d35\u5708\u00a9|website=www.huxiu.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> In the same show, he also remixed the theme song of 80s cartoon ''Hulu Brothers''(\u300a\u846b\u82a6\u5a03\u300b), bringing back many people's childhood memories and giving this classic song new life.<ref>{{Citation|title=wowkie zhang \u5927\u5f20\u4f1f-\u76d6\u4e16\u97f3\u96c4-\u846b\u82a6\u5a03 -\u672a\u4fee\u97f3\u7248|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiYWaTrFayw|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\nIn this show he brought forward the concept of CDM\u2014China Dance Music. He gave a short speech, appealing for all musicians to create music with their own ethnic style, rather than forgetting their own cultural identity by following the international trend. In 2018 Da Zhang Wei appeared as a judge in [[Rave Now]]. One of the co-stars on the show is Norwegian DJ Alan Walker, ranked 36th on DJ Mag's Top 100 DJs list of 2018. In the show, Da Zhang Wei scouted the winning performer\u2014JIANG Liang. He also scouted a team of EDM musicians who were mainly performing in underground pubs and bars in China.\n\nIn the show, he and his team created many songs that remix ethnic music with EDM. For example, he created Nezha, which tells the story of a famous hero from traditional Chinese myth Nezha. In the form of EDM, young generation of music lovers can review this traditional story thus preserving China's culture.\n\n=== Song writing ===\nUnlike many other singers in mandarin pop, Da Zhang Wei writes his own songs.

For example, when writing his hit song Xi Shua Shua, he listened to 5 gygabite of music looking for inspiration, that was almost 100 albums. He said, \"I am very hard-working when it comes to learning music.
