The largest number of patients in the Belfast Union Infirmary was recorded as 4,252 on 31 January 1869.<ref name=\"bch.n-i.nhs.uk\">[http://www.bch.n-i.nhs.uk/news/historyarticlebch.html#P-5_0 Origins of the Belfast City Hospital] Belfast City Hospital Trust {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008232835/http://www.bch.n-i.nhs.uk/news/historyarticlebch.html#P-5_0 |date=8 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== Dr. Thomas Andrews ===\nDr. Thomas Andrews, who qualified as a doctor in Edinburgh in 1835, was appointed by the Guardians at the age of 26 to work with the growing patient population and paid him \u00a360 per annum.<ref name=craig/> Belfast grew to a city of 350,000 people in Victorian times but the city had a problem with poor housing and sewage which led to at least four Cholera outbreaks. In January 1847 a new fever hospital with 159 beds was opened by the Board of Guardians on the site.<ref name=workhouses/>\n\n=== Fever hospital ===\nIn 1849 all fever patients were removed from the wards of the Frederick Street Hospital and transferred to the new fever hospital. This decision meant reduced bed numbers in the main Belfast General Hospital but that the amount of surgery now done there increased. The fever hospital treated outbreaks of cholera, smallpox, tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria, typhoid, scarlet fever and rabies.  In addition to the \"fever\" patients, the infirmary also agreed to take all patients with burns, and those with incurable illnesses to the point where they were as many as 1,338 patients in 1883.<ref name=craig/>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe number of nurses grew over these years although they were often untrained. In 1867, there were fifteen paid nurses. In November 1884, Miss [[Ella Pirrie]] was appointed Superintendent and Head Nurse.<ref name=craig/> She knew [[Florence Nightingale]] and in December 1884, Miss Nightingale sent a Christmas present to Miss Pirrie for the children in the Infirmary. Shortly after she was appointed, the Guardians approved a uniform for the paid nurses, and a distinctive apron for the unpaid female attendants.<ref name=craig/> Under Miss Pirrie, nursing training began for the first time in Belfast and the first person, Miss Craig was sent to Dublin to sit a nursing examination. Nurse Craig was appointed Superintendent in 1892.<ref name=craig/> The maternity unit was first established on the site by Dr. John McLeish in the late 19th century<ref name=craig/> and then expanded to become the Jubilee Maternity Hospital, moving into new purpose-built premises on the site in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1891762/|title=Two Hundred Years of Midwifery 1806 \u2013 2006|publisher=Journal of the Ulster Medical Society|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Health Service]] was created in 1948, and three of the hospital's laboratory assistants were among the last 45 of the workhouse residents to serve on the hospital staff. Having been orphaned and with no record of their parents, they were known as Pauper John, Skipper and Red Hand Rufus.<ref name=\"bch.n-i.nhs.uk\"/>\n\nIn the late 1960s, Dimitrios Oreopoulos, a Greek-born doctor at the hospital, arranged to have seeds from the [[Tree of Hippocrates]] in [[Kos]] planted on the hospital grounds to commemorate the proposed expansion of the hospital. One of the trees created from the seeds, in the grounds of Erskine House, became too large to transplant to the tower building and was left in place.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Douglas |first1=James F

The largest number of patients in the Belfast Union Infirmary was recorded as 4,252 on 31 January 1869.<ref name=\"bch.n-i.nhs.uk\">[http://www.bch.n-i.nhs.uk/news/historyarticlebch.html#P-5_0 Origins of the Belfast City Hospital] Belfast City Hospital Trust {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008232835/http://www.bch.n-i.nhs.uk/news/historyarticlebch.html#P-5_0 |date=8 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== Dr. Thomas Andrews ===\nDr. Thomas Andrews, who qualified as a doctor in Edinburgh in 1835, was appointed by the Guardians at the age of 26 to work with the growing patient population and paid him \u00a360 per annum.<ref name=craig/> Belfast grew to a city of 350,000 people in Victorian times but the city had a problem with poor housing and sewage which led to at least four Cholera outbreaks. In January 1847 a new fever hospital with 159 beds was opened by the Board of Guardians on the site.<ref name=workhouses/>\n\n=== Fever hospital ===\nIn 1849 all fever patients were removed from the wards of the Frederick Street Hospital and transferred to the new fever hospital. This decision meant reduced bed numbers in the main Belfast General Hospital but that the amount of surgery now done there increased. The fever hospital treated outbreaks of cholera, smallpox, tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria, typhoid, scarlet fever and rabies.  In addition to the \"fever\" patients, the infirmary also agreed to take all patients with burns, and those with incurable illnesses to the point where they were as many as 1,338 patients in 1883.<ref name=craig/>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe number of nurses grew over these years although they were often untrained. In 1867, there were fifteen paid nurses. In November 1884, Miss [[Ella Pirrie]] was appointed Superintendent and Head Nurse.<ref name=craig/> She knew [[Florence Nightingale]] and in December 1884, Miss Nightingale sent a Christmas present to Miss Pirrie for the children in the Infirmary. Shortly after she was appointed, the Guardians approved a uniform for the paid nurses, and a distinctive apron for the unpaid female attendants.<ref name=craig/> Under Miss Pirrie, nursing training began for the first time in Belfast and the first person, Miss Craig was sent to Dublin to sit a nursing examination. Nurse Craig was appointed Superintendent in 1892.<ref name=craig/> The maternity unit was first established on the site by Dr. John McLeish in the late 19th century<ref name=craig/> and then expanded to become the Jubilee Maternity Hospital, moving into new purpose-built premises on the site in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1891762/|title=Two Hundred Years of Midwifery 1806 \u2013 2006|publisher=Journal of the Ulster Medical Society|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Health Service]] was created in 1948, and three of the hospital's laboratory assistants were among the last 45 of the workhouse residents to serve on the hospital staff. Having been orphaned and with no record of their parents, they were known as Pauper John, Skipper and Red Hand Rufus.<ref name=\"bch.n-i.nhs.uk\"/>\n\nIn the late 1960s, Dimitrios Oreopoulos, a Greek-born doctor at the hospital, arranged to have seeds from the [[Tree of Hippocrates]] in [[Kos]] planted on the hospital grounds to commemorate the proposed expansion of the hospital.

A vague sequel to ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', the game is a [[shoot 'em up]] set in [[outer space]]. The goals is to destroy enemies, avoid obstacles, and rescue astronauts in twenty levels to reach [[paradise]].\n\nThe game had advanced graphics at the time of release, using large, scaled sprites to give the impression of attackers and asteroids approaching the player's ship. The game was originally written for the [[Atari 8-bit family]]\u2013something not made public until 2004. Neither the Atari 8-bit nor the arcade machine has bitmap scaling hardware; the Atari CPU has a higher clock rate.\n\n''Blaster'' was sold in both [[Duramold]] and wooden cabinets, with the former being much more common.\n\n==Plot==\nAccording to the opening demo: {{quote|It is the year 2085. The Robotrons have destroyed the human race. You escape in a stolen space shuttle. Your destination: Paradise. A remote outpost 20 million light years away. Does paradise exist? Can civilization be started again? These questions will be answered at the end of your journey. But first, you must BLAST... OR BE BLASTED!}}\n\nThis implies that the game takes place after the events of ''[[Robotron: 2084]]''. However, aside from a few oversized G.R.U.N.T. [[robot]]s in the first stage, none of the Robotron characters make an appearance in ''Blaster''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe game is controlled  with an optical [[joystick]] and two buttons: fire and thrust. The ship's weapon fires from a linear bank of four pyramid-shaped shots. Shots do not emanate toward the exact center of the screen; the first shot in the series will be furthest left, while the fourth will be furthest right. The Blastership is given three lives and extra lives are awarded every 100,000 points. The player has a [[health (gaming)|life bar]], in likeness to similar games such as ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]''; however, in this implementation, the life bar represents three hit points, and not a continuum of health points. When the ship gets hit a second time the text \"ENERGY CRITICAL\" will be flashed on-screen. Almost everything in the game can be destroyed, from the asteroids to enemy shots. In fact the latter is a critical component of surviving for an extended period of time.\n\nMarooned [[astronaut]]s can be rescued by interception through the various waves. They are initially worth 1000 points, and are incremented by 200 points for each subsequent rescue during the same life, for a maximum value of 2000 points. Any situation where enemies appear in groups offer additional bonuses for destroying all enemies in the group. In some levels, such as the Saucerland waves, there are conditions which necessitate a certain order for the ships to be destroyed in.

A vague sequel to ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', the game is a [[shoot 'em up]] set in [[outer space]]. The goals is to destroy enemies, avoid obstacles, and rescue astronauts in twenty levels to reach [[paradise]].\n\nThe game had advanced graphics at the time of release, using large, scaled sprites to give the impression of attackers and asteroids approaching the player's ship. The game was originally written for the [[Atari 8-bit family]]\u2013something not made public until 2004. Neither the Atari 8-bit nor the arcade machine has bitmap scaling hardware; the Atari's CPU has a higher clock rate.\n\n''Blaster'' was sold in both [[Duramold]] and wooden cabinets, with the former being much more common.\n\n==Plot==\nAccording to the opening demo: {{quote|It is the year 2085. The Robotrons have destroyed the human race. You escape in a stolen space shuttle. Your destination: Paradise. A remote outpost 20 million light years away. Does paradise exist? Can civilization be started again? These questions will be answered at the end of your journey. But first, you must BLAST... OR BE BLASTED!}}\n\nThis implies that the game takes place after the events of ''[[Robotron: 2084]]''. However, aside from a few oversized G.R.U.N.T. [[robot]]s in the first stage, none of the Robotron characters make an appearance in ''Blaster''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe game is controlled  with an optical [[joystick]] and two buttons: fire and thrust. The ship's weapon fires from a linear bank of four pyramid-shaped shots. Shots do not emanate toward the exact center of the screen; the first shot in the series will be furthest left, while the fourth will be furthest right. The Blastership is given three lives and extra lives are awarded every 100,000 points. The player has a [[health (gaming)|life bar]], in likeness to similar games such as ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]''; however, in this implementation, the life bar represents three hit points, and not a continuum of health points. When the ship gets hit a second time the text \"ENERGY CRITICAL\" will be flashed on-screen. Almost everything in the game can be destroyed, from the asteroids to enemy shots. In fact the latter is a critical component of surviving for an extended period of time.\n\nMarooned [[astronaut]]s can be rescued by interception through the various waves. They are initially worth 1000 points, and are incremented by 200 points for each subsequent rescue during the same life, for a maximum value of 2000 points. Any situation where enemies appear in groups offer additional bonuses for destroying all enemies in the group. In some levels, such as the Saucerland waves, there are conditions which necessitate a certain order for the ships to be destroyed in. In most of the levels a large blue \"E\" decorated with arcs of lightning can be found. Shooting these E's will completely fill the shields, while colliding with them will cause the player to warp to the next wave. Before warping, every object in the level will turn into E's and the ship will speed against a backdrop of a field of E with Enegizers.\n\n==Development==\n''Blaster'' was originally programmed by [[Vid Kidz]] for the [[Atari 8-bit family]] and the [[Atari 5200]] console, and then converted to the arcade version.<ref name=\"retro\"/> It was the third and last release by Vid Kidz.<ref name=\"retro\"/>  The Atari versions were eventually scrubbed during the corporate shuffling that occurred after the [[video game crash of 1983]], although they were finally found and released to the public in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/blaster/blaster.htm |title=Blaster |last=Reichert |first=Matt |year=2004 |work=AtariProtos.com |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motorola 6809]] of the arcade machine runs at only 1&nbsp;MHz, \"and man did it hurt\", says Jarvis.<ref name=\"mat\">{{cite book |title=Midway Arcade Treasures |date=2003 |publisher=Midway Games}}</ref>\n\nOnly three sit-down machines were ever produced.
