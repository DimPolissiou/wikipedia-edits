On subway maps, the Capital Airport Express' color is {{Color box|#{{BJS color|a}}|border=darkgray}} [[Magnolia (color)|magnolia]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Capital Airport Express is currently {{convert|28.1|km|mi}} in length and has four stations: {{BJS stations|Dongzhimen}} and {{BJS stations|Sanyuanqiao}} in the city, and two stations in the [[Beijing Capital International Airport]], one at {{BJS stations|Terminal 3}}, and the other at {{BJS stations|Terminal 2}}. Trains departing Dongzhimen first stop at Sanyuanqiao, then proceed to the airport and serve Terminal 3. Here, they [[terminal station|reverse direction]] and proceed to Terminal 2, where they reverse out again and head back to Dongzhimen via Sanyuanqiao. There is no station serving Terminal 1 directly; riders must alight at Terminal 2 and use a walkway to reach Terminal 1.\n\nLike other subway lines in Beijing, the entire line is [[Grade separation|grade separated]] from traffic. Most of the track is at ground level or elevated, paralleling the [[Airport Expressway (Beijing)|S12 Airport Expressway]], with several [[underpass]]es crossing underneath existing railway lines. However, the {{convert|4|km|mi}} section between Dongzhimen and Sanyuanqiao is underground, and the line near Terminal 2 is also underground.\n\nA one-way fare on the Capital Airport Express costs [[Renminbi|RMB(\u00a5)]] 25, with no free transfers from other lines.<ref>[http://en.bcia.com.cn/traffic/express/index.shtml \"Express Railway\" BCIA.com] Accessed 2014-06-05</ref> Unlike similar rail services such as the [[Airport Express (MTR)|MTR Airport Express]] in [[Hong Kong]] and the [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]] in [[Taiwan]], there is no downtown check-in at Dongzhimen or Sanyuanqiao stations.

Trains departing Dongzhimen first stop at Sanyuanqiao, then proceed to the airport and serve Terminal 3. Here, they [[terminal station|reverse direction]] and proceed to Terminal 2, where they reverse out again and head back to Dongzhimen via Sanyuanqiao. There is no station serving Terminal 1 directly; riders must alight at Terminal 2 and use a walkway to reach Terminal 1.\n\nLike other subway lines in Beijing, the entire line is [[Grade separation|grade separated]] from traffic. Most of the track is at ground level or elevated, paralleling the [[Airport Expressway (Beijing)|S12 Airport Expressway]], with several [[underpass]]es crossing underneath existing railway lines. However, the {{convert|4|km|mi}} section between Dongzhimen and Sanyuanqiao is underground, and the line near Terminal 2 is also underground.\n\nA one-way fare on the Capital Airport Express costs [[Renminbi|RMB(\u00a5)]] 25, with no free transfers from other lines.<ref>[http://en.bcia.com.cn/traffic/express/index.shtml \"Express Railway\" BCIA.com] Accessed 2014-06-05</ref> Unlike similar rail services such as the [[Airport Express (MTR)|MTR Airport Express]] in [[Hong Kong]] and the [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]] in [[Taiwan]], there is no downtown check-in at Dongzhimen or Sanyuanqiao stations.

The first west-bound train departs Tuqiao at 5:20am. The last east-bound train leaves Sihui 10:45pm. The last west-bound train leaves Tuqiao at 10:05pm. For the official timetable, see [http://www.bjsubway.com/chinese_ver/cczn/TimeTableDetails.asp?TimeID=14].\n\n==Route==\nThe Ba Tong Line follows the [[Jingtong Expressway|Beijing-Tongzhou Expressway]] eastward from Sihui to Guanzhuang. Between [[Gaobeidian Station|Gaobeidian]] and [[Guanzhuang station (Batong line)|Guanzhuang]], the Ba Tong Line and its stations are built into the highway's median.

They are also found over open, sparsely vegetated grasslands. During the day time, pallid bats typically roost in cracks and crevices, which may include tile roofs, exfoliating bark of trees, or rocky outcrops. During the night, this species will often use a night roost that is closer to their foraging grounds than their day roost. A night roost is usually less protected than a day roost; open porches may be used as night roosts by this species. In the winter time, this species may dip into shallow bouts of [[torpor]], often in buildings, caves, or cracks in rocks.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite iucn|url = https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/1790/0|title = Antrozous pallidus|accessdate = 18 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nPallid bats are [[insectivore]]s that feed on [[arthropod]]s such as [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, and are capable of consuming up to half their weight in insect every night.

They are also found over open, sparsely vegetated grasslands. During the day time, pallid bats typically roost in cracks and crevices, which may include tile roofs, exfoliating bark of trees, or rocky outcrops. During the night, this species will often use a night roost that is closer to their foraging grounds than their day roost. A night roost is usually less protected than a day roost; open porches may be used as night roosts by this species. In the winter time, this species may dip into shallow bouts of [[torpor]], often in buildings, caves, or cracks in rocks.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite iucn|url = https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/1790/0|title = Antrozous pallidus|accessdate = 18 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nPallid bats are [[insectivore]]s that feed on [[arthropod]]s such as [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, and are capable of consuming up to half their weight in insect every night.

Bats in areas of low [[Primary production|primary productivity]], such as the desert, tend to be smaller due to less availability of resources.
