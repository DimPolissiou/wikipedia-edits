The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell's fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city. He did not provide any copies to radio stations, as they would not play any of the Island music; the music was also not reviewed by the press.<ref name=\"Full\" /> Meanwhile, Goodall left to start the [[Doctor Bird (label)|Doctor Bird]] record label in 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11340584/Graeme-Goodall-obituary.html|title=Graeme Goodall - obituary|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nBlackwell signed the [[Spencer Davis Group]] to the label (at that time, many Island releases were being distributed by [[Philips Records|Philips]]/[[Fontana Records|Fontana]]). The group became very popular and Island started their own independent series to spotlight UK rock talent. They signed artists such as [[John Martyn]], [[Fairport Convention]], [[Free (band)|Free]], and greatly influenced the growing [[FM radio]] market. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were a major label in England with artists including [[Roxy Music]], [[King Crimson]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|The Wailers]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Steve Winwood]] and many others.  (In the US, many of their releases were issued on A&M prior to Island signing up an unsuccessful distribution deal with Capitol.

In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica.<ref name=\":1\">[http://www.kool97fm.com T interview with Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan].

One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Jackson Browne]].

In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]''.<ref name=IA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=September 20, 1985|last=Greenberg|first=James|title=Island And Alive Dissolving Joint Prod'n Venture}}</ref> In 1982, [[Paul Morley]] and producer [[Trevor Horn]] started the [[ZTT]] label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label.<ref name=\"May\" /> Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:\n\n<blockquote>I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ...

Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.\n\nThere was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].\n\n===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009\u20132017===\nFollowing its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.\n\n2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.\n\n====Island's sixth decade: the artists====\n[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.\n\n[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).\n\nNorth London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.\n\nIsland was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.\n\nCanadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.\n\nSigned to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].\n\nIn May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island's offices at [[Universal Music Group]]'s New York City building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/darcus-beese-named-president-island-records/|title=DARCUS BEESE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ISLAND RECORDS|date=2018-05-24|website=UMG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Manga Entertainment==\nIsland World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created [[Manga Entertainment]] Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991.

While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city.

One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Jackson Browne]].

Bob Marley's 1981 death was detrimental to the company, especially after its having engineered Marley's international breakthrough only a few years earlier, while Irish rock band [[U2]], which had signed to Island in March 1980, was growing in popularity, but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come. In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]''.<ref name=IA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=September 20, 1985|last=Greenberg|first=James|title=Island And Alive Dissolving Joint Prod'n Venture}}</ref> In 1982, [[Paul Morley]] and producer [[Trevor Horn]] started the [[ZTT]] label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label.<ref name=\"May\" /> Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:\n\n<blockquote>I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ...

The events were a celebration of the street-cool, independent outlook and striking visual imagery at the label's creative core. These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd's Bush Empire and [[Bush Hall]] in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label's history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.\n\nThere was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].\n\n===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009\u20132017===\nFollowing its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.\n\n2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.\n\n====Island's sixth decade: the artists====\n[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.\n\n[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).\n\nNorth London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.\n\nIsland was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.\n\nCanadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.\n\nSigned to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].\n\nIn May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island's offices at [[Universal Music Group]]'s New York City building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/darcus-beese-named-president-island-records/|title=DARCUS BEESE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ISLAND RECORDS|date=2018-05-24|website=UMG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Manga Entertainment==\nIsland World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created [[Manga Entertainment]] Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991.

The commonly held assumption that it means \"He passed over\" ([[:wikt:\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7|\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7]]), in reference to God \"passing over\" (or \"skipping\") the houses of the Hebrews during the final of the Ten [[Plagues of Egypt]], stems from the translation provided in the [[Septuagint]] (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 [<nowiki/>[[Greek language|Greek]]: ''pareleusetai''] in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:23|HE}}, and \u03b5\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd [<nowiki/>[[Greek language|Greek]]: ''eskepasen''] in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:27|HE}}).

Four days before the Exodus, the Hebrews were commanded to set aside a lamb ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3|HE}}), and inspect it daily for blemishes.

To show his power, Yahweh inflicts a series of 10 plagues on the Egyptians, culminating in the 10th plague, the death of the first-born.\n\n{{quote|This is what the {{LORD}} says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.

Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Numbers|9:11|HE}}), and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|NIV}}). If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened ({{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}), and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:9|HE}}) and eaten together with unleavened bread (''[[matzo]]'') and bitter herbs (''[[maror]]''). One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:46|HE}}), and none of the meat could be left over by morning ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:10|HE}} {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}).\n\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an [[apostate]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:43|HE}}), a [[Indentured servant|servant]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:45|HE}}), an [[Brit milah|uncircumcised man]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}), a person in a state of [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]], except when a majority of Jews are in such a state (''[[Pesahim]]'' 66b), and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a [[quorum]] of 30 (''Pesahim'' 64b). In the Temple, the [[Levites]] sang [[Hallel]] while the [[Kohen|priests]] performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (''Pesahim'' 91b).\n\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the [[mitzvah]] of the ''Korban Pesach'' is memorialized in the ''Seder Korban Pesach'', a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the ''[[Mincha]]'' (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th of Nisan,<ref name=Kitov>{{cite book|first=Eliyahu|last=Kitov|title=The Book of Our Heritage: The Jewish Year and Its Days of Significance|publisher=Feldheim|year=1997|page=562}}</ref> and in the form of the ''[[zeroa]]'', a symbolic food placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted [[humerus|shankbone]] (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the [[afikoman]] substitutes for the eating of the ''Korban Pesach'' at the end of the Seder meal ([[Mishnah]] Pesachim 119a). Many [[Sephardi Jews]] have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the ''Korban Pesach''.\n\n==Removing all leaven (''chametz'')==\n{{see also|Chametz#Removal of chametz}}\n[[File:BiurChametz2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins]]\nLeaven, in Hebrew ''[[Chametz#What is chametz?|chametz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05d7\u05de\u05e5</big> ''\u1e25amets'', \"[[leavening]]\") is made from one of five types of grains<ref name=Pomerantz/> combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes.

[[Halakha|Jewish law]] requires the elimination of [[olive]]-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the cracks of kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small.

If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n:Blessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\n\nIn Hebrew:\n\n\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05de\u05e5\n\n(''ber\u016bkh otah, YEH'WAH alihiyn\u016b, melekh ha-\u2018\u00f4lam, eser qedesh-n\u016b be-mits\u016btayu we-tsewin\u016b \u2018al be-\u00f4r \u1e25amets'')\n\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\n\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by [[candle]]light, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the ''chametz''. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\n\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for ''chametz'' will be in vain (''bracha l'vatala'') if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some ''chametz'' will be found.\n\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\n==Morning of 14th of Nissan==\nNote that if the 14th of Nissan is [[Shabbat]], many of the below will be celebrated on the 13th instead [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|due to restrictions in place during Shabbat]].\n\n===Fast of the Firstborn===\n{{main|Fast of the Firstborn|siyum}}\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on [[Motza'ei Shabbat]]), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the [[Fast of the Firstborn]] which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:29|HE}}, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a ''[[siyum]]'' (ceremony marking the completion of a section of [[Torah learning]]) right after [[Shacharit|morning prayers]], and the [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\n\n===Burning and nullification of leaven===\nOn the morning of the 14th of [[Nisan]], any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (''s'rayfat chametz''). The head of the household repeats the declaration of ''biyur chametz'', declaring any ''chametz'' that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\nShould more ''chametz'' actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\n\nUnlike ''chametz'', which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\n\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" [[Passover sacrifice]] (''Korban Pesach'') has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish temple]] approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\n\nHowever, the Paschal lamb is still a principal feature of [[Beta Israel|Falashah]], Karaite and Samaritan observance.\n\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3\u201311|HE}}.\n\n==Separate kosher for Passover utensils and dishes==\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat ''chametz'' (leaven) during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}), observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with ''chametz'', for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some ''chametz'' utensils can be immersed in boiling water (''[[Hagalah|hagalat keilim]]'') to purge them of any traces of ''chametz'' that may have accumulated during the year. Many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that [[glass]] does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a [[blow torch]] to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called ''libun gamur'').<ref name=\"WSJblowtorch\">{{Cite news |last= Lagnado |first= Lucette |title= As Passover Nears, These Rabbis Are Getting Out Their Blowtorches |page= A1 |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |location= New York |date= April 18, 2011 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704628404576264751651607740 }}</ref>\n\n==Matzah==\n{{main|Matzo}}\n[[Image:Machine-made Shmura Matzo.jpg|thumb|250px|Machine made ''shmura matza'']]\n\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is [[matzo]], an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:18|HE}}</ref> Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the [[Passover Seder]]. There are several explanations for this.\n\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=60495 |title=Thought For Food: An Overview of the Seder | work =AskMoses.com \u2013 Judaism, Ask a Rabbi \u2013 Live}}</ref> Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to [[hardtack]]), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\n\nMatzo has also been called ''Lechem Oni'' (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\"). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.<ref>[http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=450 What is the kabbalistic view on chametz?] by Rabbi Yossi Marcus</ref>\n\n[[File:Shmura Matzo2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hand made ''shmura matzo'']]\n\n''Shmura matzo'' (\"watched\" or \"guarded\" matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities.

In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"''[[Chavurah|chaburas]]''\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. ''Chaburas'' also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\n\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,<ref name=Pomerantz/> as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the ''chabura'' members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170657/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |title=Making Matzah the Old-Fashioned Way |publisher=The Jewish Federations of North America |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\n\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now ''chametz'', and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\n\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.<ref name=Pomerantz/>\n\n==Passover seder==\n[[File:Sedertable.jpg|thumb|250px|Table set for the Passover Seder]]\n{{Main|Passover Seder}}\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities outside [[Land of Israel|Israel]]) for a special dinner called a [[Passover seder|seder]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8</big> ''seder'' \u2013 derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the [[Haggadah]]. Four cups of wine are consumed at various stages in the narrative. The Haggadah divides the night's procedure into 15 parts:\n\n#''Kadeish/ Qad\u0113sh'' <big>\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9</big> \u2013 recital of [[Kiddush]] blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine\n#''Urchatz/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25ats/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 the [[Handwashing in Judaism|washing of the hands]] \u2013 without blessing\n#''Karpas'' <big>\u05db\u05e8\u05e4\u05e1</big> \u2013 dipping of the ''[[karpas]]'' in salt water\n#''Yachatz/ Ya\u1e25ats/ Ya\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d9\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 breaking the middle matzo; the larger piece becomes the ''[[afikoman]]'' which is eaten later during the ritual of ''Tzafun''\n#''Maggid/ Maggiyd'' <big>\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3</big> \u2013 retelling the Passover story, including the recital of \"[[the four questions]]\" and drinking of the second cup of wine\n#''Rachtzah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7tsah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e8\u05d7\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 second washing of the hands \u2013 with blessing\n#''Motzi/ M\u00f4tsiy\u2019/ M\u00f4\u1e63iy\u2019'' <big>\u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0</big> \u2013 traditional blessing before eating [[bread]] products\n#''Matzo/ Ma\u1e63o'' <big>\u05de\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 blessing before eating [[matzo]]\n#''Maror'' <big>\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8</big> \u2013 eating of the [[maror]]\n#''Koreich/ Kor\u0113kh'' <big>\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 eating of a sandwich made of matzo and maror\n#''Shulchan oreich/ Sh\u016bl\u00b7\u1e25an \u2018\u00f4r\u0113kh'' <big>\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d7\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 lit. \"set table\" \u2013 the serving of the holiday meal\n#''Tzafun/ Tsaf\u016bn/ \u1e62af\u016bn'' <big>\u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df</big> \u2013 eating of the ''[[afikoman]]''\n#''Bareich/ Bar\u0113kh'' <big>\u05d1\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 [[Birkat Hamazon|blessing after the meal]] and drinking of the third cup of wine\n#''[[Hallel]]'' <big>\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc</big> \u2013 recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine\n#''Nirtzah/ Niyr\u00b7tsah/ Niyr\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 conclusion\n\nThese 15 parts parallel the 15 steps in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on which the [[Levite]]s stood during Temple services, and which were memorialized in the 15 [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] (#120\u2013134) known as ''Shir HaMa'a lot'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea}} ''shiyr ha-ma\u2018al\u00f4th'', \"[[Song of Ascents|Songs of Ascent]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kolhator.org.il/shir_hamaalot.php |title=Shir Ha Ma'a lot |publisher=Kolhator.org.il |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of [[Kiddush]] which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the ''[[afikoman]]'', the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including ''[[Chad Gadya]]'' (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\n\n===Maror===\n[[File:3TypesMaror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Types of maror: grated [[horseradish]], [[romaine lettuce]], whole horseradish root]]\n[[Maror]] (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5 ''ve-yimareru'') their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver seder plate]]\n\n===Four cups of wine===\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of [[the Exodus]], the drinking of the third cup concludes [[Birkat Hamazon]] and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel.\n\n===The four questions and participation of children===\n{{See also|The four questions}}\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, ''Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh'' (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\n\n:Why is this night different from all other nights?\n:On all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\n:On all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\n:On all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\n:On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\n\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about [[The Exodus|the Exodus from Egypt]], the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n\n===Afikoman===\n[[File:Haggadah 15th cent.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century Haggadah]]\nThe ''afikoman'' \u2013 an integral part of the Seder itself \u2013 is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called ''Yachatz'', the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the ''afikoman''. Many families use the ''afikoman'' as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the ''afikoman'' and offering a prize for its return.<ref name=Pomerantz/> Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the ''afikoman'' and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the ''afikoman'' must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, ''Tzafun''.\n\n===Concluding songs===\n\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\". This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. \"[[Echad Mi Yodea]]\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"[[Chad Gadya]]\" are allegorical.\n\n==Counting of the Omer==\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,<ref>[[Karaite Jews]] begin the count on the Sunday within the holiday week. This leads to Shavuot for the Karaites always falling on a Sunday.</ref> Jews begin the practice of the [[Counting of the Omer]], a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of [[Shavuot]] 50 days hence. Each night after the [[Maariv|evening prayer service]], men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs: Historical and Contemporary|first=Sol|last=Scharfstein|pages=36\u201337|year=1999|isbn=0881256269}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple stood in Jerusalem]], a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of Unleavened Bread. [[Josephus]] writes:<blockquote>\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an ''assaron'' for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.<ref name=\"Barley\"/></blockquote> Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\n\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and [[mitzvot]] before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering \u2013 a measure of barley, typically animal fodder \u2013 and the Shavuot offering \u2013 two loaves of wheat bread, human food \u2013 symbolizes the transition process.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of the Omer|first=Ellen|last=Cohn|title=Ecology and the Jewish Spirit: Where Nature and the Sacred Meet|editor-first=Ellen|editor-last=Bernstein|page=164|year=2000|isbn=1580230822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8qvQcZeAv4C&pg=PA164}}</ref>\n\n==Chol HaMoed: The intermediate days of Passover==\nIn [[Land of Israel|Israel]], Passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major [[Jewish holidays]]. In [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, no work is performed on those days, with most of the rules relating to the observances of [[Shabbat]] being applied.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nOutside Israel, in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays. In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. [[Reform Judaism]] observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\n\nLike the holiday of [[Sukkot]], the intermediary days of Passover are known as [[Chol HaMoed]] (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as [[macaroon]]s and homemade candies.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nPassover cake recipes call for [[potato starch]] or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use [[matzo farfel]] (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base.

Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?<br />And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to \"visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.\" It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit. Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall \"be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.</blockquote>\n\n==Influence on other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:The two disciples, Peter and John, are sent to prepare the Passover (f. 32) Cropped.jpg|thumb|The two disciples, [[st Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], were sent by Christ to prepare the Passover]]\n{{see also|Easter|Passover (Christian holiday)}}\n\nThe Christian celebration of [[Good Friday]] finds its roots in the Jewish feast of Passover, the evening on which Jesus was crucified as the [[Lamb of God|Passover Lamb]].<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Er-QZeW12tUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = The Jewish Pesach and the Origins of the Christian Easter|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|first1=Clemens|last1=Leonhard |year=2012|accessdate = June 14, 2018|isbn = 978-3110927818}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FqKAT_eTKMfA0AG7xMHXBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Pascha%22%20name&f=false|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=Long before this controversy, Ex 12 as a story of origins and its ritual expression had been firmly fixed in the Christian imagination.

Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Numbers|9:11|HE}}), and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|NIV}}). If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened ({{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}), and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:9|HE}}) and eaten together with unleavened bread (''[[matzo]]'') and bitter herbs (''[[maror]]''). One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:46|HE}}), and none of the meat could be left over by morning ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:10|HE}} {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}).\n\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an [[apostate]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:43|HE}}), a [[Indentured servant|servant]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:45|HE}}), an [[Brit milah|uncircumcised man]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}), a person in a state of [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]], except when a majority of Jews are in such a state (''[[Pesahim]]'' 66b), and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a [[quorum]] of 30 (''Pesahim'' 64b). In the Temple, the [[Levites]] sang [[Hallel]] while the [[Kohen|priests]] performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (''Pesahim'' 91b).\n\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the [[mitzvah]] of the ''Korban Pesach'' is memorialized in the ''Seder Korban Pesach'', a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the ''[[Mincha]]'' (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th of Nisan,<ref name=Kitov>{{cite book|first=Eliyahu|last=Kitov|title=The Book of Our Heritage: The Jewish Year and Its Days of Significance|publisher=Feldheim|year=1997|page=562}}</ref> and in the form of the ''[[zeroa]]'', a symbolic food placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted [[humerus|shankbone]] (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the [[afikoman]] substitutes for the eating of the ''Korban Pesach'' at the end of the Seder meal ([[Mishnah]] Pesachim 119a). Many [[Sephardi Jews]] have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the ''Korban Pesach''.\n\n==Removing all leaven (''chametz'')==\n{{see also|Chametz#Removal of chametz}}\n[[File:BiurChametz2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins]]\nLeaven, in Hebrew ''[[Chametz#What is chametz?|chametz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05d7\u05de\u05e5</big> ''\u1e25amets'', \"[[leavening]]\") is made from one of five types of grains<ref name=Pomerantz/> combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes.

[[Halakha|Jewish law]] requires the elimination of [[olive]]-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the cracks of kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small.

Modern observance may also include sealing cabinets and drawers which contain \"Chametz\" shut by using adhesive tape, which serves a similar purpose to a lock but also shows evidence of tampering.

This sale is considered completely binding according to Halakha, and at any time during the holiday, the buyer may come to take or partake of his property.

If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n:Blessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\n\nIn Hebrew:\n\n\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05de\u05e5\n\n(''ber\u016bkh otah, YEH'WAH alihiyn\u016b, melekh ha-\u2018\u00f4lam, eser qedesh-n\u016b be-mits\u016btayu we-tsewin\u016b \u2018al be-\u00f4r \u1e25amets'')\n\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\n\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by [[candle]]light, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the ''chametz''. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\n\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for ''chametz'' will be in vain (''bracha l'vatala'') if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some ''chametz'' will be found.\n\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\n==Morning of 14th of Nissan==\nNote that if the 14th of Nissan is [[Shabbat]], many of the below will be celebrated on the 13th instead [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|due to restrictions in place during Shabbat]].\n\n===Fast of the Firstborn===\n{{main|Fast of the Firstborn|siyum}}\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on [[Motza'ei Shabbat]]), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the [[Fast of the Firstborn]] which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:29|HE}}, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a ''[[siyum]]'' (ceremony marking the completion of a section of [[Torah learning]]) right after [[Shacharit|morning prayers]], and the [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\n\n===Burning and nullification of leaven===\nOn the morning of the 14th of [[Nisan]], any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (''s'rayfat chametz''). The head of the household repeats the declaration of ''biyur chametz'', declaring any ''chametz'' that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\nShould more ''chametz'' actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\n\nUnlike ''chametz'', which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\n\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" [[Passover sacrifice]] (''Korban Pesach'') has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish temple]] approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\n\nHowever, the Paschal lamb is still a principal feature of [[Beta Israel|Falashah]], Karaite and Samaritan observance.\n\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3\u201311|HE}}.\n\n==Separate kosher for Passover utensils and dishes==\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat ''chametz'' (leaven) during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}), observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with ''chametz'', for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some ''chametz'' utensils can be immersed in boiling water (''[[Hagalah|hagalat keilim]]'') to purge them of any traces of ''chametz'' that may have accumulated during the year. Many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that [[glass]] does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a [[blow torch]] to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called ''libun gamur'').<ref name=\"WSJblowtorch\">{{Cite news |last= Lagnado |first= Lucette |title= As Passover Nears, These Rabbis Are Getting Out Their Blowtorches |pages= A1 |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |location= New York |date= April 18, 2011 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704628404576264751651607740 }}</ref>\n\n==Matzah==\n{{main|Matzo}}\n[[Image:Machine-made Shmura Matzo.jpg|thumb|250px|Machine made ''shmura matza'']]\n\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is [[matzo]], an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:18|HE}}</ref> Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the [[Passover Seder]]. There are several explanations for this.\n\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=60495 |title=Thought For Food: An Overview of the Seder | work =AskMoses.com \u2013 Judaism, Ask a Rabbi \u2013 Live}}</ref> Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to [[hardtack]]), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\n\nMatzo has also been called ''Lechem Oni'' (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\"). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.<ref>[http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=450 What is the kabbalistic view on chametz?] by Rabbi Yossi Marcus</ref>\n\n[[File:Shmura Matzo2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hand made ''shmura matzo'']]\n\n''Shmura matzo'' (\"watched\" or \"guarded\" matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities.

In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"''[[Chavurah|chaburas]]''\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. ''Chaburas'' also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\n\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,<ref name=Pomerantz/> as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the ''chabura'' members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170657/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |title=Making Matzah the Old-Fashioned Way |publisher=The Jewish Federations of North America |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\n\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now ''chametz'', and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\n\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.<ref name=Pomerantz/>\n\n==Passover seder==\n[[File:Sedertable.jpg|thumb|250px|Table set for the Passover Seder]]\n{{Main|Passover Seder}}\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities outside [[Land of Israel|Israel]]) for a special dinner called a [[Passover seder|seder]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8</big> ''seder'' \u2013 derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the [[Haggadah]]. Four cups of wine are consumed at various stages in the narrative. The Haggadah divides the night's procedure into 15 parts:\n\n#''Kadeish/ Qad\u0113sh'' <big>\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9</big> \u2013 recital of [[Kiddush]] blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine\n#''Urchatz/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25ats/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 the [[Handwashing in Judaism|washing of the hands]] \u2013 without blessing\n#''Karpas'' <big>\u05db\u05e8\u05e4\u05e1</big> \u2013 dipping of the ''[[karpas]]'' in salt water\n#''Yachatz/ Ya\u1e25ats/ Ya\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d9\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 breaking the middle matzo; the larger piece becomes the ''[[afikoman]]'' which is eaten later during the ritual of ''Tzafun''\n#''Maggid/ Maggiyd'' <big>\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3</big> \u2013 retelling the Passover story, including the recital of \"[[the four questions]]\" and drinking of the second cup of wine\n#''Rachtzah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7tsah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e8\u05d7\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 second washing of the hands \u2013 with blessing\n#''Motzi/ M\u00f4tsiy\u2019/ M\u00f4\u1e63iy\u2019'' <big>\u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0</big> \u2013 traditional blessing before eating [[bread]] products\n#''Matzo/ Ma\u1e63o'' <big>\u05de\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 blessing before eating [[matzo]]\n#''Maror'' <big>\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8</big> \u2013 eating of the [[maror]]\n#''Koreich/ Kor\u0113kh'' <big>\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 eating of a sandwich made of matzo and maror\n#''Shulchan oreich/ Sh\u016bl\u00b7\u1e25an \u2018\u00f4r\u0113kh'' <big>\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d7\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 lit. \"set table\" \u2013 the serving of the holiday meal\n#''Tzafun/ Tsaf\u016bn/ \u1e62af\u016bn'' <big>\u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df</big> \u2013 eating of the ''[[afikoman]]''\n#''Bareich/ Bar\u0113kh'' <big>\u05d1\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 [[Birkat Hamazon|blessing after the meal]] and drinking of the third cup of wine\n#''[[Hallel]]'' <big>\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc</big> \u2013 recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine\n#''Nirtzah/ Niyr\u00b7tsah/ Niyr\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 conclusion\n\nThese 15 parts parallel the 15 steps in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on which the [[Levite]]s stood during Temple services, and which were memorialized in the 15 [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] (#120\u2013134) known as ''Shir HaMa'a lot'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea}} ''shiyr ha-ma\u2018al\u00f4th'', \"[[Song of Ascents|Songs of Ascent]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kolhator.org.il/shir_hamaalot.php |title=Shir Ha Ma'a lot |publisher=Kolhator.org.il |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of [[Kiddush]] which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the ''[[afikoman]]'', the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including ''[[Chad Gadya]]'' (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\n\n===Maror===\n[[File:3TypesMaror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Types of maror: grated [[horseradish]], [[romaine lettuce]], whole horseradish root]]\n[[Maror]] (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5 ''ve-yimareru'') their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver seder plate]]\n\n===Four cups of wine===\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of [[the Exodus]], the drinking of the third cup concludes [[Birkat Hamazon]] and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel.\n\n===The four questions and participation of children===\n{{See also|The four questions}}\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, ''Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh'' (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\n\n:Why is this night different from all other nights?\n:On all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\n:On all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\n:On all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\n:On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\n\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about [[The Exodus|the Exodus from Egypt]], the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n\n===Afikoman===\n[[File:Haggadah 15th cent.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century Haggadah]]\nThe ''afikoman'' \u2013 an integral part of the Seder itself \u2013 is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called ''Yachatz'', the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the ''afikoman''. Many families use the ''afikoman'' as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the ''afikoman'' and offering a prize for its return.<ref name=Pomerantz/> Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the ''afikoman'' and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the ''afikoman'' must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, ''Tzafun''.\n\n===Concluding songs===\n\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\". This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. \"[[Echad Mi Yodea]]\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"[[Chad Gadya]]\" are allegorical.\n\n==Counting of the Omer==\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,<ref>[[Karaite Jews]] begin the count on the Sunday within the holiday week. This leads to Shavuot for the Karaites always falling on a Sunday.</ref> Jews begin the practice of the [[Counting of the Omer]], a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of [[Shavuot]] 50 days hence. Each night after the [[Maariv|evening prayer service]], men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs: Historical and Contemporary|first=Sol|last=Scharfstein|pages=36\u201337|year=1999|isbn=0881256269}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple stood in Jerusalem]], a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of Unleavened Bread. [[Josephus]] writes:<blockquote>\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an ''assaron'' for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.<ref name=\"Barley\"/></blockquote> Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\n\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and [[mitzvot]] before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering \u2013 a measure of barley, typically animal fodder \u2013 and the Shavuot offering \u2013 two loaves of wheat bread, human food \u2013 symbolizes the transition process.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of the Omer|first=Ellen|last=Cohn|title=Ecology and the Jewish Spirit: Where Nature and the Sacred Meet|editor-first=Ellen|editor-last=Bernstein|page=164|year=2000|isbn=1580230822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8qvQcZeAv4C&pg=PA164}}</ref>\n\n==Chol HaMoed: The intermediate days of Passover==\nIn [[Land of Israel|Israel]], Passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major [[Jewish holidays]].

In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. [[Reform Judaism]] observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\n\nLike the holiday of [[Sukkot]], the intermediary days of Passover are known as [[Chol HaMoed]] (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as [[macaroon]]s and homemade candies.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nPassover cake recipes call for [[potato starch]] or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use [[matzo farfel]] (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base. For families with [[Eastern Europe]]an backgrounds, [[borsht]], a soup made with [[beet]]s, is a Passover tradition.<ref>https://forward.com/food/134439/the-perfect-borscht/</ref>\n[[File:Wonder Pot cake.jpg|150px|thumb|A Passover brownie cake baked in a [[Wonder Pot]].]]\nWhile kosher for Passover packaged goods are available in stores, some families opt to cook everything from scratch during Passover week.

There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities ''[[Tachanun]]'', a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torah.org/learning/yomtov-omer-5755-vol1no21/|title=YomTov, Vol. I, # 21 - Pesach Sheni, The \"Second\" Pesach \u2022 Torah.org}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional foods==\n[[File:Matzah brei serving.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Matzah brei]] (fried [[matzo]] and egg), a popular Passover dish]]\nBecause the house is free of leaven (''chametz'') for eight days, the Jewish household typically eats different foods during the week of Passover.

Alstat]], an early leader of [[Conservative Judaism]], known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills, wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the Passover story during the rise of Nazi persecution and terror:<ref>[[Canadian Jewish Chronicle|The Canadian Jewish Chronicle]], March 31, 1939</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps in our generation the counsel of our Talmudic sages may seem superfluous, for today the story of our enslavement in Egypt is kept alive not only by ritualistic symbolism, but even more so by tragic realism. We are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment. Are not our hapless brethren in the German Reich eating \"the bread of affliction\"? Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?<br />And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to \"visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.\" It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit. Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall \"be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.</blockquote>\n\n==Influence on other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:The two disciples, Peter and John, are sent to prepare the Passover (f. 32) Cropped.jpg|thumb|The two disciples, [[st Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], were sent by Christ to prepare the Passover]]\n{{see also|Easter|Passover (Christian holiday)}}\n\nThe Christian celebration of [[Good Friday]] finds its roots in the Jewish feast of Passover, the evening on which Jesus was crucified as the [[Lamb of God|Passover Lamb]].<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Er-QZeW12tUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = The Jewish Pesach and the Origins of the Christian Easter|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|first1=Clemens|last1=Leonhard |year=2012|accessdate = June 14, 2018|isbn = 978-3110927818}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FqKAT_eTKMfA0AG7xMHXBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Pascha%22%20name&f=false|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=Long before this controversy, Ex 12 as a story of origins and its ritual expression had been firmly fixed in the Christian imagination. Though before the final decades of the second century only accessible as an exegetical tradition, already in the Paulin letters the Exodus saga is deeply involved with the celebration of bath and meal. Even here, this relationship does not suddenly appear, but represents developments in ritual narrative that mus have begun at the very inception of the Christian message. Jesus of Nazareth was crucifed during Pesach-Mazzot, an event that a new covenant people of Jews and Gentiles both saw as definitive and defining. Ex 12 is thus one of the few reliable guides for tracing the synergism among ritual, text, and kerygma before the Council of Nicaea.|page=21|year= 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=84USbbs1jfUC&pg=PA117&dq=Passover+Lamb+Lamb+of+God&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DK-AT4vlMqjm0QGz1ICXCA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Passover%20Lamb%20Lamb%20of%20God&f=false|title = The Destroyer and the Lamb: The Relationship Between Angelomorphic and Lamb Christology in the Book of Revelation|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|author= Matthias Reinhard Hoffmann|quote=1.2.2. ''Christ as the Passover Lamb from Exodus'' A number of features throughout Revelation seem to correspond to Exodus 12: The connection of Lamb and Passover, a salvific effect of the Lamb's blood and the punishment of God's (and His people's) opponents from Exodus 12 may possibly be reflected within the settings of the Apocalypse. The concept of Christ as a Passover lamb is generally not unknown in NT or early Christian literature, as can for instance be seen in 1 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Peter 1:19 or Justin Martyr's writing (''Dial''. 111:3). In the Gospel of John, especially, this connection between Christ and Passover is made very explicit.|ISBN=3-16-148778-8|page=117|year= 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also |Day of Ashura#Significance of Ashura for Sunni Muslims}}\n\nIn the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sect of [[Islam]], it is recommended to fast on the day of [[Ashura]]h (10th of [[Muharram]]) based on [[hadith|narrations]] attributed to [[Muhammad]]. The fast is celebrated in order to commemorate the day when Moses and his followers were saved from Pharaoh by [[God in Islam|God]] by creating a path in the Red Sea (i.e. [[The Exodus]]). According to [[Muslim]] tradition, the Jews of [[Medina|Madinah]] used to fast on the tenth of Muharram in observance of Passover. In narrations recorded in the al-Hadith (sayings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad) of Sahih al-Bukhari, it is recommended that Muslims fast on this day. It is also stipulated that its observance should differ from the feast of Passover which is celebrated by the Jews, and he stated that Muslims should fast for two days instead of one, either on the 9th and 10th day or on the 10th and 11th day of Muharram.<ref name=\"Volume 3, Book 31, Number 222\">{{cite book|author=[[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]|title=[[Sahih Bukhari]]}}</ref>{{rp|Volume 3, Book 31, Number 222}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Judaism}}\n* [[Gebrochts]]\n* [[Haggadah of Pesach]]\n* [[Jewish greetings#Holidays|Jewish greetings]]\n* [[Kitniyot]]\n* [[Quartodecimanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Passover}}\n{{NIE Poster|year=1905}}\n* [http://www.reformjudaism.org/jewish-holidays/passover/ Passover Resources \u2013 ReformJudaism.org]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081011124755/http://www.passover.net/ Guide to Passover \u2013 chabad.org]\n* [http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/category/pesah/ 'Peninei Halachah' Jewish Law \u2013 Yhb.org.il ]\n* [http://www.aish.com/h/pes/mm/48972121.html Aish.com Passover Primer]\n* [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11933-passover Jewish Encyclopedia: Passover]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100304151058/http://www.akhlah.com/holidays/pesach/passover.php Akhlah: The Jewish Children's Learning Network]\n* [http://www.yeshiva.co/collection/default.aspx/Pesach All about Pesach]\n* [http://jewishholidaysonline.com/pesach Secular dates for passover]\n* {{NYTtopic|subjects/p/passover}}\n\n{{Passover Footer}}\n{{Jewish and Israeli holidays}}\n{{US Holidays}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Passover| ]]\n[[Category:Hallel]]\n[[Category:Jewish festivals]]\n[[Category:Moses]]\n[[Category:Nisan observances]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover"}
