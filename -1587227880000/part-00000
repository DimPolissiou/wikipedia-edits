This gambit failed when Seitz unexpectedly withdrew his support, and the preselection was instead won by [[Marlene Kairouz]].

This gambit failed when Seitz unexpectedly withdrew his support, and the preselection was instead won by [[Marlene Kairouz]].

In a cool and cloudy Saturday morning, polesitter [[Tony Stewart]] ran away from the start, his pace not being matched by any of his competitors. [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]] had a great start climbing to 5th place, while [[Eddie Cheever]] went the opposite way losing two additional spots to [[Scott Goodyear]] and a fast-starting [[Buddy Lazier]]. [[Buzz Calkins]] pressured [[Arie Luyendyk]] for second place and eventually passed him on Lap 15, pulling away shortly after. In fourth place, [[Scott Sharp]] lacked some pace, and started developing a loose condition around Lap 30. One of his corrections on Lap 32 made Ward lose the three spots he had gained, as he veered out to avoid an incident, and Stewart got to lap that group of cars by Lap 37, his lead having increased to 15 seconds. Sharp eventually started losing places, and had to do his first pit stop on Lap 45, much earlier than intended.<ref name=\"Raceday\"/>\n\nFrom around Lap 40, smoking was consistently reported out of Calkins' car while braking for Turn 1. Vapor chemtrails coming from the rear wings as a result of the high humidity also caused some confusing reports of smoking for other drivers, among them Stewart.<ref name=\"RaceReport\">{{cite news |url=https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-wdw-report/?y=1997&s=1|title=IRL: WDW report|publisher=Motorsport.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018|date=January 25, 1997}}</ref> His first pit stop on Lap 65 was a slow one, depriving him of putting a lap on Calkins and Luyendyk. [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]] had problems with his gearbox on his pit stop and slowed on track shortly after, having to retire from the race. After the first round of stops, Cheever was up to fourth place, having passed [[Scott Goodyear]] on track on Lap 50 and [[Buddy Lazier]] in the pit stop window. Running a race of his own, Stewart got around Luyendyk on Lap 79. Three laps later, [[Buzz Calkins]], who was bound to have the same fate, slowed on track after mistakenly turning off a switch in his car, trying to nurse his engine problems. He got back up to speed shortly after, in third place.\n\nLeading a pack of lapped cars in 13th place, six laps down, rookie [[Jeret Schroeder]] spun on his own on the exit of Turn 1 and crashed into the wall. The trail of cars that followed him slowed suddenly, and [[Arie Luyendyk]] lost control of his car trying to avoid them, crashing into the inside wall. Both incidents happened at reduced speeds, but the damage took both drivers out of the race, and caused a race-changing caution.<ref name=\"Raceday\"/> With rain looming in the background as a strong possibility, and the race being past the halfway point, most of the drivers elected to do an earlier second pit stop, hoping that rain appeared before Lap 170, with the exception of race leader [[Tony Stewart]], [[Marco Greco]] and [[Jim Guthrie (racing driver)|Jim Guthrie]], who stuck to their two-stop strategy. Also, having stopped just before the caution, [[Scott Sharp]] restarted the race in front of [[Scott Goodyear]] and [[Buddy Lazier]], who passed the Canadian a few laps later, although Sharp would eventually lose position with both drivers within 30 laps.\n\nAfter his second green-flag pit stop on Lap 130, Stewart rejoined the track some 20 seconds behind [[Buzz Calkins]], and cautiosly let [[Eddie Cheever]] take second place while running on cold tires, getting by him again on Lap 143. Stewart was trying to make up a 10-second gap with the leader when, two laps later, Calkins slowed on track with a blown engine. That gave the lead back to Stewart, only for him to spun a few seconds later in Turn 3, damaging his rear wing and puncturing his right rear tire against the outside wall. It was thought that the spin had been caused by Stewart running into some debris from Calkins' blown engine, but he later stated that it had been caused by an oil leak in his car. Both drivers retired from the race while the caution was out, and heavy rain started falling on the track less than five minutes after their incidents.<ref name=\"Raceday\"/>\n\nIRL officials brought out the red flag on Lap 149. [[Eddie Cheever]] had inherited the lead during the caution, and would be later proclaimed as the winner after the race was called with 51 laps to go. This gave Cheever, who had not led a lap under green flag conditions, his first Indy car win after seven years, and the first for a driver-owner since [[A. J. Foyt]] at the [[1981 Pocono 500]]. It also ended a long winless drought in Cheever's career: it was his first win on any series since the [[1988 1000 km of Fuji]], his first win in an open-wheel car since the [[1979 European Formula Two Championship|1979 Formula 2]] race at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]], and the first major open-wheel victory of his career, having scored 9 podiums without a win in his ten-year F1 tenure, and another four in CART.\n\nDuring the caution, [[Buddy Lazier]], [[Scott Goodyear]] and [[Scott Sharp]] made a pit stop, but [[Mike Groff]], who had run ninth for most of the race, didn't follow suit, gaining three places on all of them for what would be the best finish of his career in second place, extending his championship lead to 10 points over [[Buzz Calkins]]. Also, Lazier's pit stop was significantly slower, which made him drop down to fifth place behind Goodyear and Sharp. [[Marco Greco]] got his third top 10 finish in a row with his two stop strategy, the same that propelled [[Jim Guthrie (racing driver)|Jim Guthrie]] into his best result at that moment in sixth position in front of the unsung [[Davey Hamilton]]. Spaniard [[Ferm\u00edn V\u00e9lez]] was the last running car in ninth place, in another career-best showing. Despite being credited with a 10th-place finish, [[Tony Stewart]] failed to see the checkered flag for the fifth IRL race in a row, having only finished a race in his first start at Orlando the previous year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

In a cool and cloudy Saturday morning, polesitter [[Tony Stewart]] ran away from the start, his pace not being matched by any of his competitors. [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]] had a great start climbing to 5th place, while [[Eddie Cheever]] went the opposite way losing two additional spots to [[Scott Goodyear]] and a fast-starting [[Buddy Lazier]]. [[Buzz Calkins]] pressured [[Arie Luyendyk]] for second place and eventually passed him on Lap 15, pulling away shortly after. In fourth place, [[Scott Sharp]] lacked some pace, and started developing a loose condition around Lap 30. One of his corrections on Lap 32 made Ward lose the three spots he had gained, as he veered out to avoid an incident, and Stewart got to lap that group of cars by Lap 37, his lead having increased to 15 seconds. Sharp eventually started losing places, and had to do his first pit stop on Lap 45, much earlier than intended.<ref name=\"Raceday\"/>\n\nFrom around Lap 40, smoking was consistently reported out of Calkins' car while braking for Turn 1. Vapor chemtrails coming from the rear wings as a result of the high humidity also caused some confusing reports of smoking for other drivers, among them Stewart.<ref name=\"RaceReport\">{{cite news |url=https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-wdw-report/?y=1997&s=1|title=IRL: WDW report|publisher=Motorsport.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018|date=January 25, 1997}}</ref> His first pit stop on Lap 65 was a slow one, depriving him of putting a lap on Calkins and Luyendyk. [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]] had problems with his gearbox on his pit stop and slowed on track shortly after, having to retire from the race. After the first round of stops, Cheever was up to fourth place, having passed [[Scott Goodyear]] on track on Lap 50 and [[Buddy Lazier]] in the pit stop window. Running a race of his own, Stewart got around Luyendyk on Lap 79. Three laps later, [[Buzz Calkins]], who was bound to have the same fate, slowed on track after mistakenly turning off a switch in his car, trying to nurse his engine problems. He got back up to speed shortly after, in third place.\n\nLeading a pack of lapped cars in 13th place, six laps down, rookie [[Jeret Schroeder]] spun on his own on the exit of Turn 1 and crashed into the wall. The trail of cars that followed him slowed suddenly, and [[Arie Luyendyk]] lost control of his car trying to avoid them, crashing into the inside wall. Both incidents happened at reduced speeds, but the damage took both drivers out of the race, and caused a race-changing caution.<ref name=\"Raceday\"/> With rain looming in the background as a strong possibility, and the race being past the halfway point, most of the drivers elected to do an earlier second pit stop, hoping that rain appeared before Lap 170, with the exception of race leader [[Tony Stewart]], [[Marco Greco]] and [[Jim Guthrie (racing driver)|Jim Guthrie]], who stuck to their two-stop strategy. Also, having stopped just before the caution, [[Scott Sharp]] restarted the race in front of [[Scott Goodyear]] and [[Buddy Lazier]], who passed the Canadian a few laps later, although Sharp would eventually lose position with both drivers within 30 laps.\n\nAfter his second green-flag pit stop on Lap 130, Stewart rejoined the track some 20 seconds behind [[Buzz Calkins]], and cautiosly let [[Eddie Cheever]] take second place while running on cold tires, getting by him again on Lap 143. Stewart was trying to make up a 10-second gap with the leader when, two laps later, Calkins slowed on track with a blown engine. That gave the lead back to Stewart, only for him to spun a few seconds later in Turn 3, damaging his rear wing and puncturing his right rear tire against the outside wall. It was thought that the spin had been caused by Stewart running into some debris from Calkins' blown engine, but he later stated that it had been caused by an oil leak in his car. Both drivers retired from the race while the caution was out, and heavy rain started falling on the track less than five minutes after their incidents.<ref name=\"Raceday\"/>\n\nIRL officials brought out the red flag on Lap 149. [[Eddie Cheever]] had inherited the lead during the caution, and would be later proclaimed as the winner after the race was called with 51 laps to go. This gave Cheever, who had not led a lap under green flag conditions, his first Indy car win after seven years, and the first for a driver-owner since [[A. J. Foyt]] at the [[1981 Pocono 500]]. It also ended a long winless drought in Cheever's career: it was his first win on any series since the [[1988 1000 km of Fuji]], his first win in an open-wheel car since the [[1979 European Formula Two Championship|1979 Formula 2]] race at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]], and the first major open-wheel victory of his career, having scored 9 podiums without a win in his ten-year F1 tenure, and another four in CART.\n\nDuring the caution, [[Buddy Lazier]], [[Scott Goodyear]] and [[Scott Sharp]] made a pit stop, but [[Mike Groff]], who had run ninth for most of the race, didn't follow suit, gaining three places on all of them for what would be the best finish of his career in second place, extending his championship lead to 10 points over [[Buzz Calkins]]. Also, Lazier's pit stop was significantly slower, which made him drop down to fifth place behind Goodyear and Sharp. [[Marco Greco]] got his third top 10 finish in a row with his two stop strategy, the same that propelled [[Jim Guthrie (racing driver)|Jim Guthrie]] into his best result at that moment in sixth position in front of the unsung [[Davey Hamilton]]. Spaniard [[Ferm\u00edn V\u00e9lez]] was the last running car in ninth place, in another career-best showing. Despite being credited with a 10th-place finish, [[Tony Stewart]] failed to see the checkered flag for the fifth IRL race in a row, having only finished a race in his first start at Orlando the previous year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The name Ugric is derived from [[Ugrians]], an archaic exonym for the [[Magyars]] (Hungarians) and [[Yugra]], a region in north-west Russia. \n\nUgric includes three subgroups: [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Khanty language|Khanty]], and [[Mansi language|Mansi]]. The last two have traditionally been considered single languages, though their main dialects are sufficiently distinct that they may also be considered small subfamilies of three to four languages each. A common '''Proto-Ugric language''' is posited to have been spoken from the end of the 3rd&nbsp;millennium&nbsp;BC until the first half of the 1st&nbsp;millennium&nbsp;BC, in Western [[Siberia]], east of the southern [[Ural mountains]]. Of the three languages, Khanty and Mansi have traditionally been set apart from Hungarian as [[Ob-Ugric languages|Ob-Ugric]], though features uniting Mansi and Hungarian in particular are known as well.\n\n==Phonetic development==\n\n===Consonants===\nTwo common phonetic features of the Ugric languages are a rearrangement of the [[Proto-Uralic]] (PU) system of [[sibilant consonant]]s and a lenition of [[velar consonant]]s:<ref name = \"Sml88\">{{citation\n| last = Sammallahti\n| first = Pekka\n| author-link = Pekka Sammallahti\n| year = 1988\n| chapter = Historical phonology of the Uralic languages, with special reference to Samoyed, Ugric, and Permic\n| title = The Uralic Languages: Description, History and Foreign Influences\n| editor = Denis Sinor\n| pages = 478\u2013554\n| publisher = Brill\n| publication-place = Leiden\n}}</ref>\n* PU *s and *[[\u0161]] merged and developed into a non-sibilant sound (possibly {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} or [[\u026c|{{IPA|[\u026c]}}]]), yielding Mansi /t/, Khanty *[[\u026c]] \u2192 /t/ or /l/ (depending on dialect), and lost in Hungarian.\n* PU *[[\u015b]] depalatalized to *s.\n* PU medial *x, *k, *w generally lenited to *[[\u0263]].\nIt has however been pointed out that these changes are applicable to the [[Samoyedic languages]] as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=H\u00e4kkinen, Jaakko |year=2009 |title=Kantauralin ajoitus ja paikannus: perustelut puntarissa |journal=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Aikakauskirja |volume=92 |url=http://www.sgr.fi/susa/92/hakkinen.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe consonant cluster *lm is in the Ugric languages mostly reduced to plain {{IPA|/m/}} (e.g. PU [[wiktionary:Appendix:Proto-Uralic/\u015bilm\u00e4|*\u015bilm\u00e4]] 'eye' \u2192 Hungarian ''szem'', Mansi \u0441\u0430\u043c {{IPA|/sam/}}, Khanty \u0441\u0435\u043c {{IPA|/sem/}}). A peculiar exception is the numeral '3', in which Hungarian (''h\u00e1rom'') and Mansi (\u0445\u0443\u0440\u044d\u043c {{IPA|/xu\u02d0r\u0259m/}}) point to an original cluster *rm, whereas the rest of the Uralic family suggests original *lm (Khanty \u0445\u043e\u043b\u04d9\u043c, Finnish ''kolme'', Estonian ''kolm'', Inari Sami ''kulma'', Erzya \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043c\u043e, etc.) This has frequently been listed as an argument for considering Hungarian more closely related to Mansi than Khanty. The reverse has also been suggested\u2014Hungarian and Mansi retaining the original form of the numeral, whereas Khanty and all the [[Finno-Permic languages]] would have innovated {{IPA|/l/}} for some reason.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Janhunen |first=Juha |authorlink=Juha Janhunen |title=Proto-Uralic \u2013 what, where and when? |year=2009 |journal=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia |volume=258 |isbn=978-952-5667-11-0 |issn=0355-0230 |url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust258/sust258_janhunen.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nHungarian and the current literary standard Mansi and Khanty all share a spirantization of Proto-Uralic *k to {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/x/}} before [[back vowel]]s, e.g. 'fish': PU [[wiktionary:Appendix:Proto-Uralic/kala|*kala]] \u2192 Hungarian ''hal'', Mansi \u0445\u0443\u043b {{IPA|/xu\u02d0l/}}, Khanty \u0445\u0443\u043b {{IPA|/xul/}}. This is itself not a common Ugric feature \u2014 {{IPA|/k/}} remains in other Mansi and Khanty dialects (e.g. Eastern Khanty {{IPA|/kul/}}, Southern Mansi {{IPA|/ko\u02d0l/}} 'fish'), but it has been argued to result from a proto-Ugric split of *k to front and back allophones {{IPA|[k]}} ~ {{IPA|[q]}}, with the latter then independently spirantizing in each three cases.\n\nThe three Ugric varieties also share the lateralization of Proto-Uralic *[[\u03b4]] to *l (as do the [[Permic languages]]), but it is possible this postcedes the emergence of retroflex *[[\u026d]] from PU *l in Khanty.<ref name = \"Sml88\"/> Another possible counterargument is the similar lateralization of the palatalized counterpart *\u03b4\u0301 \u2192 Mansi {{IPA|/l\u02b2/}}, likely to have been a simultaneous change with the lateralization of *[[\u00f0]]. In Khanty the reflex is {{IPA|/j/}}, whereas instances of {{IPA|/l\u02b2/}} also exist, which may suggest a separate development. An original *[[\u013a]] is no longer reconstructed for older stages of Uralic, however, which leaves the origin of Khanty {{IPA|/l\u02b2/}} an open question.\n\nAn innovation clearly limited to the Ugric languages is the development of *[[\u014b]] to *\u014bk, though there are numerous exceptions in each language to this.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe development of the vowel system remains subject to interpretation. All three Ugric branches contrast [[vowel length]]; in Hungarian this is late, generally derived by [[compensatory lengthening]] after loss of unstressed vowels and *\u0263. The Ob-Ugric languages, however, derive their quantity contrasts mainly from PU quality contrasts: thus for example in Northern Mansi, PU [[wiktionary:Appendix:Proto-Uralic/pelj\u00e4|*pelj\u00e4]] 'ear' \u2192 *p\u00e4\u013a \u2192 {{IPA|/pal\u02b2/}}, but PU [[wiktionary:Appendix:Proto-Uralic/p\u00e4l\u00e4|*p\u00e4l\u00e4]] 'half' \u2192 *p\u00e4\u00e4l \u2192 {{IPA|/pa\u02d0l/}}.\n\nContrasts between PU stem vowels (*a/*\u00e4 vs. *i) do not survive as such in modern Ugric languages, but they commonly leave their mark on vowel qualities in the first syllable, suggesting retention of the contrast at least to the Proto-Ugric stage. For example, PU *\u0144'''\u00ef'''xl'''i''' 'arrow' \u2192 Hungarian ''ny\u00edl'', but PU *m'''\u00ef'''ks'''a''' 'liver' \u2192 Hungarian ''m\u00e1j''. Remnants of original stem vowels are also found in the oldest Hungarian records, such as PU *konta 'group, hunting party' \u2192 Old Hungarian ''hodu'' 'army' (\u2192 Modern Hungarian ''had'').\n\n==Lexical features==\nThe Ugric languages share considerable amounts of common lexicon not found in the other Uralic languages. This includes both basic vocabulary, e.g. 'fire' (Hungarian ''t\u0171z'', Mansi \u0442\u0430\u045e\u0442 /ta\u02d0wt/, Khanty \u0442\u0443\u0442 /tut/) as well as more specialized terminology, particularly the word for 'horse' (H ''l\u00f3, lov-'', M \u043b\u0443\u045e /luw/, Kh \u043b\u0430\u0432 /law/) and related items such as 'saddle' (H ''nyer\u00ebg'', M \u043d\u0430\u0433\u044d\u0440 /na\u0263\u0259r/). This latter fact together with an importance of horse motifs in Ob-Ugric folklore has been used to argue for locating Proto-Ugric in the southernmost parts of Siberia, in close contact with nomadic steppe peoples if not nomadic themselves. Some loanwords from such sources into Ugric are known as well, perhaps most prominently the numeral '7': *\u03b8\u00e4pt(V) \u2192 H ''h\u00e9t'',{{efn|The initial /h/ is unetymological, and has been explained as influence of the adjacent numeral ''hat'' '6'.}} M \u0441\u0430\u0442 /sat/, Kh \u0442\u0430\u043f\u04d9\u0442 /tap\u0259t/ (from an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] source; cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''sapt\u00e1'', [[Avestan]] ''hapta'', both from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*sapt\u00e1'' < [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*sept\u1e3f\u0325}}'').\n\n''Names'' of two of the Ugric peoples are cognate as well: Hungarian ''magyar'' 'Hungarian' can be equated with ''Mansi'' (from an original root *m\u00e4\u0144\u0107-). A related word in Khanty denotes a specific [[phratry]].\n\nA common derivational innovation is seen in the word for 'louse': Proto-Uralic *t\u00e4ji \u2192 *t\u00e4(j)-ktVmV \u2192 H ''tet\u0171'', M \u0442\u0430\u043a\u044d\u043c, Kh \u0442\u0435\u0432\u0442\u04d9\u043c.\n\n==Structural features==\n* An original [[ablative]] case marked by ''-l''\n* A series of original [[locative]] cases, formed from postpositions derived from a pronoun root ''*n\u00e4''\n* [[Possessive suffix]]es are placed before [[case suffix]]es, not after them as in the other Uralic languages\n* A class of \"instable\" verb stems, in which alternation between CV and CVC stem variants occurs, e.g. ''to take': Hungarian ''v\u00eb-'' ~ ''v\u00ebv-'' ~ ''[[wiktionary:vesz|v\u00ebsz-]]'', Mansi *wi- ~ *w\u00e6j-, Khanty *w\u0115- ~ *w\u0115j-.\n* Distinct attributive and nominal forms of the numeral '2': Hungarian ''[[wiktionary:k\u00e9t|k\u00e9t]]'' vs. ''[[wiktionary:kett\u0151|kett\u0151]]'', Mansi \u043a\u0438\u0442 vs. \u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0433, Khanty (Northern) \u043a\u0430\u0442 vs. \u043a\u0430\u0442\u04d9\u043d, (Eastern) {{IPA|/k\u00e6t/}} vs. {{IPA|/k\u00e6t\u0259\u0263/}}\n* Found in Hungarian and Mansi, an extended form of the [[caritive]] suffix containing ''-l''.\n* Distinct verb conjugations according to the [[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitivity]] of the verb. It is sometimes termed as \u201cdefinite\u201d versus \u201cindefinite\u201d conjugation, because also the [[definiteness]] of the [[Object (grammar)|object]] can play a role when selecting between the two. This feature is within the Uralic family also found in the [[Mordvinic languages]], and it is likely to not represent a common Ugric innovation; the particular details of the construction are different in all three Ugric languages.\n* Verbal prefixes, which modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways\n\n;Examples from Mansi\n\n\u0113l(a) \u2013 'forwards, onwards, away'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| j\u014dm- 'to go, to stride' || \u0113l-j\u014dm- 'to go away/on'\n|-\n| tinal- 'to sell' || \u0113l-tinal- 'to sell off'\n|}\n\nxot \u2013 'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| min- 'to go' || xot-min- 'to go away, to stop'\n|-\n| roxt- 'to be frightened' || xot-roxt- 'to take fright suddenly'\n|}\n\n;Examples from Hungarian\n\nel \u2013 'away, off'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ugrik 'to jump' || elugrik 'to jump away'\n|-\n| mosolyog 'to smile' || elmosolyodik 'to start to smile' (implying a lack of control)\n|}\n\nki \u2013 'out (of)'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ugrik 'to jump' || kiugrik 'to jump out'\n|-\n| n\u00e9z 'to look' || kin\u00e9z 'to look out'\n|}\n\nIn Hungarian, the [[citation form]] of verbs is the present tense of the 3rd person singular form, which is given here, which does not have any suffixes.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Uralic languages]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n*{{cite journal|last=Honti|first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3|title=Features of Ugric Languages (Observations on the Question of Ugric Unity)|year=1979|pages=1\u201325|volume=29|journal=Acta Linguistica Academia Scientiarum Hungaricae}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Honti|first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3|title=Ugrilainen kantakieli \u2013 erheellinen vai reaalinen hypoteesi?|year=1998|volume=228|journal=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia|isbn=952-5150-15-1}}\n*{{cite book |last=Riese |first=Timothy |title=Vogul: Languages of the World/Materials 158 |url=http://www.lincom.at |publisher=Lincom Europa |year=2001 |isbn=3-89586-231-2}}\n*{{cite book |last=T\u00f6rkenczy |first=Mikl\u00f3s |title=Hungarian Verbs & Essentials of Grammar |publisher=Passport Books |year=1997 |isbn=0-8442-8350-9}}\n\n{{Uralic languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Uralic languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|text=[[Ugri\u0107]], a river in Bosnia, and [[Oghuric languages]]}}\n{{More footnotes|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox language family|name=Ugric|altname=Ugrian|acceptance=controversial|region=[[Hungary]] and Western [[Siberia]]|familycolor=Uralic|fam2=|glotto=none|child1=''[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]''|child2=''[[Khanty language|Khanty]]''|child3=''[[Mansi language|Mansi]]''|map=Lenguas_ugrias.png|mapcaption=The Ugric languages}}\n\nThe '''Ugric''' or '''Ugrian''' languages ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|ju\u02d0|\u0261|r|\u1d7b|k}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|ju\u02d0|\u0261|r|i|\u0259|n}}), are a proposed branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] [[language family]].

This is itself not a common Ugric feature \u2014 {{IPA|/k/}} remains in other Mansi and Khanty dialects (e.g. Eastern Khanty {{IPA|/kul/}}, Southern Mansi {{IPA|/ko\u02d0l/}} 'fish'), but it has been argued to result from a proto-Ugric split of *k to front and back allophones {{IPA|[k]}} ~ {{IPA|[q]}}, with the latter then independently spirantizing in each three cases.\n\nThe three Ugric varieties also share the lateralization of Proto-Uralic *[[\u03b4]] to *l (as do the [[Permic languages]]), but it is possible this postcedes the emergence of retroflex *[[\u026d]] from PU *l in Khanty.<ref name = \"Sml88\"/> Another possible counterargument is the similar lateralization of the palatalized counterpart *\u03b4\u0301 \u2192 Mansi {{IPA|/l\u02b2/}}, likely to have been a simultaneous change with the lateralization of *[[\u00f0]]. In Khanty the reflex is {{IPA|/j/}}, whereas instances of {{IPA|/l\u02b2/}} also exist, which may suggest a separate development. An original *[[\u013a]] is no longer reconstructed for older stages of Uralic, however, which leaves the origin of Khanty {{IPA|/l\u02b2/}} an open question.\n\nAn innovation clearly limited to the Ugric languages is the development of *[[\u014b]] to *\u014bk, though there are numerous exceptions in each language to this.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe development of the vowel system remains subject to interpretation. All three Ugric branches contrast [[vowel length]]; in Hungarian this is late, generally derived by [[compensatory lengthening]] after loss of unstressed vowels and *\u0263. The Ob-Ugric languages, however, derive their quantity contrasts mainly from PU quality contrasts: thus for example in Northern Mansi, PU [[wiktionary:Appendix:Proto-Uralic/pelj\u00e4|*pelj\u00e4]] 'ear' \u2192 *p\u00e4\u013a \u2192 {{IPA|/pal\u02b2/}}, but PU [[wiktionary:Appendix:Proto-Uralic/p\u00e4l\u00e4|*p\u00e4l\u00e4]] 'half' \u2192 *p\u00e4\u00e4l \u2192 {{IPA|/pa\u02d0l/}}.\n\nContrasts between PU stem vowels (*a/*\u00e4 vs. *i) do not survive as such in modern Ugric languages, but they commonly leave their mark on vowel qualities in the first syllable, suggesting retention of the contrast at least to the Proto-Ugric stage. For example, PU *\u0144'''\u00ef'''xl'''i''' 'arrow' \u2192 Hungarian ''ny\u00edl'', but PU *m'''\u00ef'''ks'''a''' 'liver' \u2192 Hungarian ''m\u00e1j''. Remnants of original stem vowels are also found in the oldest Hungarian records, such as PU *konta 'group, hunting party' \u2192 Old Hungarian ''hodu'' 'army' (\u2192 Modern Hungarian ''had'').\n\n==Lexical features==\nThe Ugric languages share considerable amounts of common lexicon not found in the other Uralic languages. This includes both basic vocabulary, e.g. 'fire' (Hungarian ''t\u0171z'', Mansi \u0442\u0430\u045e\u0442 /ta\u02d0wt/, Khanty \u0442\u0443\u0442 /tut/) as well as more specialized terminology, particularly the word for 'horse' (H ''l\u00f3, lov-'', M \u043b\u0443\u045e /luw/, Kh \u043b\u0430\u0432 /law/) and related items such as 'saddle' (H ''nyer\u00ebg'', M \u043d\u0430\u0433\u044d\u0440 /na\u0263\u0259r/). This latter fact together with an importance of horse motifs in Ob-Ugric folklore has been used to argue for locating Proto-Ugric in the southernmost parts of Siberia, in close contact with nomadic steppe peoples if not nomadic themselves. Some loanwords from such sources into Ugric are known as well, perhaps most prominently the numeral '7': *\u03b8\u00e4pt(V) \u2192 H ''h\u00e9t'',{{efn|The initial /h/ is unetymological, and has been explained as influence of the adjacent numeral ''hat'' '6'.}} M \u0441\u0430\u0442 /sat/, Kh \u0442\u0430\u043f\u04d9\u0442 /tap\u0259t/ (from an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] source; cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''sapt\u00e1'', [[Avestan]] ''hapta'', both from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*sapt\u00e1'' < [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*sept\u1e3f\u0325}}'').\n\n''Names'' of two of the Ugric peoples are cognate as well: Hungarian ''magyar'' 'Hungarian' can be equated with ''Mansi'' (from an original root *m\u00e4\u0144\u0107-). A related word in Khanty denotes a specific [[phratry]].\n\nA common derivational innovation is seen in the word for 'louse': Proto-Uralic *t\u00e4ji \u2192 *t\u00e4(j)-ktVmV \u2192 H ''tet\u0171'', M \u0442\u0430\u043a\u044d\u043c, Kh \u0442\u0435\u0432\u0442\u04d9\u043c.\n\n==Structural features==\n* An original [[ablative]] case marked by ''-l''\n* A series of original [[locative]] cases, formed from postpositions derived from a pronoun root ''*n\u00e4''\n* [[Possessive suffix]]es are placed before [[case suffix]]es, not after them as in the other Uralic languages\n* A class of \"instable\" verb stems, in which alternation between CV and CVC stem variants occurs, e.g. ''to take': Hungarian ''v\u00eb-'' ~ ''v\u00ebv-'' ~ ''[[wiktionary:vesz|v\u00ebsz-]]'', Mansi *wi- ~ *w\u00e6j-, Khanty *w\u0115- ~ *w\u0115j-.\n* Distinct attributive and nominal forms of the numeral '2': Hungarian ''[[wiktionary:k\u00e9t|k\u00e9t]]'' vs. ''[[wiktionary:kett\u0151|kett\u0151]]'', Mansi \u043a\u0438\u0442 vs. \u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0433, Khanty (Northern) \u043a\u0430\u0442 vs. \u043a\u0430\u0442\u04d9\u043d, (Eastern) {{IPA|/k\u00e6t/}} vs. {{IPA|/k\u00e6t\u0259\u0263/}}\n* Found in Hungarian and Mansi, an extended form of the [[caritive]] suffix containing ''-l''.\n* Distinct verb conjugations according to the [[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitivity]] of the verb. It is sometimes termed as \u201cdefinite\u201d versus \u201cindefinite\u201d conjugation, because also the [[definiteness]] of the [[Object (grammar)|object]] can play a role when selecting between the two. This feature is within the Uralic family also found in the [[Mordvinic languages]], and it is likely to not represent a common Ugric innovation; the particular details of the construction are different in all three Ugric languages.\n* Verbal prefixes, which modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways\n\n;Examples from Mansi\n\n\u0113l(a) \u2013 'forwards, onwards, away'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| j\u014dm- 'to go, to stride' || \u0113l-j\u014dm- 'to go away/on'\n|-\n| tinal- 'to sell' || \u0113l-tinal- 'to sell off'\n|}\n\nxot \u2013 'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| min- 'to go' || xot-min- 'to go away, to stop'\n|-\n| roxt- 'to be frightened' || xot-roxt- 'to take fright suddenly'\n|}\n\n;Examples from Hungarian\n\nel \u2013 'away, off'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ugrik 'to jump' || elugrik 'to jump away'\n|-\n| mosolyog 'to smile' || elmosolyodik 'to start to smile' (implying a lack of control)\n|}\n\nki \u2013 'out (of)'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ugrik 'to jump' || kiugrik 'to jump out'\n|-\n| n\u00e9z 'to look' || kin\u00e9z 'to look out'\n|}\n\nIn Hungarian, the [[citation form]] of verbs is the present tense of the 3rd person singular form, which is given here, which does not have any suffixes.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Uralic languages]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n*{{cite journal|last=Honti|first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3|title=Features of Ugric Languages (Observations on the Question of Ugric Unity)|year=1979|pages=1\u201325|volume=29|journal=Acta Linguistica Academia Scientiarum Hungaricae}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Honti|first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3|title=Ugrilainen kantakieli \u2013 erheellinen vai reaalinen hypoteesi?|year=1998|volume=228|journal=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia|isbn=952-5150-15-1}}\n*{{cite book |last=Riese |first=Timothy |title=Vogul: Languages of the World/Materials 158 |url=http://www.lincom.at |publisher=Lincom Europa |year=2001 |isbn=3-89586-231-2}}\n*{{cite book |last=T\u00f6rkenczy |first=Mikl\u00f3s |title=Hungarian Verbs & Essentials of Grammar |publisher=Passport Books |year=1997 |isbn=0-8442-8350-9}}\n\n{{Uralic languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Uralic languages]]\n", "name_user": "SrpskiAnonimac", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugric_languages"}

{"title_page": "Clerical celibacy", "text_new": "{{generalize|date=January 2014}}\n'''Clerical celibacy''' is the requirement in certain [[religion]]s that some or all members of the [[clergy]] be unmarried. These religions consider that, outside of marriage, deliberately indulging in lustful thoughts and behavior is sinful; clerical [[celibacy]] also requires abstention from these.<ref>\"People should cultivate chastity in the way that is suited to their state of life. Some profess virginity or consecrated celibacy which enables them to give themselves to God alone with an undivided heart in a remarkable manner. Others live in the way prescribed for all by the moral law, whether they are married or single\" ([https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2349]).</ref>\n\nWithin the [[Catholic Church]], clerical celibacy is mandated for all clergy in the [[Latin Church]] except in the [[Deacon#Roman Catholicism|permanent diaconate]]. Exceptions are sometimes admitted for ordination to transitional diaconate and priesthood on a case-by-case basis for married clergymen of other churches or communities who become Catholics, but ordination of married men to the [[bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopacy]] is excluded (see [[Personal ordinariate#Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy|Personal ordinariate]]). [[Clerical marriage]] is not allowed and therefore, if those for whom in some [[particular Church]] celibacy is optional (such as permanent deacons in the Latin Church) wish to marry, they must do so before ordination. [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] either follow the same rules as the Latin Church or require celibacy for bishops while allowing priestly ordination of married men.\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], celibacy is the norm for [[Bishop (Eastern Orthodox Church)|bishops]]; married men may be ordained to the [[Priesthood (Orthodox Church)|priesthood]], but even married priests whose wives pre-decease them are not allowed to enter marriage after ordination. Similarly, celibacy is not a requirement for ordination as a [[Deacon#Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism|deacon]] and in some [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches deacons may marry after ordination. For a period in the 5th and early 6th centuries the [[Church of the East]] did not apply the rule of celibacy even for ordination to the episcopate. [[Anglicanism]] and [[Protestantism]] in general do not require celibacy of its clergy and allow\u2014or even encourage\u2014clerical marriage.\n\n==Meanings of \"celibacy\"==\n\nThe word \"[[celibacy]]\" can mean either the state of being unmarried or [[sexual abstinence]], especially because of [[religious vows]], from [[sexual intercourse]].<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/celibacy American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: celibacy]</ref><ref>[http://www.yourdictionary.com/continence Webster's New World College Dictionary: celibacy]</ref>\nIn the canon law of the [[Latin Church]], the word \"celibacy\" is used specifically in the sense of being unmarried. However, for its clergy this state of being unmarried is considered to be a consequence of the obligation to be completely and perpetually continent:\n{{quote|text=Clerics are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy which is a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and humanity.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM Canon 277 \u00a71]</ref>}}\n\nPermanent deacons, namely those deacons who are not intended to become priests, are, in general, exempted from this rule.<ref>\"The following are simply impeded from receiving orders . . . a man who has a wife, unless he is legitimately destined to the permanent diaconate.\" [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3S.HTM#4.1.0.6.2.3.1042]</ref> But married permanent deacons are not allowed to remarry after the death of their spouse.<ref>[http://www.bustedhalo.com/features/what-is-a-deacon/ What is a Deacon? - Busted Halo]</ref>\n\nThe [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states:\n{{quote|text=All the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the exception of permanent deacons, are normally chosen from among men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain celibate \"for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\" Called to consecrate themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to \"the affairs of the Lord\", they give themselves entirely to God and to men. Celibacy is a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church's minister is consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God.\n\nIn the Eastern Churches a different discipline has been in force for many centuries: while bishops are chosen solely from among celibates, married men can be ordained as deacons and priests. This practice has long been considered legitimate; these priests exercise a fruitful ministry within their communities. Moreover, priestly celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern Churches and many priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In the East as in the West a man who has already received the sacrament of Holy Orders can no longer marry.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1579-1580] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111024309/https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm |date=January 11, 2010 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe word \"[[celibacy]]\", while referring to the state of being unmarried, may also refer specifically to the practice of retaining all reproductive fluids in the body and the practice by which no reproductive fluids are allowed to leave the body for any reason. This practice is also sometimes associated with the philosophical concept of a virgin birth. This view will mean that the reproductive fluids in the body are to be used by the priest, solely for the conception of a spiritual birth. This philosophical concept may also be referenced, by some, as a reason why women are not received into the priesthood.\n\nOn the granting of permission, by exception, for the priestly ordination of married men in the Latin Church, see [[#Rules|Rules]], below.\n\n==Background==\nIn some [[Christianity|Christian]] churches, such as the [[Latin Church|western]] and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|eastern]] sections of the [[Catholic Church]], [[priest]]s and [[bishop]]s must as a rule be unmarried men. In others, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], married men may be ordained as [[deacon]]s or priests, but may not remarry if their wife dies, and celibacy is required only of bishops. Since celibacy is seen as a consequence of the obligation of continence, it implies abstinence from sexual relationships. The Code of Canon Law prescribes:\n:Clerics are to behave with due prudence towards persons whose company can endanger their obligation to observe continence or give rise to scandal among the faithful.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM canon 277 \u00a72]</ref>\n\nIn some Christian churches, a [[vow]] of [[chastity]] is made by members of [[religious order]]s or monastic communities, along with vows of [[poverty]] and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]], in order to imitate the life of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] (see also [[Evangelical counsels]]). This vow of chastity, made by people not all of whom are clergy, is different from what is the obligation, not a vow, of clerical continence and celibacy\n\nCelibacy for religious and monastics (monks and sisters/nuns) and for bishops is upheld by the [[Catholic Church]] and the traditions of both [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. Bishops must be unmarried men or widowers; a married man cannot become a bishop. In [[Latin Church]] Catholicism and in some [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], most priests are celibate men. Exceptions are admitted and there are over 200 married Catholic priests who converted from the [[Anglican Communion]] and Protestant faiths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  In most Orthodox traditions and in some Eastern Catholic Churches men who are already married may be ordained priests, but priests may not marry after ordination.\n\nNeither the Catholic nor the Orthodox tradition considers the rule of clerical celibacy to be an unchangeable [[dogma]], but instead as a rule that could be adjusted if the Church thought it appropriate and to which exceptions are admitted.\n\nFrom the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|first ecumenical council]] the Christian church forbids voluntary physical [[castration]],<ref>[http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/nicaea-325-canons Council of Nicaea, canon I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215233640/http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/nicaea-325-canons |date=2012-02-15 }}</ref> and the alleged self-castration of the theologian [[Origen]] was used to discredit him.\n\n== In the Bible ==\nAccording to the Bible, there at least two prominent facts of priesthood, in absence of celibacy: the Jewish High Priest Zechariah, and St Peter the Apostle in respect of Mark named in 1 Peter 5:13.\n\nIf Jesus rejected the priesthood of Aaron in favor of the priesthood of Melchizedek ({{bibleverse|Hebrew|7:11|NKJV}}), then the case of Zechariah is far more relevant than the possible son of the first Pope, by effect of the direct intervention of God and the existing links between Elizabeth and Mary.\n\n=== Jewish High Priesthood ===\nJewish High Priests, who weekly alternated in the service of the First and the Second Temple of Jerusalem, were married and their priesthood was inherited by father to son. A similar succession was also imperative for the [[Levite|Levites]]. \n\nMore particularly, [[Zechariah (New Testament figure)|Zechariah]] was married to Elizabeth who was a relative of the Virgin Mary ({{bibleref2|Luke|1:36}}. By a miracle of God, he became the father of [[John the Baptist]] when the couple was \"well advanced in years\" ({{bibleverse|Luke|1:5\u20137|NKJV}}). He was also [[High Priest of Israel#Succession|High Priest]] of the [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period|Second Temple of Jerusalem]], belonging to the Jewish priestly family of [[Abijah#Men|Abijah]], direct descendant of [[Aaron]] ({{bibleverse|Luke|1:67-79|NKJV}}).\n\nElizabeth was told to be a relative of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the spouse of Joseph. The celebrating priest of their marriage is unnamed in the Gospels. However, while Zechariah was a direct descendant of Aaron through the class of Abijah who was called to serve in the Second Temple of Jerusalem, the Virgin [[Visitation of the Virgin and St Elizabeth|visited the House of Elizabeth]] and stayed here for three months.\n\n=== 1 Peter 5:13===\n{{bibleverse|1 Peter|5:13|NKJV}} refers to a Mark, son of [[Saint Peter#New Testament accounts|Peter]], which was named Cefa as the first pope of the early Christian Church. It isn't yet acclared if Peter had a marriage and a son named Mark. The Byzantine tradition believes that Mark the Apostle and the Evangelist was an idolatre born in [[Pentapolis]], converted to Christianity by St. Peter who followed in Rome.<ref name=\"calendariobizantino.it\">{{cite web | url = http://www.calendariobizantino.it/calendario-4.1461536223.0.html | title = Feast of St Mark the Apostle and the Evangelist in the Byzantine calendar | date = 25 April 2016 | language = it | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190727125538/http://www.calendariobizantino.it/calendario-4.1461536223.0.html | archive-date = 27 July 2019 | url-status = live}}</ref> \n\nWe don't know if the Mark of 1 Peter 5:13 can be identified with Mark the Apostle and the Evangelist. Mark is linked to Babylon through the lion's iconography and the prophet Ezekiel:\n* the [[lion of Venice]] (also called as the [[Lion of St Mark]]) has been for centuries the symbol of the Republic and the Patriarcate of Venice,\n* the four lions appeared during the prophetic vision of {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|1:10|NKJV}}, held in Babylon.

In fact, the only marriages that had to have any kind of blessing were those of deacons and priests.\"   \"The tradition of celibacy continued to evolve. In some places it was expected that priests be not sexually active after ordination.

While he was able to remain continent for a while, eventually his burning desire overpowered him. However, he did not want to be regarded as inconsistent or seen as taking his oath lightly. Instead of returning to his wife, he engaged in promiscuous sex and what Epiphanius termed \"sex practices against nature\". In this way, he started [[Nicolaism]], an [[antinomian]] heresy which believed that as long as they abstained from marriage, it was not a sin to exercise their sexual desires as they pleased.

We decree in accordance with the definitions of the sacred canons, that marriages already contracted by such persons must be dissolved, and that the persons be condemned to do penance.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran1.html The Canons of the First Lateran Council, 1123]</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"contract marriage\" in the first part of canon 21 excludes [[clerical marriage]]s, and the marriages that the second part says must be dissolved may possibly be such marriages, contracted after ordination, not before.  Canon 3 makes reference to a rule made at the First Council of Nicaea (see above), which is understood as not forbidding a cleric to live in the same house with a wife whom he married before being ordained.\n\nSixteen years later, the [[Second Lateran Council]] (1139), in which some five hundred bishops took part, enacted the following canons:\n:Canon 6: We also decree that those who in the subdiaconate and higher orders have contracted marriage or have concubines, be deprived of their office and ecclesiastical benefice. For since they should be and be called the temple of God, the vessel of the Lord, the abode of the Holy Spirit, it is unbecoming that they indulge in marriage and in impurities.\n:Canon 7: Following in the footsteps of our predecessors, the Roman pontiffs Gregory VII, Urban, and Paschal, we command that no one attend the masses of those who are known to have wives or concubines. But that the law of continence and purity, so pleasing to God, may become more general among persons constituted in sacred orders, we decree that bishops, priests, deacons, subdeacons, canons regular, monks, and professed clerics ''(conversi)'' who, transgressing the holy precept, have dared to contract marriage, shall be separated. For a union of this kind which has been contracted in violation of the ecclesiastical law, we do not regard as matrimony. Those who have been separated from each other, shall do penance commensurate with such excesses.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran2.html The Canons of the Second Lateran Council, 1123]</ref>\n\nThis Council thus declared clerical marriages not only illicit though valid, as before, but invalid (\"we do not regard as matrimony\").  The marriages in question are, again, those contracted by men who already are \"bishops, priests, deacons, subdeacons, canons regular, monks and professed clerics\". And later legislation, found especially in the [[Decretal#The Quinque Compilationes Antiquae Decretalium|Quinque Compilationes Antiquae]] and the [[Decretals#The decretals of Gregory IX|Decretals of Gregory IX]], continued to deal with questions concerning married men who were ordained legally. In 1322 Pope John XXII insisted that no one bound in marriage\u2014even if unconsummated\u2014could be ordained unless there was full knowledge of the requirements of Church law. If the free consent of the wife had not been obtained, the husband, even if already ordained, was to be reunited with his wife, exercise of his ministry being barred. Accordingly, the assumption that a wife might not want to give up her marital rights may have been one of the factors contributing to the eventual universal practice in the [[Latin Church]] of ordaining only unmarried men.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_01011993_chisto_en.html Roman Cholij: Priestly celibacy in patristics and in the history of the Church]</ref>\n\nHowever, although the decrees of the Second Council of the Lateran might still be interpreted in the older sense of prohibiting marriage only after ordination, they came to be understood as absolute prohibitions, and, while the fact of being married was formally made a canonical impediment to ordination in the Latin Church only with the 1917 Code of Canon Law,<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P37.HTM Canon 987]</ref> the prohibition of marriage for all clerics in major orders began to be taken simply for granted.<ref name=\"americamagazine.org\"/> The Second Lateran Council is thus often cited as having for the first time introduced a general law of celibacy, requiring ordination only of unmarried men. Somewhat inaccurately, since several of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] allow married men to be ordained (though not to be consecrated as bishops), the New Catholic Encyclopedia states: \"The Second Lateran Council (1139) seems to have enacted the first written law making sacred orders a diriment impediment to marriage for the universal Church.\".<ref>''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Catholic University of America: Washington, D.C. 1967) vol. 3, p. 366</ref>\n\n===16th century===\nWhile the 11th century [[Gregorian Reform]]'s campaign against [[clerical marriage]] and concubinage met strong opposition,<ref>\"Otto, the bishop of Constance, refused to enforce with his own clergy Gregory VII's directives regarding clerics and women. When Bishop Altmann of Passau tried, on the contrary, to implement the reforms, the clergy attacked him and with the help of imperial troops drove him out of his diocese. A cleric, probably Ulrich, the bishop of Imola, took up his pen about 1060 in a defense of clerical marriage that assumed conjugal relations after the ordination of the spouse. Ulrich's 'Rescript' influenced other writings in the same vein that continued to appear into the 12th century\" ([https://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=2564 John W. O'Malley,  Some Basics about Celibacy]).</ref> by the time of the [[Second Council of the Lateran]] it had won widespread support from lay and ecclesiastical leaders.\n\nNew opposition appeared in connection with the [[Protestant Reformation]], not only on the part of the Reformers, but also among churchmen and others who remained in union with the see of Rome.  Figures such as [[Panormitanus]], [[Erasmus]], [[Thomas Cajetan]], and the Holy Roman Emperors [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] argued against it.\n\nIn practice, the discipline of clerical continence meant by then that only unmarried men were ordained. Thus, in the discussions that took place, no distinction was made between clerical continence and clerical celibacy.\n\nThe Reformers made abolition of clerical continence and celibacy a key element in their reform. They denounced it as opposed to the New Testament recommendation that a cleric should be \"the husband of one wife\" (see on {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|3:2\u20134|KJV}} above), the declared right of the apostles to take around with them a believing Christian as a wife ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|9:5|KJV}}) and the admonition, \"Marriage should be honoured by all\" ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:4|NIVUK}}). They blamed it for widespread sexual misconduct among the clergy.<ref>[[Jean Calvin]], [[Institutes of the Christian Religion]], [http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/calvin/ci_html/4_12.htm#4.12.23 IV,12,23\u201328] .</ref>\n\nAgainst the long-standing tradition of the Church in the East as well as in the West, which excluded marriage after ordination, [[Zwingli]] married in 1522, [[Martin Luther|Luther]] in 1525, and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] in 1539.

The Catholic Church considers Protestant and most [[Apostolicae curae|Anglican ordinations invalid]], while recognizing [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some Anglican ordinations as valid. In some cases, [[defrocking|laicized]] Catholic priests are allowed to marry by special dispensation. Additionally, dispensations can be granted for deacons whose wives have died to marry a second time,  especially if they have young children to look after.\n*In [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] (which latter are in [[full communion]] with Rome), married men may be ordained to any order except as bishops, and one may not marry ''after'' ordination as a [[subdeacon]].

(The canons stipulate that they must also see to their wives' maintenance, for example Canon 12 of the [[Quinisext Council]].)  Typically, the wife of such a man will take up the [[nun|monastic life]] herself, though this also is not required.  There are many Orthodox bishops currently serving who have never been [[tonsure]]d (formally initiated) to monastic orders.  There are also many who are tonsured monastics but have never formally lived the monastic life. Further, a number of bishops are widowers, but because clergy cannot remarry after ordination, such a man must remain celibate after the death of his wife.

Early Anglican Church clergy under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] were required to be celibate (see [[Thirty-nine Articles#Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]]), but the requirement was eliminated by [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. Some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] priestly orders require their members to remain celibate, as do monastic orders of all brothers and sisters.\n*Most [[Protestant]] traditions have no restrictions on the marriage of ministers or other clergy, except that in some circles divorced persons may not serve as pastors, and in practice the large majority of pastors are married.\n*Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]  or \"Mormons\" reject lifelong clerical celibacy. All worthy males can receive a priesthood office beginning with that of deacon in the year that they turn 12 years of age. A young man is usually encouraged to delay marriage until after he has been ordained an elder and served two years as a full-time missionary for his church. Generally, only married men are called to be bishops (who preside over local congregations designated as wards), and marriage in the temple and faithfulness to it are seen as necessary for salvation in the highest heaven. As with most Christians, all Latter-day saints, including members of the priesthood, are expected to entirely abstain from unchaste conduct.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/topics/marriage?lang=eng&query=marriage Marriage], churchofjesuschrist.org</ref>\n\n== Other religions ==\n*[[Judaism]] has no history of celibacy for its leaders, including [[rabbi]]s and [[kohen|kohanim]]. Before the destruction of the [[Second Temple|Jerusalem temple]], priests ([[kohen|kohanim]]) and Levites were required to practice continence (abstain from sexual intercourse with their wives) before and during their time of service at the temple. They were permitted to resume marital relations after completing their service. Some community functions are, as a rule, filled only by married men. Marriage is encouraged for everyone.\n*In [[Islam]], lifelong celibacy or monasticism is forbidden. Marriage is encouraged for everyone.\n*In [[Hinduism]], priests can marry. At the same time, Hindu monks (sanyaasis), who are usually expected to withdraw from [[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] ('the world'), usually practice celibacy. The idea is to keep the mind free from distraction caused by sex-life and use that focus in serving God.\n*The [[Buddhist monasticism|traditions of monasticism]] within [[Buddhism]] require celibacy. Several cultures, however, have revised this and now have forms of married lay teachers, who are distinct from the celibate clergy. Moreover, in the countries of [[Southeast Asia]] practicing [[Theravada]] Buddhism, a tradition exists of young men becoming ordained as monks for brief periods (typically a few weeks and generally no more than a year) upon completing education, but then leaving monastic life, and continuing to return to the monastery for short periods of reflection even after marriage (if the wife consents). Many Japanese monks and priests were celibate up to the time of the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n*In [[Jainism]], Monks do not marry from the day they take [[monasticism|Jain monasticism]].\n\n==The Catholic Church today==\n{{Main|Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|Sacerdotalis caelibatus|}}\nCelibacy is represented in the Catholic Church as having apostolic authority. Theologically, the Church desires to imitate the life of Jesus with regard to chastity and the sacrifice of married life for the \"sake of the Kingdom\" ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 18:28\u201330, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 19:27\u201330; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 10:20\u201321), and to follow the example of Jesus Christ in being \"married\" to the Church, viewed by Catholicism and many Christian traditions as the \"Bride of Christ\". Also of importance are the teachings of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] that chastity is the superior state of life, and his desire expressed in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|I Corinthians]] 7:7\u20138, \"I would that all men were even as myself [celibate]\u2014but every one has his proper gift from God; one after this manner, and another after that. But I say to the unmarried and the widows. It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.\"\n\nPractically speaking, the reasons for celibacy are given by the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians 7:7\u20138; 32\u201335: \"But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of this world how she may please her husband. And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord without impediment.\"\n\nI Corinthians 9:5 is sometimes cited by those opposed to mandatory clerical celibacy, as the verse is often rendered as referring to the Apostles carrying \"wives\" with them. Even apart from disputes about the significance of the word translated as \"wives\",<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0406.htm Tertullian, On Monogamy]: \"'For have we not the power of eating and drinking?' he does not demonstrate that 'wives' were led about by the apostles, whom even such as have not still have the power of eating and drinking; but simply 'women', who used to minister to them in the same way (as they did) when accompanying the Lord\"; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/30091.htm Jerome, Against Jovinianus, Book I]: \"In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage.\"</ref> this passage is of doubtful relevance to the rule of celibacy for priests of the [[Latin Church]], which was introduced much later and is seen only as a ''discipline'' within that [[particular Church]] alone, not a ''doctrine'' binding all: in other words, a church regulation, but not an integral part of Church teaching. [[St. Peter]], often seen as the first pope, as well as many subsequent popes, bishops, and priests during the church's first 270 years were in fact married men, and often fathers of children. The practice of clerical continence, along with a prohibition of marriage after ordination as a deacon, priest or bishop, is traceable from the time of the [[Council of Elvira]] of approximately 305-306. This law was reinforced in the [[Directa Decretal]] (385) and at the [[Council of Carthage]] in 390. The tradition of clerical continence developed into a practice of clerical celibacy (ordaining only unmarried men) from the 11th century onward among Latin Church Catholics and became a formal part of canon law in 1917. This law of clerical celibacy does not apply to [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]]. Until recently, the Eastern Catholic bishops of North America would generally ordain only unmarried men, for fear that married priests would create scandal. Since [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]]'s call for the restoration of Eastern Catholic traditions, a number of bishops have returned to the traditional practice of ordaining married men to the presbyterate. Bishops are still celibate and normally chosen from the ranks of monks.\n\nIn the Latin Church exceptions are sometimes made. After the Second Vatican Council a general exception was made for the ordination as deacons of men of at least thirty-five years of age who are not intended to be ordained later as priests and whose wives consent to their ordination.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3P.HTM Canon 1031 \u00a72]</ref> Since the time of [[Pope Pius XII]] individual exceptions are sometimes made for former non-Catholic clergymen. Under the rules proposed for [[personal ordinariate]]s for former Anglicans, the [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] may request the Pope to grant authorization, on a case-by-case basis, for admission to ordination in the Catholic Church of married former Anglican clergy (see [[Personal ordinariate#Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy]]).\n\nBecause the rule of clerical celibacy is a law and not a doctrine, exceptions can be made, and it can, in principle, be changed at any time by the Pope. Both [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] spoke clearly of their understanding that the traditional practice is unlikely to change.

These religions consider that, outside of marriage, deliberately indulging in lustful thoughts and behavior is sinful; clerical [[celibacy]] also requires abstention from these.<ref>\"People should cultivate chastity in the way that is suited to their state of life.

Exceptions are sometimes admitted for ordination to transitional diaconate and priesthood on a case-by-case basis for married clergymen of other churches or communities who become Catholics, but ordination of married men to the [[bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopacy]] is excluded (see [[Personal ordinariate#Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy|Personal ordinariate]]). [[Clerical marriage]] is not allowed and therefore, if those for whom in some [[particular Church]] celibacy is optional (such as permanent deacons in the Latin Church) wish to marry, they must do so before ordination. [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] either follow the same rules as the Latin Church or require celibacy for bishops while allowing priestly ordination of married men.\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], celibacy is the norm for [[Bishop (Eastern Orthodox Church)|bishops]]; married men may be ordained to the [[Priesthood (Orthodox Church)|priesthood]], but even married priests whose wives pre-decease them are not allowed to enter marriage after ordination. Similarly, celibacy is not a requirement for ordination as a [[Deacon#Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism|deacon]] and in some [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches deacons may marry after ordination. For a period in the 5th and early 6th centuries the [[Church of the East]] did not apply the rule of celibacy even for ordination to the episcopate. [[Anglicanism]] and [[Protestantism]] in general do not require celibacy of its clergy and allow\u2014or even encourage\u2014clerical marriage.\n\n==Meanings of \"celibacy\"==\n\nThe word \"[[celibacy]]\" can mean either the state of being unmarried or [[sexual abstinence]], especially because of [[religious vows]], from [[sexual intercourse]].<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/celibacy American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: celibacy]</ref><ref>[http://www.yourdictionary.com/continence Webster's New World College Dictionary: celibacy]</ref>\nIn the canon law of the [[Latin Church]], the word \"celibacy\" is used specifically in the sense of being unmarried. However, for its clergy this state of being unmarried is considered to be a consequence of the obligation to be completely and perpetually continent:\n{{quote|text=Clerics are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy which is a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and humanity.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM Canon 277 \u00a71]</ref>}}\n\nPermanent deacons, namely those deacons who are not intended to become priests, are, in general, exempted from this rule.<ref>\"The following are simply impeded from receiving orders . . . a man who has a wife, unless he is legitimately destined to the permanent diaconate.\" [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3S.HTM#4.1.0.6.2.3.1042]</ref> But married permanent deacons are not allowed to remarry after the death of their spouse.<ref>[http://www.bustedhalo.com/features/what-is-a-deacon/ What is a Deacon? - Busted Halo]</ref>\n\nThe [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states:\n{{quote|text=All the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the exception of permanent deacons, are normally chosen from among men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain celibate \"for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\" Called to consecrate themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to \"the affairs of the Lord\", they give themselves entirely to God and to men. Celibacy is a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church's minister is consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God.\n\nIn the Eastern Churches a different discipline has been in force for many centuries: while bishops are chosen solely from among celibates, married men can be ordained as deacons and priests. This practice has long been considered legitimate; these priests exercise a fruitful ministry within their communities. Moreover, priestly celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern Churches and many priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In the East as in the West a man who has already received the sacrament of Holy Orders can no longer marry.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1579-1580] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111024309/https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm |date=January 11, 2010 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe word \"[[celibacy]]\", while referring to the state of being unmarried, may also refer specifically to the practice of retaining all reproductive fluids in the body and the practice by which no reproductive fluids are allowed to leave the body for any reason. This practice is also sometimes associated with the philosophical concept of a virgin birth. This view will mean that the reproductive fluids in the body are to be used by the priest, solely for the conception of a spiritual birth. This philosophical concept may also be referenced, by some, as a reason why women are not received into the priesthood.\n\nOn the granting of permission, by exception, for the priestly ordination of married men in the Latin Church, see [[#Rules|Rules]], below.\n\n==Background==\nIn some [[Christianity|Christian]] churches, such as the [[Latin Church|western]] and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|eastern]] sections of the [[Catholic Church]], [[priest]]s and [[bishop]]s must as a rule be unmarried men. In others, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], married men may be ordained as [[deacon]]s or priests, but may not remarry if their wife dies, and celibacy is required only of bishops. Since celibacy is seen as a consequence of the obligation of continence, it implies abstinence from sexual relationships. The Code of Canon Law prescribes:\n:Clerics are to behave with due prudence towards persons whose company can endanger their obligation to observe continence or give rise to scandal among the faithful.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM canon 277 \u00a72]</ref>\n\nIn some Christian churches, a [[vow]] of [[chastity]] is made by members of [[religious order]]s or monastic communities, along with vows of [[poverty]] and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]], in order to imitate the life of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] (see also [[Evangelical counsels]]). This vow of chastity, made by people not all of whom are clergy, is different from what is the obligation, not a vow, of clerical continence and celibacy\n\nCelibacy for religious and monastics (monks and sisters/nuns) and for bishops is upheld by the [[Catholic Church]] and the traditions of both [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. Bishops must be unmarried men or widowers; a married man cannot become a bishop. In [[Latin Church]] Catholicism and in some [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], most priests are celibate men. Exceptions are admitted and there are over 200 married Catholic priests who converted from the [[Anglican Communion]] and Protestant faiths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  In most Orthodox traditions and in some Eastern Catholic Churches men who are already married may be ordained priests, but priests may not marry after ordination.\n\nNeither the Catholic nor the Orthodox tradition considers the rule of clerical celibacy to be an unchangeable [[dogma]], but instead as a rule that could be adjusted if the Church thought it appropriate and to which exceptions are admitted.\n\nFrom the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|first ecumenical council]] the Christian church forbids voluntary physical [[castration]],<ref>[http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/nicaea-325-canons Council of Nicaea, canon I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215233640/http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/nicaea-325-canons |date=2012-02-15 }}</ref> and the alleged self-castration of the theologian [[Origen]] was used to discredit him.\n\n== In the Bible ==\nAccording to the Bible, there at least two prominent facts of priesthood, in absence of celibacy: the Jewish High Priest Zechariah, and St Peter the Apostle in respect of Mark named in 1 Peter 5:13.\n\nIf Jesus rejected the priesthood of Aaron in favor of the priesthood of Melchizedek ({{bibleverse|Hebrew|7:11|NKJV}}), then the case of Zechariah is far more relevant than the possible son of the first Pope, by effect of the direct intervention of God and the existing links between Elizabeth and Mary.\n\n=== Jewish High Priesthood ===\nJewish High Priests, who weekly alternated in the service of the First and the Second Temple of Jerusalem, were married and their priesthood was inherited by father to son. A similar succession was also imperative for the [[Levite|Levites]]. \n\nMore particularly, [[Zechariah (New Testament figure)|Zechariah]] was married to Elizabeth who was a relative of the Virgin Mary ({{bibleref2|Luke|1:36}}. By a miracle of God, he became the father of [[John the Baptist]] when the couple was \"well advanced in years\" ({{bibleverse|Luke|1:5\u20137|NKJV}}). He was also [[High Priest of Israel#Succession|High Priest]] of the [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period|Second Temple of Jerusalem]], belonging to the Jewish priestly family of [[Abijah#Men|Abijah]], direct descendant of [[Aaron]] ({{bibleverse|Luke|1:67-79|NKJV}}).\n\nElizabeth was told to be a relative of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the spouse of Joseph. The celebrating priest of their marriage is unnamed in the Gospels. However, while Zechariah was a direct descendant of Aaron through the class of Abijah who was called to serve in the Second Temple of Jerusalem, the Virgin [[Visitation of the Virgin and St Elizabeth|visited the House of Elizabeth]] and stayed here for three months.\n\n=== 1 Peter 5:13===\n{{bibleverse|1 Peter|5:13|NKJV}} refers to a Mark, son of [[Saint Peter#New Testament accounts|Peter]], which was named Cefa as the first pope of the early Christian Church. It isn't yet acclared if Peter had a marriage and a son named Mark. The Byzantine tradition believes that Mark the Apostle and the Evangelist was an idolatre born in [[Pentapolis]], converted to Christianity by St. Peter who followed in Rome.<ref name=\"calendariobizantino.it\">{{cite web | url = http://www.calendariobizantino.it/calendario-4.1461536223.0.html | title = Feast of St Mark the Apostle and the Evangelist in the Byzantine calendar | date = 25 April 2016 | language = it | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190727125538/http://www.calendariobizantino.it/calendario-4.1461536223.0.html | archive-date = 27 July 2019 | url-status = live}}</ref> \n\nWe don't know if the Mark of 1 Peter 5:13 can be identified with Mark the Apostle and the Evangelist. Mark is linked to Babylon through the lion's iconography and the prophet Ezekiel:\n* the [[lion of Venice]] (also called as the [[Lion of St Mark]]) has been for centuries the symbol of the Republic and the Patriarcate of Venice,\n* the four lions appeared during the prophetic vision of {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|1:10|NKJV}}, held in Babylon. It was followed by the translation of Ezekiel's reliquies into the Venetian Basilica in 828 CE.<ref name=\"calendariobizantino.it\" /> \n\nIn such a way, Peter and Mark had a common spiritual brotherhood as son of Christ. Peter might also have had a special spiritual paternity with the Evangelist as his Christian converter and baptizer. However, the presence of Mark in Babylon is unreferenced in the Bible and, in the same manner, the Gospel of Mark doesn't mention the lion's symbolism nor the Ezekiel's prophecy.\n\n==Clerical continence in Christianity==\n{{See also|Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)}}\n\n===First century===\nSome of the earliest Christian leaders were married men. The mention in {{bibleverse||Mark|1:30}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|4:38}}, and {{bibleverse||Matthew|8:14-15}} of [[Saint Peter]]'s mother-in-law indicates that he had married ({{bibleverse||Matthew|8:14-15}}: \"when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.\") According to Clement of Alexandria, \"Peter and Philip begat children\",<ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm Clements, Stromata (book III) / Eusebius, Church History (Book III)</ref> and Peter's wife suffered martyrdom (Stromata, III, vi, ed. Dindorf, II, 276).\n\nOn the other hand, in {{bibleverse||Luke|18:28-30|KJV}} Jesus responds to Peter's statement that he and the other disciples had left all and followed him by saying there is \"no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God who will not receive back an overabundant return in this present age and eternal life in the age to come\".<ref>[http://www.staycatholic.com/celibacy_in_the_first_two_centuries.htm Michael E.

Catholic leaders, such as St. Augustine, taught that Original Sin was transmitted through intercourse. Therefore, abstinence and virginity was the ideal life and only the weak should marry. However, most bishops and presbyters continued to marry. In fact, the only marriages that had to have any kind of blessing were those of deacons and priests.\"   \"The tradition of celibacy continued to evolve. In some places it was expected that priests be not sexually active after ordination. When monastic spirituality became popular in the fourth and fifth centuries, it promoted the ideal of celibacy as a model for all priests.\"\n\n\"One way church authority enforced celibacy was by ordaining monks, who took the vow of chastity, to evangelize large areas of Europe. Church authority continued to mandate celibacy. The First Lateran Council (1123\u20131153) forbade those in orders to marry and ordered all those already married to renounce their wives and do penance.

The cases mentioned largely concern, not clerical celibacy, but clerical continence.</ref> and concubinage.\n\nThe [[First Lateran Council]] (1123), a [[ecumenical council|General Council]], adopted the following canons:\n:Canon 3: We absolutely forbid priests, deacons, and subdeacons to associate with concubines and women, or to live with women other than such as the Nicene Council (canon 3) for reasons of necessity permitted, namely, the mother, sister, or aunt, or any such person concerning whom no suspicion could arise.\n:Canon 21: We absolutely forbid priests, deacons, subdeacons, and monks to have concubines or to contract marriage. We decree in accordance with the definitions of the sacred canons, that marriages already contracted by such persons must be dissolved, and that the persons be condemned to do penance.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran1.html The Canons of the First Lateran Council, 1123]</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"contract marriage\" in the first part of canon 21 excludes [[clerical marriage]]s, and the marriages that the second part says must be dissolved may possibly be such marriages, contracted after ordination, not before.  Canon 3 makes reference to a rule made at the First Council of Nicaea (see above), which is understood as not forbidding a cleric to live in the same house with a wife whom he married before being ordained.\n\nSixteen years later, the [[Second Lateran Council]] (1139), in which some five hundred bishops took part, enacted the following canons:\n:Canon 6: We also decree that those who in the subdiaconate and higher orders have contracted marriage or have concubines, be deprived of their office and ecclesiastical benefice. For since they should be and be called the temple of God, the vessel of the Lord, the abode of the Holy Spirit, it is unbecoming that they indulge in marriage and in impurities.\n:Canon 7: Following in the footsteps of our predecessors, the Roman pontiffs Gregory VII, Urban, and Paschal, we command that no one attend the masses of those who are known to have wives or concubines. But that the law of continence and purity, so pleasing to God, may become more general among persons constituted in sacred orders, we decree that bishops, priests, deacons, subdeacons, canons regular, monks, and professed clerics ''(conversi)'' who, transgressing the holy precept, have dared to contract marriage, shall be separated. For a union of this kind which has been contracted in violation of the ecclesiastical law, we do not regard as matrimony. Those who have been separated from each other, shall do penance commensurate with such excesses.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran2.html The Canons of the Second Lateran Council, 1123]</ref>\n\nThis Council thus declared clerical marriages not only illicit though valid, as before, but invalid (\"we do not regard as matrimony\").  The marriages in question are, again, those contracted by men who already are \"bishops, priests, deacons, subdeacons, canons regular, monks and professed clerics\". And later legislation, found especially in the [[Decretal#The Quinque Compilationes Antiquae Decretalium|Quinque Compilationes Antiquae]] and the [[Decretals#The decretals of Gregory IX|Decretals of Gregory IX]], continued to deal with questions concerning married men who were ordained legally. In 1322 Pope John XXII insisted that no one bound in marriage\u2014even if unconsummated\u2014could be ordained unless there was full knowledge of the requirements of Church law. If the free consent of the wife had not been obtained, the husband, even if already ordained, was to be reunited with his wife, exercise of his ministry being barred. Accordingly, the assumption that a wife might not want to give up her marital rights may have been one of the factors contributing to the eventual universal practice in the [[Latin Church]] of ordaining only unmarried men.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_01011993_chisto_en.html Roman Cholij: Priestly celibacy in patristics and in the history of the Church]</ref>\n\nHowever, although the decrees of the Second Council of the Lateran might still be interpreted in the older sense of prohibiting marriage only after ordination, they came to be understood as absolute prohibitions, and, while the fact of being married was formally made a canonical impediment to ordination in the Latin Church only with the 1917 Code of Canon Law,<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P37.HTM Canon 987]</ref> the prohibition of marriage for all clerics in major orders began to be taken simply for granted.<ref name=\"americamagazine.org\"/> The Second Lateran Council is thus often cited as having for the first time introduced a general law of celibacy, requiring ordination only of unmarried men. Somewhat inaccurately, since several of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] allow married men to be ordained (though not to be consecrated as bishops), the New Catholic Encyclopedia states: \"The Second Lateran Council (1139) seems to have enacted the first written law making sacred orders a diriment impediment to marriage for the universal Church.\".<ref>''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Catholic University of America: Washington, D.C. 1967) vol. 3, p. 366</ref>\n\n===16th century===\nWhile the 11th century [[Gregorian Reform]]'s campaign against [[clerical marriage]] and concubinage met strong opposition,<ref>\"Otto, the bishop of Constance, refused to enforce with his own clergy Gregory VII's directives regarding clerics and women. When Bishop Altmann of Passau tried, on the contrary, to implement the reforms, the clergy attacked him and with the help of imperial troops drove him out of his diocese. A cleric, probably Ulrich, the bishop of Imola, took up his pen about 1060 in a defense of clerical marriage that assumed conjugal relations after the ordination of the spouse. Ulrich's 'Rescript' influenced other writings in the same vein that continued to appear into the 12th century\" ([https://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=2564 John W. O'Malley,  Some Basics about Celibacy]).</ref> by the time of the [[Second Council of the Lateran]] it had won widespread support from lay and ecclesiastical leaders.\n\nNew opposition appeared in connection with the [[Protestant Reformation]], not only on the part of the Reformers, but also among churchmen and others who remained in union with the see of Rome.  Figures such as [[Panormitanus]], [[Erasmus]], [[Thomas Cajetan]], and the Holy Roman Emperors [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] argued against it.\n\nIn practice, the discipline of clerical continence meant by then that only unmarried men were ordained. Thus, in the discussions that took place, no distinction was made between clerical continence and clerical celibacy.\n\nThe Reformers made abolition of clerical continence and celibacy a key element in their reform. They denounced it as opposed to the New Testament recommendation that a cleric should be \"the husband of one wife\" (see on {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|3:2\u20134|KJV}} above), the declared right of the apostles to take around with them a believing Christian as a wife ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|9:5|KJV}}) and the admonition, \"Marriage should be honoured by all\" ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:4|NIVUK}}). They blamed it for widespread sexual misconduct among the clergy.<ref>[[Jean Calvin]], [[Institutes of the Christian Religion]], [http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/calvin/ci_html/4_12.htm#4.12.23 IV,12,23\u201328] .</ref>\n\nAgainst the long-standing tradition of the Church in the East as well as in the West, which excluded marriage after ordination, [[Zwingli]] married in 1522, [[Martin Luther|Luther]] in 1525, and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] in 1539.

The Catholic Church considers Protestant and most [[Apostolicae curae|Anglican ordinations invalid]], while recognizing [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some Anglican ordinations as valid. In some cases, [[defrocking|laicized]] Catholic priests are allowed to marry by special dispensation. Additionally, dispensations can be granted for deacons whose wives have died to marry a second time,  especially if they have young children to look after.\n*In [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] (which latter are in [[full communion]] with Rome), married men may be ordained to any order except as bishops, and one may not marry ''after'' ordination as a [[subdeacon]].  The [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches follow the same rules as in the Eastern Orthodox Church for bishops and priests, but the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]],<ref>[http://malankaraorthodoxchurch.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=326&Itemid=477 \"Why can't a non-celibate priest re-marry if his wife dies?\"]</ref> and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] permit ordained deacons to marry, while the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] does not allow it.<ref>[http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/7_priesthood.html Coptic Orthodox Church Network: \"The Sacrament of Priesthood\"]</ref> For much of the 5th century, the [[Church of the East]] allowed even bishops to marry, but in the early 6th century decided to ordain only celibate monks to episcopacy, while still allowing priests to marry after ordination.<ref>[http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=1&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=HQ&pageno=1 Ronald G. Roberson, \"The Assyrian Church of the East\"]</ref> While some incorrectly believe all Orthodox bishops must be [[monk]]s, in fact, according to [[canon law|church law]], they simply may no longer be living with their wives if they are to be consecrated to the episcopacy. (The canons stipulate that they must also see to their wives' maintenance, for example Canon 12 of the [[Quinisext Council]].)  Typically, the wife of such a man will take up the [[nun|monastic life]] herself, though this also is not required.  There are many Orthodox bishops currently serving who have never been [[tonsure]]d (formally initiated) to monastic orders.  There are also many who are tonsured monastics but have never formally lived the monastic life. Further, a number of bishops are widowers, but because clergy cannot remarry after ordination, such a man must remain celibate after the death of his wife. The Holy See's 1929 decree ''Cum data fuerit'', forbidding priestly ordination and ministry of married men in certain [[diaspora]] areas outside the home territories of the Eastern Catholic Churches, was revoked by a decree of June 2014.<ref>[http://cathnews.co.nz/2014/11/21/vatican-lifts-married-priests-ban-us-canada-australia/ \"Vatican lifts married priests ban in US, Canada, and Australia\"] in ''CathNews New Zealand'', 21 November 2014</ref>\n*Churches of the [[Anglican]] Communion have no restrictions on the marriage of deacons, priests, bishops, or other ministers to a person of the opposite sex.  Early Anglican Church clergy under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] were required to be celibate (see [[Thirty-nine Articles#Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]]), but the requirement was eliminated by [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. Some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] priestly orders require their members to remain celibate, as do monastic orders of all brothers and sisters.\n*Most [[Protestant]] traditions have no restrictions on the marriage of ministers or other clergy, except that in some circles divorced persons may not serve as pastors, and in practice the large majority of pastors are married.\n*Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]  or \"Mormons\" reject lifelong clerical celibacy. All worthy males can receive a priesthood office beginning with that of deacon in the year that they turn 12 years of age. A young man is usually encouraged to delay marriage until after he has been ordained an elder and served two years as a full-time missionary for his church. Generally, only married men are called to be bishops (who preside over local congregations designated as wards), and marriage in the temple and faithfulness to it are seen as necessary for salvation in the highest heaven. As with most Christians, all Latter-day saints, including members of the priesthood, are expected to entirely abstain from unchaste conduct.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/topics/marriage?lang=eng&query=marriage Marriage], churchofjesuschrist.org</ref>\n\n== Other religions ==\n*[[Judaism]] has no history of celibacy for its leaders, including [[rabbi]]s and [[kohen|kohanim]]. Before the destruction of the [[Second Temple|Jerusalem temple]], priests ([[kohen|kohanim]]) and Levites were required to practice continence (abstain from sexual intercourse with their wives) before and during their time of service at the temple. They were permitted to resume marital relations after completing their service. Some community functions are, as a rule, filled only by married men. Marriage is encouraged for everyone.\n*In [[Islam]], lifelong celibacy or monasticism is forbidden. Marriage is encouraged for everyone.\n*In [[Hinduism]], priests can marry. At the same time, Hindu monks (sanyaasis), who are usually expected to withdraw from [[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] ('the world'), usually practice celibacy. The idea is to keep the mind free from distraction caused by sex-life and use that focus in serving God.\n*The [[Buddhist monasticism|traditions of monasticism]] within [[Buddhism]] require celibacy. Several cultures, however, have revised this and now have forms of married lay teachers, who are distinct from the celibate clergy. Moreover, in the countries of [[Southeast Asia]] practicing [[Theravada]] Buddhism, a tradition exists of young men becoming ordained as monks for brief periods (typically a few weeks and generally no more than a year) upon completing education, but then leaving monastic life, and continuing to return to the monastery for short periods of reflection even after marriage (if the wife consents). Many Japanese monks and priests were celibate up to the time of the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n*In [[Jainism]], Monks do not marry from the day they take [[monasticism|Jain monasticism]].\n\n==The Catholic Church today==\n{{Main|Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|Sacerdotalis caelibatus|}}\nCelibacy is represented in the Catholic Church as having apostolic authority. Theologically, the Church desires to imitate the life of Jesus with regard to chastity and the sacrifice of married life for the \"sake of the Kingdom\" ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 18:28\u201330, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 19:27\u201330; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 10:20\u201321), and to follow the example of Jesus Christ in being \"married\" to the Church, viewed by Catholicism and many Christian traditions as the \"Bride of Christ\". Also of importance are the teachings of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] that chastity is the superior state of life, and his desire expressed in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|I Corinthians]] 7:7\u20138, \"I would that all men were even as myself [celibate]\u2014but every one has his proper gift from God; one after this manner, and another after that. But I say to the unmarried and the widows. It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.\"\n\nPractically speaking, the reasons for celibacy are given by the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians 7:7\u20138; 32\u201335: \"But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of this world how she may please her husband. And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord without impediment.\"\n\nI Corinthians 9:5 is sometimes cited by those opposed to mandatory clerical celibacy, as the verse is often rendered as referring to the Apostles carrying \"wives\" with them. Even apart from disputes about the significance of the word translated as \"wives\",<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0406.htm Tertullian, On Monogamy]: \"'For have we not the power of eating and drinking?' he does not demonstrate that 'wives' were led about by the apostles, whom even such as have not still have the power of eating and drinking; but simply 'women', who used to minister to them in the same way (as they did) when accompanying the Lord\"; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/30091.htm Jerome, Against Jovinianus, Book I]: \"In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage.\"</ref> this passage is of doubtful relevance to the rule of celibacy for priests of the [[Latin Church]], which was introduced much later and is seen only as a ''discipline'' within that [[particular Church]] alone, not a ''doctrine'' binding all: in other words, a church regulation, but not an integral part of Church teaching. [[St. Peter]], often seen as the first pope, as well as many subsequent popes, bishops, and priests during the church's first 270 years were in fact married men, and often fathers of children. The practice of clerical continence, along with a prohibition of marriage after ordination as a deacon, priest or bishop, is traceable from the time of the [[Council of Elvira]] of approximately 305-306. This law was reinforced in the [[Directa Decretal]] (385) and at the [[Council of Carthage]] in 390. The tradition of clerical continence developed into a practice of clerical celibacy (ordaining only unmarried men) from the 11th century onward among Latin Church Catholics and became a formal part of canon law in 1917. This law of clerical celibacy does not apply to [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]]. Until recently, the Eastern Catholic bishops of North America would generally ordain only unmarried men, for fear that married priests would create scandal. Since [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]]'s call for the restoration of Eastern Catholic traditions, a number of bishops have returned to the traditional practice of ordaining married men to the presbyterate. Bishops are still celibate and normally chosen from the ranks of monks.\n\nIn the Latin Church exceptions are sometimes made. After the Second Vatican Council a general exception was made for the ordination as deacons of men of at least thirty-five years of age who are not intended to be ordained later as priests and whose wives consent to their ordination.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3P.HTM Canon 1031 \u00a72]</ref> Since the time of [[Pope Pius XII]] individual exceptions are sometimes made for former non-Catholic clergymen. Under the rules proposed for [[personal ordinariate]]s for former Anglicans, the [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] may request the Pope to grant authorization, on a case-by-case basis, for admission to ordination in the Catholic Church of married former Anglican clergy (see [[Personal ordinariate#Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy]]).\n\nBecause the rule of clerical celibacy is a law and not a doctrine, exceptions can be made, and it can, in principle, be changed at any time by the Pope. Both [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] spoke clearly of their understanding that the traditional practice is unlikely to change. Pope Francis, however, has called for consideration of the question of electing so-called [[viri probati]] for the ordination to the priesthood, particularly in areas like [[Amazonia]] where there is an acute shortage of priests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/edward-pentin/will-pan-amazonian-synod-result-in-end-to-clerical-celibacy|title=Will Pan-Amazonian Synod Result in End to Clerical Celibacy?|work=National Catholic Register|access-date=2018-05-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Amazon Synod in Rome in October 2019 ===\nIn October 2019, many of the bishops at the Amazon Synod in Rome said that married priests should be allowed in the Roman Catholic church.<ref>[https://www.katholisch.de/artikel/23307-viele-bischoefe-fuer-verheiratete-priester-und-frauendiakone Katholisch.de: Viele Bisch\u00f6fe f\u00fcr verheiratete Priester und Frauendiakone(German)], October 20, 2019</ref>\n\n===Historical lack of enforcement===\nDespite the Latin Church's historical practice of priestly celibacy, there have been Catholic priests throughout the centuries who have engaged in sexual relations through the practice of [[concubinage]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Faculty of Arts|last=Wettinger|first=Godfrey|date=1977|title=Concubinage among the Clergy of Malta and Gozo ca. 1420-1550|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Journal%20of%20the%20Faculty%20of%20Arts/Journal%20of%20the%20Faculty%20of%20Arts.%206(1977)4/16.pdf|publisher=[[University of Malta]]|volume=6|issue=4|pages=165-188}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, the Catholic Church acknowledged that the church's celibacy policy hasn't always been enforced and that at some point in history, the Vatican enacted secret rules to protect priests who violated their vows of celibacy.<ref name=usatodaycelibacy>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/19/vaticans-secret-rules-priests-who-father-children/2918042002/</ref><ref name=guardianfebruary19>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/vatican-reveals-secret-rules-for-priests-who-father-children</ref><ref name=cbscelibacy>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-of-catholic-priests-vatican-confirms-secret-catholic-church-guidelines-for-priests-who-father-children/</ref> These rules even applied to Catholic clergy who fathered children by doing so as well.<ref name=cbscelibacy /><ref name=guardianfebruary19 /><ref name=usatodaycelibacy /> Some people who were fathered by Catholic clergy also publicly came forward too.<ref name=cbscelibacy /><ref name=guardianfebruary19 /><ref name=usatodaycelibacy />\n\nSome clergy who violated the celibacy policy, which also forbids marriage for clergy who did not convert from the Anglican or Protestant faiths, have also maintained their clerical status after marrying women in secret.

He played power forward for nine seasons in the NBA, spending the bulk of his career with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]].  He also played for the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Orlando Magic]], [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. In the 1988\u201389 season he averaged 12.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, 1.3 assists and over 30 minutes per game for the Bucks.<ref name=\"dbBasketball\"/> Over his NBA career, he averaged 8.1 points and 4.9 rebounds per contest.<ref name=\"dbBasketball\"/>\n\n==Coaching career==\n===Early career===\nKrystkowiak began his coaching career in 1998 as an assistant to Don Holst at his alma mater, the [[University of Montana \u2013 Missoula|University of Montana]].  He coached at Montana until 2000 when he left to join [[Old Dominion Monarchs basketball|Old Dominion]] as an assistant under former Griz head coach, [[Blaine Taylor]].<ref name=\"KryskoHiredAtUM\" /> He spent one season (2001\u20132002) at Old Dominion.\n\nKrystkowiak got his first opportunity as a head coach with the [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA's]] [[Idaho Stampede]] in 2003\u201304.  In his single season as the Stampede's head coach, he led the team to a 37\u201316 record and a CBA championship game berth.<ref name=\"NBABio\"/>\n\nHe was hired as head men's basketball coach at the [[University of Montana \u2013 Missoula|University of Montana]] in May 2004.  He led the Griz to a 42\u201320 overall record over the course of the next two seasons, reaching the NCAA tournament each year as a result of winning the [[Big Sky Conference]] tourney.  In 2006 the Grizzlies beat heavily favored, fifth seed, [[University of Nevada, Reno|Nevada]], in the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]].\n\n===NBA coaching career===\n\nIn June 2006 Krystkowiak left Montana to take a job as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks under [[Terry Stotts]].  Krystkowiak was responsible for working with the Milwaukee's big men, notably second year players [[Andrew Bogut]] and [[Charlie Villanueva]].<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=439859 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133549/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=439859 |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> He was named head coach of the team on March 14, 2007, after Stotts was fired.

In a season where starting center David Foster missed the entire season and starting point guard Josh \"Jiggy\" Watkins was dismissed halfway through,  Krystkowiak and the Utes struggled to a 6-25 finish, including only three wins against their new Pac-12 opponents.\n\nThe [[2012\u201313 Utah Utes men's basketball team|2012\u20132013]] season showed much improvement for Krystkowiak's Utes.  The additions of freshmen Jordan Loveridge and Brandon Taylor, as well as great play and leadership from senior center Jason Washburn, would help Utah more than double their win total from the previous season.  On March 9, 2013, Utah closed out its season by defeating No. 19 Oregon, celebrating Senior Night at the Huntsman Center with the program's first victory over a ranked opponent since 2009. Utah then defeated USC and California in the first and second rounds of the Pac-12 tournament before losing a rematch with Oregon, the eventual champion.\n\nKrystkowiak's third season saw the [[2013\u201314 Utah Utes men's basketball team|2013\u20132014 Runnin' Utes]] reach their first postseason tournament under the coach.  The addition of transfer point guard Delon Wright and an improved core of players led Utah to a 21-12 record, receiving an at-large bid to the [[2014 NIT|NIT]]. The next year, he led his team to the sweet sixteen, their highest run in the tournament in years. In 2017\u201318, he led the Utes to their first NIT finals appearance in 44 years. \n\nThe [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] nominated Krystkowiak for its Class of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Election results |url=http://polishsportshof.com/organization/election-results/ |publisher=National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130621233915/http://polishsportshof.com/organization/election-results/ |archivedate=June 21, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On June 21, 2018 Krystkowiak will be enshrined into the  [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Class of 2018 in Troy, Michigan.\n\n==Personal life==\nLarry and his wife, Jan, have five children, Cam, Luc, Ben and twin girls Samantha and Finley.<ref name=\"NBABio\"/> He has seen his father only once in over 30 years, because of the issues in his early life.<ref name=\"grfx\"/>\n\n==Head coaching record==\nLarry Krystkowiak's record as a head coach.\n\n=== CBA ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular Season !! colspan=\"1\"|Post Season\n|-\n!

He played power forward for nine seasons in the NBA, spending the bulk of his career with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]].  He also played for the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Orlando Magic]], [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. In the 1988\u201389 season he averaged 12.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, 1.3 assists and over 30 minutes per game for the Bucks.<ref name=\"dbBasketball\"/> Over his NBA career, he averaged 8.1 points and 4.9 rebounds per contest.<ref name=\"dbBasketball\"/>\n\n==Coaching career==\n===Early career===\nKrystkowiak began his coaching career in 1998 as an assistant to Don Holst at his alma mater, the [[University of Montana \u2013 Missoula|University of Montana]].  He coached at Montana until 2000 when he left to join [[Old Dominion Monarchs basketball|Old Dominion]] as an assistant under former Griz head coach, [[Blaine Taylor]].<ref name=\"KryskoHiredAtUM\" /> He spent one season (2001\u20132002) at Old Dominion.\n\nKrystkowiak got his first opportunity as a head coach with the [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA's]] [[Idaho Stampede]] in 2003\u201304.  In his single season as the Stampede's head coach, he led the team to a 37\u201316 record and a CBA championship game berth.<ref name=\"NBABio\"/>\n\nHe was hired as head men's basketball coach at the [[University of Montana \u2013 Missoula|University of Montana]] in May 2004.  He led the Griz to a 42\u201320 overall record over the course of the next two seasons, reaching the NCAA tournament each year as a result of winning the [[Big Sky Conference]] tourney.  In 2006 the Grizzlies beat heavily favored, fifth seed, [[University of Nevada, Reno|Nevada]], in the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]].\n\n===NBA coaching career===\n\nIn June 2006 Krystkowiak left Montana to take a job as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks under [[Terry Stotts]].  Krystkowiak was responsible for working with the Milwaukee's big men, notably second year players [[Andrew Bogut]] and [[Charlie Villanueva]].<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=439859 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133549/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=439859 |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> He was named head coach of the team on March 14, 2007, after Stotts was fired.

In a season where starting center David Foster missed the entire season and starting point guard Josh \"Jiggy\" Watkins was dismissed halfway through,  Krystkowiak and the Utes struggled to a 6-25 finish, including only three wins against their new Pac-12 opponents.\n\nThe [[2012\u201313 Utah Utes men's basketball team|2012\u20132013]] season showed much improvement for Krystkowiak's Utes.  The additions of freshmen Jordan Loveridge and Brandon Taylor, as well as great play and leadership from senior center Jason Washburn, would help Utah more than double their win total from the previous season.  On March 9, 2013, Utah closed out its season by defeating No. 19 Oregon, celebrating Senior Night at the Huntsman Center with the program's first victory over a ranked opponent since 2009. Utah then defeated USC and California in the first and second rounds of the Pac-12 tournament before losing a rematch with Oregon, the eventual champion.\n\nKrystkowiak's third season saw the [[2013\u201314 Utah Utes men's basketball team|2013\u20132014 Runnin' Utes]] reach their first postseason tournament under the coach.  The addition of transfer point guard Delon Wright and an improved core of players led Utah to a 21-12 record, receiving an at-large bid to the [[2014 NIT|NIT]]. The next year, he led his team to the sweet sixteen, their highest run in the tournament in years. In 2017\u201318, he led the Utes to their first NIT finals appearance in 44 years. \n\nThe [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] nominated Krystkowiak for its Class of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Election results |url=http://polishsportshof.com/organization/election-results/ |publisher=National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130621233915/http://polishsportshof.com/organization/election-results/ |archivedate=June 21, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On June 21, 2018 Krystkowiak will be enshrined into the  [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Class of 2018 in Troy, Michigan.\n\n==Personal life==\nLarry and his wife, Jan, have five children, Cam, Luc, Ben and twin girls Samantha and Finley.<ref name=\"NBABio\"/> He has seen his father only once in over 30 years, because of the issues in his early life.<ref name=\"grfx\"/>\n\n==Head coaching record==\nLarry Krystkowiak's record as a head coach.\n\n=== CBA ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular Season !! colspan=\"1\"|Post Season\n|-\n!

CDCR correctional officers are sworn law enforcement officers with peace officer powers.\n\nAs of 2013, CDCR employed approximately 24,000 peace officers (state correctional officers), 1,800 state parole agents, and 200 criminal investigators/special agents.\n\n\n\n'''Secretary Ralph Diaz'''\n\nRalph Diaz was appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom as Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) on March 27, 2019. Most recently, he served as Undersecretary of Operations, Deputy Director of Facility Operations, and Associate Director of High Security Institutions. Before that, Mr. Diaz served as a prison Warden, Correctional Counselor Supervisor, and Correctional Counselor, after starting his career as a Correctional Officer in 1991. \n\nMr. Diaz has the honor and privilege to lead over 60,000 of the nation\u2019s finest correctional professionals, who provide outstanding levels of rehabilitative services to the offenders in our care. \n\nWith more than 29 years of diverse correctional experience, Mr. Diaz has seen first-hand how restorative justice practices can transform communities inside and outside prison walls. He believes in a holistic approach to corrections that offers a variety of educational, vocational, and therapeutic programs to offenders while also stressing individual accountability and respecting and honoring victims of crime.\n\nMr. Diaz has been instrumental in developing policies focused on staff well-being and professional development, while empowering them to serve as role models and mentors to all.<ref>{{cite web |title=Secretary Ralph Diaz |url=https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/about-cdcr/secretary/ |website=California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1851, California activated its first state-run institution.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" Although the gang was known about for years, the formal investigation began in the spring of 2016, when SSU obtained evidence of Woodland residents with ties to Nuestra Familia gang members incarcerated at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California. Although centered in Woodland, the investigation revealed that at least nine other California counties were negatively impacted by these criminal organizations including Sacramento, Sutter, Colusa, Yuba, Del Norte, Solano, Fresno, Santa Clara, and Siskiyou. Ironically, the massive arrest sweep took place on February 14, 2018. More than 750 law enforcement federal, state and local officers netted 29 suspects on drug and weapons charges across 10 Northern California counties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public.

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" Although the gang was known about for years, the formal investigation began in the spring of 2016, when SSU obtained evidence of Woodland residents with ties to Nuestra Familia gang members incarcerated at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California. Although centered in Woodland, the investigation revealed that at least nine other California counties were negatively impacted by these criminal organizations including Sacramento, Sutter, Colusa, Yuba, Del Norte, Solano, Fresno, Santa Clara, and Siskiyou. Ironically, the massive arrest sweep took place on February 14, 2018. More than 750 law enforcement federal, state and local officers netted 29 suspects on drug and weapons charges across 10 Northern California counties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nTwo others were arrested in Pittsburgh and the Medford, Oregon, area.\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

In 1905 it was replaced by a larger church, and the old church became the parish hall.  The new church included a pipe organ, Opus 264 by Casavant Fr\u00e8res of Qu\u00e9bec, said to be the first to be constructed west of the Rockies.\n\nThe old church was replaced by a new parish hall and a rectory in 1911.  The rectory was re-located to allow the hall to be extended in 1929.  The site at the corner of Jervis Street and Pendrell Street had assumed its present configuration, except for a wheelchair ramp added in 2002.\n\nThe parish thrived, serving a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.  It adopted a traditional Anglican Sunday liturgical pattern of Holy Communion, Morning Prayer and Evensong, supported by educational and social activities like Ladies\u2019 and Men\u2019s Guilds, scouts and guides and youth groups.  \n\nThe mid-thirties depression presented financial difficulties but optimism revived after the Second World War.  Two rectors \u2013 Adam de Pencier (1908 \u2013 1910) and Godfrey Gower (1944 \u2013 1951) \u2013 went on to become Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster.  \n\nPost- war changes\n\nDavid Crawley was appointed rector (1985 \u2013 1990) as the centennial of the parish approached.  By this time the character of the West End had changed significantly.\n\n\u201cIn the 1950s, developers began pulling down the old family houses of the West End to make room for apartment buildings.  The composition of the population changed with the changes in residential housing and the population density increased to become one of the highest in Canada.  Old-style families were replaced by single-parent families, who were joined by previously unknown (or, at least, unrecognized) residents like gays and lesbians and unmarried couples living together.  For most of these persons St Paul\u2019s was perceived as irrelevant, if not invisible, and to some as passively or actively hostile.\u201d <ref>Buck, op. cit., page 50.</ref>\n\nThe parish set in process significant reforms of its liturgical practices and pastoral ministries.  Foremost of the changes was the ministry to members of the LGBT community, many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Crawley\u2019s successor, Neil Gray (1991 \u2013 2003), set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  The result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion.\n\nSt Paul\u2019s played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  \n\nIn 1973, the Pendrellis, a high-rise apartment building for accommodating seniors at subsidised rents, was constructed on parish property, and in 1995 St Paul\u2019s Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.  At the principal Sunday morning service, the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer which was used for the last time in 1995.\n\nA contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used for the first time in 1981 and the Book of Common Prayer rite was used for the last time in 2014.\n\nThe Eucharist was first celebrated by a woman priest, Barbara Blakely, in 1982.  Following the appointment of several women as assistant priests, Jessica Schaap (2013 \u2013 2017) became the first woman rector. \n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://stpaulsanglican.bc.ca/ St. Paul's Anglican Church]\n\n{{coord|49.28321|N|123.13385|W|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Paul's Anglican Church (Vancouver)}}\n[[Category:Anglican church buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Heritage buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1905]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1881]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox church\n| church name = St Paul's Anglican Church\n| denomination = Anglican Church of Canada\n| country = Canada\n| location = Vancouver, British Columbia\n| deanery = Kingsway\n| archdeaconry = Burrard\n| province = Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and the Yukon\n| diocese = New Westminster\n| archbishop = The Most Rev'd Melissa Skelton, Archbishop of New Westminster\n| rector = Rev'd Philip Cochrane\n| asstpriest = \n}}[[File:St. Paul's Anglican Episcopal Church.JPG|left|thumb|250px|St. Paul's West-End Anglican Church]]'''St. Paul's Anglican Church (established 1889) serves the south-west downtown peninsula of Vancouver, British Columbia, alongside Christ Church Cathedral (established 1888) serving the north-east.

Foremost of the changes was the ministry to members of the LGBT community, many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Crawley\u2019s successor, Neil Gray (1991 \u2013 2003), set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  The result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion.\n\nSt Paul\u2019s played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  \n\nIn 1973, the Pendrellis, a high-rise apartment building for accommodating seniors at subsidised rents, was constructed on parish property, and in 1995 St Paul\u2019s Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.  At the principal Sunday morning service, the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer which was used for the last time in 1995.\n\nA contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used for the first time in 1981 and the Book of Common Prayer rite was used for the last time in 2014.\n\nThe Eucharist was first celebrated by a woman priest, Barbara Blakely, in 1982.  Following the appointment of several women as assistant priests, Jessica Schaap (2013 \u2013 2017) became the first woman rector. \n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://stpaulsanglican.bc.ca/ St. Paul's Anglican Church]\n\n{{coord|49.28321|N|123.13385|W|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Paul's Anglican Church (Vancouver)}}\n[[Category:Anglican church buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Heritage buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1905]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1881]]\n", "name_user": "Elljaybee1929", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed 'bishops' to 'Bishop'", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul%27s_Anglican_Church_(Vancouver)"}
