If they are good enough, a transition is made so that they can represent Uppsala Kurd in the series game. The goal is to bring Uppsala Kurd higher up in the series system. We want to be able to offer young players good senior match environments on the way to Dalkurd FF want Uppsala Kurd A in div 3, 2020 and then the goal is to come up in the second in a few years.\nThe football played and the training methodology in Uppsala Kurd is the same as in Dalkurd A and the Dalkurd Academy.\n\n==Crest==\nThe crest consist of a round circle with the [[flag of Kurdistan]] as well as two [[Dalecarlian horse]]s. \"Dal\" and \"Kurd FF\" is spelled out in white letters on the top and bottom of the crest, as well as the year 2004.\n\n==Kit==\nThe traditional home colors of Dalkurd are all green.

Uppsala Kurd plays in div. 4 Uppland and is a farm team for Dalkurd FF.\nPlayers from the Dalkurd Academy regularly train with Uppsala Kurd. If they are good enough, a transition is made so that they can represent Uppsala Kurd in the series game. The goal is to bring Uppsala Kurd higher up in the series system. We want to be able to offer young players good senior match environments on the way to Dalkurd FF want Uppsala Kurd A in div 3, 2020 and then the goal is to come up in the second in a few years.\nThe football played and the training methodology in Uppsala Kurd is the same as in Dalkurd A and the Dalkurd Academy.\n\n==Crest==\nThe crest consist of a round circle with the [[flag of Kurdistan]] as well as two [[Dalecarlian horse]]s. \"Dal\" and \"Kurd FF\" is spelled out in white letters on the top and bottom of the crest, as well as the year 2004.\n\n==Kit==\nThe traditional home colors of Dalkurd are all green.

The Great Chinese famine is widely regarded as the deadliest famine and one of the greatest disasters in human history, with estimated death toll ranges in the tens of millions due to starvation. In 1958, some areas in the southern coast of China received intense rainfall over the span of just a few days, causing crops and citizens to drown in flooding. In 1959 and 1960, nearly two thirds of China's farmland received little to no precipitation, especially in northern China. Before this time, most of the farmland in China was not irrigated, so was dependent on the natural rainfall. In response to the dramatic weather events, the central government mandated policies which resulted in making the situation much worse.

Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\nIn 2008, [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets :\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had begun to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared argued that, much like Amartya Sen's earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. This claim was made in the face of reports of the worst flooding since 1933<ref name=\"dahe\" />, and aforementioned evidence that crop yields had fallen by at least 30%. They claim that unlike most other famines, there were more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\".

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite

The Great Chinese famine is widely regarded as the deadliest famine and one of the greatest disasters in human history, with estimated death toll ranges in the tens of millions due to starvation. In 1958, some areas in the southern coast of China received intense rainfall over the span of just a few days, causing crops and citizens to drown in flooding. In 1959 and 1960, nearly two thirds of China's farmland received little to no precipitation, especially in northern China. Before this time, most of the farmland in China was not irrigated, so was dependent on the natural rainfall. In response to the dramatic weather events, the central government mandated policies which resulted in making the situation much worse. In 1961, [[Liu Shaoqi]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|2nd Chairman of PRC]] attributed the famine 30% to natural disasters and 70% to man-made policies (\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e, \u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\").\n\n== Terminology ==\nBesides the name \"Three Years of Great Famine\" ({{zh|s=\u4e09\u5e74\u5927\u9965\u8352|t=\u4e09\u5e74\u5927\u9951\u8352|p=S\u0101nni\u00e1n d\u00e0 j\u012bhu\u0101ng}}), the famine has been known by many names. \n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] called it:<ref name=\"Songster-2004\">{{cite book|last=Songster|first=Edith Elena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSyIXwAACAAJ|title=A Natural Place for Nationalism: The Wanglang Nature Reserve and the Emergence of the Giant Panda as a National Icon|publisher=University of California, San Diego|year=2004|type=thesis|oclc=607612241|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=J.|date=17 February 2015|title=New (approved) assessments The great famine|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2013/09/new-approved-assessments|url-status=live|journal=The Economist|language=English|location=Beijing|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120153221/https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2013/09/new-approved-assessments|archive-date=20 January 2018|accessdate=18 January 2018}} citing {{cite book|last=Dik\u00f6tter|first=Frank|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuvlBQAAQBAJ|title=The Tragedy of Liberation: A History of the Chinese Revolution 1945\u20131957|date=17 February 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|isbn=978-1-62040-349-5|location=London|oclc=881092774|accessdate=18 January 2018}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Before the 1980s, \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\" ({{zh|s=\u4e09\u5e74\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3|t=\u4e09\u5e74\u81ea\u7136\u707d\u5bb3|p=S\u0101nni\u00e1n z\u00ecr\u00e1n z\u0101ih\u00e0i}}). \n* After the 1980s, \"Three Years of Difficulty\" ({{zh|s=\u4e09\u5e74\u56f0\u96be\u65f6\u671f|t=\u4e09\u5e74\u56f0\u96e3\u6642\u671f|p=S\u0101nni\u00e1n k\u00f9nn\u00e1n sh\u00edq\u012b}}).\n\n==Extent of the famine==\n\n=== Production drop ===\n[[File:Birth rate in China.svg|thumb|upright=2|{{center|Birth and death rate in China}}]]\n[[File:China-pyramid-1982.svg|thumb|Chinese [[population pyramid]] from 1982, displaying a shortage of people born in 1959\u201361, reflecting the high [[infant mortality]] and low birth rate during the period]]\n\nHarmful changes in farming organization and policies were made in response to grain shortages and adverse weather patterns, including droughts and floods.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared argued that, much like Amartya Sen's earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. This claim was made in the face of reports of the worst flooding since 1933<ref name=\"dahe\" />, and aforementioned evidence that crop yields had fallen by at least 30%. They claim that unlike most other famines, there were more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine.

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite

The historied rivalry began when Ateneo lost to De La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game during the 16th NCAA Season (1939\u201340). Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society.

The [[Collegiate Champions League]] (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [[Philippine Collegiate Championship League]] (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during \"March Madness.\"\n\nThe Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [[San Beda Red Lions]] and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [[Letran Knights]] in the Final Four. In the championship match, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] prevailed over the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], 71\u201362.\n\nIn the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the FEU Tamaraws in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16. In the 2010 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-place beating the UC Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and only 10 players intact in the line-up.\n\nIn the 2013 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Green Archers defeated the South Western University Cobras, via sweep to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2008 and winning their second title in the tournament.\n\nIn the 2018 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the University of Visayas Green Lancers, 95\u201371 to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2010 and winning their fourth title in the tournament.

They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).\n\nAteneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.\n\nLa Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a rare 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [[UAAP Season 61|1998]] to [[UAAP Season 64|2001]]. La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4-peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

The Green Archers finished the elimination round as the top seed with a 13\u20131 record with Ateneo coming in second with a 10\u20134 win-loss record. The only loss of the Green Archers came at the hands of their archivals, the Ateneo Blue Eagles during the second to the last game of the elimination round.

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship. Ateneo High School and [[De La Salle Santiago Zobel School]] (DLSZ) met twice in the UAAP juniors' basketball finals; in [[UAAP Season 70|2007]] in which DLSZ won in two games dethroning the Eaglets in the process, and in [[UAAP Season 72|2009]] in which the Blue Eaglets won the best-of-three series, 2\u20131.

The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won 7 championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75.

On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three.

The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers recorded their first victory against Ateneo Lady Eagles during this game for this season in four sets, 21\u201325, 29\u201327, 25\u201322 and 25\u201320. Game Two of the Finals was held again at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 6, 2017 in front of 20,860 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers won against Ateneo Lady Eagles in five sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201314, 18\u201325, 25\u201318 and 15\u201310, to finish the series in two games and earn their second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP women's volleyball title. La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nThe rivalry began in [[UAAP Season 74]] when both teams met in the Finals for the first time. Head-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading 4 championships to 2. The Ateneo Lady Eagles and the De La Salle Lady Spikers have fought in the UAAP women's volleyball finals for six (6) consecutive times from Seasons 74 to 79 (2012\u20132017), where the Lady Eagles won in 2014 and 2015 while the Lady Spikers won in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017.\n\n===UAAP women's volleyball results===\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!width=120px|Season !!width=75px| Ateneo !!width=75px| La Salle !!width=210px|Venue !!Note/s !!Series\n|-\n|Season 60 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || ||\n|-\n|Season 60 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first [[UAAP Final Four]] appearance since their admission in 1986. ||\n|-\n|Season 61 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || ||\n|-\n|Season 61 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball Finals]] appearance since their admission in 1986. ||\n|-\n|Season 62 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 62 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their first [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 63 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 63 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 64 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 64 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 65 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 65 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 66 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 66 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] were automatically declared as champions after sweeping the double elimination round and went on to bag their second [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 67 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 67 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their second straight and third [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 68 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Cuneta Astrodome]], [[Pasay]] || || \n|-\n|Season 68 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Cuneta Astrodome]], [[Pasay]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their third straight and fourth [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 69 || colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|All [[De La Salle University]] varsity teams were suspended on this UAAP season.}} ||\n|-\n|Season 70 ||bgcolor=blue| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> Ateneo 3 </span> ''' || La Salle 1 || [[Filoil Flying V Centre]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]] || [[Ateneo Lady Eagles volleyball team|Ateneo Lady Eagles]] and [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first meeting since La Salle's suspension. || \n|-\n|Season 70 ||bgcolor=blue| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> <s> Ateneo 3 </s> </span> ''' || <s> La Salle 1 </s> || [[Filoil Flying V Centre]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]] || All games of La Salle in the second elimination round were nullified due to La Salle's Jacqueline Alarca's ineligibility.

The historied rivalry began when Ateneo lost to De La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game during the 16th NCAA Season (1939\u201340). Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society.

The [[Collegiate Champions League]] (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [[Philippine Collegiate Championship League]] (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during \"March Madness.\"\n\nThe Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [[San Beda Red Lions]] and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [[Letran Knights]] in the Final Four. In the championship match, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] prevailed over the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], 71\u201362.\n\nIn the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the FEU Tamaraws in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16. In the 2010 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-place beating the UC Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and only 10 players intact in the line-up.\n\nIn the 2013 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Green Archers defeated the South Western University Cobras, via sweep to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2008 and winning their second title in the tournament.\n\nIn the 2018 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the University of Visayas Green Lancers, 95\u201371 to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2010 and winning their fourth title in the tournament.

They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).\n\nAteneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.\n\nLa Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a rare 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [[UAAP Season 61|1998]] to [[UAAP Season 64|2001]]. La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4-peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship.

The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won 7 championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75.

On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three.

The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers recorded their first victory against Ateneo Lady Eagles during this game for this season in four sets, 21\u201325, 29\u201327, 25\u201322 and 25\u201320. Game Two of the Finals was held again at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 6, 2017 in front of 20,860 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers won against Ateneo Lady Eagles in five sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201314, 18\u201325, 25\u201318 and 15\u201310, to finish the series in two games and earn their second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP women's volleyball title. La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nThe rivalry began in [[UAAP Season 74]] when both teams met in the Finals for the first time. Head-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading 4 championships to 2. The Ateneo Lady Eagles and the De La Salle Lady Spikers have fought in the UAAP women's volleyball finals for six (6) consecutive times from Seasons 74 to 79 (2012\u20132017), where the Lady Eagles won in 2014 and 2015 while the Lady Spikers won in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017.\n\n===UAAP women's volleyball results===\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!width=120px|Season !!width=75px| Ateneo !!width=75px| La Salle !!width=210px|Venue !!Note/s !!Series\n|-\n|Season 60 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || ||\n|-\n|Season 60 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first [[UAAP Final Four]] appearance since their admission in 1986. ||\n|-\n|Season 61 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || ||\n|-\n|Season 61 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball finals]] appearance since their admission in 1986. ||\n|-\n|Season 62 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 62 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their first [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 63 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 63 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 64 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 64 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 65 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 65 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 66 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 66 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] were automatically declared as champions after sweeping the double elimination round and went on to bag their second [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 67 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 67 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their second straight and third [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 68 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Cuneta Astrodome]], [[Pasay]] || || \n|-\n|Season 68 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Cuneta Astrodome]], [[Pasay]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their third straight and fourth [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 69 || colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|All [[De La Salle University]] varsity teams were suspended on this UAAP season.}} ||\n|-\n|Season 70 ||bgcolor=blue| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> Ateneo 3 </span> ''' || La Salle 1 || [[Filoil Flying V Centre]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]] || [[Ateneo Lady Eagles volleyball team|Ateneo Lady Eagles]] and [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first meeting since La Salle's suspension. || \n|-\n|Season 70 ||bgcolor=blue| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> <s> Ateneo 3 </s> </span> ''' || <s> La Salle 1 </s> || [[Filoil Flying V Centre]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]] || All games of La Salle in the second elimination round were nullified due to La Salle's Jacqueline Alarca's ineligibility.

In the UAAP La Salle also leads with a combined 15 titles, made up of 4 men's titles and 11 women's titles, versus Ateneo's 8 men's titles.\n\nIn the NCAA juniors division, La Salle has 30 titles versus Ateneo's 3 titles. The De La Salle Junior Archers were twice 5-peat champions from 1937 through 1941 and 1971 through 1976.

In the inaugural UAAP Juniors Football Championship in 2007\u201308, De La Salle Zobel won the demonstration championship. Ateneo won the demonstration championship the following year. In 2009\u201310, Ateneo won the first official UAAP Juniors Football Championship.\n\nFor the De La Salle Zobel boys' football team, they have maintained 5 years of high school football championships in the RIFA cup 1 and 2 where Ateneo was not successful in winning any match against De La Salle Zobel which totaled 9 championship titles from 2001 to 2005. From 2001 to 2005, De La Salle Zobel were RIFA 1 and 2 champions 9 times, most of them back to back champions in every year. The only loss De La Salle Zobel encountered was a loss to Xavier high school during the RIFA 2 championship in 2004.\n\n===Badminton===\n\nAteneo has 11 titles whereas La Salle has 6 in terms of total seniors' badminton collegiate championships. The last men's badminton crown for La Salle came in 2007 and for Ateneo in 2013. Ateneo also won championship titles in 1995, 1996, 2001, 2003, and 2011. In women's badminton, La Salle won in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009, and 2017. Ateneo won in 2003, 2012, 2013, 2018, and 2019.

In the juniors' division, Ateneo were 3-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 62 to 64. In poomsae, La Salle has 3 championships while Ateneo has yet to win a title.\n\n===Judo===\n\nIn judo, Ateneo has the upper hand with 8 collegiate titles while La Salle has 2. La Salle's men's team won their first title in 1992 while the women's team won their first title in 2013 which ended La Salle's 21-year title drought. La Salle almost won their first Judo championships in Season 71 with 3 gold medals and the Ateneo with 2. Ateneo was able to clinch championships with bronze medals that boosted them to the overall championship. In the juniors' division, Ateneo has 9 championships while La Salle has yet to win a title.\n\n===Swimming===\n\nIn collegiate swimming, La Salle has 16 titles versus Ateneo with 13 titles. La Salle was 3-peat champion in the men's division in 2000, 2001, and 2002 as well as being back-to-back champions in the women's division in 2002 and 2003. Ateneo won both men's and women's titles in UAAP Seasons 77 and 78, as well as Seasons 80 to 82. In the juniors' division, La Salle has 9 NCAA titles and 4 UAAP titles for a total of 13 championship titles. Ateneo won all 12 of its championship titles in the UAAP.\n\n===Baseball===\n\nIn collegiate baseball, Ateneo leads La Salle 6\u20135. Prior to Ateneo's 10-year curse, in 1991, La Salle lost to Ateneo 10\u20135 for Ateneo's last victory before the infamous losing streak. It took 13 years before Ateneo could beat La Salle when in 2004, Johnel Clemente's game-winning RBI single off La Salle pitcher Angel Gabriel nailed Ateneo's victory, 9\u20138. In 2006, Ateneo handed La Salle its first humiliating 10-run loss, 17\u20137, on Jonathan Sibal's 2-RBI single off pitcher Jeff Ardio which ended the game prematurely at the 8th inning (mercy rule). La Salle actually led 7\u20134 in the 4th inning before Ateneo exploded for 9 runs and put the game out of reach. In 2009, Ateneo and La Salle combined for what may be the highest scoring game in UAAP Baseball history when Ateneo defeated La Salle, 27\u201314. In [[UAAP Season 78]], La Salle dethroned Ateneo who were the 3-peat defending champions. Both teams would meet again in the [[UAAP Season 81]] Finals, where La Salle won their fifth championship title after defeating Ateneo in Game 3, 11\u20139. In the juniors' division, Ateneo has 2 NCAA titles and 3 UAAP titles for a total of 5 championship titles. La Salle won all 4 of its championship titles in the UAAP.\n\n==Trivia==\nDue to the numerous socialites watching the games live, La Salle head coach [[Franz Pumaren]] said that \"The janitors in the Araneta Coliseum would often say, 'If there's an Ateneo\u2013La Salle game, once everybody's out of the coliseum, it still smells good because of all the socialites watching.\" In the late 1990s, former first daughter and actress [[Kris Aquino]] would call Ateneo head coach [[Joe Lipa]] to check on the team's progress, according to Ricky Dandan, Lipa's former assistant and brother of former [[NU Bulldogs]] coach Manny. [[Joel Banal]], Ateneo's head coach from 2002 to [[UAAP Season 66|2003]], used to have nightmares about La Salle's dreaded [[Full-court press|press]], and considers the 2002 championship as his greatest accomplishment, after which Ateneo alums would pay for his restaurant bills. Moreover, Ateneo alumni installed the playing floor on the [[2000 NBA All-Star Game]] to the [[Moro Lorenzo Sports Center]], while [[ICTSI]] shipping magnate Billionaire [[Enrique K. Razon|Enrique Razon, Jr.]] donated US$1 million to refurbish La Salle's sporting facilities at the [[Enrique M.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. \n\nConwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. \n\nAlthough he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} \n\nConwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThe British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with [[Pennsylvania#Religion|few Catholics]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} \n\nThere was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}<ref>http://vikypedia.com/adobe-xd-cc-crack-latest-download/</ref><ref>http://vikypedia.com/adobe-xd-cc-crack-latest-download</ref>\n\n===Hogan schism===\n{{see| William Hogan (priest)}}\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 December 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} \n\nThe trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} \n\nAfter only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]]. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's general conduct created tension with Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.The trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91-92}}\n\nIn the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] \u2014 William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on 27 May 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} \n\nPhiladelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} \n\nThe pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} \n\nThe next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city  {{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} (later he completely left the Church and became a vehement anti-Catholic propagandist).{{cn}} \n\nIn hopes of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J.

While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} \n\nConwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} \n\nHe received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on 22 April 1842, at about the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession. Under threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} \n\nConwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. \n\nConwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. \n\nAlthough he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} \n\nConwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThe British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with [[Pennsylvania#Religion|few Catholics]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} \n\nThere was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}<ref>http://vikypedia.com/adobe-xd-cc-crack-latest-download/</ref><ref>http://vikypedia.com/adobe-xd-cc-crack-latest-download</ref>\n\n===Hogan schism===\n{{see| William Hogan (priest)}}\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 December 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} \n\nThe trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} \n\nAfter only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]]. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's general conduct created tension with Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.The trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91-92}}\n\nIn the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] \u2014 William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on 27 May 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} \n\nPhiladelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} \n\nThe pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} \n\nThe next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city  {{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} (later he completely left the Church and became a vehement anti-Catholic propagandist).{{cn}} \n\nIn hopes of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}}\n\nConwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} \n\nIn 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}}\n\n[[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} \n\nConwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} \n\nConwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} \n\nHe received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on 22 April 1842, at about the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession. Under threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} \n\nConwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard. In 1864 the remains were transferred to the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]].{{sfn|Luke|1940|p=293}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist | colwidth = 26em | refs = }}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bransom\n  | first = Charles N.\n  | title = Ordinations of U.S. Catholic Bishops, 1790\u20131989\n  | year = 1990\n  | publisher = United States Catholic Conference\n  | location = Washington, D.C.\n  | isbn = 1-55586-323-X\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Ennis\n  | first = Arthur J.\n  | editor-last = Connelly\n  | editor-first = James F.\n  | title = The History of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia\n  | publisher = Unigraphics Incorporated\n  | location = Wynnewood, Pennsylvania\n  | date = 1976\n  | pages = 63\u2013112\n  | chapter = Chapter Two: The New Diocese\n  | oclc = 4192313\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia\n  | last = Loughlin\n  | first = James\n  | title = Henry Conwell\n  | encyclopedia = [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]\n  | publisher = Robert Appleton Company\n  | location = New York\n  | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04349a.htm\n  | year = 1908\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Nolan\n  | first = Hugh J.\n  | editor-last = Connelly\n  | editor-first = James F.\n  | title = The History of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia\n  | publisher = Unigraphics Incorporated\n  | location = Wynnewood, Pennsylvania\n  | date = 1976\n  | pages = 113\u2013208\n  | chapter = Chapter Three: Francis Patrick Kenrick, First Coadjutor-Bishop\n  | oclc = 4192313\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Shea\n  | first = John Gilmary\n  | year = 1886\n  | title = The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church in the United States\n  | publisher = The Office of Catholic Publications\n  | location = New York\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/HierarchyOfTheCatholicChurchUSA\n  | oclc = 8217858\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n'''Articles'''\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Barr\n  | first = Colin\n  | title = 'Imperium in Imperio': Irish Episcopal Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century\n  | journal = The English Historical Review\n  | date = June 2008\n  | volume= 123\n  | issue = 502\n  | pages = 611\u2013650\n  | jstor = 20108543\n  | ref = harv\n  | doi=10.1093/ehr/cen161\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Carey\n  | first = Patrick\n  | title = The Laity's Understanding of the Trustee System, 1785\u20131855\n  | journal = The Catholic Historical Review\n  | date = July 1978\n  | volume= 64\n  | issue = 3\n  | pages = 357\u2013376\n  | jstor = 25020365\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Griffin\n  | first = Martin I.J.\n  | title = Life of Bishop Conwell of Philadelphia [part]\n  | journal = Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia\n  | date = 1913\n  | volume= 23\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 16\u201342\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=XJdJAAAAYAAJ\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Griffin\n  | first = Martin I.J.\n  | title = Life of Bishop Conwell of Philadelphia [part]\n  | journal = Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia\n  | date = 1915\n  | volume= 26\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 162\u2013178\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ShhPAQAAMAAJ\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Hessinger\n  | first = Rodney\n  | title = \"A Base and Unmanly Conspiracy\" Catholicism and the Hogan Schism in the Gendered Religious Marketplace of Philadelphia\n  | journal = Journal of the Early Republic\n  | date = Fall 2011\n  | volume= 31\n  | issue = 3\n  | pages = 357\u2013396\n  | jstor = 41261629\n  | ref = harv\n  | doi=10.1353/jer.2011.0033\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Luke\n  | first = Brother\n  | title = Calendar of the Letters of Rev.
