Much of the early work was in the area of research and development. Along with early TV sets (DE-6, E1, DE10) Fernseh AG made the first \"Remote Truck\"/\"[[Outside broadcasting|OB van]]\", an \"intermediate-film\" mobile television camera in August 1932. This was a film camera that had its film developed in the truck and a \"telecine\" then transmitted the signal almost \"live\".<ref>[http://www.fernsehmuseum.info/fese-historie-01.0.html?&L=0%29 Sie sind auf der Homepage von Fernsehmuseum Wiesbaden: Fese Historie 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Fernseh GmbH==\n*In 1939 [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] took complete ownership of Fernseh AG when Zeiss Ikon AG sold its share of Fernseh AG.\n*In 1952 Fernseh moved to [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]], and increased its broadcast product line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fernseh-gmbh.de/seitenleiste_eng.html|title=Farvis TV museum Pfungstadt|last=Fiona}}</ref>\n*In 1967 Fernseh, by then commonly called \"Bosch Fernseh\", introduced color TV products. Fernseh offered a full line of video and film equipment: [[professional video camera]]s, [[VTR]]s and [[telecine]] devices. On August 27, 1967, the first color TV program in Germany aired, with a live broadcast from a Bosch Fernseh outside broadcast (OB) van. The networks [[ZDF]], [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] and [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] each acquired a new color OB van from Bosch Fernseh to begin broadcasting in color.\n\n==Fernsehanlagen GmbH==\nIn 1972 Robert Bosch renamed its TV division: Fernsehanlagen GmbH (Fernseh facilities). The company supplied almost all the studio equipment for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich. The Darmstadt HQ had over 2000 employees in 1972. In 1972 Fernseh started to manufacture [[SECAM]] TV studio equipment for [[Moscow]].\n\n==Fernseh Inc.==\n*In October 1979 [[Bell and Howell]]'s [[TeleMation Inc.]] Division located in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], entered a joint venture with [[Robert Bosch GmbH]],  Bosch\u2019s Fernseh Division. The new joint venture was call Fernseh Inc.,  Bosch Fernseh Division was located in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]\n*In April 1982 Bosch fully acquired Fernseh Inc., renaming it \"Robert Bosch Corporation, Fernseh Division\"\n*In 1986 Bosch entered into a new joint venture with [[Philips]] Broadcast in [[Breda]], [[Netherlands]]. This new company was called [[Broadcast Television Systems Inc.|Broadcast Television Systems]] or BTS inc. Philips had been in the Broadcast market for many years with a line of PC- and LDK- [[Norelco]] [[professional video camera]]s and other video products.\n*In 1995 Philips Electronics North America Corp. fully acquired BTS Inc., renaming it Philips Broadcast-Philips Digital Video Systems.\n*In March 2001 this Philips division was sold to [[Thomson SA]], the Division was call Thomson Multimedia. In 2002, the French electronics giant Thomson SA also acquired the Grass Valley Group from a private investor that had acquired it three years earlier from [[Tektronix]] in Beaverton, Oregon, USA. The current name of this division of Thomson is [[Grass Valley (company)|Grass Valley]].  The Fernseh's [[Darmstadt]] factory, near the [[Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof|Darmstadt Train Station]] and [[European Space Operations Centre]] was moved a short distance to [[Weiterstadt]], [[Germany]].

He is noted for his large size, at {{convert|6|ft|9|in|m|abbr=}}, and for his high intellect, possessing an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 145. Wolf was nicknamed the \"Co-ed Killer\" as most of his victims were female students at [[co-educational]] institutions.\n\nBorn in California, Wolf had a disturbed upbringing. His parents divorced and he moved to Montana with his abusive mother as a child before returning to California, where he murdered his paternal grandparents when he was 15. He was diagnosed as a [[paranoid schizophrenic]] by court psychiatrists and sentenced to the [[Atascadero State Hospital]] as a [[criminally insane]] juvenile.\n\nReleased at the age of 21 after convincing psychiatrists he was rehabilitated, Kemper was regarded as non-threatening by his future victims. He targeted young female [[hitchhiking|hitchhikers]] during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to secluded areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. Kemper then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities.\n\nFound sane and guilty at his trial in 1973, Kemper requested the [[death penalty]] for his crimes. Capital punishment was [[Capital punishment in California#1972 suspension of capital punishment|suspended in California]] at the time, and he instead received eight concurrent [[life sentence]]s. Since then, he has been incarcerated in the [[California Medical Facility]]. Kemper has waived his right to a [[parole]] hearing several times and has said he is happy in prison.\n\n==Early life==\nEdmund Emil Kemper III was born in [[Burbank, California]], on December 18, 1948.<ref>{{cite book |title=Genealogy of the Kemper Family in the United States |first1=Virginia Mary |last1=McComb |first2=Willis M. |last2=Kemper |publisher=G.K.

He is noted for his large size, at {{convert|6|ft|9|in|m|abbr=}}, and for his high intellect, possessing an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 145. Kemper was nicknamed the \"Co-ed Killer\" as most of his victims were female students at [[co-educational]] institutions.\n\nBorn in California, Kemper had a disturbed upbringing. His parents divorced and he moved to Montana with his abusive mother as a child before returning to California, where he murdered his paternal grandparents when he was 15. He was diagnosed as a [[paranoid schizophrenic]] by court psychiatrists and sentenced to the [[Atascadero State Hospital]] as a [[criminally insane]] juvenile.\n\nReleased at the age of 21 after convincing psychiatrists he was rehabilitated, Kemper was regarded as non-threatening by his future victims. He targeted young female [[hitchhiking|hitchhikers]] during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to secluded areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. Kemper then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities.\n\nFound sane and guilty at his trial in 1973, Kemper requested the [[death penalty]] for his crimes. Capital punishment was [[Capital punishment in California#1972 suspension of capital punishment|suspended in California]] at the time, and he instead received eight concurrent [[life sentence]]s.

Fort also interviewed Kemper, including under [[truth serum]], and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]], alleging that he sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a [[casserole]].<ref name=\"schechter34\"/><ref name=\"coed12\"/> Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed the prospect of the infamy associated with being labeled a murderer.<ref name=\"coed12\"/> Kemper later recanted the confession of cannibalism.<ref name=\"coed13\"/>\n\nCalifornia used the [[M'Naghten rules|M'Naghten standard]], which held that for a defendant to \"establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/the-m-naghten-rule.html |title=The M'Naghten Rule |website=[[FindLaw]] |access-date=October 4, 2019}}</ref> Kemper appeared to have known that the nature of his acts was wrong, and had shown signs of [[malice aforethought]].<ref name=\"coed12\"/> On November 1, Kemper took the stand.

Kemper showed particular disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders at the same time and in the same area as Kemper. He described Mullin as \"just a cold-blooded killer ... killing everybody he saw for no good reason.\"<ref name=\"vronsky266\"/> Kemper manipulated and physically intimidated Mullin, who, at {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m}}, was more than a foot shorter than him. Kemper stated that \"[Mullin] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts.

His father was a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|Church of England vicar]], and the family lived adjacent to the father's church \u2013 first in [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], then later in [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]].

The band played at parties and school functions, with a repertoire of [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. Harvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing. The band moved to [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1982, but without Calvert; Harvey transitioned from guitar to drums.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and [[D.A.F.]] (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made three studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the '80s and '90S Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave.

His father was a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|Church of England vicar]], and the family lived adjacent to the father's church \u2013 first in [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], then later in [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]].

The band played at parties and school functions, with a repertoire of [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. Harvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing. The band moved to [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1982, but without Calvert; Harvey transitioned from guitar to drums.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made three studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the '80s and '90S Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director.

The 2011 release was supported by a world tour in the same year, which also included Harvey as a touring musician.<ref name=\"Ian\" />\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, titled ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'', released on Mute in 2013, features original compositions by Mick Harvey alongside a song by PJ Harvey (\"Glorious\") and interpretations of The Saints\u2019 \"The Story of Love\", [[Van Morrison]]\u2019s \"The Way Young Lovers Do\", Exuma\u2019s \"Summertime in New York\" and [[Roy Orbison]]\u2019s \"Wild Hearts (Run Out of Time)\". ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'' was recorded at Grace Lane, North Melbourne and Atlantis Sound, Melbourne, and features regular collaborators Westbrook on double bass and Shilo on guitar and violin.\n\n''Delirium Tremens'' (2016) is the third instalment in Harvey's project of translating [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s songs into English, after ''Intoxicated Man'' and ''Pink Elephants''. ''Delirium Tremens'' was recorded in Melbourne with Harvey's Antipodean-based core live band. 10 songs were tracked at Birdland Studios; the project then relocated to Berlin, where a further nine songs were recorded with [[Toby Dammit]] ([[The Stooges]], The Residents) and Bertrand Burgalat (of French label Tricatel), who was the string arranger on the first two volumes.\n\nHarvey again collaborated with PJ Harvey in early 2015, playing and singing on her album ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]''. The following year he joined PJ on tour promoting the album, which was released in April 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Harvey released the album ''The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War'' in collaboration with author [https://eleganthorrors.co.uk Christopher Richard Barker].\n\n==Personal life==\nHarvey divides his time between Europe and Melbourne. He has one son with his partner, Katy Beale, who is a painter. As of 2014, the family resided in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne.<ref name=\"Talk\" />\n\nAs part of his interview with Brisbane writer [[Andrew McMillen]] for the book ''Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs'', Harvey concluded with his perspective on illicit drug use:\n\n<blockquote>\nBecause I\u2019ve been so surrounded by [illicit drug use], I've seen a lot of the problems that come with it. But I've also seen a lot of people, as well, who've used in different ways and not had problems. So the point about banning it across the board is that then you remove that freedom of choice of those people, too. I mean, why does alcohol remain available when other things aren't? It's not a great drug, at all.<ref name=\"Talk\">{{cite web|title='Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs' book launch at Avid Reader, 21 August 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5u_-dvdjM|website=Andrew McMillen on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=28 August 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo albums===\n* ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Two of Diamonds (album)|Two of Diamonds]]'' (2007)\n* ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall'' (2008)\n* ''[[Sketches from the Book of the Dead]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Four (Acts of Love)|Four]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Delirium_Tremens_(Mick_Harvey_Album)|Delirium Tremens]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Intoxicated Women]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War]]'' (2018)\n\n===Film soundtracks===\n* ''The Road To God Knows Where'' & ''Live at the Paradiso'' (1989, together with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds), directed by [[Uli M Schueppel]]\n* ''[[Ghosts... of the Civil Dead]]'' (1990) \n* ''Vaterland'' (1992, together with [[Alexander Hacke]]), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''Alta Marea & Vaterland'' (1993)\n* ''[[To Have & to Hold (film)|To Have & to Hold]]'' (1996) \n* ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'' (2000)\n* ''Planet Alex'' (2000, together with Alexander Hacke), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''[[Australian Rules (film)|Australian Rules]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Suburban Mayhem]]'' (2006) \n* ''Deliver Us from Evil'' (2006)\n* ''Motion Picture Music'' (2006)\n\n===Other CD releases===\n* ''[[And The Ass Saw The Angel]]'' (2000)\n\n===Albums produced for other artists===\n* [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], ''Danger in the Past'' (1990)\n* Once Upon A Time, ''In The Blink of an Eye'' (1992)\n* [[Anita Lane]], ''Dirty Pearl'' (1993)\n* [[The Cruel Sea (band)|The Cruel Sea]], ''[[The Honeymoon Is Over (album)|The Honeymoon Is Over]]'' (1993) (co-producer) (AUS No. 4, also [[ARIA award]] for \"Best Album\" 1994)\n* [[Congo Norvell]], ''Music To Remember Him By'' (1994)\n* [[PJ Harvey]], ''[[Dance Hall at Louse Point]]'' (1996, co-producer)\n* [[Rowland S.
