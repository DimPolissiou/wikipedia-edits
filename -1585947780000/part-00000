URL accessed June 7, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 1906, Wilbur Wade Card, Trinity College's Athletic Director and a member of the Class of 1900, introduced the game of basketball to Trinity. The January 30 issue of The Trinity Chronicle headlined the new sport on its front page. Trinity's first game ended in a loss to [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]], 24\u201310. The game was played in the Angier B. Duke Gymnasium, later known as The Ark. The Trinity team won its first title in 1920, the state championship, by beating the North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering (now [[North Carolina State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State]]) 25 to 24. Earlier in the season they had beaten the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]] 19\u201318 in the first match-up between the two schools. Trinity college then became Duke University.\n\n[[Billy Werber]], Class of 1930, became Duke's first All-American in basketball. The Gothic-style West Campus opened that year, with a new gym, later to be named for Coach Card. The [[Cameron Indoor Stadium|Indoor Stadium]] opened in 1940. Initially it was referred to as an \"Addition\" to the gymnasium. Part of its cost was paid for with the proceeds from the Duke football team's appearance in the 1938 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]. In 1972 it would be named for [[Eddie Cameron]], head coach from 1929 to 1942.\n\nIn 1952, [[Dick Groat]] became the first Duke player to be named National Player of the Year. Duke left the [[Southern Conference]] to become a charter member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in 1953. The Duke team under [[Vic Bubas]] made its first appearance in the [[Final Four]] in 1963, losing 94\u201375 to [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola]] in the semifinal. The next year, Bubas' team reached the national title game, losing to the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|Bruins of UCLA]], who claimed 10 titles in the next 12 years. [[Bob Verga]] was Duke's star player in 1967.\n\nThe basketball program won its 1000th game in 1974, making Duke only the eighth school in [[NCAA]] history to reach that figure. In a turnaround, Coach [[Bill Foster (basketball, born 1929)|Bill Foster]]'s 1978 Blue Devils, who had gone 2\u201310 in the ACC the previous year, won the conference tournament and went on to the NCAA championship game, where they fell to [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. [[Gene Banks]], Mike Gminski ('80) and [[Jim Spanarkel]] ('79) ran the floor.\n\nMike Krzyzewski has been at Duke since 1980.  His many accomplishments include:\n\n:*5 National Championships \u2013 2nd most all time\n:*12 Final Fours (most since 1984\u201385) as well as five in a row from 1988 to 1992.

At the time, it was the largest gymnasium in the country south of the [[Palestra]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Originally called Duke Indoor Stadium, it was renamed for Coach Cameron on January 22, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.duke.edu/archives/history/eddie_cameron.html|title=Home|website=www.lib.duke.edu|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}</ref> The building originally included seating for 8,800, though standing room was sufficient to ensure that 12,000 could fit in on a particularly busy day. Then, as now, Duke students were allowed a large chunk of the seats, including those directly alongside the court. Renovations in 1987\u20131988 removed the standing room areas and added seats, bringing capacity to 9,314...\n\nDuke's men's basketball teams have had a decided home-court advantage for many years, thanks to the diehard students known as the [[Cameron Crazies]]. The hardwood floor has been dedicated and renamed ''Coach K Court'' in honor of head coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], and the tent city outside Cameron where students camp out before big games is known as [[Krzyzewskiville]]. In 1999, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' ranked Cameron the fourth best venue in all of professional and college sports,<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/centurys_best/news/1999/06/02/top_venues/ SI's Top 20 Venues of the 20th Century]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]].'' June 7, 1999.</ref> and ''[[USA Today]]'' referred to it as \"the toughest road game in the nation\".<ref>[https://archive.is/20120724175647/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/node/21802/ Playing With the Big Boys: Duke to Host CU]. ''[[Columbia Spectator]].'' September 5, 2006.</ref>\n\nDuke had not lost a non-conference game at Cameron from 2000 until 2019, when SFASU beat Duke in overtime (85\u201383). Duke maintains a tradition of hosting the previous season's Division II national champion in an exhibition game each November.\n\n== Player awards ==\n<!-- References can be found in the media guide

The January 30 issue of The Trinity Chronicle headlined the new sport on its front page. Trinity's first game ended in a loss to [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]], 24\u201310. The game was played in the Angier B. Duke Gymnasium, later known as The Ark. The Trinity team won its first title in 1920, the state championship, by beating the North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering (now [[North Carolina State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State]]) 25 to 24. Earlier in the season they had beaten the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]] 19\u201318 in the first match-up between the two schools. Trinity college then became Duke University.\n\n[[Billy Werber]], Class of 1930, became Duke's first All-American in basketball. The Gothic-style West Campus opened that year, with a new gym, later to be named for Coach Card. The [[Cameron Indoor Stadium|Indoor Stadium]] opened in 1940. Initially it was referred to as an \"Addition\" to the gymnasium. Part of its cost was paid for with the proceeds from the Duke football team's appearance in the 1938 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]. In 1972 it would be named for [[Eddie Cameron]], head coach from 1929 to 1942.\n\nIn 1952, [[Dick Groat]] became the first Duke player to be named National Player of the Year. Duke left the [[Southern Conference]] to become a charter member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in 1953. The Duke team under [[Vic Bubas]] made its first appearance in the [[Final Four]] in 1963, losing 94\u201375 to [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola]] in the semifinal. The next year, Bubas' team reached the national title game, losing to the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|Bruins of UCLA]], who claimed 10 titles in the next 12 years. [[Bob Verga]] was Duke's star player in 1967.\n\nThe basketball program won its 1000th game in 1974, making Duke only the eighth school in [[NCAA]] history to reach that figure. In a turnaround, Coach [[Bill Foster (basketball, born 1929)|Bill Foster]]'s 1978 Blue Devils, who had gone 2\u201310 in the ACC the previous year, won the conference tournament and went on to the NCAA championship game, where they fell to [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. [[Gene Banks]], Mike Gminski ('80) and [[Jim Spanarkel]] ('79) ran the floor.\n\nMike Krzyzewski has been at Duke since 1980.

At the time, it was the largest gymnasium in the country south of the [[Palestra]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Originally called Duke Indoor Stadium, it was renamed for Coach Cameron on January 22, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.duke.edu/archives/history/eddie_cameron.html|title=Home|website=www.lib.duke.edu|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}</ref> The building originally included seating for 8,800, though standing room was sufficient to ensure that 12,000 could fit in on a particularly busy day. Then, as now, Duke students were allowed a large chunk of the seats, including those directly alongside the court. Renovations in 1987\u20131988 removed the standing room areas and added seats, bringing capacity to 9,314...\n\nDuke's men's basketball teams have had a decided home-court advantage for many years, thanks to the diehard students known as the [[Cameron Crazies]]. The hardwood floor has been dedicated and renamed ''Coach K Court'' in honor of head coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], and the tent city outside Cameron where students camp out before big games is known as [[Krzyzewskiville]]. In 1999, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' ranked Cameron the fourth best venue in all of professional and college sports,<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/centurys_best/news/1999/06/02/top_venues/ SI's Top 20 Venues of the 20th Century].

''[[Columbia Spectator]].'' September 5, 2006.</ref>\n\nDuke had not lost a non-conference game at Cameron from 2000 until 2019, when SFASU beat Duke in overtime (85\u201383). Duke maintains a tradition of hosting the previous season's Division II national champion in an exhibition game each November.\n\n== Player awards ==\n<!-- References can be found in the media guide

He identified the show to follow a structure in accordance with Petras' body of work. Thus, he referred to act I as a representation of heartbreak from her debut record, ''[[Clarity (Kim Petras album)|Clarity]]'', the second act as being representative of her [[Halloween]]-themed [[extended play]] (EP), ''[[Turn Off the Light, Vol. 1]]'', and the third act as being \"about the ecstasy of falling in love from her Era 1 days\". Even though the staging was \"stripped down and simple\", he declared it to be \"effective\" through \"being fuelled by the charm of the singer feeling her fantasy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gigwise.com/reviews/3358604/live-review-kim-petras-at-heaven-london-27-08-2019|title=Live Review: Kim Petras at Heaven, London, 27/08/2019 {{!}} Gigwise|website=gigwise.com|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kim Petras}}\n\n[[Category:2019 concert tours]]\n", "name_user": "Benutzernamedayz", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor expressions (in order to raise the level of language).", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Tour"}

It is located in northern [[Herzegovina]], around {{convert|60|km}} southwest of [[Sarajevo]]. It is a mountainous, heavily wooded area, and is {{convert|268|m|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]. The municipality extends on both sides of the [[Neretva River]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 26,381 inhabitants.\n\nThe town is one of the oldest permanent settlements in Bosnia and Herzegovina , dating back almost 4000 years; the city in its current incarnation arising as an important town in the late 14th century.\n\n==History==\nThe area near the town is believed to be settled up to 4000 years ago, and settlements around 2000 years ago by [[Illyrian tribes]] travelling upstream along the [[Neretva]] river have been found.<ref>[http://www.bih-x.com/regije_i_gradovi/konjic.htm Bosna i Hercegovina ...::: Informativno-turisticki portal BiH :::...

During [[World War II]], the town became part of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], and following the war joined the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Between 1953 and 1979, a 611 square-metre atomic bunker, dug 300 metres into a mountain, known as [[ARK (Atomska Ratna Komanda)|ARK]], was built secretly by the government in the Konjic municipality, in which President Tito and about 350 people from the Yugoslav Government and ruling elite would have been able to find shelter.<ref>Exploring Tito's Cold War bunker, http://gulfnews.com/life-style/travel/exploring-tito-s-cold-war-bunker-1.1042780</ref> The town grew significantly and prospered as a vibrant, [[multi-ethnic]] city with good transportation links (the town is on the [[railway]] between [[Sarajevo]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]]), the large Igman ammunition factory and [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] barracks. These factors became one of the main reasons for the town\u2019s[[Yugoslav Wars|conflict]] in the 1990s.\n\n===During the Bosnian War===\nDuring conflict in Yugoslavia, Konjic municipality was of strategic importance as it contained important communication links from Sarajevo to southern Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the [[siege of Sarajevo]] the route through Konjic was of vital importance to the Bosnian government forces. Furthermore, several important military facilities were contained in Konjic, including the Igman arms and ammunition factory, the [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] Ljuta barracks, the Reserve Command Site of the JNA, the Zlatar communications and telecommunications centre, and the Celebici barracks and warehouses.\n\nAlthough the Konjic municipality did not have a majority [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serb]] population and was not part of the declared \"Serb autonomous regions\", in March 1992, the self-styled \"Serb Konjic Municipality\" adopted a decision on the Serbian territories. The SDS, in co-operation with the JNA, had also been active in arming the Serb population of the municipality and in training paramilitary units and militias. According to Dr. Andrew James Gow, an expert witness for the Prosecution, the SDS distributed around 400 weapons to Serbs in the area.\n\nKonjic was also included in those areas claimed by Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the \"Croatian Community of [[Herceg-Bosna]]\", despite the fact that the [[Croats]] did not constitute a majority of the population there either (just a quarter of population in 1991, as the municipality was mixed). The Croatian units (known as the HVO) were established and armed in the municipality by April 1992.\n\nFollowing the international recognition of the independent Bosnia and Herzegovina and the walk-out of SDS representatives from the Municipal Assembly a War Assembly was formed to take charge of the defence of the municipality. Between 20 April and early May 1992 Bosnian government forces seized control over most of the strategic assets of the Municipality and some armaments. However, Serb forces controlled the main access points to the municipality, effectively cutting it off from outside supply. Bosniak refugees began to arrive from outlying areas of the municipality expelled by Serbs, while Serb inhabitants of the town left for Serb-controlled villages according to the decision made by Serb leadership.<ref name=\"un.org\">[https://www.un.org/icty/celebici/trialc2/judgement/ Judgement ICTY vs Delic et al., 16 November 1998]</ref>\n\nOn 4 May 1992, the first shells landed in Konjic town, fired by the JNA and other Serb forces from the slopes of Borasnica and Kisera. This shelling, which continued daily for over three years, until the signing of the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]], inflicted substantial damage and resulted in the loss of many lives as well as rendering conditions for the surviving population even more unbearable. With the town swollen from the influx of refugees, there was a great shortage of accommodation as well as food and other basic necessities. Charitable organisations attempted to supply the local people with enough [[food]] but all systems of production foundered or were destroyed. It was not until August or September of that year that [[convoy]]s from the [[United Nations]] High Commissioner for Refugees ([[UNHCR]]) managed to reach the town, and all communications links were cut off with the rest of the State. A clear priority for the Konjic authorities was the de-blocking of the routes to Sarajevo and [[Mostar]]. This objective required that the Serbian forces holding [[Bradina (Konjic)|Bradina]] and [[Donje Selo (Konjic)|Donje Selo]], as well as those at Borci and other strategic points, be disarmed. Initially, an attempt was made at negotiation with the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|SDS]] and other representatives of the Serb people in Bradina and Donje Selo. This did not, however, achieve success for the Konjic authorities and plans were made for the launching of military operations by the Joint Command.<ref name=\"un.org\"/>\n\nThe first area to be targeted was the village of Donje Selo. On 20 May 1992 forces of the TO and HVO entered the village. Bosnian government soldiers moved through Viniste towards the villages of [[Ceri\u0107i]] and [[Bjelovcina]]. Ceri\u0107i, which was the first shelled, was attacked around 22 May and some of its inhabitants surrendered. The village of Bjelovcina was also attacked around that time. According to witnesses heard by the ICTY, the Serb-populated village of Bradina was shelled in the late afternoon and evening of 25 May and then soldiers in both camouflage and black uniforms appeared, firing their weapons and setting fire to buildings. Many of the population sought to flee and some withdrew to the centre of the village. These people were, nonetheless, arrested at various times around 27 and 28 May, by TO, HVO and MUP soldiers and police.<ref name=\"un trib1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/celebici/trialc2/judgement/|title=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|author=|date=|website=www.un.org}}</ref>\n\nThese military operations resulted in the arrest of many members of the Serb population and it was thus necessary to create a facility where they could be imprisoned and questioned about their role in [[war crimes]] during the siege of Konjic. The former JNA \u010celebi\u0107i compound was chosen out of necessity as the appropriate facilities for the detention of prisoners in Konjic. The majority of the prisoners who were detained between April and December 1992 were men, captured during and after the military operations at Bradina and Donje Selo and their surrounding areas. At the end of May, several groups were transferred to the [[\u010celebi\u0107i prison camp]] from various locations. In its judgement in the Delali\u0107 case the ICTY found that some Serb prisoners had been beaten, tortured and several murdered by the camp guards, and two women at the camp had been raped (one of them Grozdana Cecez, identity of other woman is unknown). Some of \u010celebi\u0107i prison guards (such as a guard with last name Tucakovi\u0107) beheaded S\u0107epan Ce\u0107ez and used his head as a football kicking it around.\n\n==Cultural heritage==\n\n===Stara \u0106uprija bridge===\n{{Main|Stara \u0106uprija}}\n[[File:Konjic Stari most 3.jpg|thumb|Konjic bridge 1682-1683]]\nKonji\u010dka [[Stara \u0106uprija]] ''(Stara \u0106uprija = {{lang-en|Old Bridge}})'' was built between 1682 and 1683 by Ali-aga Hase\u010di\u0107 (as shown by a stone plaque at the center of the bridge). It was built over six slightly pointed stone arches. It is the best preserved Ottoman bridge in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The arches were destroyed by the retreating German army in March 1945.

During [[World War II]], the town became part of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], and following the war joined the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Between 1953 and 1979, a 611 square-metre atomic bunker, dug 300 metres into a mountain, known as [[ARK (Atomska Ratna Komanda)|ARK]], was built secretly by the government in the Konjic municipality, in which President Tito and about 350 people from the Yugoslav Government and ruling elite would have been able to find shelter.<ref>Exploring Tito's Cold War bunker, http://gulfnews.com/life-style/travel/exploring-tito-s-cold-war-bunker-1.1042780</ref> The town grew significantly and prospered as a vibrant, [[multi-ethnic]] city with good transportation links (the town is on the [[railway]] between [[Sarajevo]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]]), the large Igman ammunition factory and [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] barracks. These factors became one of the main reasons for the town\u2019s[[Yugoslav Wars|conflict]] in the 1990s.\n\n===During the Bosnian War===\nDuring conflict in Yugoslavia, Konjic municipality was of strategic importance as it contained important communication links from Sarajevo to southern Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the [[siege of Sarajevo]] the route through Konjic was of vital importance to the Bosnian government forces. Furthermore, several important military facilities were contained in Konjic, including the Igman arms and ammunition factory, the [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] Ljuta barracks, the Reserve Command Site of the JNA, the Zlatar communications and telecommunications centre, and the Celebici barracks and warehouses.\n\nAlthough the Konjic municipality did not have a majority [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serb]] population and was not part of the declared \"Serb autonomous regions\", in March 1992, the self-styled \"Serb Konjic Municipality\" adopted a decision on the Serbian territories. The SDS, in co-operation with the JNA, had also been active in arming the Serb population of the municipality and in training paramilitary units and militias. According to Dr. Andrew James Gow, an expert witness for the Prosecution, the SDS distributed around 400 weapons to Serbs in the area.\n\nKonjic was also included in those areas claimed by Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the \"Croatian Community of [[Herceg-Bosna]]\", despite the fact that the [[Croats]] did not constitute a majority of the population there either (just a quarter of population in 1991, as the municipality was mixed). The Croatian units (known as the HVO) were established and armed in the municipality by April 1992.\n\nFollowing the international recognition of the independent Bosnia and Herzegovina and the walk-out of SDS representatives from the Municipal Assembly a War Assembly was formed to take charge of the defence of the municipality. Between 20 April and early May 1992 Bosnian government forces seized control over most of the strategic assets of the Municipality and some armaments. However, Serb forces controlled the main access points to the municipality, effectively cutting it off from outside supply. Bosniak refugees began to arrive from outlying areas of the municipality expelled by Serbs, while Serb inhabitants of the town left for Serb-controlled villages according to the decision made by Serb leadership.<ref name=\"un.org\">[https://www.un.org/icty/celebici/trialc2/judgement/ Judgement ICTY vs Delic et al., 16 November 1998]</ref>\n\nOn 4 May 1992, the first shells landed in Konjic town, fired by the JNA and other Serb forces from the slopes of Borasnica and Kisera. This shelling, which continued daily for over three years, until the signing of the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]], inflicted substantial damage and resulted in the loss of many lives as well as rendering conditions for the surviving population even more unbearable. With the town swollen from the influx of refugees, there was a great shortage of accommodation as well as food and other basic necessities. Charitable organisations attempted to supply the local people with enough [[food]] but all systems of production foundered or were destroyed. It was not until August or September of that year that [[convoy]]s from the [[United Nations]] High Commissioner for Refugees ([[UNHCR]]) managed to reach the town, and all communications links were cut off with the rest of the State. A clear priority for the Konjic authorities was the de-blocking of the routes to Sarajevo and [[Mostar]]. This objective required that the Serbian forces holding [[Bradina (Konjic)|Bradina]] and [[Donje Selo (Konjic)|Donje Selo]], as well as those at Borci and other strategic points, be disarmed. Initially, an attempt was made at negotiation with the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|SDS]] and other representatives of the Serb people in Bradina and Donje Selo. This did not, however, achieve success for the Konjic authorities and plans were made for the launching of military operations by the Joint Command.<ref name=\"un.org\"/>\n\nThe first area to be targeted was the village of Donje Selo. On 20 May 1992 forces of the TO and HVO entered the village. Bosnian government soldiers moved through Viniste towards the villages of [[Ceri\u0107i]] and [[Bjelovcina]]. Ceri\u0107i, which was the first shelled, was attacked around 22 May and some of its inhabitants surrendered. The village of Bjelovcina was also attacked around that time. According to witnesses heard by the ICTY, the Serb-populated village of Bradina was shelled in the late afternoon and evening of 25 May and then soldiers in both camouflage and black uniforms appeared, firing their weapons and setting fire to buildings. Many of the population sought to flee and some withdrew to the centre of the village. These people were, nonetheless, arrested at various times around 27 and 28 May, by TO, HVO and MUP soldiers and police.<ref name=\"un trib1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/celebici/trialc2/judgement/|title=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|author=|date=|website=www.un.org}}</ref>\n\nThese military operations resulted in the arrest of many members of the Serb population and it was thus necessary to create a facility where they could be imprisoned and questioned about their role in [[war crimes]] during the siege of Konjic. The former JNA \u010celebi\u0107i compound was chosen out of necessity as the appropriate facilities for the detention of prisoners in Konjic. The majority of the prisoners who were detained between April and December 1992 were men, captured during and after the military operations at Bradina and Donje Selo and their surrounding areas. At the end of May, several groups were transferred to the [[\u010celebi\u0107i prison camp]] from various locations. In its judgement in the Delali\u0107 case the ICTY found that some Serb prisoners had been beaten, tortured and several murdered by the camp guards, and two women at the camp had been raped (one of them Grozdana Cecez, identity of other woman is unknown). Some of \u010celebi\u0107i prison guards (such as a guard with last name Tucakovi\u0107) beheaded S\u0107epan Ce\u0107ez and used his head as a football kicking it around.\n\n==Cultural heritage==\n\n===Stara \u0106uprija bridge===\n{{Main|Stara \u0106uprija}}\n[[File:Konjic Stari most 3.jpg|thumb|Konjic bridge 1682-1683]]\nKonji\u010dka [[Stara \u0106uprija]] ''(Stara \u0106uprija = {{lang-en|Old Bridge}})'' was built between 1682 and 1683 by Ali-aga Hase\u010di\u0107 (as shown by a stone plaque at the center of the bridge).
