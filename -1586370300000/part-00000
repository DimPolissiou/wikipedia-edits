Composed primarily of schools from [[Texas]], at various times the conference included schools from [[Oklahoma]] and [[Arkansas]] as well, but not from the actual [[Southwestern United States]].\n\nFor most of its history, the core members of the conference were Texas-based schools plus one in Arkansas:  [[Rice University]], [[Southern Methodist University]], [[Texas A&M University]], [[Texas Christian University]], [[Baylor University]], the [[University of Arkansas]], and the [[University of Texas]].  After a long period of stability, the conference's overall athletic prowess began to decline throughout the 1980s, due in part to numerous member schools violating NCAA recruiting rules, culminating in the suspension of the entire SMU football program (\"death penalty\") for the 1987 and 1988 seasons. Arkansas, after years of feeling like an outsider in the conference, left after the 1990\u201391 school year to join the [[Southeastern Conference]], although they did compete in the SWC in football for the 1991 season.  Five years later, the conference precipitously broke up as Baylor, Texas, Texas A&M, and [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (which had entered in 1956) combined with the members of the former [[Big Eight Conference]] to form a new league, the [[Big 12 Conference]], while Rice, SMU, TCU, and [[University of Houston|Houston]] (which entered the SWC in 1976) found homes in less prominent conferences (although TCU later joined the Big 12).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early years===\n[[L. Theo Bellmont]], the University of Texas athletic director sent out questionnaires to schools in Texas and neighboring states to gauge their interest in organizing an athletic conference. By March 1, 1914 a number of schools had responded favorably to the idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio-light/1914-03-01/page-15?tag=southwestern+university+southwest+conference&rtserp=tags/southwestern-university?pep=southwest-conference&psb=dateasc&ndt=ex&pd=1&pm=3&py=1914&pci=7/|title=CONFERENCE SEEMS TO BE ASSURED FACT|date=1 March 1914|publisher=San Antonio Light|accessdate=28 November 2013|location=Austin, Texas}}</ref>\n\nThe first organizational meeting of the conference was set for April 30, 1914; since not all schools involved could send representatives to attend that date, it was ultimately held on May 5 and 7, 1914 at the Oriental Hotel in [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio-light/1914-04-19/page-16?tag=southwestern+university+southwest+conference&rtserp=tags/southwestern-university?pep=southwest-conference&psb=dateasc&ndt=ex&pd=19&pm=4&py=1914&pci=7/|title=DATE IN CHANGED|date=19 April 1914|publisher=San Antonio Light|accessdate=28 November 2013|location=Austin, Texas}}</ref> It was chaired by Bellmont, who originally wanted [[Louisiana State University]] and the [[University of Mississippi]] to join the conference as well, but they declined to do so. The Southwest Intercollegiate Athletic Conference became an official body on December 8, 1914, at a formal meeting at the Rice Hotel in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].\n\nIts early years saw fluctuation in membership; Southwestern (a comparatively smaller school) dropped out of the conference in 1916, and [[Southern Methodist University]] (SMU) joined in 1918, while [[Texas Christian University]] (TCU) became a member in 1923. Rice University left the conference in 1916, only to re-join in 1918.\n\n[[Phillips University]] was a conference member for one year (1920).  Oklahoma left in 1919 to join the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (later known as the [[Big Eight Conference]]), and was followed by Oklahoma A&M in 1925.  However, the series between Texas and Oklahoma would continue as a non-conference matchup in the annual [[Red River Rivalry]] game held in Dallas.  From 1925 until 1991, the University of Arkansas would be the only conference member not located within the state of [[Texas]].\n\n===Prime years===\nBy 1925, the conference's name was shortened to simply Southwest Conference.<ref name=TSHA />  After its organizational years, the conference settled into regularly scheduled meetings among its members, and began to gain stature nationwide. The SWC would be guided by seven commissioners, the first of whom, P. W. St. Clair, was appointed in 1938. In 1940, the conference took control of the then five-year-old [[Cotton Bowl Classic]], which further established the prestige of both the bowl and the conference. Texas Technological College (now [[Texas Tech University]]) joined the SWC in 1958, followed by the [[University of Houston]] for the 1976 season (Houston won the SWC football championship in its first season in the league).\n\n[[File:SWC (Foundation)-USA-states.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Southwest Conference, 1915\u20131925]]\n\nThe conference celebrated its glory football years in the 1960s, dominated by two teams, Texas and Arkansas.  Texas won the 1963 national championship, and Arkansas won a national championship in 1964 in the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Helms Athletic Foundation (HAF) polls.  In 1969, Texas won another national championship by beating #2-ranked Arkansas 15-14 in the regular season's final game (dubbed the \"Big Shootout\").

Reynolds Razorback Stadium|Fayetteville, Arkansas]], attended by President Richard Nixon, is usually counted among the greatest college football games ever played.  Texas also won the 1970 United Press International (UPI) National Championship (i.e., the coaches' poll), which until 1974 was awarded prior to the bowl games.  Texas lost the Cotton Bowl Classic following the 1970 season to Notre Dame by a score of 24\u201311, giving the Associated Press (AP) Championship to Nebraska after they beat LSU by a score of 17\u201312 in the Orange Bowl.\n\nSince its first Cotton Bowl Classic and lasting until 1995, the Southwest Conference Champion automatically received an invitation as the \"host\" team in the Cotton Bowl Classic game on New Year's Day in Dallas. Opponents usually were the runners-up from the [[Big Eight Conference]] or the [[Southeastern Conference]], although [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independents]] [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] were also often featured.  From the 1940s onward, the Cotton Bowl Classic was counted among the four major bowl games, and often had national championship implications.  However, in the 1990s, the game declined in importance, largely because of the decline of SWC prominence.  In 1977, [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] became the last team to win a national championship in the Cotton Bowl Classic by beating Texas in the January 1978 game.\n\nThe SWC had many legendary players and coaches over the years. In football, [[John Heisman]], [[Dana X. Bible]], [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]], [[Darrell Royal]], [[Frank Broyles]], [[Hayden Fry]], [[Lou Holtz]], [[Bill Yeoman]], [[Gene Stallings]], and [[Grant Teaff]] all served as head coaches in the conference. Some notable SWC players included [[Davey O'Brien]], [[Sammy Baugh]], [[Bobby Layne]],  [[Doak Walker]], [[Tom Landry]], [[Bob Lilly]], [[Don Meredith]], [[Earl Campbell]], [[Andre Ware]], [[Mike Singletary]], [[John David Crow]], [[Lance Alworth]], [[Dan Hampton]], [[Steve Atwater]], [[Joe Ferguson]], and [[Eric Dickerson]]. The trio of kicking contemporaries [[Steve Little (American football)|Steve Little]] of Arkansas, [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]] of Texas A&M, and [[Russell Erxleben]] of Texas all kicked record setting field goals of 60 + yards in the same season.\n\nThe early 1980s were the glory years of SWC basketball, including the ''[[Phi Slama Jama]]'' teams at the [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|University of Houston]]. However, the most consistent program during the last quarter of the 20th century was the [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|University of Arkansas]] with Sweet 16 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1990, 1991, Elite 8 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1990 and 1991 and Final Four appearances in 1978 and 1990. Arkansas's famed Triplets, [[Marvin Delph]], [[Ron Brewer]] and [[Sidney Moncrief]], gave the rest of the league fits.  Furthermore, the Razorbacks' [[Lee Mayberry]], [[Todd Day]] and [[Oliver Miller]] won three straight SWC regular season and tournament titles from 1989\u20131991, the school's last three seasons in the conference.  The passion of Arkansas fans for their Razorbacks often overran the confines of SWC basketball venues, so much so, that Reunion Arena in Dallas (annual site of the SWC postseason tournament) was deemed \"[[Barnhill Arena|Barnhill]] South\" (after the Razorbacks' on-campus arena) based on the numbers and intensity of Hog fans present.\n\nOutstanding basketball coaches included [[Nolan Richardson]], [[Tom Penders]], [[Eddie Sutton]], [[Abe Lemons]], [[Guy Lewis|Guy V. Lewis]], [[Shelby Metcalf]] and [[Gerald Myers]]. Great SWC hoops players included the aforementioned ''Triplets'', [[Hakeem Olajuwon|Akeem Olajuwon]], [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Vinnie Johnson]], [[Jon Koncak]], [[Alvin Robertson]], [[Ricky Pierce]], [[Darrell Walker]], [[Joe Kleine]], Day, Mayberry, Miller and [[Ulysses Reed|U.S. Reed]], among others.\n\nThe [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas Longhorns]] baseball program under coach [[Cliff Gustafson]] won national titles in 1975 and 1983, as well as titles under [[Bibb Falk]] in 1949 and 1950. The [[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball|Arkansas Razorbacks]] also fielded fine teams that advanced to the College World Series. The Hogs finished 2nd in 1979, 3rd in 1985 and 5th in both the 1987 and 1989 seasons. The Hogs have continued this tradition since moving to the SEC, reaching the CWS four times under Arkansas alumnus [[Dave Van Horn]], and were the 2018 national runners-up. [[Texas A&M Aggies baseball|Texas A&M]] rose to power in the late 1980s, going 58-5 in 1989 before losing twice in the regional championship round on [[Olsen Field|its home field]] to [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]]. The Aggies reached the College World Series in 1993. [[Rice Owls baseball|Rice]] began its ascent to college baseball's elite in the conference's final years under coach [[Wayne Graham]], reaching the CWS in 1997, the year after the conference disbanded.\n\nThe [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] were dominant in track and field winning 15 SWC cross country team titles, 11 SWC indoor track team titles, 9 SWC outdoor track team titles and an incredible 8 SWC triple crowns (cross country, indoor track and outdoor track champions all in the same season). During their SWC days, the Razorbacks won 14 NCAA national team championships and one NCAA team triple crown. The list of Arkansas individual SWC champions and individual NCAA champions is long. Standout coaches and athletes include the legendary John McDonnell of Arkansas, the winningest coach in NCAA history regardless of sport. Baylor's [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]], Texas A&M's [[Randy Matson]],  Rice's Fred Hansen, Houston's [[Carl Lewis]] and Arkansas' [[Mike Conley Sr.|Mike Conley]] all went on to win Olympic gold medals.\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:SWC (Dissolution)-USA-states.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Southwest Conference, 1925\u20131991]]\n[[File:1995 Bayou Bucket Classic game ball.jpg|thumb|The game ball from the 1995 [[Bayou Bucket Classic]], the last football game in Southwest Conference history]]\nThe 1980s saw many of the conference's athletic programs hit by recruiting scandals and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] probations.<ref name=\"probation1\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFDCUPCIU7kC&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372&dq=1980s+southwest+conference+probations&source=bl&ots=mR9p2hKUhl&sig=mg0RRUJEYAFQl4Ax6T5k-K_3MGY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result SWC sanctions in the 1980s]</ref><ref name=\"probation2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmv5YNVTVCYC&pg=PA119 Probation history of the SWC]</ref><ref name=\"sportsillustrated\">[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007325/3/index.htm 1995 Sports Illustrated article on the SWC]</ref>  The only programs to escape probation in the 1980s were Arkansas, Baylor, and Rice.<ref name=\"probation1\"/><ref name=\"sportsillustrated\" /><ref name=\"Houston History Magazine\">{{cite magazine|url=http://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SWC.pdf|title=The Break-Up of the Southwest Conference|magazine=Houston History|volume=10|number=3|via=houstonhistorymagazine.org|first=Auston|last=Fertak|date=July 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> Because of [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|repeated major violations]], in [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|1987]], the [[SMU Mustangs football]] program became only the third in NCAA history to receive the so-called [[Death penalty (NCAA)|\"Death Penalty\"]] (after [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] basketball in 1952\u201353 and [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball|Southwestern Louisiana]] basketball from 1973 to 1975). The NCAA canceled SMU's 1987 season, and limited it to seven road games for 1988.  However, nearly all of the school's lettermen transferred elsewhere, forcing SMU to keep its football program shuttered for 1988 as well.  SMU also remained on probation until [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]].  At that time, NCAA rules prohibited schools on probation from appearing on live [[television]]. As a result, the conference's market share in television coverage dwindled.\n\nThe SWC's performance in football declined precipitously. The last SWC football champion to win a bowl game was Texas A&M, who beat Notre Dame in the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic by a score of 35-10. Since then, the final eight SWC champions lost in their bowl games. After SMU's second-place finish in most polls in 1982, SWC programs usually were not serious contenders for the national title.  Texas had strong teams in 1981, 1983, 1990, and 1995. Arkansas had strong teams in 1988 and 1989, and Texas A&M was strong from 1985 to 1995, but by the end of their respective seasons none were able to remain in the national championship hunt.\n\n====The last days of the College Football Association====\nOn June 27, 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma]]'' that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf.\n\nThe [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10]] conferences sold their rights to ABC.  Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]]) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the [[College Football Association]] to [[College Football on ABC|ABC]] and [[SEC on CBS|CBS]].  The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nBy [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]], the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|NBC]].<ref name=\"1991 NBC Deal\">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|title= COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Notre Dame Scored a $38 Million Touchdown on Its TV Deal|work=New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|date=1991-08-25|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D91038F936A1575BC0A967958260 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Southeastern Conference invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join the conference in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA.  The other conferences in the CFA correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe SEC represented one of the more valuable assets in the CFA.  It seemed likely if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have quite a difficult time securing good TV deals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn February 1994, the [[Southeastern Conference]] announced that they would be leaving the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only.  This led ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' to proclaim that \"the College Football Association as a television entity is dead\".<ref name=\"SEC LEAVES CFA\">{{cite web | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/335883/SEC-OFFICIALLY-LEAVES-CFA-BIG-EAST-WILL-FOLLOW-SOON.html?pg=all | title=SEC OFFICIALLY LEAVES CFA; BIG EAST WILL FOLLOW SOON | work=The Dallas Morning News | date=February 12, 1994 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Maisel, Ivan}}</ref>  In 1995, the SEC and the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS.  The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal.  More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to significant realignment of college conferences.\n\nIn 1990, Arkansas announced its departure for the [[Southeastern Conference]], marking the beginning of the end for the Southwest Conference.  In March 1994, Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor, and Texas Tech accepted invitations to join with the members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] to form the [[Big 12 Conference]].  Soon afterward, SMU, TCU, and Rice accepted invitations to join the [[Western Athletic Conference]], while Houston became a charter member of [[Conference USA]].  In May 1996, after the completion of championship matches in [[baseball]] and [[Track and field|track & field]], the Southwest Conference was officially dissolved.\n\nOver the course of its 82-year history, teams of the Southwest Conference garnered 64 recognized national championships in collegiate sports.\n\nIn 1997, the official records of the conference from 1914 to 1996 were moved from Dallas to the campus of [[Texas Tech University]], becoming part of the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library. The archive also contains an extensive assortment of images and memorabilia from each member university.\n\n==Members==\n{{Location map+|Texas|width=400|caption=|relief=no|places=\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Arkansas|position=bottom|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Arkansas Razorbacks|lat=36.076389|long=-94.160833}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Baylor|position=top|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Baylor Bears | lat=31.54861 | long=-97.11667}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Houston|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Houston Cougars|lat=29.718922|long=-95.339162}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Rice|position=right|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Rice Owls|lat=29.71694|long=-95.40278}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=SMU|position=top|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=SMU Mustangs|lat=32.841|long=-96.784}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=TCU|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=TCU Horned Frogs|lat=32.70961|long=-97.62823}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas | position=bottom | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas Longhorns| lat=30.2849 | long=-97.7341}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas<br>A&M | position=right | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas A&M Aggies | lat=30.6187 | long=-96.3365}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas<br>Tech | position=top | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas Tech Red Raiders | lat=33.5843 | long=-101.8783}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Southwestern | position=left | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Southwestern Pirates | lat=30.636 | long=-97.6648}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Phillips | position=left | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Phillips University | lat=36.396944 | long=-97.844722}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Oklahoma| position=bottom| mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Oklahoma Sooners | lat=35.208611 | long=-97.445833}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Oklahoma State | position=right | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Oklahoma State Cowboys | lat=36.132222 | long=-97.080833}}\n}}\n\n*[[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] (1915\u20131991)\n*[[Baylor University|Baylor]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[University of Houston|Houston]] (1972\u20131996)\n*[[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] (1915\u20131919)\n*[[Oklahoma State University-Stillwater|Oklahoma A&M]] (1915\u20131925)\n*[[Phillips University|Phillips]] (1920)\n*[[Rice University|Rice]] (1915\u20131917 provisional, 1918\u20131996)\n*[[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] (1918\u20131996)\n*[[Southwestern University|Southwestern]] (1915\u20131916)\n*[[University of Texas|Texas]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[Texas Christian University|TCU]] (1923\u20131996)\n*[[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (1956\u20131996)\n\nNote:  Houston was invited to join the SWC in March 1971, and began play in all sports except football and basketball in 1972\u201373.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/6869578/|title=On the Threshold of Respectability|date=28 March 1971|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche Journal|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> Cougar basketball joined the fray in 1975\u201376, and football was last to join for the 1976\u201377 school year.\n\n===Membership timeline===\n<timeline>\nDateFormat = yyyy\nImageSize  = width:750 height:auto barincrement:24\nPeriod     = from:1915 till:1998\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nPlotArea   = right:0 left:0 bottom:50 top:0\n\nColors = id:barcolor value:black\n         id:line     value:black\n         id:bg       value:white\n\nPlotData=\n  width:20 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s\n\n  bar:1  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1916 text:[[Southwestern University|Southwestern]] (1915\u20131916)\n  bar:2  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1919 text:[[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] (1915\u20131919)\n  bar:3  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1925 text:[[Oklahoma State University-Stillwater|Oklahoma State]] (1915\u20131925)\n  bar:4  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1991 text:[[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] (1915\u20131991)\n  bar:5  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Baylor University|Baylor]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:6  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Rice University|Rice]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:7  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[University of Texas|Texas]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:8  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&M]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:9  color:powderblue from:1918 till:1996 text:[[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] (1918\u20131996)\n  bar:10 color:powderblue from:1920 till:1921 text:[[Phillips University|Phillips]] (1920)\n  bar:11 color:powderblue from:1923 till:1996 text:[[Texas Christian University|TCU]] (1923\u20131996)\n  bar:12 color:powderblue from:1956 till:1996 text:[[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (1956\u20131996)\n  bar:13 color:yellow from:1972 till:1976 text:[[University of Houston|Houston]] (1972 Olympic sports;

Composed primarily of schools from [[Texas]], at various times the conference included schools from [[Oklahoma]] and [[Arkansas]] as well, but not from the actual [[Southwestern United States]].\n\nFor most of its history, the core members of the conference were Texas-based schools plus one in Arkansas:  [[Rice University]], [[Southern Methodist University]], [[Texas A&M University]], [[Texas Christian University]], [[Baylor University]], the [[University of Arkansas]], and the [[University of Texas]].  After a long period of stability, the conference's overall athletic prowess began to decline throughout the 1980s, due in part to numerous member schools violating NCAA recruiting rules, culminating in the suspension of the entire SMU football program (\"death penalty\") for the 1987 and 1988 seasons. Arkansas, after years of feeling like an outsider in the conference, left after the 1990\u201391 school year to join the [[Southeastern Conference]], although they did compete in the SWC in football for the 1991 season.  Five years later, the conference precipitously broke up as Baylor, Texas, Texas A&M, and [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (which had entered in 1956) combined with the members of the former [[Big Eight Conference]] to form a new league, the [[Big 12 Conference]], while Rice, SMU, TCU, and [[University of Houston|Houston]] (which entered the SWC in 1976) found homes in less prominent conferences (although TCU later joined the Big 12).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early years===\n[[L. Theo Bellmont]], the University of Texas athletic director sent out questionnaires to schools in Texas and neighboring states to gauge their interest in organizing an athletic conference. By March 1, 1914 a number of schools had responded favorably to the idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio-light/1914-03-01/page-15?tag=southwestern+university+southwest+conference&rtserp=tags/southwestern-university?pep=southwest-conference&psb=dateasc&ndt=ex&pd=1&pm=3&py=1914&pci=7/|title=CONFERENCE SEEMS TO BE ASSURED FACT|date=1 March 1914|publisher=San Antonio Light|accessdate=28 November 2013|location=Austin, Texas}}</ref>\n\nThe first organizational meeting of the conference was set for April 30, 1914; since not all schools involved could send representatives to attend that date, it was ultimately held on May 5 and 7, 1914 at the Oriental Hotel in [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio-light/1914-04-19/page-16?tag=southwestern+university+southwest+conference&rtserp=tags/southwestern-university?pep=southwest-conference&psb=dateasc&ndt=ex&pd=19&pm=4&py=1914&pci=7/|title=DATE IN CHANGED|date=19 April 1914|publisher=San Antonio Light|accessdate=28 November 2013|location=Austin, Texas}}</ref> It was chaired by Bellmont, who originally wanted [[Louisiana State University]] and the [[University of Mississippi]] to join the conference as well, but they declined to do so. The Southwest Intercollegiate Athletic Conference became an official body on December 8, 1914, at a formal meeting at the Rice Hotel in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].\n\nIts early years saw fluctuation in membership; Southwestern (a comparatively smaller school) dropped out of the conference in 1916, and [[Southern Methodist University]] (SMU) joined in 1918, while [[Texas Christian University]] (TCU) became a member in 1923. Rice University left the conference in 1916, only to re-join in 1918.\n\n[[Phillips University]] was a conference member for one year (1920).  Oklahoma left in 1919 to join the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (later known as the [[Big Eight Conference]]), and was followed by Oklahoma A&M in 1925.  However, the series between Texas and Oklahoma would continue as a non-conference matchup in the annual [[Red River Rivalry]] game held in Dallas.  From 1925 until 1991, the University of Arkansas would be the only conference member not located within the state of [[Texas]].\n\n===Prime years===\nBy 1925, the conference's name was shortened to simply Southwest Conference.<ref name=TSHA />  After its organizational years, the conference settled into regularly scheduled meetings among its members, and began to gain stature nationwide. The SWC would be guided by seven commissioners, the first of whom, P. W. St. Clair, was appointed in 1938. In 1940, the conference took control of the then five-year-old [[Cotton Bowl Classic]], which further established the prestige of both the bowl and the conference. Texas Technological College (now [[Texas Tech University]]) joined the SWC in 1958, followed by the [[University of Houston]] for the 1976 season (Houston won the SWC football championship in its first season in the league).\n\n[[File:SWC (Foundation)-USA-states.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Southwest Conference, 1915\u20131925]]\n\nThe conference celebrated its glory football years in the 1960s, dominated by two teams, Texas and Arkansas.  Texas won the 1963 national championship, and Arkansas won a national championship in 1964 in the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Helms Athletic Foundation (HAF) polls.  In 1969, Texas won another national championship by beating #2-ranked Arkansas 15-14 in the regular season's final game (dubbed the \"Big Shootout\").  The [[1969 Texas vs. Arkansas football game|1969 Arkansas\u2013Texas game]] in [[Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium|Fayetteville, Arkansas]], attended by President Richard Nixon, is usually counted among the greatest college football games ever played.  Texas also won the 1970 United Press International (UPI) National Championship (i.e., the coaches' poll), which until 1974 was awarded prior to the bowl games.  Texas lost the Cotton Bowl Classic following the 1970 season to Notre Dame by a score of 24\u201311, giving the Associated Press (AP) Championship to Nebraska after they beat LSU by a score of 17\u201312 in the Orange Bowl.\n\nSince its first Cotton Bowl Classic and lasting until 1995, the Southwest Conference Champion automatically received an invitation as the \"host\" team in the Cotton Bowl Classic game on New Year's Day in Dallas. Opponents usually were the runners-up from the [[Big Eight Conference]] or the [[Southeastern Conference]], although [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independents]] [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] were also often featured.  From the 1940s onward, the Cotton Bowl Classic was counted among the four major bowl games, and often had national championship implications.  However, in the 1990s, the game declined in importance, largely because of the decline of SWC prominence.  In 1977, [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] became the last team to win a national championship in the Cotton Bowl Classic by beating Texas in the January 1978 game.\n\nThe SWC had many legendary players and coaches over the years. In football, [[John Heisman]], [[Dana X. Bible]], [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]], [[Darrell Royal]], [[Frank Broyles]], [[Hayden Fry]], [[Lou Holtz]], [[Bill Yeoman]], [[Gene Stallings]], and [[Grant Teaff]] all served as head coaches in the conference. Some notable SWC players included [[Davey O'Brien]], [[Sammy Baugh]], [[Bobby Layne]],  [[Doak Walker]], [[Tom Landry]], [[Bob Lilly]], [[Don Meredith]], [[Earl Campbell]], [[Andre Ware]], [[Mike Singletary]], [[John David Crow]], [[Lance Alworth]], [[Dan Hampton]], [[Steve Atwater]], [[Joe Ferguson]], and [[Eric Dickerson]]. The trio of kicking contemporaries [[Steve Little (American football)|Steve Little]] of Arkansas, [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]] of Texas A&M, and [[Russell Erxleben]] of Texas all kicked record setting field goals of 60 + yards in the same season.\n\nThe early 1980s were the glory years of SWC basketball, including the ''[[Phi Slama Jama]]'' teams at the [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|University of Houston]]. However, the most consistent program during the last quarter of the 20th century was the [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|University of Arkansas]] with Sweet 16 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1990, 1991, Elite 8 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1990 and 1991 and Final Four appearances in 1978 and 1990. Arkansas's famed Triplets, [[Marvin Delph]], [[Ron Brewer]] and [[Sidney Moncrief]], gave the rest of the league fits.  Furthermore, the Razorbacks' [[Lee Mayberry]], [[Todd Day]] and [[Oliver Miller]] won three straight SWC regular season and tournament titles from 1989\u20131991, the school's last three seasons in the conference.  The passion of Arkansas fans for their Razorbacks often overran the confines of SWC basketball venues, so much so, that Reunion Arena in Dallas (annual site of the SWC postseason tournament) was deemed \"[[Barnhill Arena|Barnhill]] South\" (after the Razorbacks' on-campus arena) based on the numbers and intensity of Hog fans present.\n\nOutstanding basketball coaches included [[Nolan Richardson]], [[Tom Penders]], [[Eddie Sutton]], [[Abe Lemons]], [[Guy Lewis|Guy V. Lewis]], [[Shelby Metcalf]] and [[Gerald Myers]]. Great SWC hoops players included the aforementioned ''Triplets'', [[Hakeem Olajuwon|Akeem Olajuwon]], [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Vinnie Johnson]], [[Jon Koncak]], [[Alvin Robertson]], [[Ricky Pierce]], [[Darrell Walker]], [[Joe Kleine]], Day, Mayberry, Miller and [[Ulysses Reed|U.S. Reed]], among others.\n\nThe [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas Longhorns]] baseball program under coach [[Cliff Gustafson]] won national titles in 1975 and 1983, as well as titles under [[Bibb Falk]] in 1949 and 1950. The [[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball|Arkansas Razorbacks]] also fielded fine teams that advanced to the College World Series. The Hogs finished 2nd in 1979, 3rd in 1985 and 5th in both the 1987 and 1989 seasons. The Hogs have continued this tradition since moving to the SEC, reaching the CWS four times under Arkansas alumnus [[Dave Van Horn]], and were the 2018 national runners-up. [[Texas A&M Aggies baseball|Texas A&M]] rose to power in the late 1980s, going 58-5 in 1989 before losing twice in the regional championship round on [[Olsen Field|its home field]] to [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]]. The Aggies reached the College World Series in 1993. [[Rice Owls baseball|Rice]] began its ascent to college baseball's elite in the conference's final years under coach [[Wayne Graham]], reaching the CWS in 1997, the year after the conference disbanded.\n\nThe [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] were dominant in track and field winning 15 SWC cross country team titles, 11 SWC indoor track team titles, 9 SWC outdoor track team titles and an incredible 8 SWC triple crowns (cross country, indoor track and outdoor track champions all in the same season). During their SWC days, the Razorbacks won 14 NCAA national team championships and one NCAA team triple crown. The list of Arkansas individual SWC champions and individual NCAA champions is long. Standout coaches and athletes include the legendary John McDonnell of Arkansas, the winningest coach in NCAA history regardless of sport. Baylor's [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]], Texas A&M's [[Randy Matson]],  Rice's Fred Hansen, Houston's [[Carl Lewis]] and Arkansas' [[Mike Conley Sr.|Mike Conley]] all went on to win Olympic gold medals.\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:SWC (Dissolution)-USA-states.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Southwest Conference, 1925\u20131991]]\n[[File:1995 Bayou Bucket Classic game ball.jpg|thumb|The game ball from the 1995 [[Bayou Bucket Classic]], the last football game in Southwest Conference history]]\nThe 1980s saw many of the conference's athletic programs hit by recruiting scandals and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] probations.<ref name=\"probation1\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFDCUPCIU7kC&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372&dq=1980s+southwest+conference+probations&source=bl&ots=mR9p2hKUhl&sig=mg0RRUJEYAFQl4Ax6T5k-K_3MGY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result SWC sanctions in the 1980s]</ref><ref name=\"probation2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmv5YNVTVCYC&pg=PA119 Probation history of the SWC]</ref><ref name=\"sportsillustrated\">[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007325/3/index.htm 1995 Sports Illustrated article on the SWC]</ref>  The only programs to escape probation in the 1980s were Arkansas, Baylor, and Rice.<ref name=\"probation1\"/><ref name=\"sportsillustrated\" /><ref name=\"Houston History Magazine\">{{cite magazine|url=http://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SWC.pdf|title=The Break-Up of the Southwest Conference|magazine=Houston History|volume=10|number=3|via=houstonhistorymagazine.org|first=Auston|last=Fertak|date=July 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> Because of [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|repeated major violations]], in [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|1987]], the [[SMU Mustangs football]] program became only the third in NCAA history to receive the so-called [[Death penalty (NCAA)|\"Death Penalty\"]] (after [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] basketball in 1952\u201353 and [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball|Southwestern Louisiana]] basketball from 1973 to 1975). The NCAA canceled SMU's 1987 season, and limited it to seven road games for 1988.  However, nearly all of the school's lettermen transferred elsewhere, forcing SMU to keep its football program shuttered for 1988 as well.  SMU also remained on probation until [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]].  At that time, NCAA rules prohibited schools on probation from appearing on live [[television]]. As a result, the conference's market share in television coverage dwindled.\n\nThe SWC's performance in football declined precipitously. The last SWC football champion to win a bowl game was Texas A&M, who beat Notre Dame in the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic by a score of 35-10. Since then, the final eight SWC champions lost in their bowl games. After SMU's second-place finish in most polls in 1982, SWC programs usually were not serious contenders for the national title.  Texas had strong teams in 1981, 1983, 1990, and 1995. Arkansas had strong teams in 1988 and 1989, and Texas A&M was strong from 1985 to 1995, but by the end of their respective seasons none were able to remain in the national championship hunt.\n\n====The last days of the College Football Association====\nOn June 27, 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma]]'' that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf.\n\nThe [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10]] conferences sold their rights to ABC.  Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]]) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the [[College Football Association]] to [[College Football on ABC|ABC]] and [[SEC on CBS|CBS]].  The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nBy [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]], the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|NBC]].<ref name=\"1991 NBC Deal\">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|title= COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Notre Dame Scored a $38 Million Touchdown on Its TV Deal|work=New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|date=1991-08-25|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D91038F936A1575BC0A967958260 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Southeastern Conference invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join the conference in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA.  The other conferences in the CFA correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe SEC represented one of the more valuable assets in the CFA.  It seemed likely if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have quite a difficult time securing good TV deals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn February 1994, the [[Southeastern Conference]] announced that they would be leaving the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only.  This led ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' to proclaim that \"the College Football Association as a television entity is dead\".<ref name=\"SEC LEAVES CFA\">{{cite web | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/335883/SEC-OFFICIALLY-LEAVES-CFA-BIG-EAST-WILL-FOLLOW-SOON.html?pg=all | title=SEC OFFICIALLY LEAVES CFA; BIG EAST WILL FOLLOW SOON | work=The Dallas Morning News | date=February 12, 1994 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Maisel, Ivan}}</ref>  In 1995, the SEC and the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS.  The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal.  More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to significant realignment of college conferences.\n\nIn 1990, Arkansas announced its departure for the [[Southeastern Conference]], marking the beginning of the end for the Southwest Conference.  In March 1994, Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor, and Texas Tech accepted invitations to join with the members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] to form the [[Big 12 Conference]].  Soon afterward, SMU, TCU, and Rice accepted invitations to join the [[Western Athletic Conference]], while Houston became a charter member of [[Conference USA]].  In May 1996, after the completion of championship matches in [[baseball]] and [[Track and field|track & field]], the Southwest Conference was officially dissolved.\n\nOver the course of its 82-year history, teams of the Southwest Conference garnered 64 recognized national championships in collegiate sports.\n\nIn 1997, the official records of the conference from 1914 to 1996 were moved from Dallas to the campus of [[Texas Tech University]], becoming part of the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library. The archive also contains an extensive assortment of images and memorabilia from each member university.\n\n==Members==\n{{Location map+|Texas|width=400|caption=|relief=no|places=\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Arkansas|position=bottom|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Arkansas Razorbacks|lat=36.076389|long=-94.160833}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Baylor|position=top|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Baylor Bears | lat=31.54861 | long=-97.11667}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Houston|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Houston Cougars|lat=29.718922|long=-95.339162}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=Rice|position=right|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=Rice Owls|lat=29.71694|long=-95.40278}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=SMU|position=top|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=SMU Mustangs|lat=32.841|long=-96.784}}\n   {{Location map~|Texas|label=TCU|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg|link=TCU Horned Frogs|lat=32.70961|long=-97.62823}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas | position=bottom | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas Longhorns| lat=30.2849 | long=-97.7341}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas<br>A&M | position=right | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas A&M Aggies | lat=30.6187 | long=-96.3365}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Texas<br>Tech | position=top | mark=Blue pog.svg | link=Texas Tech Red Raiders | lat=33.5843 | long=-101.8783}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Southwestern | position=left | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Southwestern Pirates | lat=30.636 | long=-97.6648}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Phillips | position=left | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Phillips University | lat=36.396944 | long=-97.844722}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Oklahoma| position=bottom| mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Oklahoma Sooners | lat=35.208611 | long=-97.445833}}\n   {{Location map~ | Texas| label=Oklahoma State | position=right | mark=Yellow pog.svg | link=Oklahoma State Cowboys | lat=36.132222 | long=-97.080833}}\n}}\n\n*[[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] (1915\u20131991)\n*[[Baylor University|Baylor]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[University of Houston|Houston]] (1972\u20131996)\n*[[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] (1915\u20131919)\n*[[Oklahoma State University-Stillwater|Oklahoma A&M]] (1915\u20131925)\n*[[Phillips University|Phillips]] (1920)\n*[[Rice University|Rice]] (1915\u20131917 provisional, 1918\u20131996)\n*[[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] (1918\u20131996)\n*[[Southwestern University|Southwestern]] (1915\u20131916)\n*[[University of Texas|Texas]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] (1915\u20131996)\n*[[Texas Christian University|TCU]] (1923\u20131996)\n*[[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (1956\u20131996)\n\nNote:  Houston was invited to join the SWC in March 1971, and began play in all sports except football and basketball in 1972\u201373.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/6869578/|title=On the Threshold of Respectability|date=28 March 1971|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche Journal|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> Cougar basketball joined the fray in 1975\u201376, and football was last to join for the 1976\u201377 school year.\n\n===Membership timeline===\n<timeline>\nDateFormat = yyyy\nImageSize  = width:750 height:auto barincrement:24\nPeriod     = from:1915 till:1998\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nPlotArea   = right:0 left:0 bottom:50 top:0\n\nColors = id:barcolor value:black\n         id:line     value:black\n         id:bg       value:white\n\nPlotData=\n  width:20 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s\n\n  bar:1  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1916 text:[[Southwestern University|Southwestern]] (1915\u20131916)\n  bar:2  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1919 text:[[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] (1915\u20131919)\n  bar:3  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1925 text:[[Oklahoma State University-Stillwater|Oklahoma State]] (1915\u20131925)\n  bar:4  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1991 text:[[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] (1915\u20131991)\n  bar:5  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Baylor University|Baylor]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:6  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Rice University|Rice]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:7  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[University of Texas|Texas]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:8  color:powderblue from:1915 till:1996 text:[[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&M]] (1915\u20131996)\n  bar:9  color:powderblue from:1918 till:1996 text:[[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] (1918\u20131996)\n  bar:10 color:powderblue from:1920 till:1921 text:[[Phillips University|Phillips]] (1920)\n  bar:11 color:powderblue from:1923 till:1996 text:[[Texas Christian University|TCU]] (1923\u20131996)\n  bar:12 color:powderblue from:1956 till:1996 text:[[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (1956\u20131996)\n  bar:13 color:yellow from:1972 till:1976 text:[[University of Houston|Houston]] (1972 Olympic sports;

Costs are paid through funding from federal and provincial general tax revenues which include income taxes, sales taxes and corporate taxes. In British Columbia, taxation-based funding was (until January 1, 2020) supplemented by a fixed monthly premium which is waived or reduced for those on low incomes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp/bc-residents/msp-premium-elimination-jan-1-2020|title=Ministry of Health - Redirect|website=gov.bc.ca}}</ref> In Ontario, there is an income tax identified as a health premium on taxable income above $20,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/health-premium |title=Health Premium |publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario |access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to funding through the tax system, hospitals and medical research are funded in part by charitable contributions.

At older ages, the rate dropped, and only one-fifth of the 65-or-older age group (21%) was covered.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/1999001/article/4646-eng.pdf |title=Dental Insurance and use of Dental Services |website=Statcan.gc.ca |access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref> Attributes that can contribute to these outcomes is household income, employment, as well as education. Those individuals who are in the middle class may be covered through the benefits of their employment whereas older individuals may not due to the fact of retirement.\n\n===Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and massage therapy===\nCoverage for services by [[physiotherapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s (also known as OTs) and Registered [[Massage Therapist]]s (RMTs) varies by province. For example, in Ontario the provincial health plan, OHIP, does cover physiotherapy following hospital discharge and occupational therapy<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pthealth.ca/service/occupational-therapy/ |title=Occupational Therapy (OT) |publisher=pt Health |access-date=January 19, 2017}}</ref> but does not cover massage therapy. To be eligible for coverage for physiotherapy in Ontario, the insured individual has to have been discharged as an inpatient of a hospital after an overnight stay and require physiotherapy for the condition, illness or injury for which he or she was hospitalized, or be age 19 or younger or age 65 or older.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-physiotherapy |title=Get physiotherapy: Get government-funded physiotherapy |website=ontario.ca |publisher=Queen\u2019s Printer for Ontario |access-date=January 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Other coverage limitations===\nCoverage varies for care related to the feet. In Ontario, as of 2019, Medicare covers between $7\u201316 of each visit to a registered [[podiatrist]] up to $135 per patient per year, plus $30 for x-rays.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/what-ohip-covers |title=What OHIP covers |website=www.ontario.ca |access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref> Although the elderly, as well as diabetic patients, may have needs that greatly exceed that limit, such costs would have to be covered by patients or private supplemental insurance.\n\nAs of 2014, most, but not all provinces and territories provide coverage for sex reassignment surgery (also known as gender confirming surgery) and other treatment for [[gender dysphoria]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailyxtra.com/canada/news-and-ideas/news/sex-reassignment-surgeries-funded-in-two-provinces-89914 |title=Sex-reassignment surgeries funded in all but two provinces - But gaps remain in which surgeries covered where for trans Canadians |last=Rose |first=Rebecca |date=July 24, 2014 |website=Daily Xtra |publisher=Pink Triangle Press}}</ref> In Ontario, sex reassignment surgery requires prior approval before being covered.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/srs/ |title=Sex Reassignment Surgery |website=health.gov.on.ca |publisher=Queen\u2019s Printer for Ontario |access-date=January 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are wide discrepancies in coverage for various assistive devices such as wheelchairs and respiratory equipment in Canada.

Because Canada's public policies come from the federal government as well as the provincial governments, these two need to work together to create a beneficial healthcare plan. There are quite a few plans in which one, 65 years of age or older, can apply for to ensure they are covered. These include: [[Old Age Security]] (OAS), [[Guaranteed Income Supplement]] (GIS), Allowance and, [[Canada Pension Plan]] (CPP). The OAS is one in which citizens who have lived in Canada for 10 or more years and are age 65 or older can apply for. Those who have received the benefit of OAS and have a low income can then apply for the GIS. If a person has received the GIS, their spouse between the ages of 60\u201364 can apply for Allowance. Moving along, those who are in the workforce tend to put money aside for the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) by the time they reach age 65. The CPP is essentially a social insurance program preparing individuals for retirement. To those who obtain the CPP, they receive the benefit of the plan paying for things such as retirement, disability, children's benefits, and more. \"You must apply for OAS, GIS, the Allowance, CPP and other federal programs. You will not receive them automatically.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/seniors/forum/government-income-benefits.html |title=What every older Canadian should know about: Income and benefits from government programs - Canada.ca |date=October 3, 2016 |website=Canada.ca |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref> Although there are these beneficial plans, the need for a better plan of action for seniors is in effect. Out of the approximately 39 million people in Canada, roughly 6{{nbsp}}million of these people consist of seniors. \"Given these challenges, it is not surprising that nine in ten (90%) Canadians agree that Canada requires a national seniors strategy to address needs along the full continuum of care.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cma.ca/En/Lists/Medias/the-state-of-seniors-health-care-in-canada-september-2016.pdf |title=The State of Seniors Healthcare in Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213191639/https://www.cma.ca/En/Lists/Medias/the-state-of-seniors-health-care-in-canada-september-2016.pdf |archive-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref> In order to ensure maximum coverage of the elderly a few things need to be in order. For starters, having a shorter wait time for these seniors. As individuals grow older the more care is needed to ensure a healthy body and lifestyle and wait times can put a damper on this. Next, having specialized physicians who are knowledgeable in handling seniors in a gentle and well-equipped way. \"Restrictions on government funding has limited access to care\u2014wait-lists are routine, and Canadians are increasingly having difficulties accessing the services of family physicians. The system has not kept up with the demands and expectations of the patient.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.benefitscanada.com/benefits/health-wellness/canadian-healthcare-what-works-and-what-doesn%E2%80%99t-27647 |title=Canadian healthcare: What works and what doesn't |website=Benefitscanada.com |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref> This puts stress on those seniors and the need to ensure everyone is taken proper care of is essential having said that Canada is known to 'leave no Canadian behind'. And lastly, having continual care for these elders is essential in ensuring the finest [[health care]] available for those in need. It is stated that individuals ages 55\u201364, \"Over half (55 percent) have savings that represent less than one year's worth of the resources they need to supplement government programs like OAS/GIS and CPP/QPP. And fewer than 20 percent have enough savings to support the supplemented resources required for at least five years.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ipolitics.ca/2016/02/17/were-facing-a-wave-of-seniors-living-in-poverty-and-were-not-ready/ |title=We're facing a wave of seniors living in poverty \u2014 and we're not ready - iPolitics |date=February 17, 2016 |work=iPolitics |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref> With this being said, to ensure the coverage of all seniors, the expansion of public policies are in need. And to reiterate the federal government, as well as the provincial government, should work together to create enhanced opportunities for these individuals.\n\n==== Nursing homes and home care ====\nThere appear to be some problems within the [[Nursing home care|nursing home]]/home care subsection of health care in Canada, and scholars and advocates point to an increasingly complex care system, [[occupational hazard]]s, and an overall shortage of workers willing to work in this field as the main causes. Authors Ruth Lowndes and James Struthers in their dissertation say that there has been an intensification of job precarity, inadequate staffing levels as well as increasingly complex needs including different types of routinized, assembly-lines types of work, and cost-cutting on equipment and supplies. They also point out that within increasing elder [[Population of Canada|population]], the supply of workers is not meeting the demand required to provide adequate care.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lowndes |first=Ruth |last2=Struthers |first2=James |date=Spring 2016 |title=Changes and Continuities in the Workplace of Long-Term Residential Care in Canada, 1970\u20132015 |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=368\u2013395 |doi=10.3138/jcs.50.2.368}}</ref> This idea couples with another study that as we enter the 2020s and 30s, the equipment and processes that nurses undergo will become progressively composite.

However, the Act did give the provinces responsibility for regulating hospitals, and the provinces claimed that their general responsibility for local and private matters encompassed healthcare. The federal government felt that the health of the population fell under the \"[[Peace, order, and good government]]\" part of its responsibilities. This led to several decades of debate over jurisdiction that were not resolved until the 1930s. Eventually, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] decided that the administration and delivery of healthcare was a provincial concern, but that the federal government also had the responsibility of protecting the health and well-being of the population.\n\nBy far the largest government health program is Medicare, which is ten provincial programs, such as [[OHIP]] in [[Ontario]], that are required to meet the general guidelines laid out in the federal ''Canada Health Act''. Almost all government health spending goes through Medicare, but there are several smaller programs. The federal government directly administers health to groups such as the military, and inmates of federal prisons. They also provide some care to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and veterans, but these groups mostly use the public system. Before 1966, [[Veterans Affairs Canada]] had a large healthcare network, but this was merged into the general system with the creation of Medicare. The largest group the federal government is directly responsible for is [[First Nations]]. Native peoples are a federal responsibility and the federal government guarantees complete coverage of their health needs. For the last twenty years and despite health care being a guaranteed right for First Nations due to the many treaties the government of Canada signed for access to First Nations lands and resources, the amount of coverage provided by the Federal government's [[Non-Insured Health Benefits]] program has diminished drastically for optometry, dentistry, and medicines. Status First Nations individuals qualify for a set number of visits to the optometrist and dentist, with a limited amount of coverage for glasses, eye exams, fillings, root canals, etc. For the most part, First Nations people use normal hospitals and the federal government then fully compensates the provincial government for the expense. The federal government also covers any user fees the province charges. The federal government maintains a network of clinics and health centers on [[Indian reserve|Native Reserves]]. At the provincial level, there are also several much smaller health programs alongside Medicare. The largest of these is the health care costs paid by the [[workers' compensation]] system. Regardless of federal efforts, healthcare for First Nations has generally not been considered effective.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Silversides |first=Ann |date=October 23, 2007 |title=The North \"like Darfur\" |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/177/9/1013 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=177 |issue=9 |pages=1013\u20134 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.071359 |pmc=2025628 |pmid=17954876}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gao |first=Song |displayauthors=etal |date=November 4, 2008 |title=Access to health care among status Aboriginal people with chronic kidney disease |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/10/1007 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=1007\u201312 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080063 |pmc=2572655 |pmid=18981441}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Peiris |first=David |last2=Alex Brown |last3=BMed MPH |last4=Alan Cass |last5=MBBS PhD |date=November 4, 2008 |title=Addressing inequities in access to quality health care for indigenous people |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/10/985 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=985\u20136 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.081445 |pmc=2572646 |pmid=18981431}}</ref>\n\nDespite being a provincial responsibility, the large health costs have long been partially funded by the federal government. The cost-sharing agreement created by the ''[[Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act]]'' and extended by the ''Medical Care Act'' was discontinued in 1977 and replaced by [[Established Programs Financing]]. This gave a bloc transfer to the provinces, giving them more flexibility but also reducing the federal influence on the health system. In 1996, when faced with a large budget shortfall, the Liberal federal government merged the health transfers with the transfers for other social programs into the [[Canada Health and Social Transfer]], and overall funding levels were cut. This placed considerable pressure on the provinces and combined with [[population aging]] and the generally high rate of [[inflation]] in health costs, has caused problems with the system.\n\n==Physicians and medical organization==\nCanada, like its North American neighbor the United States, has a ratio of practicing physicians to a population that is below the OECD average<ref name=\" number of docs\">[https://data.oecd.org/healthres/doctors.htm Health resources - Doctors].

While viewing studies done in the cities of Quebec as well as Ontario a few interesting facts were seen. For example, studies in Quebec showed that there was a strong relation among dental services and the socioeconomic factors of income and education whereas in Ontario older adults heavily relied on dental insurance with visits to the dentist. \"According to the National Public Health Service in 1996/1997, it showed a whopping difference of people who were in different classes. About half of Canadians aged 15 or older (53%) reported having dental insurance (Table 1). Coverage tended to be highest among middle-aged people. At older ages, the rate dropped, and only one-fifth of the 65-or-older age group (21%) was covered.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/1999001/article/4646-eng.pdf |title=Dental Insurance and use of Dental Services |website=Statcan.gc.ca |access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref> Attributes that can contribute to these outcomes is household income, employment, as well as education.

Because Canada's public policies come from the federal government as well as the provincial governments, these two need to work together to create a beneficial healthcare plan. There are quite a few plans in which one, 65 years of age or older, can apply for to ensure they are covered. These include: [[Old Age Security]] (OAS), [[Guaranteed Income Supplement]] (GIS), Allowance and, [[Canada Pension Plan]] (CPP). The OAS is one in which citizens who have lived in Canada for 10 or more years and are age 65 or older can apply for. Those who have received the benefit of OAS and have a low income can then apply for the GIS. If a person has received the GIS, their spouse between the ages of 60\u201364 can apply for Allowance. Moving along, those who are in the workforce tend to put money aside for the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) by the time they reach age 65. The CPP is essentially a social insurance program preparing individuals for retirement. To those who obtain the CPP, they receive the benefit of the plan paying for things such as retirement, disability, children's benefits, and more. \"You must apply for OAS, GIS, the Allowance, CPP and other federal programs.

Authors Ruth Lowndes and James Struthers in their dissertation say that there has been an intensification of job precarity, inadequate staffing levels as well as increasingly complex needs including different types of routinized, assembly-lines types of work, and cost-cutting on equipment and supplies. They also point out that within increasing elder [[Population of Canada|population]], the supply of workers is not meeting the demand required to provide adequate care.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lowndes |first=Ruth |last2=Struthers |first2=James |date=Spring 2016 |title=Changes and Continuities in the Workplace of Long-Term Residential Care in Canada, 1970\u20132015 |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=368\u2013395 |doi=10.3138/jcs.50.2.368}}</ref> This idea couples with another study that as we enter the 2020s and 30s, the equipment and processes that nurses undergo will become progressively composite.

However, the Act did give the provinces responsibility for regulating hospitals, and the provinces claimed that their general responsibility for local and private matters encompassed healthcare. The federal government felt that the health of the population fell under the \"[[Peace, order, and good government]]\" part of its responsibilities. This led to several decades of debate over jurisdiction that were not resolved until the 1930s. Eventually, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] decided that the administration and delivery of healthcare was a provincial concern, but that the federal government also had the responsibility of protecting the health and well-being of the population.\n\nBy far the largest government health program is Medicare, which is ten provincial programs, such as [[OHIP]] in [[Ontario]], that are required to meet the general guidelines laid out in the federal ''Canada Health Act''. Almost all government health spending goes through Medicare, but there are several smaller programs. The federal government directly administers health to groups such as the military, and inmates of federal prisons. They also provide some care to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and veterans, but these groups mostly use the public system. Before 1966, [[Veterans Affairs Canada]] had a large healthcare network, but this was merged into the general system with the creation of Medicare. The largest group the federal government is directly responsible for is [[First Nations]]. Native peoples are a federal responsibility and the federal government guarantees complete coverage of their health needs. For the last twenty years and despite health care being a guaranteed right for First Nations due to the many treaties the government of Canada signed for access to First Nations lands and resources, the amount of coverage provided by the Federal government's [[Non-Insured Health Benefits]] program has diminished drastically for optometry, dentistry, and medicines. Status First Nations individuals qualify for a set number of visits to the optometrist and dentist, with a limited amount of coverage for glasses, eye exams, fillings, root canals, etc. For the most part, First Nations people use normal hospitals and the federal government then fully compensates the provincial government for the expense. The federal government also covers any user fees the province charges. The federal government maintains a network of clinics and health centers on [[Indian reserve|Native Reserves]]. At the provincial level, there are also several much smaller health programs alongside Medicare. The largest of these is the health care costs paid by the [[workers' compensation]] system. Regardless of federal efforts, healthcare for First Nations has generally not been considered effective.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Silversides |first=Ann |date=October 23, 2007 |title=The North \"like Darfur\" |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/177/9/1013 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=177 |issue=9 |pages=1013\u20134 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.071359 |pmc=2025628 |pmid=17954876}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gao |first=Song |displayauthors=etal |date=November 4, 2008 |title=Access to health care among status Aboriginal people with chronic kidney disease |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/10/1007 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=1007\u201312 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080063 |pmc=2572655 |pmid=18981441}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Peiris |first=David |last2=Alex Brown |last3=BMed MPH |last4=Alan Cass |last5=MBBS PhD |date=November 4, 2008 |title=Addressing inequities in access to quality health care for indigenous people |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/10/985 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=985\u20136 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.081445 |pmc=2572646 |pmid=18981431}}</ref>\n\nDespite being a provincial responsibility, the large health costs have long been partially funded by the federal government. The cost-sharing agreement created by the ''[[Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act]]'' and extended by the ''Medical Care Act'' was discontinued in 1977 and replaced by [[Established Programs Financing]]. This gave a bloc transfer to the provinces, giving them more flexibility but also reducing the federal influence on the health system.

In contrast, Denmark has had a 2-month wait time guarantee for elective surgery (although this may not always have been met and does not itself show the rates of surgery performed), while in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland (all with near-universal coverage) the majority of patients contacted reported waiting less than 1{{nbsp}}month for elective surgery (an average of 5{{nbsp}}weeks for hip and knee replacements in the Netherlands).\n\nSurveys on waiting times for elective surgery show that the percentage of patients who reported waiting a long time for elective surgery increased greatly in the 1990s, suggesting that waiting times were much shorter before then. Anecdotal (and therefore weak) evidence suggests that waiting times were not perceived as a major problem by the public before cutbacks in the 1990s at a time of greatly increased demand for health care.

The scores do not incorporate any information about the actual workings of the system, other than as reflected in life expectancy.
