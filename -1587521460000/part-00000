Delfeayo also has two brothers who are not musicians: Ellis Marsalis III (b. 1964) is a poet, photographer and computer networking specialist based in [[Baltimore]], and Mboya Kenyatta (b. 1970) is [[autism|autistic]] and was the primary inspiration for Delfeayo's founding of the New Orleans-based Uptown Music Theatre. Formed in 2000, UMT has trained over 300 youth and staged eight original musicals, all of which are based upon the mission of \"community unity\".\n\nWhile a gifted trombonist, Delfeayo has recorded relatively few albums and is both more prolific and better known for his work as a producer of acoustic jazz recordings. Along with ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'' engineer Patrick Smith, Delfeayo coined a phrase that was primarily responsible for the shift in many jazz recordings from rock and roll production to the resurgence of acoustic recording. \"To obtain more wood sound from the bass, this album recorded without usage of the ''dreaded'' bass direct\" first appeared on brother Branford's ''Renaissance'' (Columbia, 1987), and became the single sentence to define the recorded quality of many acoustic jazz recordings since the late 1980s.
