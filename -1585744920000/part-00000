{"title_page": "Sentence clause structure", "text_new": "{{Short description|how clauses compose sentences in grammar and syntax}}\nIn [[grammar]], '''sentence and clause structure''', commonly known as '''sentence composition''', is the classification of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] based on the number and kind of [[clause]]s in their [[syntax|syntactic structure]],  Such division is an element of [[traditional grammar]].\n\n==Types of clauses==\n\nIn standard English, sentences are composed of five ''clause'' patterns:\n\n1. Subject + Verb (intransitive) (as in \"She runs to the meeting\")\n\n2. Subject + Verb (transitive) + Object (as in \"She runs the meeting\")\n\n3. Subject + Verb (linking) + Subject Complement (adjective, noun, pronoun) (as in \"Abdul is happy\" or \"Jeanne is a person\" or \"I am she\")\n\n4. Subject + Verb (transitive) + Indirect Object + Direct Object (this clause pattern is a derivative of S+V+O, transforming the object of a preposition into an indirect object of the verb, as in \"She made me a pie,\" which is, in transformational grammar, actually \"She made a pie for me\")\n\n5. Subject + Verb (transitive) + Object + Object Complement (as in \"They made him happy\": they did not make \"him\", and they did not make \"happy\"; they made \"him happy\"--the object and its complement form a syntactical unit)\n\n''Sentences'' \u2013 which are composed of these clauses, in either \"dependent\" or \"independent\" form \u2013 also have patterns, as explained below.\n\n==Types of sentences==\nA ''simple sentence'' consists of only one clause. A ''compound sentence'' consists of two or more [[independent clause]]s. A ''complex sentence'' has at least one independent clause plus at least one [[dependent clause]].<ref name=\"Huddleston\">{{cite book |last=Huddleston |first=Rodney |title=Introduction to the Grammar of English |year=1984 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-29704-2}}</ref> A set of words with no independent clause may be an ''incomplete sentence'', also called a ''sentence fragment''.\n\nA sentence consisting of at least one dependent clause and at least two independent clauses may be called a ''complex-compound sentence'' or ''compound-complex sentence''.\n\nSentence 1 is an example of a simple sentence. Sentence 2 is compound because \"so\" is considered a coordinating conjunction in English, and sentence 3 is complex. Sentence 4 is compound-complex (also known as complex-compound). Example 5 is a sentence fragment.\n\n#''I like trains.''\n#''I don't know how to bake, so I buy my bread already made.''\n#''I enjoyed the apple pie that you bought for me.''\n#''The dog lived in the garden, but the cat, who was smarter, lived inside the house.''\n#''What an idiot.''\n\nThe simple sentence in example 1 contains one clause. Example 2 has two clauses (''I don't know how to bake'' and ''I buy my bread already made''), combined into a single sentence with the [[coordinating conjunction]] ''so''. In example 3, ''I enjoyed the apple pie'' is an independent clause, and ''that you bought for me'' is a dependent clause; the sentence is thus complex. In sentence 4, ''The dog lived in the garden'' and ''the cat lived inside the house'' are both independent clauses; ''who was smarter'' is a dependent clause. Example 5 features a noun phrase but no verb. It is not a grammatically complete clause.\n\n==Simple sentences==\nA simple sentence structure contains one [[independent clause]] and no [[dependent clause]]s.<ref name=\"Rozakis\">{{cite book |author=Rozakis, Laurie |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Style |publisher=Alpha |year=2003 |isbn=1-59257-115-8 |pages=167\u2013168}}</ref>\n\n*''I run.''\nThis simple sentence has one independent clause which contains one [[subject (grammar)|subject]], ''I'', and one [[Predicate (grammar)|verb]], ''run''.\n*''The girl ran into her bedroom.''\nThis simple sentence has one independent clause which contains one subject, ''girl'', and one predicate, ''ran into her bedroom''. The predicate is a [[verb phrase]] that consists of more than one word.\n*''In the backyard, the dog barked and howled at the cat.''\nThis simple sentence has one independent clause which contains one subject, ''dog'', and one predicate, ''barked and howled at the cat''. This predicate has two verbs, known as a compound predicate: ''barked'' and ''howled''. This [[compound verb]] should not be confused with a compound sentence. ''In the backyard'' and ''at the cat'' are [[prepositional phrase]]s.\n\n==Compound sentences==\n<!-- [[Compound sentence]] redirects here -->\nIn English language, a compound sentence is composed of at least two independent clauses. It does not require a dependent clause. The clauses are joined by a '''coordinating''' conjunction (with or without a comma), a semicolon that functions as a conjunction, a colon instead of a semicolon between two sentences when the second sentence explains or illustrates the first sentence and no coordinating conjunction is being used to connect the sentences, or a conjunctive adverb preceded by a semicolon. A conjunction can be used to make a compound sentence. Conjunctions are words such as ''and'', ''but'', ''or'', ''nor'', ''so'', and ''yet''. Examples:\n\n* I started on time, but I arrived late.\n* I will accept your offer or decline it; these are the two options.\n* The law was passed: from April 1, all cars would have to be tested.\n* The war was lost; consequently, the whole country was occupied.\n\nThe use of a comma to separate two independent clauses without the addition of an appropriate conjunction is called a [[comma splice]] and is generally considered an error (when used in the English language).<ref name=\"Rozakis\"/> Example:\n* The sun was shining, everyone appeared happy.\n\nIf a sentence contains ''homogenous'' members referring to another common member of the sentence, the sentence may be considered either simple<ref>{{cite book |last=Scheib |first=Henry |title=The Thought and Its Expression: A Grammar After the System Introduced Into the Best Schools of Germany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30hAAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA55 |date=1849}}</ref> or compound.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/sentences/compound-sentences.html |title=Compound Sentences}}</ref> If the homogenous members are removed, then the sentence is called ''contracted''.

(Russian)\n\n==Complex and compound-complex sentences==\n{{main|Dependent clause}}\n\nA complex sentence has one or more dependent clauses (also called subordinate clauses). Since a dependent clause cannot stand on its own as a sentence, complex sentences must also have at least one independent clause. In short, a sentence with one or more dependent clauses and at least one independent clause is a complex sentence. A sentence with two or more independent clauses plus one or more dependent clauses is called compound-complex or complex-compound.\n\nIn addition to a subject and a verb, dependent clauses contain a [[subordinating conjunction]] or similar word. There are a large number of subordinating conjunctions in English. Some of these give the clause an [[adverb]]ial function, specifying time, place, or manner. Such clauses are called [[adverbial clause]]s.\n*''When I stepped out into the bright sunlight, from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind''. ([[S. E. Hinton]], ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'')\nThis complex sentence contains an adverbial clause, ''When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house''. The adverbial clause describes when and where the action of the main clause, ''I had only two things on my mind'', took place.\n\nA [[relative clause]] is a dependent clause that modifies a [[noun]] or noun phrase in the independent clause. In other words, the relative clause functions similar to an [[adjective]].\n*''Let him who has been deceived complain''. ([[Miguel de Cervantes]], ''[[Don Quixote]]'')\n*''You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.'' ([[J.K. Rowling]], ''[[Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'')\nIn the first example, the [[restrictive relative clause]] ''who has been deceived'' specifies or defines the meaning of ''him'' in the independent clause, ''Let him complain''. In the second example, the non-restrictive relative clause ''who have never known your family'' describes ''you'' in the independent clause, ''You see them standing around you''.\n\nA noun clause is a dependent clause that functions like a noun. A noun clause may function as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a clause, or as a [[predicate nominative]] or an [[Object (grammar)|object]].\n*''What she had realized was that love was that moment when your heart was about to burst.'' ([[Stieg Larsson]], ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'')\nIn this sentence the independent clause contains two noun clauses. The noun clause ''What she had realized'' serves as the subject of the verb ''was'', and ''that love was that moment'' serves as [[subject complement|complement]]. The sentence also contains a relative clause, ''when your heart was about to burst''.\n\n==Incomplete sentences<!--'Sentence fragment' redirects here-->==\nAn incomplete sentence, or sentence fragment, is a set of words which does not form a complete sentence, either because it does not express a complete thought{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} or because it lacks some grammatical element, such as a subject or a verb.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sinclair |first=Christine |title=Grammar: Getting it Right |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-335-22008-3}}</ref> A [[dependent clause]] without an [[independent clause]] is one example of an incomplete sentence.\n\nSome [[prescriptive grammar]]s<ref>e.g. [[H.

That's not funny anymore.-->\nA ''run-on'' [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] consists of two or more [[independent clauses]] (i.e., clauses that have not been made dependent through the use of a relative pronoun or a subordinating conjunction) that are joined without appropriate punctuation: the clauses \"run on\"--into confusion rather than clarity, like intersecting streets without signs for Yield or Stop. The independent clauses can be \"fused\", as in \"It is nearly half past five we cannot reach town before dark\", in which case the two independent clauses might be separated (between \"five\" and \"we\") with a period [...five. We...], a comma and conjunction (...five, and we...), or a semicolon (...five; we...). The independent clauses can be joined ''inadequately'' with only a comma (the [[comma splice]]). [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], which takes literary license by intentionally breaking this grammatical rule by use of long, punctuation-free, run-on sentences, particularly in the final chapter \"[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 18, Penelope|Penelope]]\".\n\nIn general, run-on sentences occur when two or more independent clauses are joined without using a [[Grammatical conjunction|coordinating conjunction]] (i.e. ''for'', ''and'', ''nor'', ''but'', ''or'', ''yet'', ''so'') or correct punctuation (i.e. semicolon, dash, or period).<ref name=\"Fused\">{{cite web |last1=Berry |first1=Chris |last2=Brizee |first2=Allen |title=Runons \u2013 Comma Splices Fused Sentences |date=2006-08-31 |url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/598/02/ |accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref><ref name=\"CCC\">{{cite web |title=Run-on Sentences, Comma Splices |url=http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/runons.htm |accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-run-ons/ |title=English Grammar Lesson - Run-Ons! - ELC |date=2017-05-19 |work=ELC - English Language Center |access-date=2017-09-14 |language=en-US}}</ref> A run-on sentence can be as short as four words, for instance: ''I drive she walks'', or even ''I drive, she walks,'' because in these short cases there are two [[Grammatical subject|subjects]] paired with two [[intransitive verb]]s.

Since a dependent clause cannot stand on its own as a sentence, complex sentences must also have at least one independent clause. In short, a sentence with one or more dependent clauses and at least one independent clause is a complex sentence. A sentence with two or more independent clauses plus one or more dependent clauses is called compound-complex or complex-compound.\n\nIn addition to a subject and a verb, dependent clauses contain a [[subordinating conjunction]] or similar word. There are a large number of subordinating conjunctions in English. Some of these give the clause an [[adverb]]ial function, specifying time, place, or manner. Such clauses are called [[adverbial clause]]s.\n*''When I stepped out into the bright sunlight, from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind''. ([[S. E. Hinton]], ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'')\nThis complex sentence contains an adverbial clause, ''When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house''. The adverbial clause describes when and where the action of the main clause, ''I had only two things on my mind'', took place.\n\nA [[relative clause]] is a dependent clause that modifies a [[noun]] or noun phrase in the independent clause. In other words, the relative clause functions similar to an [[adjective]].\n*''Let him who has been deceived complain''. ([[Miguel de Cervantes]], ''[[Don Quixote]]'')\n*''You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.'' ([[J.K. Rowling]], ''[[Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'')\nIn the first example, the [[restrictive relative clause]] ''who has been deceived'' specifies or defines the meaning of ''him'' in the independent clause, ''Let him complain''. In the second example, the non-restrictive relative clause ''who have never known your family'' describes ''you'' in the independent clause, ''You see them standing around you''.\n\nA noun clause is a dependent clause that functions like a noun. A noun clause may function as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a clause, or as a [[predicate nominative]] or an [[Object (grammar)|object]].\n*''What she had realized was that love was that moment when your heart was about to burst.''

We...], a comma and conjunction (...five, and we...), or a semicolon (...five; we...). The independent clauses can be joined ''inadequately'' with only a comma (the [[comma splice]]). [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], which takes literary license by intentionally breaking this grammatical rule by use of long, punctuation-free, run-on sentences, particularly in the final chapter \"[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 18, Penelope|Penelope]]\".\n\nIn general, run-on sentences occur when two or more independent clauses are joined without using a [[Grammatical conjunction|coordinating conjunction]] (i.e. ''for'', ''and'', ''nor'', ''but'', ''or'', ''yet'', ''so'') or correct punctuation (i.e. semicolon, dash, or period).<ref name=\"Fused\">{{cite web |last1=Berry |first1=Chris |last2=Brizee |first2=Allen |title=Runons \u2013 Comma Splices Fused Sentences |date=2006-08-31 |url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/598/02/ |accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref><ref name=\"CCC\">{{cite web |title=Run-on Sentences, Comma Splices |url=http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/runons.htm |accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-run-ons/ |title=English Grammar Lesson - Run-Ons! - ELC |date=2017-05-19 |work=ELC - English Language Center |access-date=2017-09-14 |language=en-US}}</ref> A run-on sentence can be as short as four words, for instance: ''I drive she walks'', or even ''I drive, she walks,'' because in these short cases there are two [[Grammatical subject|subjects]] paired with two [[intransitive verb]]s.

It was created in 1660, along with the subsidiary title of '''Baron Loughneagh'''. From 1665 to 1816 the [[Skeffington baronets|Skeffington Baronetcy]] of Fisherwick was attached to the viscountcy and from 1756 to 1816 the Viscounts also held the title of '''Earl of Massereene'''. Since 1843 the peerages are united with titles of '''Viscount Ferrard''', of Oriel and '''Baron Oriel''', both in the Peerage of Ireland, and '''Baron Oriel''', in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. The Viscount also holds the subsidiary titles of ''Baron Loughneagh'' (1660) and ''Baron Oriel'' (1790) in the Peerage of Ireland and ''Baron Oriel'' (1821) in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. As '''Baron Oriel''', he sat in the [[House of Lords]] until 1999.\n\nThe family seat was [[Chilham Castle]], near [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]].\n\n==Viscount Massereene==\n[[John Clotworthy, 1st Viscount Massereene|John Clotworthy]] was a prominent Anglo-Irish politician during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].

Mary Clotworthy, and in default thereof to his heirs general. This makes the peerages unique in being the only extant Irish peerages that can descend through heirs general rather than heirs male only. Lord Massereene was succeeded according to the special remainder by his son-in-law, the second Viscount. In 1756 his great-grandson, the fifth Viscount, was created '''Earl of Massereene''' in Peerage of Ireland. However, the earldom and baronetcy became extinct in 1816 on the death of his grandson, the fourth Earl. The barony of Loughneugh and viscountcy of Massereene were inherited according to the special remainder (which allowed them to be passed on through the female line) by his daughter Harriet, the ninth Viscountess. She was the wife of Thomas Henry Foster, 2nd Viscount Ferrard (see below). Lord Ferrard and Lady Massereene were both succeeded by their son, the tenth Viscount Massereene and third Viscount Ferrard. In 1817 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Skeffington in lieu of Foster. His son, the eleventh and fourth Viscount, notably served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Louth|Lord Lieutenant of County Louth]]. His son, the twelfth and fifth Viscount, was [[Lord Lieutenant of Antrim]] and a member of the [[Senate of Northern Ireland]]. {{As of|2017}} the titles are held by the latter's grandson, the fourteenth and seventh Viscount, who succeeded his father in 1992.

It gave protection to laborers and Civic servants.  In 1923, the governor of [[Sistan and Baluchestan]] ordered a decree in nine articles to protect carpet makers\u2019 rights, including working hours, leaves, and minimum age.  It was the first national document of [[labor rights]].<ref>(Rasaeinia, 2000 p.&nbsp;95)</ref>  In 1928, Parliament passed the [[Civil law (area)|Civil Law]] (Ghanon-e Madanei) which addressed employment contracts. This law divides the employer and employee relations into two categories by benchmarking French Law. Independent contractors (e.g. carpenters, doctors, lawyers, and plumbers) who control their own work are accountable for their profit and lost. Next, servants who are being paid by an employer to perform specific tasks, but do not have full control of their work and act upon the employer\u2019s instructions and orders.<ref>(Katozian, 2005)</ref>\n\nIn 1936, the cabinet issued regulations on minimum hygiene conditions in factories,<ref name=\"Ladjevardi, 1985 p. 61\">(Ladjevardi, 1985 p.&nbsp;61)</ref> which was the first attempt to regulate employer-employee relationships.   On May 18, 1946, the Council of Ministers <ref name=\"Ladjevardi, 1985 p. 61\"/> passed the labour bill.  The first labour minister was appointed that same year <ref>(Ladjevardi, 1985 p.&nbsp;190)</ref> which improved the systematisation of labour relations and personnel management. Yet, the working conditions, despite the legislation, were entirely at the whim of enterprise owners because the laws were not enforced and the Labour Ministry was weak. Employers could do virtually as they wished with no consequences and they barred formation of labour unions.<ref>(Ladjevardi, 1985 p.&nbsp;196)</ref>\n\nIn 1951, a committee was appointed by the ministry of labour to translate various countries labour laws and the international [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] Conventions to [[Persian language|Persian]] in order to do a comparative study and draft a labour law.  This effort did not lead to proposal of labor law.  Then, from 1952 to 1957, various committees established by the ministry of labour and foreign consultants including a Belgian consultant and general secretary of the Middle East labour institute were invited to finalise the draft of labour law, which finally in 1959 voted and passed by the [[Majlis of Iran|Parliament \"Majils\"]]. This law was practised until 1990.<ref>(Mozafari, 2002 p.&nbsp;13)</ref>\n       \nThe next phase of labour legislation began with the Shah\u2019s \"[[White Revolution]]\" \"Enghlab Sefied\" in 1962.  It provided generous welfare and social improvements, such as profit sharing, employee stock ownership plans, company housing, [[minimum wage]], and an improved [[Social security|Social Security]] Act.<ref>(Ladjevardi, 1985 p.&nbsp;240-242)</ref> All were paid for with revenue from high oil prices.  Nevertheless, many private sector owners opposed the new initiatives that infringed on their power.  New personnel practices were introduced, including payroll administration with time management, job descriptions, job classifications and evaluations, and organisational hierarchies, mainly in large companies and government-run industries.  In the 1960s, progressive private sector entrepreneurs, such as the Ladjevardi family in the Behshar Industrial group, introduced job classifications; personnel policies and procedures, and automated payroll systems following the recommendations of the [[NIOC|Iranian National Oil Company]]\u2019s foreign advisors.\n\n===After the revolution===\n{{see also| Economic history of Iran}}\n[[Image:Tajrishbazar.JPG|right|thumb|[[Social security]] for all employees is compulsory in [[Iran]].]]\nFollowing the [[Islamic revolution]] and the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|new constitution]], this enchanted many with idealistic promises. The new constitution addressed work and labour topics in eleven areas through various articles summarised as the following:<ref>Rasaeinia (2000)</ref>\n\n#\tAwards freedom of career and occupation\n#\tCommands for establishment of working hours\n#\tElimination of compulsory work\n#\tProhibits abuse and exploitation \n#\tAcknowledges ownership and right to earned wages for worker\n#\tProhibits disturbance of business by others\n#\tPledges equal opportunity for everyone by providing necessity and amenities\n#\tPledges to make available equipment and tools to those able to work if they lack the capability to acquire required equipment and tools\n#\tPledges to grant interest free loans for establishment of cooperative institutes and companies\n#\tPledges to provide health and hygiene services for diverse age groups\n#\tPledges to aid the underprivileged and victims of accident\n\nA new era of labour legislation, shaped after the new Islamic constitution, recognised progress had occurred following the establishment of the first Islamic Workers Council or (Shora-e Islami Karagaran). This provided workers rights similar to those of European workers, but under the umbrella of [[Islam]].\n\nDuring the first two decades of the revolution, the Workers Council influenced many of the personnel management tasks including recruitment, selection, promotion, job evaluation, salary structure, productivity bonus, health and safety and many more tasks (even providing employees with a daily milk and food ration). Added to these were establishing and operating factory grocery stores and housing cooperatives. Ironically, many of these tasks became official ink of the 1990 Islamic Republic of Iran Labour law.\n\nThe end of the Iran-Iraq war marked the start of economic liberation, as well as, a gain of the reformists in [[Majlis of Iran|Parliament]]. In this period, a new private sector emerged, challenging the utopian labour laws and regulations.  With this, the 1990 labour law was pro-labour and expensive to administer. Management had to seat labour representatives on the company\u2019s board of directors, which was unprecedented in the traditional management style of Iranian private sector, in addition to enforcement many welfare and mandatory benefit.\n\nThe first dent in the labour law came about with the introduction of temporary employment contracts that allowed employers to hire employees under a one-year contract with the ability to be reissued year after year after a settlement of the annual \"end of services\" benefit. The Ministry of Labour issued a communiqu\u00e9 in March 1994 stating that employment under the \"fixed terms\" contracts was legal.<ref>(IRI-Ministry of Labor)</ref>\n\nThe government created an ambitious development plan aimed at liberalising and boosting the economy over-night. The plan contributed in creating a passive labour law. Then, in 2004, the reformists in the Sixth Parliament and the conservatives in the [[Guardian Council]] succeeded in reaching an agreement to amend the Labour Law to exempt firms with five or fewer workers from some of its provisions.  This provided small entrepreneurs with more freedom in their employment practices.<ref>(Salehi-Isfahani, 2005)</ref>\n\nFinally, in 2006, in response to growing pressures from the private sector for labour law reform, the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Labour]] drafted an amendment to deconstruct the \"free market\". A new law is under consideration based on these amendments.<ref>(Maljoo, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Labor law==\n{{See also|Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs}}\n\nThere is a minimum national [[wage]] applicable to each sector of activity fixed by the Supreme Labour Council which is revised annually. In 2010 the [[minimum wage]], determined by the Supreme Labour Council, was about US$303 per month (US$3,636 per year).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hesabdary.com/news/detail.asp?id=1402 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131459/http://www.hesabdary.com/news/detail.asp/?id=1402 |archive-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8812221177</ref><ref>http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_mth.aspx?SelectDate=2010-01-31&reportType=REP</ref> Membership in the [[social security system]] for all employees is compulsory. The [[poverty line#National poverty lines|national poverty line]] for [[Tehran]] in the year ending March 20, 2008 was $9,612 per year and the national average was $4,932.<ref>[http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=97282&sectionid=351020102 PressTV: 29-33% of Iranians live below poverty line] Retrieved June 7, 2009</ref>\n\nAlthough Iranian workers have, in theory, a right to form [[labour union]]s, there is, in actuality, no union system in the country. Workers are represented ostensibly by the Workers' House, a state-sponsored institution that nevertheless attempts to challenge some state policies. Guild unions operate locally in most areas but are limited largely to issuing credentials and licenses. The right of workers to [[Strike action|strike]] is generally not respected by the state, and since 1979 strikes have often been met by [[police]] action.\nu\nThe comprehensive Labour Law covers all labour relations in Iran, including hiring of local and foreign staff. The Labour Law provides a very broad and inclusive definition of the individuals it covers, and written, oral, temporary and indefinite employment contracts are all recognised.\n\nThe Iranian Labour Law is very employee-friendly and makes it extremely difficult to lay off staff. Employing personnel on consecutive six-month contracts is illegal, as is dismissing staff without proof of a serious offence. Labour disputes are settled by a special labour council, which usually rules in favour of the employee.\n\nThe Labour Law provides the minimum standards an employer must adhere to when forming an employment relationship. The minimum age for workers in Iran is 15 years, but large sectors of the economy (including small businesses, agricultural concerns, and family-owned enterprises) are exempted.\n\n===Provisions of employment contract===\n{{see also| Economy of Iran#Labour force}}\nTo have a valid '''contract''' concluded under the Law, the following provisions must be included:<ref name=ILO>http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/WEBTEXT/21843/64830/E90IRN01.htm</ref>\n\n*1. Type of Work, vocation or duty that must be undertaken by the worker;\n*2. Basic compensation and supplements thereto;\n*3. Working hours, holidays and leaves;\n*4. Place of performance of duties;\n*5. Probationary period, if any;\n*6. Date of conclusion of contract;\n*7. Duration of employment; and\n*8. Any other terms and conditions required according to nature of employment.\n\nThe employer may require the employee to be subject to a probationary period. However, the probation time may not exceed one month for unskilled workers and three months for skilled and professional workers. During the probation period, either party may immediately terminate the employment relationship without cause or payment of severance pay. The only caveat being that if the employer terminates the relationship, he must pay the employee for the entire duration of the probation period.\n\n===Suspension of employment contract===\nThe fact that the employment contract can be suspended by an employee under certain conditions presents yet another challenge to employers. What this allows is suspension of the employment contract under the following conditions:<ref name=ILO/>\n\n*1. The period of military service (active, contingency and reserve), as well as voluntary enlistment during conflicts. This period shall be considered part of the employee's service record at place of employment;\n*2. The closure of a workshop or parts thereof due to force majeure;\n*3. Educational leave for up to four years; and\n*4. The period of detention that does not lead to conviction;\n\nOnce the conditions giving rise to the suspension of the contract are removed, the employer must allow for return of the employee to work. If the position is filled or eliminated, the employer is obligated to provide a similar position for the employee. Failure to do the above is considered wrongful discharge and subject to legal action.\n\n===Termination of employment contract===\nThe Law allows for termination of the employment contract only under the following instances:<ref name=ILO/>\n\n*1. Death of employee;\n*2. Retirement of employee;\n*3. Total disability of employee;\n*4. Expiration of the duration of the employment contract;\n*5. Conclusion of work in task specific contracts; and\n*6. Resignation of the employee.\n\nThe employer is bound to pay benefits under all of the above scenarios according to the years of service.\n\n===Dismissal of an employee===\nAn employee may only be dismissed upon approval of the Islamic Labour Council or the Labour Discretionary Board. Grounds for dismissal include an employee's neglect in carrying out his/her duties or violation of disciplinary by-laws of the employer. The employer must have provided written prior notice of the employee's violations. If the board is not convinced that the employee's dismissal is justified, the employer must reinstate the employee. Once an employee is dismissed, the employer is obligated to provide the legal [[severance package]].<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Severance & termination benefits===\nThe Law mandates the following compensation for terminated, disabled and suspended employee:<ref name=ILO/>\n\n*1. Suspended Employee - Where an employee is suspended without cause the employer must reinstate the employee and pay for all damages and compensation resulted from the wrongful suspension;\n*2. Terminated Employee - An employer is under legal obligation to provide thirty (30) days salary for every year of service for employees made redundant or retired;\n*3. Disabled Employee - The employer must pay 30 days salary for every year of service. Moreover, if disability of an employee is due to working conditions, the employer must pay 60 days salary for every year of employee's service period.\n\n===Working hours & overtime===\nThe workweek in Iran is based on a '''44-hour week'''. Typically, employees work from Saturday to Wednesday (8 hours per day) and half a day on Thursday (4 hours). Any hours worked beyond these will entitle the employee to overtime. The Law mandates a payment of 40% above the hourly wage to employees for any accrued overtime. The employee must consent to overtime work.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Holidays & leave===\n{{See also|Iranian calendar}}\nEmployees are entitled to leave on all official state holidays (approximately 22 days a year) and ''Fridays''. Any employee working during these holidays will be entitled to overtime pay. Additionally, employees are entitled to one-month holiday per annum. The annual leave for those employees engaged in hard and hazardous employment shall be five weeks per annum. Employees are entitled to save up to 9 days of their annual leave.<ref name=ILO/>\n\nIn case of termination, disability or redundancies, employees must be compensated for any accrued leave. Finally, employees are entitled to 3 days of paid vacation for marriage or death of a spouse, father, mother or child.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Maternity leave===\n{{see also|Social Security Organisation (Iran)}}\nWomen employees are entitled to 90 days of maternity leave. The employee's salary during maternity leave will be paid according to the provisions of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110903224522/http://www2.tamin.org.ir/web/sso-en/laws Social Security Act]. Maternity leave must be considered part of an employee's service record. Employers must provide returning employees with the same position.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Employment of foreign nationals===\n{{See also|Iranian citizens abroad|Human trafficking in Iran}}\nThe Law forbids employment of foreign nationals without a proper [[work permit]]. Diplomats, United Nations employees and foreign press reporters are exempt from this requirement. A work permit to a foreign national will be issued only if the following conditions are met:<ref name=ILO/>\n\n*1. Lack of expertise among Iranian nationals;\n*2. The foreign national being qualified for the position; and\n*3. The expertise of the foreign national will be used for training of, and later replacement by, Iranian individuals.\n\nWork permits will be issued, renewed or extended for a maximum period of one year. Moreover, no exit visa will be granted to the foreign national unless the national has paid all due taxes, duties, etc.<ref name=ILO/> (More info: [http://www.investiniran.ir/en/filepool/45?redirectpage=%2fen%2febook Employment of Foreign Nationals in Iran])\n\n====Exemption====\nA new law provides that workshops with less than five employees will not be subject to the labor laws.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Health care===\n{{Main|Health care in Iran}}\nThe [[Iranian constitution]] entitles Iranians to basic [[health care]], and most receive subsidised prescription [[drugs]] and [[vaccination]] programs. An extensive network of public clinics offers basic care at low cost, and general and specialist [[hospital]]s operated by the Ministry of Health provide higher levels of care. In most large cities, well-to-do persons use private [[clinics]] and hospitals that charge high fees. Specialised medical facilities are concentrated in urban areas, but rural communities have relatively good access to primary care physicians at clinics in [[villages]], where the government-sponsored primary health care system has raised the level of health education and prenatal care since the late 1990s.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Social protection===\n{{See also|Social Security Organisation (Iran)|Civil Servants Pension Organisation|Bonyad}}\nIran has a comprehensive [[social protection]] system with some 28 social insurance, social assistance, and disaster relief programmes benefiting large segments of the population. These programmes include training and job-search assistance, health and unemployment insurance, disability, old-age and survivorship pensions, and in kind- or in-kind transfers including subsidies (e.g., housing, food, energy), rehabilitation and other social services (e.g. long-term care services for the elderly), and even marriage and burial assistance.<ref name=ILO/>\n\nDespite significant achievements in human development and poverty reduction, serious challenges to growth call for reform.  While labour-market pressures continue to increase because of demographic dynamics and increased participation of women in the labour force, Iran\u2019s economy is still unable to generate enough needed jobs to absorb the new flows into the labour market and at the same time reduce unemployment extensively.\n\nIn addition to income tax, employers are required to contribute to the State [[Social security|Social Security]] Fund and the Employment Fund. For social security and [[unemployment insurance]], the employee pays 7% of salary (between the ages of 18-65), employer (20 to 23%), the State (3%). [[Independent business|Independent]] workers pay 12-18%, depending on the type of coverage sought.<ref name=\"socialsecurity.gov\">[https://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/ssptw/2004-2005/asia/iran.html U.S. Social Security Administration: Iran's entry] Retrieved October 14, 2010</ref>  In 2003 the minimum standard [[pension]] was 50 percent of the worker\u2019s earnings but not less than the amount of the minimum wage.\n\nThe [[social security]] makes it possible to ensure the employees against [[unemployment]], the [[disease]], old age ([[retirement]] [[pension]]), the occupational [[accident]]s.<ref name=\"socialsecurity.gov\"/>  Iran did not legislate in favour of a universal social protection, but in 1996, the Centre for statistics of Iran estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population was covered by Social Security. [[Social Security Organisation (Iran)|The Organisation of the social security]], managed by the [[Ministry of Welfare and Social Security (Iran)|Ministry of social protection]], delivers also family benefits and of [[maternity]] under certain conditions. Iran spent 22.5 percent of its 2003 national budget on social welfare programs. More than 50 percent of that amount covered pensions.\n\n[[Social welfare provision|Welfare]] programs for the needy are managed by more than 30 individual public agencies and semi-state organisations called [[Bonyad]], as well as by several private non-governmental organisations. In 2003 the government began to consolidate its welfare organisations in an effort to eliminate redundancy and inefficiency.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal| Iran| economy| society}}\n*[[Iranian Labour News Agency]]\n*[[List of trade unions#Iran|List of trade unions in Iran]]\n**[[Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company]]\n*[[Taxation in Iran]]\n*[[Economy of Iran]] (Including Labour force)\n*[[International rankings of Iran#Economy|International Rankings of Iran in Economy]]\n*[[List of major economic laws in Iran]]\n*{{Wikivoyage-inline|Iran}}\n*[[British labour law]]\n*[[Bonyad]] - Iran's foundations which control 20% of Iran's GDP.\n*[[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Constitution of Iran]]\n*[[Government of Iran]]\n*[[Education in Iran]]\n*[[Iran's brain drain]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Araghi, E (2002), \"labor Law (1), Hoghogh Kar (1), \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \", In Persian Translated by Author, Tehran: Samt\n* Katozian, N.

This law was practised until 1990.<ref>(Mozafari, 2002 p.&nbsp;13)</ref>\n       \nThe next phase of labour legislation began with the Shah\u2019s \"[[White Revolution]]\" \"Enghlab Sefied\" in 1962.  It provided generous welfare and social improvements, such as profit sharing, employee stock ownership plans, company housing, [[minimum wage]], and an improved [[Social security|Social Security]] Act.<ref>(Ladjevardi, 1985 p.&nbsp;240-242)</ref> All were paid for with revenue from high oil prices.  Nevertheless, many private sector owners opposed the new initiatives that infringed on their power.  New personnel practices were introduced, including payroll administration with time management, job descriptions, job classifications and evaluations, and organisational hierarchies, mainly in large companies and government-run industries.  In the 1960s, progressive private sector entrepreneurs, such as the Ladjevardi family in the Behshar Industrial group, introduced job classifications; personnel policies and procedures, and automated payroll systems following the recommendations of the [[NIOC|Iranian National Oil Company]]\u2019s foreign advisors.\n\n===After the revolution===\n{{see also| Economic history of Iran}}\n[[Image:Tajrishbazar.JPG|right|thumb|[[Social security]] for all employees is compulsory in [[Iran]].]]\nFollowing the [[Islamic revolution]] and the [[Constitution of Iran|new constitution]], this enchanted many with idealistic promises. The new constitution addressed work and labour topics in eleven areas through various articles summarised as the following:<ref>Rasaeinia (2000)</ref>\n\n#\tAwards freedom of career and occupation\n#\tCommands for establishment of working hours\n#\tElimination of compulsory work\n#\tProhibits abuse and exploitation \n#\tAcknowledges ownership and right to earned wages for worker\n#\tProhibits disturbance of business by others\n#\tPledges equal opportunity for everyone by providing necessity and amenities\n#\tPledges to make available equipment and tools to those able to work if they lack the capability to acquire required equipment and tools\n#\tPledges to grant interest free loans for establishment of cooperative institutes and companies\n#\tPledges to provide health and hygiene services for diverse age groups\n#\tPledges to aid the underprivileged and victims of accident\n\nA new era of labour legislation, shaped after the new Islamic constitution, recognised progress had occurred following the establishment of the first Islamic Workers Council or (Shora-e Islami Karagaran). This provided workers rights similar to those of European workers, but under the umbrella of [[Islam]].\n\nDuring the first two decades of the revolution, the Workers Council influenced many of the personnel management tasks including recruitment, selection, promotion, job evaluation, salary structure, productivity bonus, health and safety and many more tasks (even providing employees with a daily milk and food ration). Added to these were establishing and operating factory grocery stores and housing cooperatives. Ironically, many of these tasks became official ink of the 1990 Islamic Republic of Iran Labour law.\n\nThe end of the Iran-Iraq war marked the start of economic liberation, as well as, a gain of the reformists in [[Majlis of Iran|Parliament]]. In this period, a new private sector emerged, challenging the utopian labour laws and regulations.  With this, the 1990 labour law was pro-labour and expensive to administer. Management had to seat labour representatives on the company\u2019s board of directors, which was unprecedented in the traditional management style of Iranian private sector, in addition to enforcement many welfare and mandatory benefit.\n\nThe first dent in the labour law came about with the introduction of temporary employment contracts that allowed employers to hire employees under a one-year contract with the ability to be reissued year after year after a settlement of the annual \"end of services\" benefit. The Ministry of Labour issued a communiqu\u00e9 in March 1994 stating that employment under the \"fixed terms\" contracts was legal.<ref>(IRI-Ministry of Labor)</ref>\n\nThe government created an ambitious development plan aimed at liberalising and boosting the economy over-night. The plan contributed in creating a passive labour law. Then, in 2004, the reformists in the Sixth Parliament and the conservatives in the [[Guardian Council]] succeeded in reaching an agreement to amend the Labour Law to exempt firms with five or fewer workers from some of its provisions.  This provided small entrepreneurs with more freedom in their employment practices.<ref>(Salehi-Isfahani, 2005)</ref>\n\nFinally, in 2006, in response to growing pressures from the private sector for labour law reform, the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Labour]] drafted an amendment to deconstruct the \"free market\". A new law is under consideration based on these amendments.<ref>(Maljoo, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Labor law==\n{{See also|Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs}}\n\nThere is a minimum national [[wage]] applicable to each sector of activity fixed by the Supreme Labour Council which is revised annually. In 2010 the [[minimum wage]], determined by the Supreme Labour Council, was about US$303 per month (US$3,636 per year).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hesabdary.com/news/detail.asp?id=1402 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131459/http://www.hesabdary.com/news/detail.asp/?id=1402 |archive-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8812221177</ref><ref>http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_mth.aspx?SelectDate=2010-01-31&reportType=REP</ref> Membership in the [[social security system]] for all employees is compulsory. The [[poverty line#National poverty lines|national poverty line]] for [[Tehran]] in the year ending March 20, 2008 was $9,612 per year and the national average was $4,932.<ref>[http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=97282&sectionid=351020102 PressTV: 29-33% of Iranians live below poverty line] Retrieved June 7, 2009</ref>\n\nAlthough Iranian workers have, in theory, a right to form [[labour union]]s, there is, in actuality, no union system in the country. Workers are represented ostensibly by the Workers' House, a state-sponsored institution that nevertheless attempts to challenge some state policies. Guild unions operate locally in most areas but are limited largely to issuing credentials and licenses. The right of workers to [[Strike action|strike]] is generally not respected by the state, and since 1979 strikes have often been met by [[police]] action.\nu\nThe comprehensive Labour Law covers all labour relations in Iran, including hiring of local and foreign staff. The Labour Law provides a very broad and inclusive definition of the individuals it covers, and written, oral, temporary and indefinite employment contracts are all recognised.\n\nThe Iranian Labour Law is very employee-friendly and makes it extremely difficult to lay off staff. Employing personnel on consecutive six-month contracts is illegal, as is dismissing staff without proof of a serious offence. Labour disputes are settled by a special labour council, which usually rules in favour of the employee.\n\nThe Labour Law provides the minimum standards an employer must adhere to when forming an employment relationship. The minimum age for workers in Iran is 15 years, but large sectors of the economy (including small businesses, agricultural concerns, and family-owned enterprises) are exempted.\n\n===Provisions of employment contract===\n{{see also| Economy of Iran#Labour force}}\nTo have a valid '''contract''' concluded under the Law, the following provisions must be included:<ref name=ILO>http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/WEBTEXT/21843/64830/E90IRN01.htm</ref>\n\n*1. Type of Work, vocation or duty that must be undertaken by the worker;\n*2. Basic compensation and supplements thereto;\n*3. Working hours, holidays and leaves;\n*4. Place of performance of duties;\n*5. Probationary period, if any;\n*6. Date of conclusion of contract;\n*7. Duration of employment; and\n*8. Any other terms and conditions required according to nature of employment.\n\nThe employer may require the employee to be subject to a probationary period. However, the probation time may not exceed one month for unskilled workers and three months for skilled and professional workers. During the probation period, either party may immediately terminate the employment relationship without cause or payment of severance pay. The only caveat being that if the employer terminates the relationship, he must pay the employee for the entire duration of the probation period.\n\n===Suspension of employment contract===\nThe fact that the employment contract can be suspended by an employee under certain conditions presents yet another challenge to employers. What this allows is suspension of the employment contract under the following conditions:<ref name=ILO/>\n\n*1. The period of military service (active, contingency and reserve), as well as voluntary enlistment during conflicts. This period shall be considered part of the employee's service record at place of employment;\n*2. The closure of a workshop or parts thereof due to force majeure;\n*3. Educational leave for up to four years; and\n*4. The period of detention that does not lead to conviction;\n\nOnce the conditions giving rise to the suspension of the contract are removed, the employer must allow for return of the employee to work. If the position is filled or eliminated, the employer is obligated to provide a similar position for the employee. Failure to do the above is considered wrongful discharge and subject to legal action.\n\n===Termination of employment contract===\nThe Law allows for termination of the employment contract only under the following instances:<ref name=ILO/>\n\n*1. Death of employee;\n*2. Retirement of employee;\n*3. Total disability of employee;\n*4. Expiration of the duration of the employment contract;\n*5. Conclusion of work in task specific contracts; and\n*6. Resignation of the employee.\n\nThe employer is bound to pay benefits under all of the above scenarios according to the years of service.\n\n===Dismissal of an employee===\nAn employee may only be dismissed upon approval of the Islamic Labour Council or the Labour Discretionary Board. Grounds for dismissal include an employee's neglect in carrying out his/her duties or violation of disciplinary by-laws of the employer. The employer must have provided written prior notice of the employee's violations. If the board is not convinced that the employee's dismissal is justified, the employer must reinstate the employee. Once an employee is dismissed, the employer is obligated to provide the legal [[severance package]].<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Severance & termination benefits===\nThe Law mandates the following compensation for terminated, disabled and suspended employee:<ref name=ILO/>\n\n*1. Suspended Employee - Where an employee is suspended without cause the employer must reinstate the employee and pay for all damages and compensation resulted from the wrongful suspension;\n*2. Terminated Employee - An employer is under legal obligation to provide thirty (30) days salary for every year of service for employees made redundant or retired;\n*3. Disabled Employee - The employer must pay 30 days salary for every year of service. Moreover, if disability of an employee is due to working conditions, the employer must pay 60 days salary for every year of employee's service period.\n\n===Working hours & overtime===\nThe workweek in Iran is based on a '''44-hour week'''. Typically, employees work from Saturday to Wednesday (8 hours per day) and half a day on Thursday (4 hours). Any hours worked beyond these will entitle the employee to overtime. The Law mandates a payment of 40% above the hourly wage to employees for any accrued overtime. The employee must consent to overtime work.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Holidays & leave===\n{{See also|Iranian calendar}}\nEmployees are entitled to leave on all official state holidays (approximately 22 days a year) and ''Fridays''. Any employee working during these holidays will be entitled to overtime pay. Additionally, employees are entitled to one-month holiday per annum. The annual leave for those employees engaged in hard and hazardous employment shall be five weeks per annum. Employees are entitled to save up to 9 days of their annual leave.<ref name=ILO/>\n\nIn case of termination, disability or redundancies, employees must be compensated for any accrued leave. Finally, employees are entitled to 3 days of paid vacation for marriage or death of a spouse, father, mother or child.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Maternity leave===\n{{see also|Social Security Organisation (Iran)}}\nWomen employees are entitled to 90 days of maternity leave. The employee's salary during maternity leave will be paid according to the provisions of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110903224522/http://www2.tamin.org.ir/web/sso-en/laws Social Security Act]. Maternity leave must be considered part of an employee's service record. Employers must provide returning employees with the same position.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Employment of foreign nationals===\n{{See also|Iranian citizens abroad|Human trafficking in Iran}}\nThe Law forbids employment of foreign nationals without a proper [[work permit]]. Diplomats, United Nations employees and foreign press reporters are exempt from this requirement. A work permit to a foreign national will be issued only if the following conditions are met:<ref name=ILO/>\n\n*1. Lack of expertise among Iranian nationals;\n*2. The foreign national being qualified for the position; and\n*3. The expertise of the foreign national will be used for training of, and later replacement by, Iranian individuals.\n\nWork permits will be issued, renewed or extended for a maximum period of one year. Moreover, no exit visa will be granted to the foreign national unless the national has paid all due taxes, duties, etc.<ref name=ILO/> (More info: [http://www.investiniran.ir/en/filepool/45?redirectpage=%2fen%2febook Employment of Foreign Nationals in Iran])\n\n====Exemption====\nA new law provides that workshops with less than five employees will not be subject to the labor laws.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Health care===\n{{Main|Health care in Iran}}\nThe [[Iranian constitution]] entitles Iranians to basic [[health care]], and most receive subsidised prescription [[drugs]] and [[vaccination]] programs. An extensive network of public clinics offers basic care at low cost, and general and specialist [[hospital]]s operated by the Ministry of Health provide higher levels of care. In most large cities, well-to-do persons use private [[clinics]] and hospitals that charge high fees. Specialised medical facilities are concentrated in urban areas, but rural communities have relatively good access to primary care physicians at clinics in [[villages]], where the government-sponsored primary health care system has raised the level of health education and prenatal care since the late 1990s.<ref name=ILO/>\n\n===Social protection===\n{{See also|Social Security Organisation (Iran)|Civil Servants Pension Organisation|Bonyad}}\nIran has a comprehensive [[social protection]] system with some 28 social insurance, social assistance, and disaster relief programmes benefiting large segments of the population. These programmes include training and job-search assistance, health and unemployment insurance, disability, old-age and survivorship pensions, and in kind- or in-kind transfers including subsidies (e.g., housing, food, energy), rehabilitation and other social services (e.g. long-term care services for the elderly), and even marriage and burial assistance.<ref name=ILO/>\n\nDespite significant achievements in human development and poverty reduction, serious challenges to growth call for reform.  While labour-market pressures continue to increase because of demographic dynamics and increased participation of women in the labour force, Iran\u2019s economy is still unable to generate enough needed jobs to absorb the new flows into the labour market and at the same time reduce unemployment extensively.\n\nIn addition to income tax, employers are required to contribute to the State [[Social security|Social Security]] Fund and the Employment Fund. For social security and [[unemployment insurance]], the employee pays 7% of salary (between the ages of 18-65), employer (20 to 23%), the State (3%). [[Independent business|Independent]] workers pay 12-18%, depending on the type of coverage sought.<ref name=\"socialsecurity.gov\">[https://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/ssptw/2004-2005/asia/iran.html U.S. Social Security Administration: Iran's entry] Retrieved October 14, 2010</ref>  In 2003 the minimum standard [[pension]] was 50 percent of the worker\u2019s earnings but not less than the amount of the minimum wage.\n\nThe [[social security]] makes it possible to ensure the employees against [[unemployment]], the [[disease]], old age ([[retirement]] [[pension]]), the occupational [[accident]]s.<ref name=\"socialsecurity.gov\"/>  Iran did not legislate in favour of a universal social protection, but in 1996, the Centre for statistics of Iran estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population was covered by Social Security. [[Social Security Organisation (Iran)|The Organisation of the social security]], managed by the [[Ministry of Welfare and Social Security (Iran)|Ministry of social protection]], delivers also family benefits and of [[maternity]] under certain conditions. Iran spent 22.5 percent of its 2003 national budget on social welfare programs. More than 50 percent of that amount covered pensions.\n\n[[Social welfare provision|Welfare]] programs for the needy are managed by more than 30 individual public agencies and semi-state organisations called [[Bonyad]], as well as by several private non-governmental organisations. In 2003 the government began to consolidate its welfare organisations in an effort to eliminate redundancy and inefficiency.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal| Iran| economy| society}}\n*[[Iranian Labour News Agency]]\n*[[List of trade unions#Iran|List of trade unions in Iran]]\n**[[Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company]]\n*[[Taxation in Iran]]\n*[[Economy of Iran]] (Including Labour force)\n*[[International rankings of Iran#Economy|International Rankings of Iran in Economy]]\n*[[List of major economic laws in Iran]]\n*{{Wikivoyage-inline|Iran}}\n*[[British labour law]]\n*[[Bonyad]] - Iran's foundations which control 20% of Iran's GDP.\n*[[Constitution of Iran]]\n*[[Government of Iran]]\n*[[Education in Iran]]\n*[[Iran's brain drain]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Araghi, E (2002), \"labor Law (1), Hoghogh Kar (1), \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \", In Persian Translated by Author, Tehran: Samt\n* Katozian, N.
