The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]], and invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs, but was surprised and heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Krasos]], where he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E. Gregory), pp. 567\u2013569}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}\n\nThis sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun, especially as he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year, which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories. As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]]. According to [[al-Tabari]], his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} These numbers are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era,{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} and about half as many as the estimated strength of the entire [[Byzantine army]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}} Although they\u2014and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] of 300,000 men\u2014are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative of the size of the Abbasid force.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|pp=661, 662 (note 5)}}  At the same time, a naval force under his admiral [[Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri]] was prepared to raid Cyprus.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}}\n\n[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Geophysical map of eastern Anatolia and northern Syria, showing the main fortresses during the Arab\u2013Byzantine frontier wars|Map of the Byzantine\u2013Arab frontier zone in southeastern [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid campaign of 806 took place]]\nThe huge invasion army departed Harun's residence of [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria on 11 June 806, with the Caliph at its head. Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to al-Tabari,\n{{quote|[Harun] ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging. The slave girl and the tent, together with its contents, vessels and fittings, were handed over to Nikephoros's envoy. He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested, and he further sent to him dates, dishes of jellied sweets, raisins and healing drugs.\"{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}}}\n\nNikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50,000 silver coins, 100 [[satin]] garments, 200 garments of fine [[brocade]], 12 [[falcon]]s, four hunting dogs, and three more horses.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}} But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn, the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[spread of Islam]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the [[Muslim world]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms.

The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3.

According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans.

Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]], and invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1. Historical background}} Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike\u2014a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a [[Elpidius (rebel)|Byzantine renegade]] warned the Abbasid governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] to \"throw away his [[silk]] and put on his armour\". In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs, but was surprised and heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Krasos]], where he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E. Gregory), pp. 567\u2013569}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}\n\nThis sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun, especially as he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year, which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories. As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]].

The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to al-Tabari,\n{{quote|[Harun] ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging. The slave girl and the tent, together with its contents, vessels and fittings, were handed over to Nikephoros's envoy. He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested, and he further sent to him dates, dishes of jellied sweets, raisins and healing drugs.\"{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}}}\n\nNikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50,000 silver coins, 100 [[satin]] garments, 200 garments of fine [[brocade]], 12 [[falcon]]s, four hunting dogs, and three more horses.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}} But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn, the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute. Theophanes records that Harun unexpectedly returned and seized Thebasa in retaliation, but this is not corroborated elsewhere.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}}\n\nThe Arabs did launch a series of retaliatory raids in the next year, but the spring raid under Yazid ibn Makhlad al-Hubayri al-Fazari was soundly defeated, with Yazid himself falling in the field. The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[spread of Islam]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the [[Muslim world]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms. Despite the sack of Herakleia, and its prominent treatment in Arab sources, no permanent result was achieved, as Nikephoros was quick to violate the terms of the truce.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}} According to the historian Warren Treadgold, if Harun had taken the advice offered by one of his lieutenants to proceed further west and sack a major city, he might have inflicted more long-lasting damage on Byzantium,{{efn|name=fn2}} but the Caliph's objectives were more limited: Harun was content with a show of force that would intimidate Nikephoros and prevent him from repeating the offensive of 805, and which bolstered his credentials as a champion of Islam.{{efn|name=fn1|In contrast with their Umayyad predecessors, the Abbasid caliphs pursued a conservative foreign policy. In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}}\n\nOn the other hand, the historian [[M. A. Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]]{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.\n* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)\n* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.\n* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.\n* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.\n\nInternal commands have also been improved:\n\n* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].\n* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>\n* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.\n* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}\n* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].\n* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.\n* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].\n* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Windows Terminal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\">{{Cite book |title=Showstopper!

In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.\n* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)\n* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.\n* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.\n* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.\n\nInternal commands have also been improved:\n\n* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].\n* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>\n* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.\n* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}\n* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].\n* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.\n* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].\n* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Windows Terminal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\">{{Cite book |title=Showstopper!

[[William John Murphy]], a native of [[New Hartford, New York]], who resided in the town of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in what was then known as the territory of Arizona, was in charge of building a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Arizona Canal]] from Granite Reef to New River for the Arizona Canal Company. In 1885, he completed the canal, which would bring water to the desert land.<ref name=\"M\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=30433|title=William J. Murphy Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref> Murphy was deep in debt, since he had agreed to be paid in Arizona Canal Company stock and bonds and land instead of cash.<ref name=\"SLRP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/reclamation/saltriver/|title=WaterHistory.org|website=www.waterhistory.org}}</ref>\n[[File:William John Murphy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William John Murphy \u2013 Founder of Glendale]]\nIn 1887, Murphy formed the Arizona Improvement Company. His objective was to sell the land and water rights south of the canal. Murphy had to raise capital from out of state sources in order to meet payroll and construction expenses.<ref name=\"SLRP\"/> Murphy decided to refer to this land as \"Glendale\". In order to develop and interest potential investors and settlers in this new town, Murphy decided to provide a better way of access from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] to Glendale and ending in the town of [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]] by building an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} diagonal road which he named Grand Avenue.\n\nIn 1891, Burgess Hadsell worked with Murphy to bring 70 Brethren and River Brethren families to Glendale to form a temperance colony. Soon settlers, attracted by the town's ban on alcoholic beverages, continued to arrive. In 1895, Murphy platted the original town site and amended the plat to include a town park and some business lots.  It was bounded by Lamar Road on the south, 55th Avenue on the east, Myrtle Avenue on the north, and 59th Avenue on the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.glendaleaz.com/economicdevelopment/documents/CCMP.pdf|title=Glendale City Center Master Plan|publisher=glendaleaz.com}}</ref> The construction of a railroad from Prescott to Phoenix was made possible with an exchange of the right-of-way made by Murphy along Grand Avenue.<ref name=\"M\"/>  The railroad allowed Glendale settlers to transport goods to the north and easily receive building materials.\n\nThe construction and commercial applications of the Beet Sugar Factory in 1906, also contributed to the growth of Glendale. Though the operations of the factory only lasted until 1913, it played an important role in the increase of immigrant and migrant settlers in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://molokane.org/molokan/Locations/Americas/Arizona/Noon.htm|title=Beet Sugar Factory History, Glendale, Arizona|website=molokane.org}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGlendale is located at {{Coord|33|32|19|N|112|11|11|W|type:city}} (33.538654, \u2212112.186261).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Phoenix weatherbox}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|55.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|55.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.13%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 1000\n|1920= 2737\n|1930= 3665\n|1940= 4855\n|1950= 8179\n|1960= 15893\n|1970= 36228\n|1980= 97172\n|1990= 147864\n|2000= 218812\n|2010= 226721\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=250702\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 226,710 people, 79,114 households, and 54,721 families residing in the city.

Both the Cardinals and bowl game moved from [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the [[Arizona State University]] campus in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]. Since opening, the facility has brought two [[Super Bowl]]s, three college football national championship games, the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four]], [[WrestleMania XXVI]] and [[International Champions Cup]] soccer to Glendale. Designed by architect Peter Eisenman, the stadium was featured on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] TV series, ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' because of its roll-out natural grass field.\n\n[[Gila River Arena]] (formerly Glendale Arena, then Jobing.com Arena) and [[Westgate City Center]] is adjacent to State Farm Stadium, and is the home of the [[Arizona Coyotes]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). It was also the home of the now defunct [[Arizona Sting]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL). The inaugural [[Street League Skateboarding]] event was held in the summer of 2010 in Glendale at the Gila River Arena. This street skateboarding competition returns to Glendale annually.\n\nIn 2009, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]]  of [[Major League Baseball]] began to share the new  [[Camelback Ranch|Camelback Ranch-Glendale]] spring training complex and stadium in Glendale owned and operated by the City of Glendale.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Glendale-1917 Nash Fire Truck.jpg|thumb|right|This 1917 Nash Fire Truck was the first motorized fire truck of the Glendale Fire Department.

[[William John Murphy]], a native of [[New Hartford, New York]], who resided in the town of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in what was then known as the territory of Arizona, was in charge of building a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Arizona Canal]] from Granite Reef to New River for the Arizona Canal Company. In 1885, he completed the canal, which would bring water to the desert land.<ref name=\"M\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=30433|title=William J. Murphy Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref> Murphy was deep in debt, since he had agreed to be paid in Arizona Canal Company stock and bonds and land instead of cash.<ref name=\"SLRP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/reclamation/saltriver/|title=WaterHistory.org|website=www.waterhistory.org}}</ref>\n[[File:William John Murphy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William John Murphy \u2013 Founder of Glendale]]\nIn 1887, Murphy formed the Arizona Improvement Company. His objective was to sell the land and water rights south of the canal. Murphy had to raise capital from out of state sources in order to meet payroll and construction expenses.<ref name=\"SLRP\"/> Murphy decided to refer to this land as \"Glendale\". In order to develop and interest potential investors and settlers in this new town, Murphy decided to provide a better way of access from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] to Glendale and ending in the town of [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]] by building an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} diagonal road which he named Grand Avenue.\n\nIn 1891, Burgess Hadsell worked with Murphy to bring 70 Brethren and River Brethren families to Glendale to form a temperance colony. Soon settlers, attracted by the town's ban on alcoholic beverages, continued to arrive. In 1895, Murphy platted the original town site and amended the plat to include a town park and some business lots.  It was bounded by Lamar Road on the south, 55th Avenue on the east, Myrtle Avenue on the north, and 59th Avenue on the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.glendaleaz.com/economicdevelopment/documents/CCMP.pdf|title=Glendale City Center Master Plan|publisher=glendaleaz.com}}</ref> The construction of a railroad from Prescott to Phoenix was made possible with an exchange of the right-of-way made by Murphy along Grand Avenue.<ref name=\"M\"/>  The railroad allowed Glendale settlers to transport goods to the north and easily receive building materials.\n\nThe construction and commercial applications of the Beet Sugar Factory in 1906, also contributed to the growth of Glendale. Though the operations of the factory only lasted until 1913, it played an important role in the increase of immigrant and migrant settlers in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://molokane.org/molokan/Locations/Americas/Arizona/Noon.htm|title=Beet Sugar Factory History, Glendale, Arizona|website=molokane.org}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGlendale is located at {{Coord|33|32|19|N|112|11|11|W|type:city}} (33.538654, \u2212112.186261).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Phoenix weatherbox}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|55.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|55.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.13%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 1000\n|1920= 2737\n|1930= 3665\n|1940= 4855\n|1950= 8179\n|1960= 15893\n|1970= 36228\n|1980= 97172\n|1990= 147864\n|2000= 218812\n|2010= 226721\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=250702\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 226,710 people, 79,114 households, and 54,721 families residing in the city.

Both venues are part of the Glendale Sports and Entertainment District development plan, meant to spur growth in the sparsely inhabited Yucca district. Both venues are owned by the City of Glendale.\n\nState Farm Stadium has been the home field of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in the [[National Football League]] since 2006, and the annual [[Fiesta Bowl]] college football game since 2007. Both the Cardinals and bowl game moved from [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the [[Arizona State University]] campus in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]. Since opening, the facility has brought two [[Super Bowl]]s, three college football national championship games, the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four]], [[WrestleMania XXVI]] and [[International Champions Cup]] soccer to Glendale. Designed by architect Peter Eisenman, the stadium was featured on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] TV series, ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' because of its roll-out natural grass field.\n\n[[Gila River Arena]] (formerly Glendale Arena, then Jobing.com Arena) and [[Westgate City Center]] is adjacent to State Farm Stadium, and is the home of the [[Arizona Coyotes]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). It was also the home of the now defunct [[Arizona Sting]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL). The inaugural [[Street League Skateboarding]] event was held in the summer of 2010 in Glendale at the Gila River Arena. This street skateboarding competition returns to Glendale annually.\n\nIn 2009, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]]  of [[Major League Baseball]] began to share the new  [[Camelback Ranch|Camelback Ranch-Glendale]] spring training complex and stadium in Glendale owned and operated by the City of Glendale.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Glendale-1917 Nash Fire Truck.jpg|thumb|right|This 1917 Nash Fire Truck was the first motorized fire truck of the Glendale Fire Department.

He died in 882 and was succeeded in all his territories, which encompassed most of [[East Francia]], by his younger brother, [[Charles the Fat]], already [[king of Italy]] and [[Carolingian emperor|emperor]].\n\n==Military youth==\nAs a young man, Louis was deployed in military operations against the [[Abodrites]] to the east in 858 and 862.<ref>Reuter, 72.</ref> In 854, at the invitation of the nobles of [[Aquitaine]] opposed to [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]], and coaxed by his father and his cousin [[Charles, Archbishop of Mainz]], he crossed into Gaul at the head of an army, intent on receiving the Aquitainian crown. He marched as far as [[Limoges]] before turning back.\n\nBack home, Louis forged close ties with the nobles of East Francia and became increasingly independent from his father. He engaged himself to the daughter of Count Adalard and, in 865, he and his brother Charles joined in rebellion against their father. This flirtation with revolt was brief, however, and Louis, Charles, and their father were reconciled later that year, though the elder Louis was forced to make a division of the remainder of his territories between his two sons. Carloman had already been given the ''[[Subkingdom (Monarchy)|subregulus]]'' of [[Bavaria]] in 864, now Louis received [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Franconia]] and Charles [[Alemannia]] and [[Rhaetia]].\n\nIn 869, Louis married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 885)|Liutgard of Saxony]], daughter of [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony]], at [[Aschaffenburg]]. Liutgard was a strong-willed and politically ambitious woman and later on spurred her husband to pursue ambitious goals. This match increased tensions between father and son and in 871 and in 873, Louis rebelled, but, on each occasion, he later reconciled with his father.\n\n==Rule in Saxony==\nUpon his father's death in 876, Louis fully inherited his subkingdoms, bearing the title ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\"). Louis the Younger considered himself the true heir of Louis the German and as his father died in 876, Louis buried him in the abbey of [[Lorsch]], in his own territories, in order to emphasise his primacy to his brothers. Louis also retained his father's chief advisor, [[Liutbert, Archbishop of Mainz|Liutbert]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. He and his brother ruled their kingdoms independently but cooperatively and never at war.\n\n===Acquisition of Lotharingia and Bavaria===\nLouis's rule was immediately threatened by Charles the Bald, who tried to annex the eastern parts of [[Lotharingia]] and maybe even to achieve supremacy over his nephew. Louis brought war on Charles and, on 8 October 876 at [[Andernach]], he defeated the much-larger host of West Francia. The East Frankish army displayed superiority in both unity and tactics, and the young king had even dressed his soldiers in white garments so that they appeared as an army of spirits.\n\nAfter this victory, Louis the German's three sons met in November at [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] to discuss the division of their father's kingdom and to have their hosts swear allegiance. According to the plan drawn up in 865, which their father, despite all his sons' rebellions, had confirmed in 872, Carloman received Bavaria, Charles Swabia, and Louis Saxony, Franconia, and Thuringia. Throughout his reign, though he is always called \"King of Saxony\" by historians, he never visited Saxony proper, though it formed the bulk of his territory. At the end of 877, the brothers assembled again to discuss the administration of their half of Lotharingia. After Carloman relinquished his claim, the realm was divided between Louis and Charles, who again met in September 878 in [[Alsace|Alsatia]]. In 879, Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke and named Louis as his successor (and erstwhile regent) in Bavaria. Louis received it outright a year later when Carloman expired.\n\nIn November 878 after the death of Charles the Bald, his heir, [[Louis the Stammerer]], and the latter's cousin Louis the Younger promised each other to respect the succession of their respective sons and to issue no claims contrary to that, at [[Voeren]] (''Fourons'' in [[French language|French]]). This Treaty of Fouron was soon put to the test, when Louis the Stammerer died in April 879. A party of western nobles led by [[Abbot Joscelin]] invited Louis the Younger to succeed to the rule of the western kingdom. Since his wife Liutgard also advocated heeding this call, Louis invaded West Francia. He marched as far as [[Verdun]], but after the new kings [[Louis III of France|Louis III]] and [[Carloman of France|Carloman]] ceded their part of [[Lotharingia]] to the invader, Louis retreated. In February 880, this gain was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Ribemont]], signed near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint Quentin]]. This treaty determined the border of the two kingdoms, which was to remain unchanged until the fourteenth century.\n\n===Relationship with the nobility===\nIn contrast to his father, Louis the Younger preferred reconciling royal interests with those of the nobility and avoided confrontation. He managed to bind powerful families to the king, including the [[Ottonian|Liudovingian]] relatives of his wife, that later themselves became kings and emperors. Louis mostly stayed in the [[Rhineland]], avoiding Saxony or his eastern borders. Louis did visit Bavaria on two occasions, but mostly left it to the government of his illegitimate nephew, Carloman's son, [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], [[Duke of Carinthia]].<ref>As \"prefect of the marches.\" Bowlus, 569.</ref>\n\n===Viking incursions===\nSince the summer of 879, [[Vikings]] had been increasing their attacks on the Frankish kingdom and occasionally penetrated deeply into the interior of the land. Louis's kingdom was the most hard-hit after that of West Francia. In February 880, Louis confronted and defeated a [[Norsemen|Norse]] host at the [[Battle of Thimeon]] (near modern [[Charleroi]]).{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} His son Hugh, however, was killed in this battle.{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} The next year, Louis defeated the [[Norsemen|Norse]] again at the [[Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu|battle of Saucourt]].{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=235}} Louis also drove the Norse out of the royal palace of [[Nijmegen]], which they had occupied. In the same month, a Saxon host commanded by [[Brun, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bruno]], the king's brother-in-law, suffered a heavy defeat near [[Hamburg]] and Bruno and many other Saxon nobles fell.\n\n==Death and succession==\nLouis fell sick in 881 and died in [[Frankfurt]] on 20 January 882. He was buried beside his father in the abbey of Lorsch. By his wife Liutgard of Saxony, he had had a son called Louis (877&ndash;879), who died in a fall from a palace window, and a daughter called Hildegard (878&ndash;895). Louis had also fathered an illegitimate son, Hugh (855/60 \u2013 February 880), either with the daughter of Adalard or with an earlier concubine. Since he left no heir, all his territories fell to his brother Charles, who thus could reunite the entire East Frankish kingdom. Hildegard later joined with the Bavarian magnate [[Engeldeo]] in conspiring against [[Arnulf of Carinthia|King Arnulf]] and was deprived of her \"public honours\" in 895, according to the ''[[Annals of Fulda]]''.\n\n== Family ==\nLouis the Younger married Liutgard, a daughter of Duke [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony|Liudolf of Saxony]], who was grandfather of King [[Henry I of Germany]].\n\n* [[Louis of Saxony|Louis]] (876 - November 879)\n* Hildegard (875/878 or 881 - after 900)\n* Bernhart\n* [[Hugo (Son of Louis the Younger)|Hugo]] (ca. 855/860 - February 880), illegitimate son{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}}\n* Adalhard, illegitimate son\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kings of Germany family tree]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Charles Oman|Oman, Charles]].

He died in 882 and was succeeded in all his territories, which encompassed most of [[East Francia]], by his younger brother, [[Charles the Fat]], already [[king of Italy]] and [[Carolingian emperor|emperor]].\n\n==Military youth==\nAs a young man, Louis was deployed in military operations against the [[Abodrites]] to the east in 858 and 862.<ref>Reuter, 72.</ref> In 854, at the invitation of the nobles of [[Aquitaine]] opposed to [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]], and coaxed by his father and his cousin [[Charles, Archbishop of Mainz]], he crossed into Gaul at the head of an army, intent on receiving the Aquitainian crown. He marched as far as [[Limoges]] before turning back.\n\nBack home, Louis forged close ties with the nobles of East Francia and became increasingly independent from his father. He engaged himself to the daughter of Count Adalard and, in 865, he and his brother Charles joined in rebellion against their father. This flirtation with revolt was brief, however, and Louis, Charles, and their father were reconciled later that year, though the elder Louis was forced to make a division of the remainder of his territories between his two sons. Carloman had already been given the ''[[Subkingdom (Monarchy)|subregulus]]'' of [[Bavaria]] in 864, now Louis received [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Franconia]] and Charles [[Alemannia]] and [[Rhaetia]].\n\nIn 869, Louis married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 885)|Liutgard of Saxony]], daughter of [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony]], at [[Aschaffenburg]]. Liutgard was a strong-willed and politically ambitious woman and later on spurred her husband to pursue ambitious goals. This match increased tensions between father and son and in 871 and in 873, Louis rebelled, but, on each occasion, he later reconciled with his father.\n\n==Rule in Saxony==\nUpon his father's death in 876, Louis fully inherited his subkingdoms, bearing the title ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\"). Louis the Younger considered himself the true heir of Louis the German and as his father died in 876, Louis buried him in the abbey of [[Lorsch]], in his own territories, in order to emphasise his primacy to his brothers. Louis also retained his father's chief advisor, [[Liutbert, Archbishop of Mainz|Liutbert]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. He and his brother ruled their kingdoms independently but cooperatively and never at war.\n\n===Acquisition of Lotharingia and Bavaria===\nLouis's rule was immediately threatened by Charles the Bald, who tried to annex the eastern parts of [[Lotharingia]] and maybe even to achieve supremacy over his nephew. Louis brought war on Charles and, on 8 October 876 at [[Andernach]], he defeated the much-larger host of West Francia. The East Frankish army displayed superiority in both unity and tactics, and the young king had even dressed his soldiers in white garments so that they appeared as an army of spirits.\n\nAfter this victory, Louis the German's three sons met in November at [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] to discuss the division of their father's kingdom and to have their hosts swear allegiance. According to the plan drawn up in 865, which their father, despite all his sons' rebellions, had confirmed in 872, Carloman received Bavaria, Charles Swabia, and Louis Saxony, Franconia, and Thuringia. Throughout his reign, though he is always called \"King of Saxony\" by historians, he never visited Saxony proper, though it formed the bulk of his territory. At the end of 877, the brothers assembled again to discuss the administration of their half of Lotharingia. After Carloman relinquished his claim, the realm was divided between Louis and Charles, who again met in September 878 in [[Alsace|Alsatia]]. In 879, Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke and named Louis as his successor (and erstwhile regent) in Bavaria.
