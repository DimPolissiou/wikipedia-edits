Retrieved 19 April 2009</ref> From 1 May 1850 to 24 August 1866 he was also President of the [[German Confederation]]. He was the longest-reigning Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, as well as the fourth-longest-reigning monarch of any country in European history, after [[Louis XIV of France]], [[Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann II of Liechtenstein]], and [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand]], in descending chronological order.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=1}}\n\nIn December 1848, [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Emperor Ferdinand]] abdicated the throne at [[Olomouc]], as part of [[Minister President]] [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Felix zu Schwarzenberg]]'s plan to end the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Hungary. This allowed Ferdinand's nephew Franz Joseph to accede to the throne. Largely considered to be a [[reactionary]], Franz Joseph spent his early reign resisting [[constitutionalism]] in his domains. The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and most of its claim to [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Lombardy\u2013Venetia]] to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], following the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] in 1859 and the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in 1866. Although Franz Joseph ceded no territory to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] after the Austrian defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] (23 August 1866) settled the [[German Question]] in favour of Prussia, which prevented the [[Unification of Germany]] from occurring under the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|House of Habsburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/franz-joseph-of-austria|title=Gale Encyclopedia of Biography: '&#39;Francis Joseph'&#39;|publisher=Answers.com|date=|accessdate=2013-12-02}}</ref>\n\nFranz Joseph was troubled by nationalism during his entire reign. He concluded the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], which granted greater autonomy to [[Hungary]] and transformed the Austrian Empire into the [[Dual Monarchy]] of Austria-Hungary. He ruled peacefully for the next 45 years, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother, the [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian of Mexico]] in 1867, the [[Mayerling incident|suicide of his only son]] and heir-apparent, [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]], in 1889, the [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria#Assassination|assassination of his wife]], [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth]] (\"Sisi\"), in 1898, and the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassination of his nephew and heir-presumptive]], the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in 1914.\n\nAfter the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Austria-Hungary turned its attention to the [[Balkans]], which was a hotspot of international tension because of conflicting interests with the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Bosnian Crisis]] was a result of Franz Joseph's annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908, which had been [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupied by his troops]] since the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878).\n\nOn 28 June 1914, the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of his nephew and heir-presumptive, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in [[Sarajevo]] resulted in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which was an ally of the [[Russian Empire]]. That activated a system of alliances which resulted in [[World War I]].\n\nFranz Joseph died on 21 November 1916, after ruling his domains for almost 68 years as one of the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning monarchs in modern history]]. He was succeeded by his grandnephew [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Sophiebayern franzjoseph.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Franz Joseph and his mother [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria|Archduchess Sophie]]. Painting by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]].]]\nFranz Joseph was born in the [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] in [[Vienna]] (on the 65th anniversary of the death of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor | Francis of Lorraine]]) as the eldest son of [[Archduke Franz Karl of Austria| Archduke Franz Karl]] (the younger son of [[Francis II of Austria |Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]]), and his wife [[Sophie, Princess of Bavaria|Princess Sophie of Bavaria]]. Because his uncle, reigning from 1835 as the Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria| Ferdinand]], was weak-minded, and his father unambitious and retiring, the mother of the young Archduke \"Franzl\" brought him up as a future Emperor, with emphasis on devotion, responsibility and diligence.\n\nFranzl came to idolise his grandfather, ''der Gute Kaiser Franz'', who had died shortly before the former's fifth birthday, as the ideal monarch. At the age of thirteen, Franzl started a career as a colonel in the Austrian army. From that point onward, army style dictated his personal fashion - for the rest of his life he normally wore the uniform of a military officer.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p= 61}} Franz Joseph was soon joined by three younger brothers: Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian (born 1832, the future [[Maximilian of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]] of [[Second Mexican Empire |Mexico]]); [[Archduke Charles Louis of Austria| Archduke Karl Ludwig]] (born 1833, father of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]), and [[Archduke Ludwig Viktor]] (born 1842), and a sister, [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1835\u20131840) |Maria Anna]] (born 1835), who died at the age of four.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=101}}\n\n==Revolutions of 1848==\n{{Main|revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Hungarian Revolution of 1848}}\n\nDuring the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]] the [[List of heads of government under Austrian Emperors | Austrian Chancellor]] [[Prince Metternich]] resigned (March-April 1848). The young Archduke, who (it was widely expected) would soon succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of [[Bohemia]] on 6 April 1848, but never took up the post. Sent instead to the [[First Italian War of Independence | front in Italy]], he joined [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz |Field Marshal Radetzky]] on campaign on 29 April, receiving his [[baptism of fire]] on 5 May at [[Battle of Santa Lucia|Santa Lucia]].\n[[File:Peter Fendi - The Evening Prayer, 1839 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The painting depicts the family of Franz Joseph gathered in prayer, 1839]]\nBy all accounts he handled his first military experience calmly and with dignity. Around the same time, the Imperial Family was fleeing revolutionary Vienna for the calmer setting of [[Innsbruck]], in [[County of Tyrol  |Tyrol]]. Called back from Italy, the Archduke joined the rest of his family at Innsbruck by mid-June. At Innsbruck at this time Franz Joseph first met his cousin Elisabeth, his future bride, then a girl of ten, but apparently the meeting made little impression.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=33}}\n\nFollowing Austria's victory over the Italians at [[Battle of Custoza (1848)| Custoza]] in late July 1848, the court felt it safe to return to Vienna, and Franz Joseph travelled with them. But within a few weeks Vienna again appeared unsafe, and in September the court left once more, this time for [[Olomouc]] (Olm\u00fctz) in [[Moravia]]. By now, [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz |Prince Alfred I]] of [[Windisch-Graetz |Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]], an influential military commander in Bohemia, was determined to see the young Archduke soon put on the throne. It was thought{{by whom?|date=October 2019}} that a new ruler would not be bound by the oaths to respect constitutional government to which Ferdinand had been forced to agree, and that it was necessary to find a young, energetic emperor to replace the kindly, but mentally unfit Ferdinand.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p= 8}}\n\nBy the abdication of his uncle Ferdinand and the renunciation of his father (the mild-mannered Franz Karl) Franz Joseph succeeded as Emperor of Austria at Olomouc on 2 December. At this time he first became known by his second as well as his first Christian name. The name \"Franz Joseph\" was chosen{{by whom?|date=October 2019}} to bring back memories of the new Emperor's great-granduncle, Emperor [[Josef II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (Holy Roman Emperor from 1765 to 1790), remembered as a modernising reformer.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p= 6}}\n\n\nUnder the guidance of the new prime minister [[Felix Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] the Third, the new emperor at first pursued a cautious course, granting a constitution in early 1849. At the same time, a military campaign was necessary against the Hungarians, who had [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|rebelled against Habsburg central authority]] in the name of their ancient constitution. Franz Joseph was also almost immediately faced with a renewal of the [[First Italian War of Independence|fighting in Italy]], with King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] taking advantage of setbacks in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] to resume the war in March 1849.\n[[File:Gy\u0151ri csata.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Gy\u0151r]] on 28 June 1849. Franz Joseph enters in [[Gy\u0151r]] leading the Austrian troops.]]\nHowever, the military tide began to swiftly turn in favor of Franz Joseph and the Austrian whitecoats. Almost immediately, Charles Albert was decisively beaten by Radetzky at [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Novara]] and forced to sue for peace, as well as to renounce his throne. \n\n\n===Revolution in Hungary===\nThe crucial turning point of the Hungarian events were the [[April laws]] which was ratified by King Ferdinand, however the new young Austrian monarch Francis Joseph arbitrarily \"revoked\" the laws without any legal competence. This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Francis Joseph. The new constrained [[Stadion Constitution]] of Austria, the revoke of the April laws and the Austrian military campaign against Kingdom of Hungary resulted in the fall of the pacifist [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny government]] (who searched agreement with the court) and led to the sudden emergence of [[Lajos Kossuth]]'s followers in the [[Diet of Hungary|Hungarian parliament]], who demanded the full independence of Hungary. The Austrian military intervention in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] resulted in strong anti-Habsburg sentiment among Hungarians, thus the events in Hungary grew into a war for total [[independence]] from the [[Habsburg dynasty]].\n\nIn Hungary, the situation was more severe and Austrian defeat seemed imminent. Sensing a need to secure his right to rule, Franz Joseph sought help from Russia, requesting the intervention of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]], in order \"to prevent the Hungarian insurrection developing into a European calamity\".<ref>Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette, Purdue University Press, 1976. p. 35.</ref>\n\n\nRussian troops entered Hungary in support of the Austrians and the revolution was crushed by late summer of 1849. With order now restored throughout his Empire, Franz Joseph felt free to renege on the constitutional concessions he had made, especially as the Austrian parliament meeting at [[Kremsier]] had behaved\u2014in the young Emperor's eyes\u2014abominably. The 1849 constitution was suspended, and a policy of absolutist centralism was established, guided by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Bach]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=41}}\n\n===Assassination attempt in 1853===\n[[File:J.Reiner - Attentat auf Kaiser Franz Joseph.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Assassination attempt on the emperor, 1853]]\nOn 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an assassination attempt by [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungarian nationalist]] J\u00e1nos Lib\u00e9nyi.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}} The emperor was taking a stroll with one of his officers, Count [[Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell]], on a city [[bastion]], when Lib\u00e9nyi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck. Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O'Donnell struck Lib\u00e9nyi down with his sabre.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}}\n\nO'Donnell, hitherto only a Count by virtue of his Irish nobility (as a descendant of the Irish noble dynasty [[O'Donnell of Tyrconnell]]),<ref>''O'Domhnaill Abu \u2013 [[O'Donnell]] Clan Newsletter'' no. 7, Spring 1987 (ISSN 0790-7389))</ref> was made a Count of the [[Habsburg]] Empire (''[[Reichsgraf]]''). Another witness who happened to be nearby, the butcher Joseph Ettenreich, swiftly overpowered Lib\u00e9nyi. For his deed he was later elevated to the nobility by the Emperor and became Joseph von Ettenreich. Lib\u00e9nyi was subsequently put on trial and condemned to death for attempted [[regicide]]. He was executed on the Simmeringer Heide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simmeringerhaide.at/chronik.html|title=Kleingartenanlage Simmeringer Haide|last=Decker|first=Wolfgang|website=www.simmeringerhaide.at|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref>\n\nAfter this unsuccessful attack, the Emperor's brother [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian]], later Emperor of [[Mexico]], called upon Europe's royal families for donations to construct a new church on the site of the attack. The church was to be a [[votive offering]] for the survival of the Emperor. It is located on [[Ringstra\u00dfe]] in the district of [[Alsergrund]] close to the [[University of Vienna]], and is known as the [[Votivkirche]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}} The survival of Franz Joseph was also commemorated  in Prague by erecting a new [[Statue of Francis of Assisi, Charles Bridge|statue of St. Francis of Assisi]], the patron saint of the emperor, on [[Charles Bridge]].

Under Schwarzenberg's guidance, Austria was able to stymie [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] scheming to create a new German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria. After Schwarzenberg's premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the Emperor himself effectively took over as prime minister.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=41}}\n\n\n\n===Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867===\n{{Main|Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867}}\n[[File:Ferenc J\u00f3zsef koron\u00e1z\u00e1sa Bud\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Franz Joseph's coronation as Apostolic King of Hungary.

Painting by [[Eduard von Engerth]] for the Bohemian Diet, 1861.]]\nFollowing the accession of Franz Joseph to the throne in 1848, the political representatives of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] hoped and insisted that account should be taken of their historical state rights in the upcoming constitution. They felt the position of [[Bohemia]] within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] should have been highlighted by a [[Coronation of the Bohemian monarch|coronation of the new ruler to the king of Bohemia]] in Prague (the last coronation took place in 1836). However before the 19th century the Habsburgs had ruled Bohemia by hereditary right and a separate coronation was not deemed necessary.\n\nHis new government installed the system of [[neoabsolutism]] in Austrian internal affairs to make the Austrian Empire a unitary, centralised and bureaucratically administered state. When Franz Joseph returned to constitutional rule after the debacles in Italy at [[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]] and [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]] and summoned the diets of his lands, the question of his coronation as king of Bohemia again returned to the agenda, as it had not since 1848. On 14 April 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph received a delegation from the Bohemian Diet with his words (in Czech):\n\n{{quote|\"I will have myself crowned King of Bohemia in Prague, and I am convinced that a new, indissoluble bond of trust and loyalty between My throne and My Bohemian Kingdom will be strengthened by this holy rite.\"<ref name=\"lecaine\">{{cite book|last1=Le Caine Agnew|first1=Hugh|editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=Laurence|editor2-last=Unowsky|editor2-first=Daniel L.|title=The limits of loyalty : imperial symbolism, popular allegiances, and state patriotism in the late Habsburg monarchy|date=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781845452025|pages=86\u2013112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_SOie5SJQwC&dq=|accessdate=17 November 2016|language=en|chapter=The Flyspecks on Palivec's Portrait: Franz Joseph, the Symbols of Monarchy, and Czech Popular Loyalty}}</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast to his predecessor Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]] (who spent the rest of his life after his abdication in 1848 in Bohemia and especially in Prague), Franz Joseph was never crowned separately as king of Bohemia. In 1861, the negotiations failed because of unsolved constitutional problems. However in 1866, a visit of the monarch to Prague following the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|defeat at Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 (K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz)]] was a huge success, testified by the considerable numbers of new photographs taken.\n\n[[File:L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Portrait of Franz Joseph I 1899.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1899]]\nIn 1867, the Austro-Hungarian compromise and the introduction of the dual monarchy left the Czechs and their aristocracy without the recognition of separate Bohemian state rights for which they had hoped. Bohemia remained Austrian Crown Lands. In Bohemia, opposition to dualism took the form of isolated street demonstrations, resolutions from district representations, and even open air mass protest meetings, confined to the biggest cities, such as Prague. The Czech newspaper ''[[N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy]]'', complained that the Czechs had not yet been compensated for their wartime losses and sufferings during the Austro-Prussian War, and had just seen their historic state rights tossed aside and their land subsumed into the \"other\" half of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, commonly called \"[[Cisleithania]]\".<ref name=\"lecaine\"/>\n\nThe Czech hopes were revived again in 1870\u20131871. In an Imperial Rescript of 26 September 1870, Franz Joseph referred again to the prestige and glory of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] and to his intention to hold a coronation. Under Minister-President [[Karl Hohenwart]] in 1871, the government of Cisleithania negotiated a series of fundamental articles spelling out the relationship of the Bohemian Crown to the rest of the Habsburg Monarchy. On 12 September 1871, Franz Joseph announced:\n\n{{quote|Having in mind the constitutional position of the Bohemian Crown and being conscious of the glory and power which that Crown has given us '''and our predecessors''\u2026 we gladly recognise the rights of the kingdom and are prepared to renew that recognition through our coronation oath.<ref name=\"lecaine\"/>}}\n\nFor the planned coronation, the composer [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]] had written the opera ''[[Libu\u0161e (opera)|Libu\u0161e]]'', but the ceremony did not take place. The creation of the [[German Empire]], domestic opposition from German-speaking liberals (especially [[Sudeten Germans|German-Bohemians]]) and from Hungarians doomed the [[Fundamental Articles of 1871|Fundamental Articles]]. Hohenwart resigned and nothing changed.\n\nMany Czech people were waiting for political changes in monarchy, including [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] and others. Masaryk served in the ''Reichsrat'' (Upper House) from 1891 to 1893 in the [[Young Czech Party]] and again from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Realist Party|Realist Party]] (which he had founded in 1900), but he did not campaign for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. In Vienna in 1909 he helped [[Hinko Hinkovi\u0107]]'s defense in the fabricated trial against prominent Croats and Serbs members of the Serbo-Croatian Coalition (such as [[Frano Supilo]] and [[Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107]]), and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties. The Bohemian question would remain unresolved for the entirety of Franz Joseph's reign.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n[[File:Francesco Giuseppe fra le truppe a Solferino 1859.jpg|thumb|Franz Joseph among his troops at [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]], fought during the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] of 1859]]\n\n===The German question===\n[[File:Fuerstentag Frankfurt 1863 263-022.jpg|thumb|Emperor Franz Joseph (centre in white uniform) at the [[German Confederation|Congress of German princes]] in [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], 1863]]\nThe main foreign policy goal of Franz Joseph had been the [[unification of Germany]] under the [[House of Habsburg]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=149}} This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 to the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, with only one period of interruption under the [[Wittelsbach]]s, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=150}} However, Franz Joseph's desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg [[Austrian Empire]] in the event of German unification proved problematic.\n\nTwo factions quickly developed: a party of German intellectuals favouring a [[Greater Germany]] (''Gro\u00dfdeutschland'') under the House of Habsburg; the other favouring a [[Lesser Germany]] (''Kleindeutschland''). The Greater Germans favoured the inclusion of Austria in a new all-German state on the grounds that Austria had always been a part of Germanic empires, that it was the leading power of the [[German Confederation]], and that it would be absurd to exclude eight million Austrian Germans from an all-German nation state. The champions of a lesser Germany argued against the inclusion of Austria on the grounds that it was a multi-nation state, not a German one, and that its inclusion would bring millions of non-Germans into the German nation state.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}}\n\nIf Greater Germany were to prevail, the crown would necessarily have to go to Franz Joseph, who had no desire to cede it in the first place to anyone else.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}} On the other hand, if the idea of a smaller Germany won out, the German crown could of course not possibly go to the [[Emperor of Austria]], but would naturally be offered to the head of the largest and most powerful German state outside of Austria\u2014the [[King of Prussia]]. The contest between the two ideas, quickly developed into a contest between Austria and [[Prussia]]. After Prussia decisively won the [[Seven Weeks War]], this question was solved; Austria lost no territories as long as they remained out of German affairs.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}}\n\nFranz Joseph's German identity was made explicitly clear during a meeting in August 1908 between himself and [[Edward VII]] when the latter tried to persuade him to abandon Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany for co-operation with England; Franz Joseph replied that he was a \"loyal ally\" and said \"I am a German prince.\"<ref>\"Sir, ich bin ein deutscher F\u00fcrst.\" Walter Wiltschegg: \u00d6sterreich, der \"zweite deutsche Staat\"?: der nationale Gedanke in der Ersten Republik, Stocker, p. 41.

Tsar Alexander II of Russia, wanting to intervene against the Ottomans, sought and obtained an agreement with Austria-Hungary.\n\nIn the Budapest Conventions of 1877, the two powers agreed that Russia would annex [[Bessarabia]], and Austria-Hungary would observe a benevolent neutrality toward Russia in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|pending war]] with the Turks. As compensation for this support, Russia agreed to Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=16}} A scant 15 months later, the Russians imposed on the Ottomans the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which reneged on the Budapest accord and declared that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be jointly occupied by Russian and Austrian troops.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=16}}\n\nThe treaty was overturned by the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which allowed sole [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] but did not specify a final disposition of the provinces.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} That omission was addressed in the Three Emperors' League agreement of 1881, when both Germany and Russia endorsed Austria's right to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=37}} However, by 1897, under a new tsar, the Russian Imperial government had again withdrawn its support for Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian foreign minister, Count Michael Muraviev, stated that an Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina would raise \"an extensive question requiring special scrutiny\".{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=94}}\n\nIn 1908, the Russian foreign minister, [[Alexander Izvolsky]], offered Russian support, for the third time, for the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, in exchange for Austrian support for the opening of the [[Bosporus Strait]] and the [[Dardanelles]] to Russian warships. Austria's foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Alois von Aehrenthal]], pursued this offer vigorously, resulting in the quid pro quo understanding with Izvolsky, reached on 16 September 1908 at the Buchlau Conference. However, Izvolsky made this agreement with Aehrenthal without the knowledge of [[Tsar Nicholas II]] or his government in St. Petersburg, or any of the other foreign powers including Britain, France and Serbia.\n\nBased upon the assurances of the Buchlau Conference and the treaties that preceded it, Franz Joseph signed the proclamation announcing the [[annexation]] of Bosnia-Herzegovina into the Empire on 6 October 1908. However a diplomatic crisis erupted, as both the Serbs and the Italians demanded compensation for the annexation, which the Austro-Hungarian government refused to entertain. The incident was not resolved until the revision of the Treaty of Berlin in April 1909, exacerbating tensions between Austria-Hungary and the Serbs.\n\n==Outbreak of World War I==\n{{Main|July Crisis}}\n[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|240px|Rival military coalitions in 1914: [[Triple Entente]] in green; [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in brown.]]\nOn 28 June 1914 Franz Joseph's nephew and heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], and his [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]], were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Yugoslav nationalist of Serbian ethnicity,<ref>{{cite book|author=Dejan Djoki\u0107|title=Yugoslavism: Histories of a Failed Idea, 1918\u20131992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMyZdvTympMC|date=January 2003|publisher=C.

Initial decision-making during the \"July Crisis\" fell to [[Count Leopold Berchtold]], the Austrian foreign minister; [[Count Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], the chief of staff for the Austro-Hungarian army and the other ministers.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=328}} The ultimate resolution of deliberations by the Austrian government during the weeks following the assassination of the Archduke was to give Serbia [[July Crisis#Austro-Hungarian ultimatum|an ultimatum]] of itemized demands with which it was virtually certain Serbia would be unable or unwilling to comply, thus serving as a \"legal basis for war.\"\n\nHowever, the general movement toward war with Serbia was already in motion prior to assassination of the Archduke as evidenced by a 14 June memo of Berchtold recommending the \"elimination of Serbia\" as a state, which Franz Josef [[July Crisis#Germany and war|expressed agreement with]] in a letter delivered to Kaiser Wilhelm II in Berlin on 5 July. In that letter, Franz Josef \"...explicitly stated that the decision for war against Serbia had been made before the assassination of the Archduke, and that the events of Sarajevo only confirmed the already pre-existing need for a war.\"\n\nA week after delivery of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia, on 28 July, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Within weeks, the Germans, Russians, French and British had all entered the fray which eventually became known as [[World War I]]. On 6 August, Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war against Russia.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Funeral Franz-Joseph.webm|thumb|right|Film of the funeral procession of Franz Joseph]]\nFranz Joseph died in the [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] on the evening of 21 November 1916, at the age of 86.

Sophie wanted to strengthen the relationship between the Houses of [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|Habsburg]] and [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]]\u2014descending from the latter house herself\u2014and hoped to match Franz Joseph with her sister [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria|Ludovika's]] eldest daughter, [[Duchess Helene in Bavaria|Helene]] (\"N\u00e9n\u00e9\"), who was four years the Emperor's junior.\n\nHowever, Franz Joseph fell deeply in love with N\u00e9n\u00e9's younger sister [[Elizabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth]] (\"Sisi\"), a beautiful girl of fifteen, and insisted on marrying her instead. Sophie acquiesced, despite her misgivings about Sisi's appropriateness as an imperial consort, and the young couple were married on 24 April 1854 in [[Augustinian Church, Vienna|St. Augustine's Church]], Vienna.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=242}}\n\n[[File:MAraige de Sissi et Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph.png|thumb|Marriage of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth]]\nTheir marriage would eventually prove to be an unhappy one; though Franz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, the feeling was not mutual. Elisabeth never truly acclimatized to life at court, and was frequently in conflict with the imperial family. Their first daughter Sophie died as an infant, and their only son [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Rudolf]] died by suicide in 1889 in the infamous [[Mayerling Incident]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=127}}\n\nIn 1885 Franz Joseph met [[Katharina Schratt]], a leading actress of the Vienna stage, and she became his friend and confidante. This relationship lasted the rest of his life, and was\u2014to a certain degree\u2014tolerated by Elisabeth. Franz Joseph built Villa Schratt in [[Bad Ischl]] for her, and also provided her with a small palace in Vienna.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=120}} Though their relationship lasted for thirty-four years, it remained platonic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Frederic|title=Thunder at Twilight: Vienna 1913/1914|url=https://archive.org/details/thunderattwiligh00mort|url-access=registration|year=1989|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thunderattwiligh00mort/page/85 85\u201386]}}</ref>\n\nThe Empress was an inveterate traveller, horsewoman, and fashion ''maven'' who was rarely seen in Vienna. Sisi was obsessed about preserving her beauty, carrying out many bizarre routines and strenuous exercise, and as a result suffered from ill health. She was [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria#assassination|stabbed to death]] by [[Luigi Lucheni|an Italian anarchist]] in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva. A few days after the funeral, [[Robert I, Duke of Parma|Robert of Parma]] wrote in a letter to his friend [[Tirso de Olaz\u00e1bal y Lardiz\u00e1bal|Tirso de Olaz\u00e1bal]] that \"It was pitiful to look at the Emperor, he showed a great deal of energy in his immense pain, but at times one could see all the immensity of his grief.\"<ref>The letter is available [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Letter_from_Robert,_Duke_of_Parma,_to_Tirso_de_Olaz%C3%A1bal_(Sep._1898).pdf here]</ref> Franz Joseph never fully recovered from the loss. According to the future empress [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]] he told his relatives: \"You'll never know how important she was to me\" or, according to some sources, \"You will never know how much I loved this woman.\"{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=117}}\n\n===Relationship with Franz Ferdinand===\n[[File:Kaiser Franz Joseph I. and Otto (15.09.1914).jpg|thumb|upright|The emperor and his great-grandnephew [[Otto von Habsburg]], in 1914]]\n[[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] became [[heir presumptive]] (''Thronfolger'') to the throne of Austria-Hungary in 1896, after the deaths of his cousin Rudolf (in 1889) and his father Karl Ludwig (in 1896). The relationship between him and Franz Joseph had always been a fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Countess Sophie Chotek]], a match that was out of the question in the mind of the emperor, as Sophie was merely of nobility as opposed to being of dynastic rank.\n\nAlthough the emperor received letters from members of the imperial family throughout the fall and winter of 1899 importuning him to relent, Franz Joseph stood his ground.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=288}} He finally gave his consent in 1900; however, the marriage was to be [[Morganatic marriage|morganatic]], and any children of the marriage would be ineligible to succeed to the throne.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=289}} The couple were married on 1 July 1900 at [[Z\u00e1kupy|Reichstadt]]. The emperor did not attend the wedding, nor did any of the archdukes. After that, the two men disliked and distrusted each other.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=120}}\n\nFollowing the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and Sophie in 1914, Franz Joseph's daughter, Marie Valerie, noted that her father expressed his greater confidence in the new heir presumptive: his grandnephew Archduke Charles.

November 1916) was [[Emperor of Austria]], [[Apostolic King of Hungary|King of Hungary]], [[King of Bohemia]], and monarch of many other states of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], from 2 December 1848 until his death.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/216776/Francis-Joseph Francis Joseph], in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. Retrieved 19 April 2009</ref> From 1 May 1850 to 24 August 1866 he was also President of the [[German Confederation]]. He was the longest-reigning Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, as well as the fourth-longest-reigning monarch of any country in European history, after [[Louis XIV of France]], [[Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann II of Liechtenstein]], and [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand]], in descending chronological order.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=1}}\n\nIn December 1848, [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Emperor Ferdinand]] abdicated the throne at [[Olomouc]], as part of [[Minister President]] [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Felix zu Schwarzenberg]]'s plan to end the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Hungary. This allowed Ferdinand's nephew Franz Joseph to accede to the throne. Largely considered to be a [[reactionary]], Franz Joseph spent his early reign resisting [[constitutionalism]] in his domains. The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and most of its claim to [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Lombardy\u2013Venetia]] to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], following the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] in 1859 and the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in 1866. Although Franz Joseph ceded no territory to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] after the Austrian defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] (23 August 1866) settled the [[German Question]] in favour of Prussia, which prevented the [[Unification of Germany]] from occurring under the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|House of Habsburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/franz-joseph-of-austria|title=Gale Encyclopedia of Biography: '&#39;Francis Joseph'&#39;|publisher=Answers.com|date=|accessdate=2013-12-02}}</ref>\n\nFranz Joseph was troubled by nationalism during his entire reign. He concluded the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], which granted greater autonomy to [[Hungary]] and transformed the Austrian Empire into the [[Dual Monarchy]] of Austria-Hungary. He ruled peacefully for the next 45 years, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother, the [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian of Mexico]] in 1867, the [[Mayerling incident|suicide of his only son]] and heir-apparent, [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]], in 1889, the [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria#Assassination|assassination of his wife]], [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth]] (\"Sisi\"), in 1898, and the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassination of his nephew and heir-presumptive]], the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in 1914.\n\nAfter the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Austria-Hungary turned its attention to the [[Balkans]], which was a hotspot of international tension because of conflicting interests with the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Bosnian Crisis]] was a result of Franz Joseph's annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908, which had been [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupied by his troops]] since the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878).\n\nOn 28 June 1914, the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of his nephew and heir-presumptive, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in [[Sarajevo]] resulted in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which was an ally of the [[Russian Empire]]. That activated a system of alliances which resulted in [[World War I]].\n\nFranz Joseph died on 21 November 1916, after ruling his domains for almost 68 years as one of the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning monarchs in modern history]]. He was succeeded by his grandnephew [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Sophiebayern franzjoseph.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Franz Joseph and his mother [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria|Archduchess Sophie]]. Painting by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]].]]\nFranz Joseph was born in the [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] in [[Vienna]] (on the 65th anniversary of the death of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor | Francis of Lorraine]]) as the eldest son of [[Archduke Franz Karl of Austria| Archduke Franz Karl]] (the younger son of [[Francis II of Austria |Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]]), and his wife [[Sophie, Princess of Bavaria|Princess Sophie of Bavaria]]. Because his uncle, reigning from 1835 as the Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria| Ferdinand]], was weak-minded, and his father unambitious and retiring, the mother of the young Archduke \"Franzl\" brought him up as a future Emperor, with emphasis on devotion, responsibility and diligence.\n\nFranzl came to idolise his grandfather, ''der Gute Kaiser Franz'', who had died shortly before the former's fifth birthday, as the ideal monarch. At the age of thirteen, Franzl started a career as a colonel in the Austrian army. From that point onward, army style dictated his personal fashion - for the rest of his life he normally wore the uniform of a military officer.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p= 61}} Franz Joseph was soon joined by three younger brothers: Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian (born 1832, the future [[Maximilian of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]] of [[Second Mexican Empire |Mexico]]); [[Archduke Charles Louis of Austria| Archduke Karl Ludwig]] (born 1833, father of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]), and [[Archduke Ludwig Viktor]] (born 1842), and a sister, [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1835\u20131840) |Maria Anna]] (born 1835), who died at the age of four.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=101}}\n\n==Revolutions of 1848==\n{{Main|revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Hungarian Revolution of 1848}}\n\nDuring the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]] the [[List of heads of government under Austrian Emperors | Austrian Chancellor]] [[Prince Metternich]] resigned (March-April 1848). The young Archduke, who (it was widely expected) would soon succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of [[Bohemia]] on 6 April 1848, but never took up the post. Sent instead to the [[First Italian War of Independence | front in Italy]], he joined [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz |Field Marshal Radetzky]] on campaign on 29 April, receiving his [[baptism of fire]] on 5 May at [[Battle of Santa Lucia|Santa Lucia]].\n[[File:Peter Fendi - The Evening Prayer, 1839 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The painting depicts the family of Franz Joseph gathered in prayer, 1839]]\nBy all accounts he handled his first military experience calmly and with dignity. Around the same time, the Imperial Family was fleeing revolutionary Vienna for the calmer setting of [[Innsbruck]], in [[County of Tyrol  |Tyrol]]. Called back from Italy, the Archduke joined the rest of his family at Innsbruck by mid-June. At Innsbruck at this time Franz Joseph first met his cousin Elisabeth, his future bride, then a girl of ten, but apparently the meeting made little impression.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=33}}\n\nFollowing Austria's victory over the Italians at [[Battle of Custoza (1848)| Custoza]] in late July 1848, the court felt it safe to return to Vienna, and Franz Joseph travelled with them. But within a few weeks Vienna again appeared unsafe, and in September the court left once more, this time for [[Olomouc]] (Olm\u00fctz) in [[Moravia]]. By now, [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz |Prince Alfred I]] of [[Windisch-Graetz |Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]], an influential military commander in Bohemia, was determined to see the young Archduke soon put on the throne. It was thought{{by whom?|date=October 2019}} that a new ruler would not be bound by the oaths to respect constitutional government to which Ferdinand had been forced to agree, and that it was necessary to find a young, energetic emperor to replace the kindly, but mentally unfit Ferdinand.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p= 8}}\n\nBy the abdication of his uncle Ferdinand and the renunciation of his father (the mild-mannered Franz Karl) Franz Joseph succeeded as Emperor of Austria at Olomouc on 2 December. At this time he first became known by his second as well as his first Christian name. The name \"Franz Joseph\" was chosen{{by whom?|date=October 2019}} to bring back memories of the new Emperor's great-granduncle, Emperor [[Josef II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (Holy Roman Emperor from 1765 to 1790), remembered as a modernising reformer.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p= 6}}\n\n\nUnder the guidance of the new prime minister [[Felix Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] the Third, the new emperor at first pursued a cautious course, granting a constitution in early 1849. At the same time, a military campaign was necessary against the Hungarians, who had [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|rebelled against Habsburg central authority]] in the name of their ancient constitution. Franz Joseph was also almost immediately faced with a renewal of the [[First Italian War of Independence|fighting in Italy]], with King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] taking advantage of setbacks in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] to resume the war in March 1849.\n[[File:Gy\u0151ri csata.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Gy\u0151r]] on 28 June 1849. Franz Joseph enters in [[Gy\u0151r]] leading the Austrian troops.]]\nHowever, the military tide began to swiftly turn in favor of Franz Joseph and the Austrian whitecoats. Almost immediately, Charles Albert was decisively beaten by Radetzky at [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Novara]] and forced to sue for peace, as well as to renounce his throne. \n\n\n===Revolution in Hungary===\nThe crucial turning point of the Hungarian events were the [[April laws]] which was ratified by King Ferdinand, however the new young Austrian monarch Francis Joseph arbitrarily \"revoked\" the laws without any legal competence. This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Francis Joseph. The new constrained [[Stadion Constitution]] of Austria, the revoke of the April laws and the Austrian military campaign against Kingdom of Hungary resulted in the fall of the pacifist [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny government]] (who searched agreement with the court) and led to the sudden emergence of [[Lajos Kossuth]]'s followers in the [[Diet of Hungary|Hungarian parliament]], who demanded the full independence of Hungary. The Austrian military intervention in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] resulted in strong anti-Habsburg sentiment among Hungarians, thus the events in Hungary grew into a war for total [[independence]] from the [[Habsburg dynasty]].\n\nIn Hungary, the situation was more severe and Austrian defeat seemed imminent. Sensing a need to secure his right to rule, Franz Joseph sought help from Russia, requesting the intervention of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]], in order \"to prevent the Hungarian insurrection developing into a European calamity\".<ref>Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette, Purdue University Press, 1976. p. 35.</ref>\n\n\nRussian troops entered Hungary in support of the Austrians and the revolution was crushed by late summer of 1849. With order now restored throughout his Empire, Franz Joseph felt free to renege on the constitutional concessions he had made, especially as the Austrian parliament meeting at [[Kremsier]] had behaved\u2014in the young Emperor's eyes\u2014abominably. The 1849 constitution was suspended, and a policy of absolutist centralism was established, guided by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Bach]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=41}}\n\n===Assassination attempt in 1853===\n[[File:J.Reiner - Attentat auf Kaiser Franz Joseph.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Assassination attempt on the emperor, 1853]]\nOn 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an assassination attempt by [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungarian nationalist]] J\u00e1nos Lib\u00e9nyi.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}} The emperor was taking a stroll with one of his officers, Count [[Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell]], on a city [[bastion]], when Lib\u00e9nyi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck. Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O'Donnell struck Lib\u00e9nyi down with his sabre.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}}\n\nO'Donnell, hitherto only a Count by virtue of his Irish nobility (as a descendant of the Irish noble dynasty [[O'Donnell of Tyrconnell]]),<ref>''O'Domhnaill Abu \u2013 [[O'Donnell]] Clan Newsletter'' no. 7, Spring 1987 (ISSN 0790-7389))</ref> was made a Count of the [[Habsburg]] Empire (''[[Reichsgraf]]''). Another witness who happened to be nearby, the butcher Joseph Ettenreich, swiftly overpowered Lib\u00e9nyi. For his deed he was later elevated to the nobility by the Emperor and became Joseph von Ettenreich. Lib\u00e9nyi was subsequently put on trial and condemned to death for attempted [[regicide]]. He was executed on the Simmeringer Heide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simmeringerhaide.at/chronik.html|title=Kleingartenanlage Simmeringer Haide|last=Decker|first=Wolfgang|website=www.simmeringerhaide.at|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref>\n\nAfter this unsuccessful attack, the Emperor's brother [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian]], later Emperor of [[Mexico]], called upon Europe's royal families for donations to construct a new church on the site of the attack. The church was to be a [[votive offering]] for the survival of the Emperor. It is located on [[Ringstra\u00dfe]] in the district of [[Alsergrund]] close to the [[University of Vienna]], and is known as the [[Votivkirche]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=42}} The survival of Franz Joseph was also commemorated  in Prague by erecting a new [[Statue of Francis of Assisi, Charles Bridge|statue of St. Francis of Assisi]], the patron saint of the emperor, on [[Charles Bridge]]. It was donated by Count [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky]], the first minister-president of the Austrian Empire.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statuary of St. Francis Seraph |url=http://www.kralovskacesta.cz/en/tour/objects/statuary-of-st-francis-seraph.html |website=Kr\u00e1lovsk\u00e1 cesta |accessdate=17 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Consolidation of domestic policy==\n\n\nThe next few years saw the seeming recovery of Austria's position on the international scene following the near disasters of 1848\u20131849. Under Schwarzenberg's guidance, Austria was able to stymie [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] scheming to create a new German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria. After Schwarzenberg's premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the Emperor himself effectively took over as prime minister.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=41}}\n\n\n\n===Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867===\n{{Main|Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867}}\n[[File:Ferenc J\u00f3zsef koron\u00e1z\u00e1sa Bud\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Franz Joseph's coronation as Apostolic King of Hungary. Painting by [[Edmund Tull]].]]\nThe 1850s witnessed several failures of Austrian external policy: the [[Crimean War]], the dissolution of its alliance with Russia, and defeat in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. The setbacks continued in the 1860s with defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, which resulted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=169}}\n\nThe Hungarian political leaders had two main goals during the negotiations. One was to regain the traditional status (both legal and political) of the Hungarian state, which was lost after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. The other was to restore the series of reform laws of the revolutionary parliament of 1848, which were based on the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 points]] that established modern civil and political rights, economic and societal reforms in Hungary.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ferenc Szak\u00e1ly|title=Hungary and Eastern Europe: Research Report Volume 182 of Studia historica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae|year=1980|page=178|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|ISBN=9789630525954}}</ref>\n\nThe Compromise partially re-established<ref>{{cite book|author1=Andr\u00e9 Gerrits|author2=Dirk Jan Wolffram|title=Political Democracy and Ethnic Diversity in Modern European History|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2005|page=42|ISBN=9780804749763|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFY_iWZAj7kC&pg=PA42&dq=Ausgleich+%22hungarian+parliament%22+re-established&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinkczGv4jWAhWBE5oKHRkKAiAQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Ausgleich%20%22hungarian%20parliament%22%20re-established&f=false}}</ref> the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hungary, separate from, and no longer subject to the Austrian Empire. \n\nThe compromise put an end to the 18 years long military dictatorship and absolutist rule over Hungary, which was introduced by Francis Joseph after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. \n\nAccording to Emperor Franz Joseph, \"There were three of us who made the agreement: [[Ferenc De\u00e1k|De\u00e1k]], [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy|Andr\u00e1ssy]] and myself.\"<ref>Kozuchowski, Adam.

Johnston]], ''The Austrian Mind: An Intellectual and Social History, 1848\u20131938'' (University of California Press, 1983), p. 38</ref>\n\n===The Bohemian question===\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Franz Joseph of Bohemia 1861.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Franz Joseph in the regalia of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], with the [[Bohemian Crown Jewels]] next to him. Painting by [[Eduard von Engerth]] for the Bohemian Diet, 1861.]]\nFollowing the accession of Franz Joseph to the throne in 1848, the political representatives of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] hoped and insisted that account should be taken of their historical state rights in the upcoming constitution. They felt the position of [[Bohemia]] within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] should have been highlighted by a [[Coronation of the Bohemian monarch|coronation of the new ruler to the king of Bohemia]] in Prague (the last coronation took place in 1836). However before the 19th century the Habsburgs had ruled Bohemia by hereditary right and a separate coronation was not deemed necessary.\n\nHis new government installed the system of [[neoabsolutism]] in Austrian internal affairs to make the Austrian Empire a unitary, centralised and bureaucratically administered state. When Franz Joseph returned to constitutional rule after the debacles in Italy at [[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]] and [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]] and summoned the diets of his lands, the question of his coronation as king of Bohemia again returned to the agenda, as it had not since 1848. On 14 April 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph received a delegation from the Bohemian Diet with his words (in Czech):\n\n{{quote|\"I will have myself crowned King of Bohemia in Prague, and I am convinced that a new, indissoluble bond of trust and loyalty between My throne and My Bohemian Kingdom will be strengthened by this holy rite.\"<ref name=\"lecaine\">{{cite book|last1=Le Caine Agnew|first1=Hugh|editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=Laurence|editor2-last=Unowsky|editor2-first=Daniel L.|title=The limits of loyalty : imperial symbolism, popular allegiances, and state patriotism in the late Habsburg monarchy|date=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781845452025|pages=86\u2013112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_SOie5SJQwC&dq=|accessdate=17 November 2016|language=en|chapter=The Flyspecks on Palivec's Portrait: Franz Joseph, the Symbols of Monarchy, and Czech Popular Loyalty}}</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast to his predecessor Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]] (who spent the rest of his life after his abdication in 1848 in Bohemia and especially in Prague), Franz Joseph was never crowned separately as king of Bohemia. In 1861, the negotiations failed because of unsolved constitutional problems. However in 1866, a visit of the monarch to Prague following the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|defeat at Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 (K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz)]] was a huge success, testified by the considerable numbers of new photographs taken.\n\n[[File:L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Portrait of Franz Joseph I 1899.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1899]]\nIn 1867, the Austro-Hungarian compromise and the introduction of the dual monarchy left the Czechs and their aristocracy without the recognition of separate Bohemian state rights for which they had hoped. Bohemia remained Austrian Crown Lands. In Bohemia, opposition to dualism took the form of isolated street demonstrations, resolutions from district representations, and even open air mass protest meetings, confined to the biggest cities, such as Prague. The Czech newspaper ''[[N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy]]'', complained that the Czechs had not yet been compensated for their wartime losses and sufferings during the Austro-Prussian War, and had just seen their historic state rights tossed aside and their land subsumed into the \"other\" half of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, commonly called \"[[Cisleithania]]\".<ref name=\"lecaine\"/>\n\nThe Czech hopes were revived again in 1870\u20131871. In an Imperial Rescript of 26 September 1870, Franz Joseph referred again to the prestige and glory of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] and to his intention to hold a coronation. Under Minister-President [[Karl Hohenwart]] in 1871, the government of Cisleithania negotiated a series of fundamental articles spelling out the relationship of the Bohemian Crown to the rest of the Habsburg Monarchy. On 12 September 1871, Franz Joseph announced:\n\n{{quote|Having in mind the constitutional position of the Bohemian Crown and being conscious of the glory and power which that Crown has given us '''and our predecessors''\u2026 we gladly recognise the rights of the kingdom and are prepared to renew that recognition through our coronation oath.<ref name=\"lecaine\"/>}}\n\nFor the planned coronation, the composer [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]] had written the opera ''[[Libu\u0161e (opera)|Libu\u0161e]]'', but the ceremony did not take place. The creation of the [[German Empire]], domestic opposition from German-speaking liberals (especially [[Sudeten Germans|German-Bohemians]]) and from Hungarians doomed the [[Fundamental Articles of 1871|Fundamental Articles]]. Hohenwart resigned and nothing changed.\n\nMany Czech people were waiting for political changes in monarchy, including [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] and others. Masaryk served in the ''Reichsrat'' (Upper House) from 1891 to 1893 in the [[Young Czech Party]] and again from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Realist Party|Realist Party]] (which he had founded in 1900), but he did not campaign for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. In Vienna in 1909 he helped [[Hinko Hinkovi\u0107]]'s defense in the fabricated trial against prominent Croats and Serbs members of the Serbo-Croatian Coalition (such as [[Frano Supilo]] and [[Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107]]), and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties. The Bohemian question would remain unresolved for the entirety of Franz Joseph's reign.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n[[File:Francesco Giuseppe fra le truppe a Solferino 1859.jpg|thumb|Franz Joseph among his troops at [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]], fought during the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] of 1859]]\n\n===The German question===\n[[File:Fuerstentag Frankfurt 1863 263-022.jpg|thumb|Emperor Franz Joseph (centre in white uniform) at the [[German Confederation|Congress of German princes]] in [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], 1863]]\nThe main foreign policy goal of Franz Joseph had been the [[unification of Germany]] under the [[House of Habsburg]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=149}} This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 to the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, with only one period of interruption under the [[Wittelsbach]]s, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=150}} However, Franz Joseph's desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg [[Austrian Empire]] in the event of German unification proved problematic.\n\nTwo factions quickly developed: a party of German intellectuals favouring a [[Greater Germany]] (''Gro\u00dfdeutschland'') under the House of Habsburg; the other favouring a [[Lesser Germany]] (''Kleindeutschland''). The Greater Germans favoured the inclusion of Austria in a new all-German state on the grounds that Austria had always been a part of Germanic empires, that it was the leading power of the [[German Confederation]], and that it would be absurd to exclude eight million Austrian Germans from an all-German nation state. The champions of a lesser Germany argued against the inclusion of Austria on the grounds that it was a multi-nation state, not a German one, and that its inclusion would bring millions of non-Germans into the German nation state.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}}\n\nIf Greater Germany were to prevail, the crown would necessarily have to go to Franz Joseph, who had no desire to cede it in the first place to anyone else.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}} On the other hand, if the idea of a smaller Germany won out, the German crown could of course not possibly go to the [[Emperor of Austria]], but would naturally be offered to the head of the largest and most powerful German state outside of Austria\u2014the [[King of Prussia]]. The contest between the two ideas, quickly developed into a contest between Austria and [[Prussia]]. After Prussia decisively won the [[Seven Weeks War]], this question was solved; Austria lost no territories as long as they remained out of German affairs.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=151}}\n\nFranz Joseph's German identity was made explicitly clear during a meeting in August 1908 between himself and [[Edward VII]] when the latter tried to persuade him to abandon Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany for co-operation with England; Franz Joseph replied that he was a \"loyal ally\" and said \"I am a German prince.\"<ref>\"Sir, ich bin ein deutscher F\u00fcrst.\" Walter Wiltschegg: \u00d6sterreich, der \"zweite deutsche Staat\"?: der nationale Gedanke in der Ersten Republik, Stocker, p. 41.

The league had been designed by the German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], as an attempt to maintain the peace of Europe. It would last intermittently until 1887.\n\n=== The Vatican ===\nIn 1903, Franz Joseph's [[Jus exclusivae|veto]] of Cardinal [[Mariano Rampolla]]'s election to the papacy was transmitted to the [[Papal conclave, 1903|Papal conclave]] by Cardinal [[Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko]]. It was the last use of such a veto, as the new [[Pope Pius X]] prohibited future uses and provided for excommunication for any attempt.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=127}}<ref>See also http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05677b.htm (discussing the papal veto from the perspective of the Catholic Church)</ref>\n\n=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===\n{{Main|Bosnian crisis}}\n{{See also|Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878}}\n[[File:Kaiser Franz-Joseph I.webm|thumb|Film footage about emperor Franz Joseph]]\n[[File:Franz Josef I of Austria - voice recording (1900).ogg|thumb|Voice recording of the emperor speaking into [[Valdemar Poulsen]]'s magnetic wire recorder at the [[1900 World's Fair]]]]\nDuring the mid-1870s a series of violent rebellions against Ottoman rule broke out in the Balkans, and the Turks responded with equally violent and oppressive reprisals. Tsar Alexander II of Russia, wanting to intervene against the Ottomans, sought and obtained an agreement with Austria-Hungary.\n\nIn the Budapest Conventions of 1877, the two powers agreed that Russia would annex [[Bessarabia]], and Austria-Hungary would observe a benevolent neutrality toward Russia in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|pending war]] with the Turks. As compensation for this support, Russia agreed to Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=16}} A scant 15 months later, the Russians imposed on the Ottomans the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which reneged on the Budapest accord and declared that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be jointly occupied by Russian and Austrian troops.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=16}}\n\nThe treaty was overturned by the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which allowed sole [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] but did not specify a final disposition of the provinces.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} That omission was addressed in the Three Emperors' League agreement of 1881, when both Germany and Russia endorsed Austria's right to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=37}} However, by 1897, under a new tsar, the Russian Imperial government had again withdrawn its support for Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian foreign minister, Count Michael Muraviev, stated that an Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina would raise \"an extensive question requiring special scrutiny\".{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=94}}\n\nIn 1908, the Russian foreign minister, [[Alexander Izvolsky]], offered Russian support, for the third time, for the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, in exchange for Austrian support for the opening of the [[Bosporus Strait]] and the [[Dardanelles]] to Russian warships. Austria's foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Alois von Aehrenthal]], pursued this offer vigorously, resulting in the quid pro quo understanding with Izvolsky, reached on 16 September 1908 at the Buchlau Conference. However, Izvolsky made this agreement with Aehrenthal without the knowledge of [[Tsar Nicholas II]] or his government in St. Petersburg, or any of the other foreign powers including Britain, France and Serbia.\n\nBased upon the assurances of the Buchlau Conference and the treaties that preceded it, Franz Joseph signed the proclamation announcing the [[annexation]] of Bosnia-Herzegovina into the Empire on 6 October 1908. However a diplomatic crisis erupted, as both the Serbs and the Italians demanded compensation for the annexation, which the Austro-Hungarian government refused to entertain. The incident was not resolved until the revision of the Treaty of Berlin in April 1909, exacerbating tensions between Austria-Hungary and the Serbs.\n\n==Outbreak of World War I==\n{{Main|July Crisis}}\n[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|240px|Rival military coalitions in 1914: [[Triple Entente]] in green; [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in brown.]]\nOn 28 June 1914 Franz Joseph's nephew and heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], and his [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]], were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Yugoslav nationalist of Serbian ethnicity,<ref>{{cite book|author=Dejan Djoki\u0107|title=Yugoslavism: Histories of a Failed Idea, 1918\u20131992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMyZdvTympMC|date=January 2003|publisher=C.

Initial decision-making during the \"July Crisis\" fell to [[Count Leopold Berchtold]], the Austrian foreign minister; [[Count Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], the chief of staff for the Austro-Hungarian army and the other ministers.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=328}} The ultimate resolution of deliberations by the Austrian government during the weeks following the assassination of the Archduke was to give Serbia [[July Crisis#Austro-Hungarian ultimatum|an ultimatum]] of itemized demands with which it was virtually certain Serbia would be unable or unwilling to comply, thus serving as a \"legal basis for war.\"\n\nHowever, the general movement toward war with Serbia was already in motion prior to assassination of the Archduke as evidenced by a 14 June memo of Berchtold recommending the \"elimination of Serbia\" as a state, which Franz Josef [[July Crisis#Germany and war|expressed agreement with]] in a letter delivered to Kaiser Wilhelm II in Berlin on 5 July. In that letter, Franz Josef \"...explicitly stated that the decision for war against Serbia had been made before the assassination of the Archduke, and that the events of Sarajevo only confirmed the already pre-existing need for a war.\"\n\nA week after delivery of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia, on 28 July, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Within weeks, the Germans, Russians, French and British had all entered the fray which eventually became known as [[World War I]]. On 6 August, Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war against Russia.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Funeral Franz-Joseph.webm|thumb|right|Film of the funeral procession of Franz Joseph]]\nFranz Joseph died in the [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] on the evening of 21 November 1916, at the age of 86.

Sophie wanted to strengthen the relationship between the Houses of [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|Habsburg]] and [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]]\u2014descending from the latter house herself\u2014and hoped to match Franz Joseph with her sister [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria|Ludovika's]] eldest daughter, [[Duchess Helene in Bavaria|Helene]] (\"N\u00e9n\u00e9\"), who was four years the Emperor's junior.\n\nHowever, Franz Joseph fell deeply in love with N\u00e9n\u00e9's younger sister [[Elizabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth]] (\"Sisi\"), a beautiful girl of fifteen, and insisted on marrying her instead. Sophie acquiesced, despite her misgivings about Sisi's appropriateness as an imperial consort, and the young couple were married on 24 April 1854 in [[Augustinian Church, Vienna|St. Augustine's Church]], Vienna.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=242}}\n\n[[File:MAraige de Sissi et Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph.png|thumb|Marriage of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth]]\nTheir marriage would eventually prove to be an unhappy one; though Franz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, the feeling was not mutual. Elisabeth never truly acclimatized to life at court, and was frequently in conflict with the imperial family. Their first daughter Sophie died as an infant, and their only son [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Rudolf]] died by suicide in 1889 in the infamous [[Mayerling Incident]].{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=127}}\n\nIn 1885 Franz Joseph met [[Katharina Schratt]], a leading actress of the Vienna stage, and she became his friend and confidante. This relationship lasted the rest of his life, and was\u2014to a certain degree\u2014tolerated by Elisabeth. Franz Joseph built Villa Schratt in [[Bad Ischl]] for her, and also provided her with a small palace in Vienna.{{sfn|Murad|1968|p=120}} Though their relationship lasted for thirty-four years, it remained platonic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Frederic|title=Thunder at Twilight: Vienna 1913/1914|url=https://archive.org/details/thunderattwiligh00mort|url-access=registration|year=1989|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thunderattwiligh00mort/page/85 85\u201386]}}</ref>\n\nThe Empress was an inveterate traveller, horsewoman, and fashion ''maven'' who was rarely seen in Vienna. Sisi was obsessed about preserving her beauty, carrying out many bizarre routines and strenuous exercise, and as a result suffered from ill health. She was [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria#assassination|stabbed to death]] by [[Luigi Lucheni|an Italian anarchist]] in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva. A few days after the funeral, [[Robert I, Duke of Parma|Robert of Parma]] wrote in a letter to his friend [[Tirso de Olaz\u00e1bal y Lardiz\u00e1bal|Tirso de Olaz\u00e1bal]] that \"It was pitiful to look at the Emperor, he showed a great deal of energy in his immense pain, but at times one could see all the immensity of his grief.\"<ref>The letter is available [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Letter_from_Robert,_Duke_of_Parma,_to_Tirso_de_Olaz%C3%A1bal_(Sep._1898).pdf here]</ref> Franz Joseph never fully recovered from the loss.

The relationship between him and Franz Joseph had always been a fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Countess Sophie Chotek]], a match that was out of the question in the mind of the emperor, as Sophie was merely of nobility as opposed to being of dynastic rank.\n\nAlthough the emperor received letters from members of the imperial family throughout the fall and winter of 1899 importuning him to relent, Franz Joseph stood his ground.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=288}} He finally gave his consent in 1900; however, the marriage was to be [[Morganatic marriage|morganatic]], and any children of the marriage would be ineligible to succeed to the throne.{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=289}} The couple were married on 1 July 1900 at [[Z\u00e1kupy|Reichstadt]].

Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. <!-- Antibiotics are not described as \"strongest\"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed \"broad spectrum\". Vancomycin is effective against only Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --> <!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic -->\n\n=== Viral hemorrhagic fevers ===\n\nViral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Ebola virus disease]], [[Lassa fever virus|Lassa fever]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus|Marburg virus disease]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fears of Ebola pandemic if violent attacks continue in DR Congo |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/fears-ebola-pandemic-drc-violent-attacks-continue-190522231352900.html |work=Al-Jazeera |date=23 May 2019}}</ref> Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and the vector has only a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Coronaviruses ===\n\n[[Coronavirus]]es (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East Respiratory Syndrome]] (MERS-CoV) and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] (SARS-CoV).

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish flu]] or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].\n\nFrom October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |author=MacKenzie, D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |work=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]].

After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants.

(It is also known as \"gaol fever\" and \"ship fever\", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans.\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), about eight million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence].

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic.

It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish flu]] or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].\n\nFrom October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |author=MacKenzie, D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |work=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]].

They are often found in smaller groups of up to a dozen birds, and sometimes in as few as one or two.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> No major behavior studies have been conducted, but they appear to have a similar social structure to noisy miners as they share many calls, postures, and interactive behaviors. Calls are higher pitched than noisy miner calls, but are readily recognizable as a miner call.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> They are watchful and are often the first to alarm when a predator appears. As with the other miner species, they are known to be very aggressive to other birds, particularly smaller insectivores and honeyeaters. Yellow-throated miners have been observed monopolizing small patches of remnant vegetation along roadsides and dividing paddocks, which cuts off corridors for smaller birds to move through.<ref name=\"Challenges\">{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Michael F.|last2=Taylor|first2=Richard|last3=Oldland|first3=Joanne|last4=Grey|first4=Merilyn J.|last5=Dare|first5=Amanda|title=Challenges in managing miners|journal=The Victorian Naturalist|date=2007|volume=124|issue=2|pages=102\u2013105}}</ref> Yellow-throated miners,  like their relatives the bell miner and noisy miner, have been linked to reduced bird species richness and higher psyllid abundance in disturbed mallee in Victoria.<ref name=\"InfluenceYTM\">{{cite journal|last1=O'Loughlin|first1=Thea|last2=0'Loughlin|first2=Luke S.|last3=Clarke|first3=Michael F.|title=Influence of the yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula) on bird communities and tree health in a fragmented landscape|journal=Wildlife Research|date=2014|volume=41|issue=6|pages=537\u2013544|doi=10.1071/wr14174}}</ref> However, a follow-up study found that yellow-throated miner removal did not significantly increase avian richness as it has done in studies with bell miners and noisy miners.<ref name=\"NoShortTerm\">{{cite journal|last1=O'Loughlin|first1=Theo|last2=O'Loughlin|first2=Luke S.|last3=Clarke|first3=Michael F.|title=No short-term change in avian assemblage following removal of Yellow-throated Miner (Manorina flavigula) colonies|journal=Ecological Management & Restoration|date=2017|volume=18|issue=1|pages=83\u201387|doi=10.1111/emr.12244}}</ref> Though yellow-throated miners drive away many species and are not afraid to attack larger birds, they have been found to share territory with  [[grey butcherbird]]s and [[pied butcherbird]]s and even nest in close proximity to those species.
