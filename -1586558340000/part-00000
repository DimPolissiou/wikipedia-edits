The lower receiver holds the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]] assembly including the [[Hammer (firearms)|hammer]], and is the attachment point for the [[buttstock]]. The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires the removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a [[hinge]].<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe upper receiver contains the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier assembly and is attached to the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] assembly. [[Sight (device)|Sights]] will be attached to the upper receiver or the barrel assembly. A handguard usually encloses the barrel and a [[gas-operated reloading]] device using burnt powder gas vented from a hole (or port) in the barrel near the forward end of the handguard. The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the buttstock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned [[smokeless powder]] residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions.

These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of [[body armor]]. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self-loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair [[ergonomic]] balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knupp |first=Jeremiah |year=2019 |title=This Is My Rifle: The Case For The 20\"-Barreled AR-15 |journal=American Rifleman |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201345 & 70\u201372 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/> While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.<ref name=\"Sweeney2016bm\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing the AR-15, the Bench Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88WdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 August 2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4660-9|pages=7\u20139}}</ref> From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes the AR-15 So Appealing to Mass Shooters? |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/ar-15-mass-murderer-link/ |first=Meghan |last=O\u2019Dea |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 15, 2018 |quote=While Colt alone makes the official AR-15, variants and knock-offs are made by a huge number of gun manufactures, including Bushmaster, Les Baer, Remington, Smith & Wesson (swhc, +0.00%), and Sturm & Ruger (rgr, -2.04%), just to name a few.

The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a [[hinge]].<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe upper receiver contains the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier assembly, and is attached to the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] assembly. [[Sight (device)|Sights]] will be attached to the upper receiver or to the barrel assembly.

The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the butt stock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned [[smokeless powder]] residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. A more recent alternative design has a metal operating rod pushing against the bolt carrier from a gas piston under the hand guard near the barrel port.

Most components are interchangeable between semi-auto and select fire rifles including magazines, sights, upper receiver, barrels and accessories.<ref name=\"Bartocci1\">{{cite web|last1=Bartocci|first1=Christopher|title=AR-15/M16: The Rifle That Was Never Supposed to Be|url=https://gundigest.com/reviews/the-ar-16m16-the-rifle-that-was-never-supposed-to-be|website=GunDigest|publisher=Gun Digest Media|accessdate=March 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310200746/https://gundigest.com/reviews/the-ar-16m16-the-rifle-that-was-never-supposed-to-be|archive-date=March 10, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Zimba|first1=Jeff|title=The Evolution of the Black Rifle|date=2014|publisher=Prepper Press|isbn=0692317260}}</ref> The military [[M4 carbine]] typically uses a {{convert|14.5|in|cm|adj=on}} barrel.

Parts changed include the lower receiver, bolt carrier, hammer, trigger, disconnector, and safety/mode selector. The semi-automatic bolt carrier has a longer lightening slot to prevent the bolt's engagement with an automatic sear. Due to a decrease in mass the buffer spring is heavier. On the select fire version, the hammer has an extra spur which interacts with the additional auto-sear that holds it back until the bolt carrier group is fully in battery, when automatic fire is selected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanks|first1=D.

These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of [[body armor]]. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self-loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair [[ergonomic]] balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knupp |first=Jeremiah |year=2019 |title=This Is My Rifle: The Case For The 20\"-Barreled AR-15 |journal=American Rifleman |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201345 & 70\u201372 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/> While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.<ref name=\"Sweeney2016bm\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing the AR-15, the Bench Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88WdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 August 2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4660-9|pages=7\u20139}}</ref> From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes the AR-15 So Appealing to Mass Shooters? |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/ar-15-mass-murderer-link/ |first=Meghan |last=O\u2019Dea |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 15, 2018 |quote=While Colt alone makes the official AR-15, variants and knock-offs are made by a huge number of gun manufactures, including Bushmaster, Les Baer, Remington, Smith & Wesson (swhc, +0.00%), and Sturm & Ruger (rgr, -2.04%), just to name a few.

She has never surrendered that claim, nor will ever she surrender it, and today forces are working in Ireland that will not be still until her claim is acknowledged and her voice heard in the councils of the nations.\n</blockquote>\n\nA year later the paper merged with a Dublin publication called ''The Peasant''. However, the title ''An Phoblacht'' was again used from 1925 with [[Patrick Little]] (P.J Little) as editor and continued until 1937 with a tumultuous history of internal splits and constant state oppression.  From 1925 into 1926, [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] wrote a number of articles advocating engagement in politics prior to the establishment of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. [[Peadar O'Donnell]] took over as editor in April 1926 following a split in the Republican movement (Little became one of the founding members of Fianna F\u00e1il).<ref>{{cite book|last= \u00d3 Drisceoil |first=Donal|title=Peadar O'Donnell|publisher=Cork University Press|year= 2001|isbn=978-1-85918-310-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCNT-M3Re6EC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=An+phoblacht++1925&source=bl&ots=3B0VmjvqEG&sig=B_sgTJxO0iFFRqJkjuJ67-_hTck&hl=en&ei=ShdyTa3PMomxhAeIkNBU&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&sqi=2&ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=An%20phoblacht%20%201925&f=false}}</ref> [[Frank Ryan (Irish republican)|Frank Ryan]] also edited the paper for some time; other prominent contributors during this time included [[Moss (Maurice) Twomey|Maurice Twomey]], [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], [[Frank Gallagher (author)|Frank Gallagher]] (who became the first editor of [[The Irish Press]]), [[Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington]] and Fr [[Michael O'Flanagan]].\n\nThe title appeared again in 1966 as the paper of a small IRA splinter group based in Cork.<ref>Public Record Office of Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs file HA 32/2/13 - \"Sinn Fein and Republican Clubs 1958-68\"</ref>\n\n===1970-founded publication===\nIts modern version was again refounded immediately following the Sinn F\u00e9in split by [[Jimmy Steele (republican)|Jimmy Steele]] in January 1970, ''An Phoblacht'' supporting the group led by Rua\u00edr\u00ed O'Bradaigh that became the Provisional IRA when the split with the [[Official Irish Republican Army]] occurred.\n\nIn 1970, ''An Phoblacht'' was at first circulated only in the South with another republican paper also established in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1970, ''[[Republican News]]'', under the editorship of veteran republican Jimmy Steele. It supported the campaign of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and published a weekly column titled \"War News\", which outlined IRA actions and conflict with the British Army, and provided in depth analysis of the policies being formulated by the Republican Movement. ''An Phoblacht'' began with a circulation of 20,000 per month.\n\nLocated at 2a Lower Kevin Street in [[Dublin]]'s south inner city, it moved to the northside of the capital, to [[Kevin Barry]] House, 44 [[Parnell Square]], in August 1972. And in that October it became a fortnightly publication under the editorship of [[\u00c9amonn MacThom\u00e1is]], a writer and historian<ref>Republican who loved his 'darlin' Dublin', ''The Irish Times'' (24 August 2002).</ref> who instituted changes in layout and general improvements so that it became a weekly publication. After 1976, the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], a [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] minister in the [[Fine Gael]]/Labour coalition, strengthened [[Jack Lynch]]'s original 1971 Section 31 censorship directive banning members of the IRA or its political wing Sinn F\u00e9in from the airwaves.  However this ban did not extend to the print media. Section 31 produced a climate where many career journalists engaged in [[self-censorship]] to avoid official opprobrium.\n\n''An Phoblacht'' became more important in disseminating the republican message and highlighting what it saw as the naked state oppression by the Unionist Party and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] in Northern Ireland. However, it was the southern Irish government which harassed ''An Phoblacht'' most stridently, with regular [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] [[Special Detective Unit|Special Branch]] investigations into the publication's links (both real and alleged) to the IRA. Mac Thom\u00e1is was arrested and charged with IRA membership and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment having been found guilty of the offence. The paper continued under the stewardship of Dublin journalist [[Deas\u00fan Breathnach]] until Mac Thom\u00e1is resumed duties on his release in July 1974. Within two months, Mac Thom\u00e1is was again arrested and sentenced to another 15 months. Another editor, [[Coleman Moynihan]], who had succeeded [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]] in 1972, suffered a similar fate. The paper continued on with the succeeding editors being Gerry Danaher (1974\u201375), Gerry O\u2019Hare (1975\u201377), and Deas\u00fan Breathnach (1977\u201379).\n\n===Amalgamation with ''Republican News''===\n{{one source|section|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Pearse Doherty speaking at Bodenstown 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pearse Doherty]] TD delivers the main oration at the annual [[Wolfe Tone]] Commemoration in Bodenstown, 2013. The podium carries a banner advertising An Phoblacht to the audience]]\nThe Republican Movement (Sinn F\u00e9in and the IRA) felt that a single paper for the whole of Ireland was required to provide a clear and coherent line from the leadership and to counter what they regarded as any [[Partitionism|partitionist]] thinking which might flow from the [[United Kingdom|British]] division of Ireland. Accordingly, on 27 January 1979, the first 12-page issue of the merged publications, under the banner of ''An Phoblacht/Republican News'' (AP/RN), appeared under the editorship of [[Danny Morrison (Irish republican)|Danny Morrison]].\n\nIn the final editorial of ''Republican News'' on 20 January 1979, the essential thinking behind the merger was outlined:\n\"To improve on both our reporting and analysis of the war in the North and of popular economic and social struggles in the South... the absolute necessity of one single united paper providing a clear line of republican leadership... [and] the need to overcome any partitionist thinking which results from the British-enforced division of this country and of the Irish people.\"\n\nOn 12 May 1979 ''An Phoblacht'' published extracts from a secret British Ministry of Defence intelligence document which contained a detailed analysis of the [[Provisional IRA]] and the situation in Northern Ireland. The document, written by Brigadier JM Glover, described the IRA as \"highly-professional\" and capable of sustaining their campaign for at least a further five years, and predicted increasing British military casualties. The publication caused considerable embarrassment to the incoming British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland [[Humphrey Atkins]] with [[Danny Morrison (writer)|Danny Morrison]], the paper's editor, forced into hiding for several months. A representative of the [[Press Association]] who was passed a copy of the document by AP/RN was also pursued by the British authorities and forced to flee to the United States.\n\nDuring the 1980s An Phoblacht was to the fore in reporting many issues including allegations of abuse of prisoners in Castlereagh and [[Gough Barracks]], the H-Block and Armagh Prison hunger strikes and also coverage of the ongoing conflict in [[Northern Ireland]]. Miniature versions of the paper which were about a third of the size were also printed and smuggled into prisoners in [[Long Kesh]], [[Portlaoise]], Armagh and other prisons. During the 1981 hunger strike sales of the newspaper reached up to 60,000 copies per-week and some issues quadrupled in size resulting in some editions running to 48 pages long. During this period ''An Phoblacht'' also opened another office based in west Belfast.\n\nIn October 1982 Morrison left the newspaper after being elected to the Northern Assembly for the [[Mid Ulster (Assembly constituency)|Mid-Ulster]] constituency. He was succeeded by Mick Timothy who expanded the newspaper from 12 to 16 pages. Timothy died suddenly in January 1985 and was replaced by [[Rita O'Hare]]. The headquarters of ''An Phoblacht'' was subsequently named after Timothy. During this period ''An Phoblacht'' focused strongly on alleged collusion between the British security forces and loyalist death squads. In response the paper came under attack from deathsquads.\n\nIn the 1980s, top Irish Government officials questioned senior ministers as to why the paper had not been banned under the Offences Against the State Act 1939 and suggested that the publication could be classed a \"treasonable document or seditious document\" and thus make it illegal to send it through the post. The officials also suggested blocking the publication's application for official newspaper status. The [[Attorney General]] at the time dismissed the move.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Hedges & Mark Moloney |url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/22631 |title=\u2018An Phoblacht\u2019 described in Government papers in 1982 as \u2018seditious\u2019 |publisher=An Phoblacht |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref> State papers also revealed that during a meeting on 10 January 1984, the British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Jim Prior]] and Irish Minister for Justice [[Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)|Michael Noonan]] discussed the possibility of banning the publication but recognised that \"if one title was stopped, the same paper could appear under a new title\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Moloney |url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/24653 |title=Banning An Phoblacht \u2013 Fine Gael's Michael Noonan discussed censorship move with British |publisher=An Phoblacht |accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Ulster loyalist attacks===\n\nIn 1991 a group calling itself the ''Loyalist Retaliation and Defence Group'' launched a spate of attacks against newsagents who sold ''An Phoblacht'' and also targeted AP/RN delivery drivers. On 10 August 1991, a 33-year-old shopkeeper (James Carson) was shot dead in his shop on the Falls Road, Belfast. This was followed by the shooting death of a 66-year-old shopkeeper (Lawrence Murchan) on St James's Road on 28 September 1991.

''An Phoblacht'' began with a circulation of 20,000 per month.\n\nLocated at 2a Lower Kevin Street in [[Dublin]]'s south inner city, it moved to the northside of the capital, to [[Kevin Barry]] House, 44 [[Parnell Square]], in August 1972. And in that October it became a fortnightly publication under the editorship of [[\u00c9amonn MacThom\u00e1is]], a writer and historian<ref>Republican who loved his 'darlin' Dublin', ''The Irish Times'' (24 August 2002).</ref> who instituted changes in layout and general improvements so that it became a weekly publication. After 1976, the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], a [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] minister in the [[Fine Gael]]/Labour coalition, strengthened [[Jack Lynch]]'s original 1971 Section 31 censorship directive banning members of the IRA or its political wing Sinn F\u00e9in from the airwaves.  However this ban did not extend to the print media. Section 31 produced a climate where many career journalists engaged in [[self-censorship]] to avoid official opprobrium.\n\n''An Phoblacht'' became more important in disseminating the republican message and highlighting what it saw as the naked state oppression by the Unionist Party and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] in Northern Ireland. However, it was the southern Irish government which harassed ''An Phoblacht'' most stridently, with regular [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] [[Special Detective Unit|Special Branch]] investigations into the publication's links (both real and alleged) to the IRA. Mac Thom\u00e1is was arrested and charged with IRA membership and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment having been found guilty of the offence. The paper continued under the stewardship of Dublin journalist [[Deas\u00fan Breathnach]] until Mac Thom\u00e1is resumed duties on his release in July 1974. Within two months, Mac Thom\u00e1is was again arrested and sentenced to another 15 months. Another editor, [[Coleman Moynihan]], who had succeeded [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]] in 1972, suffered a similar fate. The paper continued on with the succeeding editors being Gerry Danaher (1974\u201375), Gerry O\u2019Hare (1975\u201377), and Deas\u00fan Breathnach (1977\u201379).\n\n===Amalgamation with ''Republican News''===\n{{one source|section|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Pearse Doherty speaking at Bodenstown 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pearse Doherty]] TD delivers the main oration at the annual [[Wolfe Tone]] Commemoration in Bodenstown, 2013. The podium carries a banner advertising An Phoblacht to the audience]]\nThe Republican Movement (Sinn F\u00e9in and the IRA) felt that a single paper for the whole of Ireland was required to provide a clear and coherent line from the leadership and to counter what they regarded as any [[Partitionism|partitionist]] thinking which might flow from the [[United Kingdom|British]] division of Ireland. Accordingly, on 27 January 1979, the first 12-page issue of the merged publications, under the banner of ''An Phoblacht/Republican News'' (AP/RN), appeared under the editorship of [[Danny Morrison (Irish republican)|Danny Morrison]].\n\nIn the final editorial of ''Republican News'' on 20 January 1979, the essential thinking behind the merger was outlined:\n\"To improve on both our reporting and analysis of the war in the North and of popular economic and social struggles in the South... the absolute necessity of one single united paper providing a clear line of republican leadership... [and] the need to overcome any partitionist thinking which results from the British-enforced division of this country and of the Irish people.\"\n\nDuring the 1980s An Phoblacht was to the fore in reporting many issues including allegations of abuse of prisoners in Castlereagh and [[Gough Barracks]], the H-Block and Armagh Prison hunger strikes and also coverage of the ongoing conflict in [[Northern Ireland]]. Miniature versions of the paper which were about a third of the size were also printed and smuggled into prisoners in [[Long Kesh]], [[Portlaoise]], Armagh and other prisons. During the 1981 hunger strike sales of the newspaper reached up to 60,000 copies per-week and some issues quadrupled in size resulting in some editions running to 48 pages long. During this period ''An Phoblacht'' also opened another office based in west Belfast.\n\nOn 12 May 1979 ''An Phoblacht'' published extracts from a secret British Ministry of Defence intelligence document which contained a detailed analysis of the [[Provisional IRA]] and the situation in Northern Ireland. The document, written by Brigadier JM Glover, described the IRA as \"highly-professional\" and capable of sustaining their campaign for at least a further five years, and predicted increasing British military casualties. The publication caused considerable embarrassment to the incoming British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland [[Humphrey Atkins]] with [[Danny Morrison (writer)|Danny Morrison]], the paper's editor, forced into hiding for several months. A representative of the [[Press Association]] who was passed a copy of the document by AP/RN was also pursued by the British authorities and forced to flee to the United States.\n\nIn October 1982 Morrison left the newspaper after being elected to the Northern Assembly for the [[Mid Ulster (Assembly constituency)|Mid-Ulster]] constituency. He was succeeded by Mick Timothy who expanded the newspaper from 12 to 16 pages. Timothy died suddenly in January 1985 and was replaced by [[Rita O'Hare]]. The headquarters of ''An Phoblacht'' was subsequently named after Timothy. During this period ''An Phoblacht'' focused strongly on alleged collusion between the British security forces and loyalist death squads. In response the paper came under attack from deathsquads.\n\nIn the 1980s, top Irish Government officials questioned senior ministers as to why the paper had not been banned under the Offences Against the State Act 1939 and suggested that the publication could be classed a \"treasonable document or seditious document\" and thus make it illegal to send it through the post. The officials also suggested blocking the publication's application for official newspaper status. The [[Attorney General]] at the time dismissed the move.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Hedges & Mark Moloney |url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/22631 |title=\u2018An Phoblacht\u2019 described in Government papers in 1982 as \u2018seditious\u2019 |publisher=An Phoblacht |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref> State papers also revealed that during a meeting on 10 January 1984, the British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Jim Prior]] and Irish Minister for Justice [[Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)|Michael Noonan]] discussed the possibility of banning the publication but recognised that \"if one title was stopped, the same paper could appear under a new title\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Moloney |url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/24653 |title=Banning An Phoblacht \u2013 Fine Gael's Michael Noonan discussed censorship move with British |publisher=An Phoblacht |accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Ulster loyalist attacks===\n\nIn 1991 a group calling itself the ''Loyalist Retaliation and Defence Group'' launched a spate of attacks against newsagents who sold ''An Phoblacht'' and also targeted AP/RN delivery drivers. On 10 August 1991, a 33-year-old shopkeeper (James Carson) was shot dead in his shop on the Falls Road, Belfast. This was followed by the shooting death of a 66-year-old shopkeeper (Lawrence Murchan) on St James's Road on 28 September 1991.
