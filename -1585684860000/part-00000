The harbour is an inlet of the [[Tasman Sea]] (part of the [[South Pacific Ocean]]). It is the location of the [[Sydney Opera House]] and [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. The location of the [[History of Australia|first European settlement and colony]] on the Australian mainland, Port Jackson has continued to play a key role in the history and development of Sydney.\n\nPort Jackson, in the early days of the colony, was also used as a shorthand for Sydney and its environs. Thus, many botanists, see, e.g, [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]'s  ''Prodromus flor\u00e6 Nov\u00e6 Hollandi\u00e6 et Insul\u00e6 Van-Diemen,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/111968|title=Prodromus flor\u00e6 Nov\u00e6 Hollandi\u00e6 et Insul\u00e6 Van-Diemen : exhibens characteres plantarum quas annis 1802-1805 /|last=Brown|first=Robert|publisher=typis R.

[[Sydney Harbour National Park]] protects a number of islands and foreshore areas, swimming spots, bushwalking tracks and picnic areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/parks/sydney-harbour-national-park|title=Sydney Harbour National Park|website=NSW National Parks}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sydney Cove, Port Jackson in the County of Cumberland - F.

The Gadigal inhabited the land stretching along the south side of Port Jackson from what is now South Head, in an arc west to the present Darling Harbour. The Cammeraygal lived on the northern side of the harbour. The area along the southern banks of the [[Parramatta River]] to [[Rose Hill, New South Wales|Rose Hill]] belonged to the Wangal. The Eora inhabited Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), south to the Georges River and west to Parramatta.<ref>Woollarawarre Bennelong quoted by Governor Arthur Phillip in a despatch to Lord Sydney, 13 February 1790 CO201/5, National Archives, Kew (London)</ref>\n\n===Cook's naming of Port Jackson===\nThe first recorded European discovery of Sydney Harbour was by Lieutenant [[James Cook]] in 1770.

Phillip first stayed over night at [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Camp Cove]], then moved down the harbour, landing at Sydney Cove and then Manly Cove before returning to Botany Bay on the afternoon of 24 January. Phillip returned to Sydney Cove in HM Armed Tender ''[[HMS Supply (1759)|Supply]]'' on 26 January 1788, where he established the first [[colony]] in Australia, later to become the city of Sydney.

It spanned the harbour from Green (Laings) Point, [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watsons Bay]] to the [[artillery battery|battery]] at [[Georges Head Battery|Georges Head]], on the other side of the harbour. On the night of 31 May 1942, [[Attack on Sydney Harbour|three Japanese midget submarines]] entered the harbour, one of which became entangled in the western end of the boom net's central section. Unable to free their submarine, the crew detonated charges, killing themselves in the process. A second midget submarine came to grief in Taylor's Bay, the two crew committing suicide. The third submarine fired two torpedoes at [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|USS ''Chicago'']] (both missed) before leaving the harbour. In November 2006, this submarine was found off Sydney's Northern Beaches.<ref>{{cite book\n|chapter-url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?id=5060289\n|chapter=M24 Japanese Midget Submarine wreck site\n|url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/heritagesearch.aspx\n|title=State Heritage Inventory Database\n|author=Office of Environment and Heritage\n|access-date=28 October 2018|author-link=Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[anti-submarine]] boom net was demolished soon after [[World War II]], and all that remains are the foundations of the old boom net winch house, which can be viewed on Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay.

It is 19&nbsp;km long with an area of 55&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The estuary's volume at high tide is 562&nbsp;million cubic metres. The perimeter of the estuary is 317 kilometres.\n\nAccording to the [[Geographical Names Board of New South Wales]], Port Jackson is \"a harbour which comprises all the waters within an imaginary line joining North Head and South Head. Within this harbour lies North Harbour, Middle Harbour and Sydney Harbour.\"<ref>{{NSW GNR|id = ujjtvqWAMa|title = Port Jackson|accessdate = 3 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nPort Jackson extends westward from the single entrance known as [[Sydney Heads]] (North and South Heads) and encompasses all tidal waters within North Harbour, [[Middle Harbour]], Sydney Harbour, [[Darling Harbour]], [[Parramatta River]] and [[Lane Cove River]].<ref>RAN Hydrographic Services Map of Port Jackson published in August 1972.</ref>\n\nThe harbour is heavily embayed. The bays on the south side tend to be wide and rounded, whereas those on the north side are generally narrow inlets.  Many of these bays include [[Beaches in Sydney#Harbour beaches|beaches]].

Some other former islands, including [[Bennelong Point, New South Wales|Bennelong Island]], [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island]] and [[Berry Island, New South Wales|Berry Island]], have subsequently been linked to the shore by land reclamation, though their names often still contain the word \"Island\". Exposed at low tide is [[Sow and Pigs Reef]], a well-known navigation obstacle near the main shipping lane.{{clear}}\n\n===Tributaries and waterways===\n* [[Tank Stream]] was a fresh water course emptying into [[Sydney Cove]]. Today it is little more than a storm water drain but originally it was the fresh water supply for the fledgling colony of New South Wales in the late 18th century. It originated from a swamp to the west of present-day [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and at high tide entered Sydney Cove at the intersection of [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge]] and [[Pitt Street]]s.\n* [[Middle Harbour]] is the northern arm of Port Jackson. It begins as a small creek (Middle Harbour Creek) at St Ives.<ref>UBD Citylink Street Directory Page 155 Map reference F4</ref> It joins the main waterway of Port Jackson between the two headlands, Middle Head and Grotto Point Reserve, adjacent to the Sydney Heads.\n* [[Parramatta River]] is the western arm of Port Jackson. The river begins at confluence of [[Old Toongabbie, New South Wales|Toongabbie Creek]] and Darling Mills Creek west of [[Parramatta]] and joins the main waterway of Port Jackson between Greenwich Point, [[Greenwich, New South Wales|Greenwich]], and Robinsons Point, [[Birchgrove, New South Wales|Birchgrove]].<ref>UBD City Link Street Directory Page191 Map Reference A12</ref>\n* [[Lane Cove River]] rises near Thornleigh and flows generally south for about 15 kilometres (9.3&nbsp;mi). Its catchment area is approximately 95.4 square kilometres (36.8 sq mi).\n* [[Tarban Creek]], a northern tributary of the Parramatta River, enters Port Jackson at Hunters Hill.\n* [[Johnstons Creek (New South Wales)|Johnstons Creek]] is located in the inner-western suburbs of Glebe, Annandale, Forest Lodge and Stanmore. It rises in Stanmore and flows in a generally northward direction towards Rozelle Bay. The creek passes beneath the stands of the now demolished [[Harold Park Paceway]] prior to emptying into Rozelle Bay at Bicentennial Park Glebe. [[Orphan School Creek]] is a tributary of Johnstons Creek.\n* [[Duck River (New South Wales)|Duck River]] is a perennial stream and southern tributary of the Parramatta River.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Sydney Harbour pano at night.jpg|thumb|center|650px|Sydney Harbour at night, with the [[Sydney Opera House|Opera House]] and [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]]]]\n\n===Bridges===\n[[File:Sydney 02 11 2008.JPG|thumbnail|The [[Anzac Bridge]] is on the righthand side with [[Glebe Island]] and [[White Bay, New South Wales|White Bay]] on the lefthand side.

The harbour is an inlet of the [[Tasman Sea]] (part of the [[South Pacific Ocean]]). It is the location of the [[Sydney Opera House]] and [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. The location of the [[History of Australia|first European settlement and colony]] on the Australian mainland, Port Jackson has continued to play a key role in the history and development of Sydney.\n\nPort Jackson, in the early days of the colony, was also used as a shorthand for Sydney and its environs. Thus, many botanists, see, e.g, [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]'s  ''Prodromus flor\u00e6 Nov\u00e6 Hollandi\u00e6 et Insul\u00e6 Van-Diemen,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/111968|title=Prodromus flor\u00e6 Nov\u00e6 Hollandi\u00e6 et Insul\u00e6 Van-Diemen : exhibens characteres plantarum quas annis 1802-1805 /|last=Brown|first=Robert|publisher=typis R.

It spanned the harbour from Green (Laings) Point, [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watsons Bay]] to the [[artillery battery|battery]] at [[Georges Head Battery|Georges Head]], on the other side of the harbour. On the night of 31 May 1942, [[Attack on Sydney Harbour|three Japanese midget submarines]] entered the harbour, one of which became entangled in the western end of the boom net's central section. Unable to free their submarine, the crew detonated charges, killing themselves in the process. A second midget submarine came to grief in Taylor's Bay, the two crew committing suicide. The third submarine fired two torpedoes at [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|USS ''Chicago'']] (both missed) before leaving the harbour.

August 28, 1963]]\n\nJohn Lewis was the youngest of the \"Big Six\" leaders as chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) from 1963 to 1966, some of the most tumultuous years of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. During his tenure, SNCC opened [[Freedom Schools]], launched the Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], and organized some of the voter registration efforts during the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma voting rights campaign]]. As the chairman of SNCC, Lewis had written a speech in reaction to the Civil Rights Bill of 1963. He denounced the bill because it didn't protect African Americans against police brutality or provide African Americans with the right to vote.\n\nLewis graduated from the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville and then received a bachelor's degree in Religion and Philosophy from Fisk University. As a student, he was very dedicated to the Civil Rights Movement. He organized [[sit-ins]] at segregated lunch counters in Nashville and took part in many other civil rights activities as part of the [[Nashville Student Movement]]. He was instrumental in organizing student sit-ins, bus [[boycotts]] and [[nonviolent]] protests in the fight for voter and racial equality.\n\nIn 1960, Lewis became one of the 13 original [[Freedom Riders]]. There were seven whites and six blacks who were determined to ride from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans in an integrated fashion. At that time, several states of the old Confederacy still enforced laws prohibiting black and white riders from sitting next to each other on public transportation. The Freedom Ride, originated by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] and revived by [[James Farmer]] and CORE, was initiated to pressure the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'' (1960) that declared segregated interstate bus travel to be unconstitutional. In the South, Lewis and other nonviolent Freedom Riders were beaten by angry mobs, arrested at times and taken to jail. When CORE gave up on the Freedom Ride because of the violence, Lewis and fellow activist [[Diane Nash]] arranged for the Nashville students to take it over and bring it to a successful conclusion.\n\nIn 1963, when Chuck McDew stepped down as SNCC chairman, Lewis, one of the founding members of SNCC, was quickly elected to take over. Lewis's experience at that point was already widely respected. His courage and his tenacious adherence to the philosophy of reconciliation and nonviolence made him emerge as a leader. By this time, he had been arrested 24 times in the nonviolent struggle for equal justice. He held the post of chairman until 1966.[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march) - NARA - 542056.jpg|thumb|left|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march)]]\n\nIn 1963, as chairman of SNCC Lewis was named one of the \"Big Six\" leaders who were organizing the [[March on Washington]], the occasion of Dr. King's celebrated \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, along with [[Whitney Young]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[James Farmer]] and [[Roy Wilkins]]. Lewis also spoke at the March. Discussing the occasion, historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote: \"At the great Washington March of 1963, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), John Lewis, speaking to the same enormous crowd that heard [[Martin Luther King]]'s ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, was prepared to ask the right question: 'Which side is the federal government on?' That sentence was eliminated from his speech by organizers of the March to avoid offending the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy Administration]]. But Lewis and his fellow SNCC workers had experienced, again and again, the strange passivity of the national government in the face of Southern violence.\"<ref name=FreedomAlbany>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|title=My Name Is Freedom Albany, Georgia|format=reprint|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|location=Boston|work=You Can't Be Neutral on A Moving Train |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/19990219104007/http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|archivedate=February 19, 1999}}</ref> At 23 he was the youngest speaker that day and is the last remaining living speaker.<ref name=\"scholastic\">{{cite news|title=The Sixties|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Junior Scholastic]]|date=February 11, 1994|page=6<!--|accessdate=December 1, 2008-->}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Lewis 1964-04-16 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lewis in 1964]]\nIn 1964, Lewis coordinated SNCC's efforts for \"[[Mississippi Freedom Summer]],\" a campaign to register black voters across the South. The Freedom Summer was an attempt to expose college students from around the country to the perils of African-American life in the South. Lewis traveled the country encouraging students to spend their summer break trying to help people in Mississippi, the most recalcitrant state in the union, to register and vote. Lewis became nationally known during his prominent role in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] when, on March 7, 1965 \u2013 a day that would become known as \"[[Selma to Montgomery marches#\"Bloody Sunday\" events|Bloody Sunday]]\" \u2013 Lewis and fellow activist [[Hosea Williams]] led over 600 marchers across the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. At the end of the bridge, they were met by [[Alabama Highway Patrol|Alabama State Troopers]] who ordered them to disperse. When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged [[tear gas]] and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with night sticks. Lewis's skull was fractured, but he escaped across the bridge to [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]], the movement's headquarter church in Selma. Before Lewis could be taken to the hospital, he appeared before the television cameras calling on [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] to intervene in Alabama. Lewis bears scars on his head from the incident.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Rustin Young Ryan Farmer Lewis.jpg|thumb|Lewis (far right) with [[Bayard Rustin]], [[Andrew Young]], Congressman [[William Fitts Ryan]], and [[James Farmer]] 1965]]\n[[File:50th Anniversary of the Selma Marches - Former President George W Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush participated in the program (cropped to Obama and Bush couples).jpg|thumb|50th Anniversary of the 1965 Selma Marches \u2013 Former First Lady Laura Bush, Former First Lady Michelle Obama, Former President Barack Obama, John Lewis, and Former President George W.

Kennedy, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, Walter Reuther, Whitney Young, Floyd McKissick. Not in order: Roy Wilkins. August 28, 1963]]\n\nJohn Lewis was the youngest of the \"Big Six\" leaders as chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) from 1963 to 1966, some of the most tumultuous years of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. During his tenure, SNCC opened [[Freedom Schools]], launched the Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], and organized some of the voter registration efforts during the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma voting rights campaign]]. As the chairman of SNCC, Lewis had written a speech in reaction to the Civil Rights Bill of 1963. He denounced the bill because it didn't protect African Americans against police brutality or provide African Americans with the right to vote.\n\nLewis graduated from the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville and then received a bachelor's degree in Religion and Philosophy from Fisk University. As a student, he was very dedicated to the Civil Rights Movement. He organized [[sit-ins]] at segregated lunch counters in Nashville and took part in many other civil rights activities as part of the [[Nashville Student Movement]]. He was instrumental in organizing student sit-ins, bus [[boycotts]] and [[nonviolent]] protests in the fight for voter and racial equality.\n\nIn 1960, Lewis became one of the 13 original [[Freedom Riders]]. There were seven whites and six blacks who were determined to ride from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans in an integrated fashion. At that time, several states of the old Confederacy still enforced laws prohibiting black and white riders from sitting next to each other on public transportation. The Freedom Ride, originated by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] and revived by [[James Farmer]] and CORE, was initiated to pressure the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'' (1960) that declared segregated interstate bus travel to be unconstitutional. In the South, Lewis and other nonviolent Freedom Riders were beaten by angry mobs, arrested at times and taken to jail. When CORE gave up on the Freedom Ride because of the violence, Lewis and fellow activist [[Diane Nash]] arranged for the Nashville students to take it over and bring it to a successful conclusion.\n\nIn 1963, when Chuck McDew stepped down as SNCC chairman, Lewis, one of the founding members of SNCC, was quickly elected to take over. Lewis's experience at that point was already widely respected. His courage and his tenacious adherence to the philosophy of reconciliation and nonviolence made him emerge as a leader. By this time, he had been arrested 24 times in the nonviolent struggle for equal justice. He held the post of chairman until 1966.[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march) - NARA - 542056.jpg|thumb|left|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march)]]\n\nIn 1963, as chairman of SNCC Lewis was named one of the \"Big Six\" leaders who were organizing the [[March on Washington]], the occasion of Dr. King's celebrated \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, along with [[Whitney Young]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[James Farmer]] and [[Roy Wilkins]]. Lewis also spoke at the March. Discussing the occasion, historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote: \"At the great Washington March of 1963, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), John Lewis, speaking to the same enormous crowd that heard [[Martin Luther King]]'s ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, was prepared to ask the right question: 'Which side is the federal government on?' That sentence was eliminated from his speech by organizers of the March to avoid offending the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy Administration]]. But Lewis and his fellow SNCC workers had experienced, again and again, the strange passivity of the national government in the face of Southern violence.\"<ref name=FreedomAlbany>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|title=My Name Is Freedom Albany, Georgia|format=reprint|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|location=Boston|work=You Can't Be Neutral on A Moving Train |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/19990219104007/http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|archivedate=February 19, 1999}}</ref> At 23 he was the youngest speaker that day and is the last remaining living speaker.<ref name=\"scholastic\">{{cite news|title=The Sixties|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Junior Scholastic]]|date=February 11, 1994|page=6<!--|accessdate=December 1, 2008-->}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Lewis 1964-04-16 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lewis in 1964]]\nIn 1964, Lewis coordinated SNCC's efforts for \"[[Mississippi Freedom Summer]],\" a campaign to register black voters across the South. The Freedom Summer was an attempt to expose college students from around the country to the perils of African-American life in the South. Lewis traveled the country encouraging students to spend their summer break trying to help people in Mississippi, the most recalcitrant state in the union, to register and vote. Lewis became nationally known during his prominent role in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] when, on March 7, 1965 \u2013 a day that would become known as \"[[Selma to Montgomery marches#\"Bloody Sunday\" events|Bloody Sunday]]\" \u2013 Lewis and fellow activist [[Hosea Williams]] led over 600 marchers across the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. At the end of the bridge, they were met by [[Alabama Highway Patrol|Alabama State Troopers]] who ordered them to disperse. When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged [[tear gas]] and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with night sticks. Lewis's skull was fractured, but he escaped across the bridge to [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]], the movement's headquarter church in Selma. Before Lewis could be taken to the hospital, he appeared before the television cameras calling on [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] to intervene in Alabama. Lewis bears scars on his head from the incident.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Rustin Young Ryan Farmer Lewis.jpg|thumb|Lewis (far right) with [[Bayard Rustin]], [[Andrew Young]], Congressman [[William Fitts Ryan]], and [[James Farmer]] 1965]]\n[[File:50th Anniversary of the Selma Marches - Former President George W Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush participated in the program (cropped to Obama and Bush couples).jpg|thumb|50th Anniversary of the 1965 Selma Marches \u2013 Former First Lady Laura Bush, Former First Lady Michelle Obama, Former President Barack Obama, John Lewis, and Former President George W.

He tried to enter a whites-only waiting room and two white men attacked him, injuring his face and kicking him in the ribs.

Margetson.png|thumb|[[King Arthur|Arthur]] in [[William Henry Margetson]]'s illustration for ''Legends of King Arthur and His Knights'' (1914)]]\n\n'''King Arthur's Morgan's family''' grew throughout the centuries with [[King Arthur]]'s legend. Several of the legendary members of this mythical king's family became leading characters of mythical tales in their own right.\n\n==Medieval Welsh tradition==\n[[File:Uther Pendragon by W. H. Margetson.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Uther Pendragon]] by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]\n\nIn Welsh Arthurian pre-Galfridian tradition, that is from before the time of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th-century ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), Arthur was granted numerous relations and family members. Several early Welsh sources are usually taken as indicative of [[Uther Pendragon]] being known as Arthur's father before Geoffrey wrote, with Arthur also being granted a brother ([[Madoc ap Uthyr|Madog]]) and a nephew ([[Eliwlod]]) in these texts.<ref>T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.145\u201351; P. Sims-Williams, \"The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems\" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33\u201371 at pp.53-4.</ref> Arthur also appears to have been assigned a sister in this material \u2013 [[Gawain|Gwalchmei]] is named as his sister-son (nephew) in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', his mother being one Gwyar.<ref>R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.372\u20133.</ref> ''Culhwch and Olwen'', the ''Vita Iltuti'' and the ''[[Brut Dingestow]]'' combine to suggest that Arthur had a mother too, named [[Igraine|Eigyr]].<ref>R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5.</ref>\n\nIn addition to this immediate family, Arthur was said to have had a great variety of more distant relatives, including maternal aunts, uncles, cousins and a grandfather named [[Amlawdd Wledig|Anlawd (or Amlawdd) Wledig]] (\"Prince Anlawd\"). The latter is the common link between many of these figures and Arthur: thus the relationship of first cousins that is implied or stated between Arthur, [[Culhwch]], [[Illtud]], and Goreu mab Custenhin depends upon all of their mothers being daughters of this Anlawd, who appears to be ultimately a genealogical construct designed to allow such inter-relationships between characters to be postulated by medieval Welsh authors.<ref>R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5</ref> Arthur's maternal uncles in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', including Llygatrud Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyt Ennwir and Gweir Baladir Hir, similarly appear to derive from this relationship.<ref>These maternal uncles are named at lines 251-2, 288-90: R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992).</ref>\n\nThe genealogies from the 13th-century Mostyn MS. 117 assert that Arthur is the son of [[Uther Pendragon|Uthyr]], the son of Custennin, the son of Cynfawr, the son of Tudwal, the son of Morfawr, the son of Eudaf, the son of Cadwr, the son of Cynan, the son of [[Caradog ap Bran|Caradoc]], the son of [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]], the son of [[Ll\u0177r]]. Regarding Arthur's own family, his wife is consistently stated to be [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]], usually the daughter of King [[Leodegrance|Ogrfan Gawr]] (variation: 'Gogrfan Gawr', \"[G]Ogrfan the Giant\") and sister to [[Gwenhwyach]], although ''Culhwch'' and ''Bonedd yr Arwyr'' do indicate that Arthur also had some sort of relationship with Eleirch daughter of Iaen, which produced a son named Kyduan (Cydfan).<ref>See T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.151\u20135; R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.76\u20137, 107-08 -- the latter note that the sons of Iaen appear to have been kinsmen of Arthur on ''their'' father's side, not Arthur's father's side, i.e. they were Arthur's in-laws via their sister.</ref> Kyduan was not the only child of Arthur according to Welsh Arthurian tradition \u2013 he is also ascribed sons called Amr (Amhar),<ref>''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]] and also the romance ''[[Geraint and Enid]]'', which mentions an \"Amhar son of Arthur\".</ref> Gwydre,<ref>R.

Margetson.png|thumb|upright|[[Guinevere]] by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]\n\nRelatively few members of Arthur's family in the Welsh materials are carried over to the works of Geoffrey of Monmouth and [[Chivalric romance|chivalric romancers]]. His grandfather Anlawd Wledic and his maternal uncles, aunts and cousins do not appear there, and neither do any of his sons or his paternal relatives. Only the core family seem to have made the transition: his wife Gwenhwyfar (who became [[Guinevere]]), his father [[Uther]], his mother ([[Igraine|Igerna]]) and his sister-son Gwalchmei ([[Gawain]]). Gwalchmei's mother \u2013 Arthur's sister \u2013 failed to make the journey, Gwyar's place being taken by Anna, the wife of [[King Lot|Loth]], in Geoffrey's account, whilst Medraut ([[Mordred]]) is made into a second sister-son for Arthur (a status he does not have in the Welsh material).<ref>B. F. Roberts, \"Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' and ''Brut Y Brenhinedd''\" in R. Bromwich, A. O. H. Jarman and B. F. Roberts (edd.)

Margetson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Morgan le Fay]] by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]\n\nIn addition, new family members enter the Arthurian tradition from this point onwards. Uther is given a new family, including two brothers and a father,<ref>Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|Book 8.1]].</ref> while Arthur gains a sister or half-sister, [[Morgan le Fay]], first named as his relative by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion|Yvain]].''<ref>''Arthurian Romances'' trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991)</ref> A new son of Arthur, named Loholt, is introduced in Chr\u00e9tien's ''[[Erec and Enide]]''[[Erec and Enide|.]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780192837936|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780192837936/page/428 428]|title=Lancelot of the Lake|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192837936|language=en}}</ref> Another significant new family-member is Arthur's other sister or half-sister initially known as Orcades ([[Morgause]]), the daughter of Gorlois and Igerna (Igraine) and mother of Gawain and Mordred in the romances (replacing Anna in this role). A third half-sister, [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine of Garlot|Elaine]], is also added at this time. Through the sisters, Arthur is given further nephews ([[Agravain]], [[Gaheris]] and [[Gareth]] by Morgause, [[Galeschin]] by Elaine, and [[Yvain]] by Morgan), who all become Knights of the [[Round Table]]. Various works also mention or feature his nieces.\n\nThere are furthermore various other more distant family members, such as the case of the historical Romano-British leader [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] being turned into his uncle (Uther's brother) in Goeffrey's tradition deriving Arthur's lineage from the self-proclaimed Western Roman Emperor [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine II of Britain]], who in this version of the legend is presented as Arthur's grandfather. One important figure of no actual blood relation to Arthur is [[Sir Ector|Ector]], who in the stories of Arthur's incognito youth is often secretly his adoptive father following the death of Uther soon after his birth.\n\n==Offspring==\nAlthough Arthur is given sons in both early and late Arthurian tales, he is rarely granted significant further generations of descendants. This is at least partly because of the premature deaths of his sons, who in the later tradition usually (and prominently) include Mordred.\n\nAmr is the first to be mentioned in Arthurian literature, appearing in the 9th-century ''[[History of the Britons|Historia Brittonum]]'': \"There is another wonder in the region which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; and the name of the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it sometimes six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length \u2013 and I myself have put this to the test.\"<ref>''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]].</ref> Why Arthur chose to kill his son is never made clear. The only other reference to Amr comes in the post-Galfridian Welsh romance ''[[Geraint and Enid|Geraint]]'', where \"Amhar son of Arthur\" is one of Arthur\u2019s four chamberlains along with [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]]'s son Amhren.<ref>T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), p.231.</ref>\n\nGwydre is similarly unlucky, being slaughtered by the giant boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', along with two of Arthur's maternal uncles - no other references to either Gwydre or Arthur's uncles survive.<ref>R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116\u20137 and note on Gwydre; T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), pp.132, 134.</ref> Another son, known only from a possibly 15th-century Welsh text, is said to have died on the field of [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]]:\n\n:Sandde Bryd Angel drive the crow / off the face of ?Duran [son of Arthur].\n:Dearly and belovedly his mother raised him.\n::Arthur sang it<ref>J. Rowland, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion'' (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250-1.</ref>\n\nMore is known of Arthur's son Llacheu. He is one of the \"Three Well-Endowed Men of the Island of Britain\", according to the [[Welsh Triads|Triad]] 4, and he fights alongside [[Sir Kay|Cei]] in the early Arthurian poem ''[[Pa gur|Pa gur yv y porthaur?]]''.<ref>R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), no. 4; P. Sims-Williams, \"The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems\" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33\u201371 at p.43.</ref> Like his father is in ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', Llacheu appears in the 12th-century and later Welsh poetry as a standard of heroic comparison and he also seems to have been similarly a figure of local topographic folklore too.<ref>[[O. J. Padel]], ''Arthur in Medieval Welsh Literature'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), pp.55\u20136, 99; P. Sims-Williams, \"The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems\" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33\u201371 at p.4.4.</ref> Taken together, it is generally agreed that all these references indicate that Llacheu was a figure of considerable importance in the early Arthurian cycle.<ref>T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.168-9.</ref> Nonetheless, Llacheu too dies, with the speaker in the pre-Galfridian poem ''Ymddiddan Gwayddno Garanhir ac Gwyn fab Nudd'' remembering that he had \"been where Llacheu was slain / the son of Arthur, awful in songs / when ravens croaked over blood.\"<ref>J.B. Coe and S. Young, ''The Celtic Sources for the Arthurian Legend'' (Llanerch, 1995), p.125</ref>\n\nThe romances' Loholt (Lohot) usually appears as a son by Guinevere in the works such as ''[[Lanzelet]]'' and ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', but in the [[Vulgate Cycle]] he is Arthur's illegitimate son by Lyzianor (Lionors).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>''Arthurian Romances'' trans.

Mordred, like Amr, is killed by Arthur \u2013 at Camlann \u2013 according to Geoffrey of Monmouth and the post-Galfridian tradition but, unlike the others, he is ascribed [[Sons of Mordred|two sons]], both of whom rose against Arthur's successor and cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine III]] with the help of the Saxons. However, in Geoffrey's ''Historia'' (when Arthur's killing of Mordred and Mordred's sons first appear), Mordred was not yet actually Arthur's son.<ref>Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 11#2|Book 11.2-4]].</ref> His relationship with Arthur was once more reinterpreted in the Vulgate Cycle, as he was made the result of an unwitting incest between Arthur and his sister.<ref>''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'' trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols.</ref> This tale is preserved in the later romances, with the motif of Arthur knowing that Mordred would grow up to kill him, and so by the time of Malory's ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' Arthur has devised a plot, [[Herod the Great|Herod]]-like, to kill all children born on the same day as Mordred in order to save himself from this fate (unsuccessfully).<ref>See A. Varin, \"Mordred, King Arthur's Son\" in ''Folklore'' 90 (1979), pp.167\u201377 on Mordred's birth, its origins and Arthur's reaction to his dream.</ref> \n\nLater literature has expanded Arthur's family further. [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s 16th-century romance ''[[Tom a Lincoln]]'' adds another illegitimate son, the eponymous Tom. Through Tom, Arthur is also given grandsons referred to only as the [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]] and Faerie Knight. Other works, such as [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'', [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Bridal of Triermain]]'' and modern adaptations of Arthurian legend, have occasionally given Arthur daughters, diverging from the earlier legends.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Bromwich, R.

Margetson.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Uther Pendragon]] by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]\n\nIn Welsh Arthurian pre-Galfridian tradition, that is from before the time of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th-century ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), Arthur was granted numerous relations and family members. Several early Welsh sources are usually taken as indicative of [[Uther Pendragon]] being known as Arthur's father before Geoffrey wrote, with Arthur also being granted a brother ([[Madoc ap Uthyr|Madog]]) and a nephew ([[Eliwlod]]) in these texts.<ref>T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.145\u201351; P. Sims-Williams, \"The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems\" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33\u201371 at pp.53-4.</ref> Arthur also appears to have been assigned a sister in this material \u2013 [[Gawain|Gwalchmei]] is named as his sister-son (nephew) in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', his mother being one Gwyar.<ref>R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.372\u20133.</ref> ''Culhwch and Olwen'', the ''Vita Iltuti'' and the ''[[Brut Dingestow]]'' combine to suggest that Arthur had a mother too, named [[Igraine|Eigyr]].<ref>R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5.</ref>\n\nIn addition to this immediate family, Arthur was said to have had a great variety of more distant relatives, including maternal aunts, uncles, cousins and a grandfather named [[Amlawdd Wledig|Anlawd (or Amlawdd) Wledig]] (\"Prince Anlawd\"). The latter is the common link between many of these figures and Arthur: thus the relationship of first cousins that is implied or stated between Arthur, [[Culhwch]], [[Illtud]], and Goreu mab Custenhin depends upon all of their mothers being daughters of this Anlawd, who appears to be ultimately a genealogical construct designed to allow such inter-relationships between characters to be postulated by medieval Welsh authors.<ref>R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5</ref> Arthur's maternal uncles in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', including Llygatrud Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyt Ennwir and Gweir Baladir Hir, similarly appear to derive from this relationship.<ref>These maternal uncles are named at lines 251-2, 288-90: R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992).</ref>\n\nThe genealogies from the 13th-century Mostyn MS. 117 assert that Arthur is the son of [[Uther Pendragon|Uthyr]], the son of Custennin, the son of Cynfawr, the son of Tudwal, the son of Morfawr, the son of Eudaf, the son of Cadwr, the son of Cynan, the son of [[Caradog ap Bran|Caradoc]], the son of [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]], the son of [[Ll\u0177r]]. Regarding Arthur's own family, his wife is consistently stated to be [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]], usually the daughter of King [[Leodegrance|Ogrfan Gawr]] (variation: 'Gogrfan Gawr', \"[G]Ogrfan the Giant\") and sister to [[Gwenhwyach]], although ''Culhwch'' and ''Bonedd yr Arwyr'' do indicate that Arthur also had some sort of relationship with Eleirch daughter of Iaen, which produced a son named Kyduan (Cydfan).<ref>See T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.151\u20135; R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen.

Margetson.png|thumb|upright|[[Guinevere]] by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]\n\nRelatively few members of Arthur's family in the Welsh materials are carried over to the works of Geoffrey of Monmouth and [[Chivalric romance|chivalric romancers]]. His grandfather Anlawd Wledic and his maternal uncles, aunts and cousins do not appear there, and neither do any of his sons or his paternal relatives. Only the core family seem to have made the transition: his wife Gwenhwyfar (who became [[Guinevere]]), his father [[Uther]], his mother ([[Igraine|Igerna]]) and his sister-son Gwalchmei ([[Gawain]]). Gwalchmei's mother \u2013 Arthur's sister \u2013 failed to make the journey, Gwyar's place being taken by Anna, the wife of [[King Lot|Loth]], in Geoffrey's account, whilst Medraut ([[Mordred]]) is made into a second sister-son for Arthur (a status he does not have in the Welsh material).<ref>B. F. Roberts, \"Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' and ''Brut Y Brenhinedd''\" in R. Bromwich, A. O. H. Jarman and B. F. Roberts (edd.)

Margetson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Morgan le Fay]] by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]\n\nIn addition, new family members enter the Arthurian tradition from this point onwards. Uther is given a new family, including two brothers and a father,<ref>Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|Book 8.1]].</ref> while Arthur gains a sister or half-sister, [[Morgan le Fay]], first named as his relative by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion|Yvain]].''<ref>''Arthurian Romances'' trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991)</ref> A new son of Arthur, named Loholt, is introduced in Chr\u00e9tien's ''[[Erec and Enide]]''[[Erec and Enide|.]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780192837936|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780192837936/page/428 428]|title=Lancelot of the Lake|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192837936|language=en}}</ref> Another significant new family-member is Arthur's other sister or half-sister initially known as Orcades ([[Morgause]]), the daughter of Gorlois and Igerna (Igraine) and mother of Gawain and Mordred in the romances (replacing Anna in this role). A third half-sister, [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine of Garlot|Elaine]], is also added at this time. Through the sisters, Arthur is given further nephews ([[Agravain]], [[Gaheris]] and [[Gareth]] by Morgause, [[Galeschin]] by Elaine, and [[Yvain]] by Morgan), who all become Knights of the [[Round Table]]. Various works also mention or feature his nieces.\n\nThere are furthermore various other more distant family members, such as the case of the historical Romano-British leader [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] being turned into his uncle (Uther's brother) in Goeffrey's tradition deriving Arthur's lineage from the self-proclaimed Western Roman Emperor [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine II of Britain]], who in this version of the legend is presented as Arthur's grandfather. One important figure of no actual blood relation to Arthur is [[Sir Ector|Ector]], who in the stories of Arthur's incognito youth is often secretly his adoptive father following the death of Uther soon after his birth.\n\n==Offspring==\nAlthough Arthur is given sons in both early and late Arthurian tales, he is rarely granted significant further generations of descendants. This is at least partly because of the premature deaths of his sons, who in the later tradition usually (and prominently) include Mordred.\n\nAmr is the first to be mentioned in Arthurian literature, appearing in the 9th-century ''[[History of the Britons|Historia Brittonum]]'': \"There is another wonder in the region which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; and the name of the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it sometimes six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length \u2013 and I myself have put this to the test.\"<ref>''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]].</ref> Why Arthur chose to kill his son is never made clear. The only other reference to Amr comes in the post-Galfridian Welsh romance ''[[Geraint and Enid|Geraint]]'', where \"Amhar son of Arthur\" is one of Arthur\u2019s four chamberlains along with [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]]'s son Amhren.<ref>T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), p.231.</ref>\n\nGwydre is similarly unlucky, being slaughtered by the giant boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', along with two of Arthur's maternal uncles - no other references to either Gwydre or Arthur's uncles survive.<ref>R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116\u20137 and note on Gwydre; T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), pp.132, 134.</ref> Another son, known only from a possibly 15th-century Welsh text, is said to have died on the field of [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]]:\n\n:Sandde Bryd Angel drive the crow / off the face of ?Duran [son of Arthur].\n:Dearly and belovedly his mother raised him.\n::Arthur sang it<ref>J. Rowland, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion'' (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250-1.</ref>\n\nMore is known of Arthur's son Llacheu. He is one of the \"Three Well-Endowed Men of the Island of Britain\", according to the [[Welsh Triads|Triad]] 4, and he fights alongside [[Sir Kay|Cei]] in the early Arthurian poem ''[[Pa gur|Pa gur yv y porthaur?]]''.<ref>R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), no. 4; P. Sims-Williams, \"The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems\" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33\u201371 at p.43.</ref> Like his father is in ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', Llacheu appears in the 12th-century and later Welsh poetry as a standard of heroic comparison and he also seems to have been similarly a figure of local topographic folklore too.<ref>[[O. J. Padel]], ''Arthur in Medieval Welsh Literature'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), pp.55\u20136, 99; P. Sims-Williams, \"The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems\" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33\u201371 at p.4.4.</ref> Taken together, it is generally agreed that all these references indicate that Llacheu was a figure of considerable importance in the early Arthurian cycle.<ref>T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.168-9.</ref> Nonetheless, Llacheu too dies, with the speaker in the pre-Galfridian poem ''Ymddiddan Gwayddno Garanhir ac Gwyn fab Nudd'' remembering that he had \"been where Llacheu was slain / the son of Arthur, awful in songs / when ravens croaked over blood.\"<ref>J.B. Coe and S. Young, ''The Celtic Sources for the Arthurian Legend'' (Llanerch, 1995), p.125</ref>\n\nThe romances' Loholt (Lohot) usually appears as a son by Guinevere in the works such as ''[[Lanzelet]]'' and ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', but in the [[Vulgate Cycle]] he is Arthur's illegitimate son by Lyzianor (Lionors).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>''Arthurian Romances'' trans.

Mordred, like Amr, is killed by Arthur \u2013 at Camlann \u2013 according to Geoffrey of Monmouth and the post-Galfridian tradition but, unlike the others, he is ascribed [[Sons of Mordred|two sons]], both of whom rose against Arthur's successor and cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine III]] with the help of the Saxons. However, in Geoffrey's ''Historia'' (when Arthur's killing of Mordred and Mordred's sons first appear), Mordred was not yet actually Arthur's son.<ref>Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 11#2|Book 11.2-4]].</ref> His relationship with Arthur was once more reinterpreted in the Vulgate Cycle, as he was made the result of an unwitting incest between Arthur and his sister.<ref>''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'' trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols.</ref> This tale is preserved in the later romances, with the motif of Arthur knowing that Mordred would grow up to kill him, and so by the time of Malory's ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' Arthur has devised a plot, [[Herod the Great|Herod]]-like, to kill all children born on the same day as Mordred in order to save himself from this fate (unsuccessfully).<ref>See A. Varin, \"Mordred, King Arthur's Son\" in ''Folklore'' 90 (1979), pp.167\u201377 on Mordred's birth, its origins and Arthur's reaction to his dream.</ref> \n\nLater literature has expanded Arthur's family further. [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s 16th-century romance ''[[Tom a Lincoln]]'' adds another illegitimate son, the eponymous Tom. Through Tom, Arthur is also given grandsons referred to only as the [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]] and Faerie Knight. Other works, such as [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'', [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Bridal of Triermain]]'' and modern adaptations of Arthurian legend, have occasionally given Arthur daughters, diverging from the earlier legends.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Bromwich, R.

It came from the [[Middle Dutch]] \"bluyster\" and was a modification of the [[Old French]] \"blostre\", which meant a leprous nodule\u2014a rise in the skin due to [[leprosy]]. In [[dermatology]] today, the words [[cutaneous condition#Vesicle|''vesicle'' and ''bulla'']] refer to blisters of smaller or greater size, respectively.\n\nTo heal properly, a blister should not be popped unless medically necessary. If popped, the excess skin should not be removed because the skin underneath needs that top layer to heal properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blister-treatment|title=Blister Treatments and Prevention|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\nA blister may form when the skin has been damaged by [[friction]] or rubbing, heat, cold or chemical exposure. Fluid collects between the upper layers of [[skin]] (the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) and the layers below (the [[dermis]]). This fluid cushions the tissue underneath, protecting it from further damage and allowing it to heal.\n\n===Friction or rubbing===\n[[File:Friction Blisters On Human Foot.jpg|thumb|Various sized blisters on the sole of a foot due to friction]]\nIntense rubbing can cause a blister, as can any friction on the skin if continued long enough. This kind of blister is most common after walking long distances or by wearing old or poorly fitting shoes.<ref name=\"Naylor1\">[Naylor PFD. \"The Skin Surface and Friction,\" ''[[British Journal of Dermatology]]''. 1955;67:239\u2013248.]</ref><ref name=\"Naylor2\">[Naylor PFD. \"Experimental Friction Blisters,\" British Journal of Dermatology. 1955;67:327\u2013342.]</ref><ref name=Sulzberger>[Sulzberger MB, Cortese TA, Fishman L, Wiley HS. \"Studies on Blisters Produced by Friction,\" Journal of Investigative Dermatology. 1966;47:456\u2013465.]</ref> Blisters are most common on the hands and feet, as these extremities are susceptible while walking, running, or performing repetitive motions, such as joystick manipulation whilst playing certain video games, digging with a shovel, playing guitar or bass, etc. Blisters form more easily on damp skin than on dry or soaked skin,<ref name=\"Carlson1\">[Carlson JM. \"The Friction Factor,\" OrthoKinetic Review. Nov/Dec 2001;1(7):1\u20133.]</ref> and are more common in warm conditions. Less-aggressive rubbing over long periods of time may cause [[calluses]] to form rather than a blister. Both blisters and calluses can lead to more serious complications, such as foot [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ation and infection, particularly when sensation or circulation is impaired, as in the case of [[diabetes]], [[neuropathy]] or [[peripheral artery disease]] (PAD).\n\n===Extreme temperature===\n[[File:Second degree burn after 2 days.JPG|thumb|upright|Blister|A blister caused by [[Scalding|burning]].]]\nThis type of blistering is one of the tools used to determine the degree of burns sustained. First and second degree [[burn]]s may result in blistered skin; however, it is characteristic of second degree burns to blister immediately, whereas first degree burns can have blisters after a couple of days. Blisters can also form on the hands and feet as a result of tissue damage incurred by [[frostbite]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uuhsc.utah.edu/burncenter/emergencycare/firstdegree.html |title=First Degree Burns |publisher=Uuhsc.utah.edu |accessdate=2012-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218230119/http://uuhsc.utah.edu/burncenter/emergencycare/firstdegree.html |archivedate=2012-02-18 }}</ref>\n\n===Chemical exposure===\n[[Image:blister-arm.jpg|right|thumb|Blisters caused by exposure to [[sulfur mustard]] agent.]]\n\nSometimes, the skin will blister when it comes into contact with a cosmetic, detergent, solvent, or other chemical such as [[nickel sulfate]], [[Balsam of Peru]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pxnKBrfwTFYC&pg=PT923 |title=Conn's Current Therapy 2011|work=google.com}}</ref> or [[urushiol]] ([[poison ivy]], [[poison oak]], [[poison sumac]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049342.htm|title=Consumer Updates - Outsmarting Poison Ivy and Other Poisonous Plants|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.fda.gov}}</ref> This is known as [[contact dermatitis]]. Blisters can also develop as a result of an allergic reaction to an insect bite or sting.  Some [[chemical warfare]] agents, known as [[blister agents]] or vesicants, cause large, painful blisters wherever they contact skin; an example is [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]].\n\n===Crushing/pinching===\nA [[blood blister]] usually forms when a minute [[blood vessel]] close to \nthe surface of the skin ruptures (breaks), and blood leaks into a tear between the layers of skin. This can happen if the skin is crushed, pinched or aggressively squeezed.\n\n===Medical conditions===\nThere are also a number of medical conditions that cause blisters. The most common are [[chickenpox]], [[herpes simplex|herpes]], [[impetigo]], and a form of [[eczema]] called [[dyshidrosis]]. Other, much rarer conditions that cause blisters include:\n\n* [[Bullous pemphigoid]]: a skin disease that causes large, tightly filled blisters to develop, usually affecting people over the age of 60.\n* [[Pemphigus]]: a serious skin disease in which blisters develop if pressure is applied to the skin; the blisters burst easily, leaving raw areas that can become infected.\n* [[Dermatitis herpetiformis]]: a skin disease that causes intensely itchy blisters, usually on the elbows, knees, back and buttocks. The blisters usually develop in patches of the same shape and size on both sides of the body.\n* Chronic bullous [[dermatosis]]: a disease that causes clusters of blisters on the face, mouth or genitals.\n* [[Cutaneous radiation syndrome]]\n* [[Epidermolysis bullosa]]\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n\n===Friction blisters===\nFriction blisters are caused by excess [[shear stress]] between the bottom and surface of the skin and the body. The strata of skin around the [[stratum spinosum]] are most susceptible to shear. As the stratum spinosum tears away from the connecting tissues below, plasma from the cells diffuses out.

It came from the [[Middle Dutch]] \"bluyster\" and was a modification of the [[Old French]] \"blostre\", which meant a leprous nodule\u2014a rise in the skin due to [[leprosy]]. In [[dermatology]] today, the words [[cutaneous condition#Vesicle|''vesicle'' and ''bulla'']] refer to blisters of smaller or greater size, respectively.\n\nTo heal properly, a blister should not be popped unless medically necessary. If popped, the excess skin should not be removed because the skin underneath needs that top layer to heal properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blister-treatment|title=Blister Treatments and Prevention|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\nA blister may form when the skin has been damaged by [[friction]] or rubbing, heat, cold or chemical exposure. Fluid collects between the upper layers of [[skin]] (the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) and the layers below (the [[dermis]]). This fluid cushions the tissue underneath, protecting it from further damage and allowing it to heal.\n\n===Friction or rubbing===\n[[File:Friction Blisters On Human Foot.jpg|thumb|Various sized blisters on the sole of a foot due to friction]]\nIntense rubbing can cause a blister, as can any friction on the skin if continued long enough. This kind of blister is most common after walking long distances or by wearing old or poorly fitting shoes.<ref name=\"Naylor1\">[Naylor PFD. \"The Skin Surface and Friction,\" ''[[British Journal of Dermatology]]''. 1955;67:239\u2013248.]</ref><ref name=\"Naylor2\">[Naylor PFD. \"Experimental Friction Blisters,\" British Journal of Dermatology. 1955;67:327\u2013342.]</ref><ref name=Sulzberger>[Sulzberger MB, Cortese TA, Fishman L, Wiley HS. \"Studies on Blisters Produced by Friction,\" Journal of Investigative Dermatology. 1966;47:456\u2013465.]</ref> Blisters are most common on the hands and feet, as these extremities are susceptible while walking, running, or performing repetitive motions, such as joystick manipulation whilst playing certain video games, digging with a shovel, playing guitar or bass, etc. Blisters form more easily on damp skin than on dry or soaked skin,<ref name=\"Carlson1\">[Carlson JM. \"The Friction Factor,\" OrthoKinetic Review. Nov/Dec 2001;1(7):1\u20133.]</ref> and are more common in warm conditions. Less-aggressive rubbing over long periods of time may cause [[calluses]] to form rather than a blister. Both blisters and calluses can lead to more serious complications, such as foot [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ation and infection, particularly when sensation or circulation is impaired, as in the case of [[diabetes]], [[neuropathy]] or [[peripheral artery disease]] (PAD).\n\n===Extreme temperature===\n[[File:Second degree burn after 2 days.JPG|thumb|upright|Blister|A blister caused by [[Scalding|burning]].]]\nThis type of blistering is one of the tools used to determine the degree of burns sustained. First and second degree [[burn]]s may result in blistered skin; however, it is characteristic of second degree burns to blister immediately, whereas first degree burns can have blisters after a couple of days. Blisters can also form on the hands and feet as a result of tissue damage incurred by [[frostbite]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uuhsc.utah.edu/burncenter/emergencycare/firstdegree.html |title=First Degree Burns |publisher=Uuhsc.utah.edu |accessdate=2012-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218230119/http://uuhsc.utah.edu/burncenter/emergencycare/firstdegree.html |archivedate=2012-02-18 }}</ref>\n\n===Chemical exposure===\n[[Image:blister-arm.jpg|right|thumb|Blisters caused by exposure to [[sulfur mustard]] agent.]]\n\nSometimes, the skin will blister when it comes into contact with a cosmetic, detergent, solvent, or other chemical such as [[nickel sulfate]], [[Balsam of Peru]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pxnKBrfwTFYC&pg=PT923 |title=Conn's Current Therapy 2011|work=google.com}}</ref> or [[urushiol]] ([[poison ivy]], [[poison oak]], [[poison sumac]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049342.htm|title=Consumer Updates - Outsmarting Poison Ivy and Other Poisonous Plants|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.fda.gov}}</ref> This is known as [[contact dermatitis]]. Blisters can also develop as a result of an allergic reaction to an insect bite or sting.  Some [[chemical warfare]] agents, known as [[blister agents]] or vesicants, cause large, painful blisters wherever they contact skin; an example is [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]].\n\n===Crushing/pinching===\nA [[blood blister]] usually forms when a minute [[blood vessel]] close to \nthe surface of the skin ruptures (breaks), and blood leaks into a tear between the layers of skin. This can happen if the skin is crushed, pinched or aggressively squeezed.\n\n===Medical conditions===\nThere are also a number of medical conditions that cause blisters. The most common are [[chickenpox]], [[herpes simplex|herpes]], [[impetigo]], and a form of [[eczema]] called [[dyshidrosis]]. Other, much rarer conditions that cause blisters include:\n\n* [[Bullous pemphigoid]]: a skin disease that causes large, tightly filled blisters to develop, usually affecting people over the age of 60.\n* [[Pemphigus]]: a serious skin disease in which blisters develop if pressure is applied to the skin; the blisters burst easily, leaving raw areas that can become infected.\n* [[Dermatitis herpetiformis]]: a skin disease that causes intensely itchy blisters, usually on the elbows, knees, back and buttocks. The blisters usually develop in patches of the same shape and size on both sides of the body.\n* Chronic bullous [[dermatosis]]: a disease that causes clusters of blisters on the face, mouth or genitals.\n* [[Cutaneous radiation syndrome]]\n* [[Epidermolysis bullosa]]\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n\n===Friction blisters===\nFriction blisters are caused by excess [[shear stress]] between the bottom and surface of the skin and the body. The strata of skin around the [[stratum spinosum]] are most susceptible to shear. As the stratum spinosum tears away from the connecting tissues below, plasma from the cells diffuses out. This plasma solution helps new cells divide and grow into new connective tissues and epidermal layers.\n\nThe clear fluid will be reabsorbed as new cells develop and the swollen appearance will subside. Painful blisters located on hands ([[Hand|palmar surface]]) and feet ([[Sole (foot)|plantar surface]]) are due to tissue shearing deeper in the epidermis, near nerve endings.

{"title_page": "Addled Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Parliaments of England 1601}}\n\nThe '''Parliament of 1614''' was the second [[Parliament of England]] of the reign of [[James VI and I]], which sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, to posterity it has been known as the '''Addled Parliament''', for this legislative failure.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604-1610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. This spreading, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been sometimes attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though the existence of this alleged scheme has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. The Commons were pitted against the Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 MPs sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James fell back on new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the [[Blessed Parliament]], was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3 year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source.

Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}} \n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614.

Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of it's actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614.

Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, to posterity it has been known as the '''Addled Parliament''', for this legislative failure.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604-1610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. This spreading, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been sometimes attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though the existence of this alleged scheme has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. The Commons were pitted against the Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 MPs sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James fell back on new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the [[Blessed Parliament]], was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3 year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}} \n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament== \n===Prologue===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of it's actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]].

James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies. Such an ostensibly tolerant doctrine was a novelty in James's time.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}}}} the second ({{lang|la|bona corporis}}), assuring parliament of the security of the [[Stuart dynasty]]; and the third ({{lang|la|bona fortunae}}), stating his financial necessity, and his aim not to bargain with Parliament any longer, but ask of their good will.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=226}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=80-82}} All but the religious aspect of this speech bore the unmistakable stamp of Bacon's influence.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=82}} Notably missing from the speech was any promise of compromise or reformation from the king.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} In the same speech, he stringently denied any sanction of Neville's undertaking,{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} but speculation on the conspiracy was already widespread.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Neville's plan had, by now, been twisted into a far-reaching conspiracy of the king's court.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} English diplomat Sir [[Thomas Roe]] was the first to allege that the the rumours were promulgated by the Earl of Northampton's [[crypto-Catholic]] faction, who wanted the king to instead look for funds in a [[marital alliance]] with the Catholic Spain, thus favouring parliament's failure.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}} This hypothesis has been accepted by most later historians,{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 533: \"Northampton was accused by some contemporaries and most later historians of engineering the abrupt dissolution of the Addled Parliament in 1614\"}} but has met with the notable rejection of Northampton's biographer, [[Linda Levy Peck]].{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 535: \"Secondly, the one thing that every schoolboy knows about Northampton - that he destroyed the Addled Parliament of 1614 - might be questioned\"}}\n\nSuspicions only compounded as Parliament proceeded, with the revelation that the king had corresponded with influential subjects in the hopes of securing the election of the sympathetic.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} The House of Commons was divided between those who accepted the conspiracy and those who rejected it.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Commons thus immediately set about investigating the preceding elections for signs of misconduct.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} Though little more was established, it was found that [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], Sir [[Thomas Parry (ambassador)|Thomas Parry]] had swayed the election in [[Stockbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockbridge]]. For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton was finally gratified, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.

He only raised a [[3rd Parliament of King James I|Parliament in 1621]] as a last resort to raise money for his son-in-law [[Elector Palatine Frederick V]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{sfn|Thrush|2010d}} As one historian has commented, \"had it not been for the outbreak of the Thirty Years\u2019 War in 1618, he might have succeeded in avoiding Parliament for the rest of his reign.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} In the mean time, still heavily in debt, James set about finding other ways to raise money. \"We shall see strange projects for money set on foot, and yet all will not help\", one observer noted.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=158-159}} His financial needs were temporarily sated with a [[benevolence (tax)|benevolence]] asked of his wealthiest subjects in 1614, raising \u00a365,000;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=94}} the sale of the [[Cautionary Towns]] of [[Brielle]] and [[Vlissingen]] to the Dutch in 1616, raising \u00a3250,000;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=95}} and in 1617, the request of a loan of \u00a3100,000 from the [[City of London]] for a Scottish [[Royal entry|Progress]], though the City did not give this in full.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=100}} The deficit was slowly reduced from 1614 to 1618.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=153}} Yet, by 1620, his debt had risen to \u00a3900,000 and no marriage deal had materialised.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:Portrait of Samuel Rawson Gardiner.jpg|thumb|Victorian historian of James's reign [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that the Addled Parliament saw the \"first dawning\" of certain constitutional ideas in Parliament.]]\nVictorian [[Whig historian]] [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]], in his monumental history of the lead up to the Civil War, took the view that the Parliament of 1614 was primarily concerned with \"higher questions\", i.e. those a constitutional nature, \"which, once mooted, can never drop out of sight\".{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=1}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1883|p=228}} To this Parliament, Gardiner wrote, one can \"trace the first dawning of the idea that, in order to preserve the rights of the subject intact, it would be necessary to make some change in the relations between the authority of the Crown and the representatives of the people.\"{{sfn|Gardiner|1883|p=240}} Gardiner's judgement of the constitutional import of this assembly has met with the sympathy of some later historians.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=31}} Thomas L.

Bergendahl is best known as the producer behind the films based on novels by [[Astrid Lindgren]].\n\n== Life and career ==\nBergendahl was born in April 1933 in \u00c5rsunda. He grew up on a farm between [[\u00c5rsunda]] and [[Hammarby, G\u00e4vleborg|G\u00e4strike-Hammarby]]. His parents were farmers with cows, horses, chickens, pigs and many other animals. Bergendahl later went to University in [[G\u00e4vle]].

The production manager told Bergendahl to apply for a job at the film company. One year later, Bergendahl was part of the film crew of ''[[Miss April (1958 film)|Miss April]]'', a film with [[Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand]] and [[Gaby Stenberg]] in the leading roles. At that time he did know anything about film work, so he tried to help wherever he could.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ystadsallehanda.se/familj/waldemar-bergendahl-i-borjan-ville-jag-hoppa-av/|title=Waldemar Bergendahl: \"I b\u00f6rjan ville jag hoppa av\"|author=Lena Wreede}}</ref>\n\nBergendahl dreamed of becoming an actor, but realized soon that he was not suitable for the job. However, he wanted to continue working in the film industry and therefore decided to work as a producer.<ref name=GDS/>\n\nIn 1963 Bergendahl produced the film ''[[Raven's End]]''. In 1984 he started working with [[Astrid Lindgren]] and produced ''[[Ronia, the Robber's Daughter (film)|Ronia, the Robber's Daughter]]''. His film ''[[My Life as a Dog]]'' (1988) was nominated as the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|best non English film]] for the [[British Academy Film Award]].\n\nBergendahl has produced around 120 films.

Bilirubin is a naturally occurring substance in the body of humans and many other animals, but it is [[neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]] when its [[concentration]] in the [[blood]] is too high, a condition known as [[bilirubin#Hyperbilirubinemia|hyperbilirubinemia]]. Hyperbilirubinemia may cause bilirubin to accumulate in the [[grey matter]] of the [[central nervous system]], potentially causing irreversible [[neurology|neurological]] damage. Depending on the level of exposure, the effects range from clinically unnoticeable to severe [[brain damage]] and even death.\n\nWhen hyperbilirubinemia increases past a mild level, it leads to [[jaundice]], raising the risk of progressing to kernicterus. When this happens in adults, it is usually because of [[liver failure|liver problems]].  [[Infant|Newborns]] are especially vulnerable to hyperbilirubinemia-induced neurological damage, because in the earliest days of life, the still-developing [[liver]] is heavily exercised by the breakdown of [[fetal hemoglobin]] as it is replaced with [[hemoglobin A|adult hemoglobin]] and the [[blood brain barrier]] is not as developed. Mildly elevated [[serum (blood)|serum]] bilirubin levels are common in newborns, and [[neonatal jaundice]] is not unusual, but bilirubin levels must be carefully monitored in case they start to climb, in which case more aggressive [[therapy]] is needed, usually via [[light therapy]] but sometimes even via [[exchange transfusion]].\n\n==Classification==\n\n===Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE)===\nABE is an acute state of elevated bilirubin in the central nervous system. Clinically, it encompasses a wide range of symptoms. These include lethargy, decreased feeding, hypotonia or hypertonia, a high-pitched cry, [[spasmodic torticollis]], [[opisthotonus]], [[setting sun sign]], fever, seizures, and even death. If the bilirubin is not rapidly reduced, ABE quickly progresses to chronic bilirubin encepalopathy.\n\n===Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (CBE)===\nCBE is a chronic state of severe bilirubin-induced neurological lesions. Reduction of bilirubin in this state will not reverse the sequelae. Clinically, manifestations of CBE include: \n# movement disorders - dyskinetic CP with often spasticity.  60% have severe motor disability (unable to walk).\n# auditory dysfunction - auditory neuropathy (ANSD)  \n# visual/oculomotor impairments (nystagmus, strabismus, Impaired upward or downward gaze, and/or cortical visual impairment). In rare cases, blindness can occur.\n# dental enamel hypoplasia/dysplasia of the [[deciduous teeth]],  \n# Gastroesophageal reflux,  \n# impaired digestive function.\n# Slightly decreased intellectual function : Although most of (approximately 85%) individual with kernicterus fall in normal or dull-normal range.\n# Epilepsy is uncommon.\nThese impairments are associated with lesions in the basal ganglia, auditory nuclei of the brain stem, and oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem. Cortex and white matter are subtly involved. Cerebellum may be involved. Severe cortical involvement is uncommon.\n\n===Subtle bilirubin encephalopathy (SBE)===\nSBE is a chronic state of mild bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND). Clinically, this may result in neurological, learning and movement disorders, isolated hearing loss and auditory dysfunction.\n\n*In the past it was thought that kernicterus (KI) often cause an intellectual disability.  This was assumed due to difficulty with hearing, that is typically not detected in a normal audiogram accompanied by impairments of speech, with choreoathetosis. With advances in technology, this has proven to not be the case as those living with KI have repeatedly demonstrated their intelligence using Augmentative Communication devices {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}. Although most individuals with kernicteric cerebral palsy have normal intelligence, some children with mild choreoathetosis develop dull normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability even without auditory dysfunction.\n\n==Causes==\nUnconjugated hyperbilirubinemia during the neonatal period describes the history of nearly all individuals who suffer from kernicterus. It is thought that the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] is not fully functional in neonates and therefore bilirubin is able to cross the barrier. Moreover, neonates have much higher levels of bilirubin in their blood due to:\n\n# Although the severe anemia of erythroblastosis fetalis is usually the cause of death, many children who barely survive the anemia exhibit permanent mental impairment or damage to motor areas of the brain because of precipitation of bilirubin in the neuronal cells, causing destruction of many, a condition called kernicterus. The rapid breakdown of fetal red blood cells immediately prior to birth (and subsequent replacement by normal adult human red blood cells). This breakdown of fetal red blood cells releases large amounts of bilirubin. \n# Neonates cannot metabolize and eliminate bilirubin. The sole path for bilirubin elimination is through the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 (UGT1A1) proteins that perform a (SN2 conjugation) reaction called \"glucuronidation\". This reaction adds a large sugar to the bilirubin and makes it more water-soluble, so more readily excreted via the urine and/or the feces.  The UGT1A1 enzymes are present, but not active until several months after birth in the newborn liver. Apparently, this is a  developmental compromise since the maternal liver and placenta perform glucuronidation for the fetus. In the early 1980s a late-fetal change (30 \u2013 40 weeks of gestation) in hepatic UGT1A1 (from 0.1% to 1.0% of adult activity levels) and post-natal changes that are related to birth age not gestational age were reported.  Similar development of activities to pan-specific substrates were observed except for serotonin (1A4), where adult activities were observed in fetal (16 \u2013 25 weeks) and neonatal liver up to 10 days old.  More recently, individual UGT isoform development in infants and young children, including two fetal liver samples, were analyzed and showed that pediatric levels of mRNA and protein for UGT1A1 did not differ from adults, but activities were lower.  Hence, the effects of UGT1A1 developmental delay in activation have been illuminated over the last 20\u201330 years. The molecular mechanism(s) for activating UGT1A1 remain unknown.  \n# Administration of [[aspirin]] to neonates and infants.  Aspirin displaces the bilirubin that was non-covalently attached to albumin in the blood stream, thus generating an increased level of free bilirubin which can cross the developing [[blood brain barrier]]. This can be life-threatening.\n\nBilirubin is known to accumulate in the gray matter of neurological tissue where it exerts direct neurotoxic effects.

The tramway was connected to a local flint mill that ground clay and [[chert]] into flints. These were transported to Porth Penrhyn on the coast by the tramway,{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=27}} which was one of the earliest overground railways in Britain. It included two balanced gravity [[cable railway|inclines]] one from the floor of the Cegin valley near Llandegai to the hills above Bangor, the other dropping from there to the mill. Both inclines used vertically mounted winding drums.\n\n===Penrhyn Railway (1801\u20131878)===\n[[File:Penrhyn Railway en.png|thumb|Penrhyn Railway]]\nThe success of the Llandegai Tramway encouraged the owners of the Penrhyn quarry to consider a similar tramway from their slate quarry to Porth Penrhyn. The plan subsumed the existing tramway into a longer railroad that connected Bethesda to the sea. \n\nConstruction started on 2 September 1800, relaying and extending the Llandegai Tramway, with the first slate train traveling on 25 June 1801. The new railway was also {{RailGauge|23.5in}} gauge.{{discuss|section=Railway gauge}} The connection to the Llandegai flint mill continued to be used until 1831. The railroad was operated by horse power along with gravity and three [[cable railway|balanced inclines]] \u2013 \"Port\" (sometimes called \"Marchogion\") near Llandegai, which was inherited from the Llandegai Tramway, \"Dinas\" north east of Tregarth and \"Cilgeraint\" a short distance north of Coed-y-Parc workshops in Bethesda. The longest extended for 220 yards. With hindsight this seems hard work, but the overall gain was remarkable, shown not least by the cost of transport falling from 4 shillings per ton to 1 shilling{{sfn|Turner|1975|pp=42\u20133}}\n\nBy the early 1870s the Penrhyn Quarry Railway was no longer able to keep up with the output of the Penrhyn quarry. By 1874 the decision had been made to replace the railroad with a steam locomotive worked railway without rope-hauled inclines. Steam locomotives had already been introduced with great success on the quarry's internal railway system and at the nearby [[Dinorwic Quarry]]. The [[Ffestiniog Railway]]'s example had shown that running a 2&nbsp;ft gauge line for several miles from quarry to sea was perfectly feasible, and that company's [[Charles Easton Spooner]] was retained to survey and map possible routes to the port. The Penrhyn directors saw every reason not to follow the [[Padarn Railway]]'s example and build a main line built to a gauge of 4&nbsp;ft, joining lines in its quarries to lines in its dock both at a much narrower gauge. All Penrhyn tracks were of the same narrow gauge, so no costly and inefficient internal trans-shipments were needed.{{sfn|Turner|1975|pp=47\u20139}} At the end of 1875 the first \"mainline\" locomotive was delivered to Port Penrhyn and moved to the quarry workshops at Coed y Parc. The railroad was converted into the new railway in five stages from 1877 to 1878.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Penrhyn Quarry Railway (1878\u20131962)===\n[[File:Penrhyn Quarry Railway en.png|thumb|Penrhyn Quarry Railway]]\n\nThe first locomotives used on the new railway were three [[De Winton]]'s with horizontal boilers. Although successful, these locomotives were not powerful enough for the substantial traffic that passed down the line. In 1882 the railway ordered 'Charles', a large 0-4-0ST from [[Hunslet Engine Company|Hunslet]]. Charles proved very successful and was followed by 'Blanche' and 'Linda' in 1893 to the same basic design. These locomotives were the mainstay of the railway for the rest of its life.{{sfn|Boyd|1985}}\n\nThere was a significant demand for building materials after the [[First World War]], as Britain recovered from the conflict and many new houses were built to replace slums. The slate industry had been largely mothballed during the conflict, but now found itself in a boom period. Shortly after the war, the quarry began producing Fullersite - ground slate waste - which was shipped in large quantities along the railway.  In 1924, with traffic continuing the rise, three additional [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] locomotives were purchased. These had been built for war use by the [[Transportation Corps|United States Army Transport Corp]], and were refurbished before being sold to the railway, but were not successful, and after three years of intermittent use they were put aside. {{sfn|Boyd|1985}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Second World War]], there was a short boom in demand for Welsh slate, to meet reconstruction needs throughout the United Kingdom. However this proved to be a short-lived period of success, and cheap foreign imports of slate and new man-made roofing materials quickly began to eat into the market for the higher-quality and more expensive Penrhyn product. A steady decline in traffic through the 1950s and growth in the use of roads for transporting slates direct from the quarry to market meant the end of the railway was inevitable. In June 1962, the last slate train ran, though a few unofficial trips were run as late as the summer of 1963.<ref>Quine 2016</ref>\n\n=== Traffic and rolling stock ===\nHeading seawards (northwards) from the quarry at Bethesda the first (Cilgeraint) incline was bypassed by building an almost parallel straight line at a gentler end-to-end gradient whose foot was some distance north of the foot of the incline. A similar approach was not feasible for the other two inclines, so the traditional approach was taken \u2013 to increase the length of the line to spread the grade. The old route was retained to the head of the Dinas Incline where the new line swung through 180 degrees in a horseshoe bend, thereby changing from heading northeast to southwest. It then swung past a new halt at Tregarth  before swinging northwards again past a new halt at Felin Hen, whereafter the line headed more or less straight for Port Penrhyn, meeting the original alignment below the foot of the Marchogion Incline.\n\nThe main line's primary purpose was to carry finished slates and Fullersite (powdered slate){{sfn|Peters|1976|loc=Plates 115-8}}<ref>[https://www.festipedia.org.uk/wiki/Penrhyn_Quarry_Wagons Fullersite wagon, via ''Festpedia'']</ref> to Port Penrhyn where they were loaded onto ships or, from February 1852 when the [[Chester and Holyhead Railway]] opened its Port Penrhyn Branch,{{sfn|Lee|1945|p=223}}{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=49}} onto standard gauge trains.{{sfn|Peters|1976|loc=Plate 149}} The ships and standard gauge trains took the products to national and international markets. Secondary traffic consisted of slate materials which were finished at workshops at Port Penrhyn into bitumen blocks and, notably, writing slates on which the port had a British near-monopoly in the 1930s.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=7\u20139}}{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=43}} Paying backloads were few, but sufficient coal was brought from the port to the quarries to warrant the company buying a fleet of 50 coal wagons. The line also carried internal user traffic such as spare parts. The intermixing of standard and narrow gauge lines at the port produced some remarkable pointwork.{{sfn|Messenger|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Peters|1976|loc=Plate 115}}\n\n[[File:Charles at Penrhyn Castle (geograph 4537381).jpg|thumb|Main line locomotive ''Charles'' with Lord Penrhyn's saloon at the [[Penrhyn Castle Railway Museum]]]]\nLord Penrhyn had his own saloon coach,{{sfn|Turner|2003|loc=Rear cover}} which has survived into preservation.<ref>[https://uk.images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A9mSs2qoEVtXvHIAUKtLBQx.;_ylu=X3oDMTByZmVxM3N0BGNvbG8DaXIyBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--?p=Lord+Penrhyn+Saloon&fr=mcafee Images of Lord Penrhyn's saloon]</ref> An example of the second type of passenger vehicle \u2013 an Incline Carriage \u2013 has survived in the [[Penrhyn Castle Railway Museum]].

Each carriage could carry 24 quarrymen \"at a pinch\". The carriages resembled enlarged versions of many used on garden railways in fine weather.{{sfn|Welbourn|2000|page=107}} 16 of these were built in two batches between 1878 and 1908, each bore a single letter in the series A to P. The service was withdrawn on 9 February 1951,{{sfn|Turner|2003|p=42}} rendering the carriages redundant. Seven survived, six were given or sold to the [[Talyllyn Railway]] where they were modified{{sfn|Messenger|2008|p=12}} or cannibalised to such an extent that no Penrhyn bodies survive there. The seventh survivor was acquired by the [[Penrhyn Castle Railway Museum]],{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=115}} where it remained on view in 2016.

The tramway was connected to a local flint mill that ground clay and [[chert]] into flints. These were transported to Porth Penrhyn on the coast by the tramway,{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=27}} which was one of the earliest overground railways in Britain. It included two balanced gravity [[cable railway|inclines]] one from the floor of the Cegin valley near Llandegai to the hills above Bangor, the other dropping from there to the mill. Both inclines used vertically mounted winding drums.\n\n===Penrhyn Railway (1801\u20131878)===\n[[File:Penrhyn Railway en.png|thumb|Penrhyn Railway]]\nThe success of the Llandegai Tramway encouraged the owners of the Penrhyn quarry to consider a similar tramway from their slate quarry to Porth Penrhyn. The plan subsumed the existing tramway into a longer railroad that connected Bethesda to the sea. \n\nConstruction started on 2 September 1800, relaying and extending the Llandegai Tramway, with the first slate train traveling on 25 June 1801. The new railway was also {{RailGauge|23.5in}} gauge.{{discuss|section=Railway gauge}} The connection to the Llandegai flint mill continued to be used until 1831. The railroad was operated by horse power along with gravity and three [[cable railway|balanced inclines]] \u2013 \"Port\" (sometimes called \"Marchogion\") near Llandegai, which was inherited from the Llandegai Tramway, \"Dinas\" north east of Tregarth and \"Cilgeraint\" a short distance north of Coed-y-Parc workshops in Bethesda. The longest extended for 220 yards. With hindsight this seems hard work, but the overall gain was remarkable, shown not least by the cost of transport falling from 4 shillings per ton to 1 shilling{{sfn|Turner|1975|pp=42\u20133}}\n\nBy the early 1870s the Penrhyn Quarry Railway was no longer able to keep up with the output of the Penrhyn quarry. By 1874 the decision had been made to replace the railroad with a steam locomotive worked railway without rope-hauled inclines. Steam locomotives had already been introduced with great success on the quarry's internal railway system and at the nearby [[Dinorwic Quarry]]. The [[Ffestiniog Railway]]'s example had shown that running a 2&nbsp;ft gauge line for several miles from quarry to sea was perfectly feasible, and that company's [[Charles Easton Spooner]] was retained to survey and map possible routes to the port. The Penrhyn directors saw every reason not to follow the [[Padarn Railway]]'s example and build a main line built to a gauge of 4&nbsp;ft, joining lines in its quarries to lines in its dock both at a much narrower gauge. All Penrhyn tracks were of the same narrow gauge, so no costly and inefficient internal trans-shipments were needed.{{sfn|Turner|1975|pp=47\u20139}} At the end of 1875 the first \"mainline\" locomotive was delivered to Port Penrhyn and moved to the quarry workshops at Coed y Parc. The railroad was converted into the new railway in five stages from 1877 to 1878.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Penrhyn Quarry Railway (1878\u20131962)===\n[[File:Penrhyn Quarry Railway en.png|thumb|Penrhyn Quarry Railway]]\n\nThe first locomotives used on the new railway were three [[De Winton]]'s with horizontal boilers. Although successful, these locomotives were not powerful enough for the substantial traffic that passed down the line. In 1882 the railway ordered 'Charles', a large 0-4-0ST from [[Hunslet Engine Company|Hunslet]]. Charles proved very successful and was followed by 'Blanche' and 'Linda' in 1893 to the same basic design. These locomotives were the mainstay of the railway for the rest of its life.{{sfn|Boyd|1985}}\n\nThere was a significant demand for building materials after the [[First World War]], as Britain recovered from the conflict and many new houses were built to replace slums. The slate industry had been largely mothballed during the conflict, but now found itself in a boom period. Shortly after the war, the quarry began producing Fullersite - ground slate waste - which was shipped in large quantities along the railway.  In 1924, with traffic continuing the rise, three additional [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] locomotives were purchased. These had been built for war use by the [[Transportation Corps|United States Army Transport Corp]], and were refurbished before being sold to the railway, but were not successful, and after three years of intermittent use they were put aside. {{sfn|Boyd|1985}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Second World War]], there was a short boom in demand for Welsh slate, to meet reconstruction needs throughout the United Kingdom. However this proved to be a short-lived period of success, and cheap foreign imports of slate and new man-made roofing materials quickly began to eat into the market for the higher-quality and more expensive Penrhyn product. A steady decline in traffic through the 1950s and an growth in the use of roads for transporting slates direct from the quarry to market meant the end of the railway was inevitable. In June 1962, the last slate train ran, though a few unofficial trips were run as late as the summer of 1963.<ref>Quine 2016</ref>\n\n=== Traffic and rolling stock ===\nHeading seawards (northwards) from the quarry at Bethesda the first (Cilgeraint) incline was bypassed by building an almost parallel straight line at a gentler end-to-end gradient whose foot was some distance north of the foot of the incline. A similar approach was not feasible for the other two inclines, so the traditional approach was taken \u2013 to increase the length of the line to spread the grade. The old route was retained to the head of the Dinas Incline where the new line swung through 180 degrees in a horseshoe bend, thereby changing from heading northeast to southwest. It then swung past a new halt at Tregarth  before swinging northwards again past a new halt at Felin Hen, whereafter the line headed more or less straight for Port Penrhyn, meeting the original alignment below the foot of the Marchogion Incline.\n\nThe main line's primary purpose was to carry finished slates and Fullersite (powdered slate){{sfn|Peters|1976|loc=Plates 115-8}}<ref>[https://www.festipedia.org.uk/wiki/Penrhyn_Quarry_Wagons Fullersite wagon, via ''Festpedia'']</ref> to Port Penrhyn where they were loaded onto ships or, from February 1852 when the [[Chester and Holyhead Railway]] opened its Port Penrhyn Branch,{{sfn|Lee|1945|p=223}}{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=49}} onto standard gauge trains.{{sfn|Peters|1976|loc=Plate 149}} The ships and standard gauge trains took the products to national and international markets. Secondary traffic consisted of slate materials which were finished at workshops at Port Penrhyn into bitumen blocks and, notably, writing slates on which the port had a British near-monopoly in the 1930s.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=7\u20139}}{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=43}} Paying backloads were few, but sufficient coal was brought from the port to the quarries to warrant the company buying a fleet of 50 coal wagons. The line also carried internal user traffic such as spare parts. The intermixing of standard and narrow gauge lines at the port produced some remarkable pointwork.{{sfn|Messenger|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Peters|1976|loc=Plate 115}}\n\n[[File:Charles at Penrhyn Castle (geograph 4537381).jpg|thumb|Main line locomotive ''Charles'' with Lord Penrhyn's saloon at the [[Penrhyn Castle Railway Museum]]]]\nLord Penrhyn had his own saloon coach,{{sfn|Turner|2003|loc=Rear cover}} which has survived into preservation.<ref>[https://uk.images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A9mSs2qoEVtXvHIAUKtLBQx.;_ylu=X3oDMTByZmVxM3N0BGNvbG8DaXIyBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--?p=Lord+Penrhyn+Saloon&fr=mcafee Images of Lord Penrhyn's saloon]</ref> An example of the second type of passenger vehicle \u2013 an Incline Carriage \u2013 has survived in the [[Penrhyn Castle Railway Museum]].

Each carriage could carry 24 quarrymen \"at a pinch\". The carriages resembled enlarged versions of many used on garden railways in fine weather.{{sfn|Welbourn|2000|page=107}} 16 of these were built in two batches between 1878 and 1908, each bore a single letter in the series A to P. The service was withdrawn on 9 February 1951,{{sfn|Turner|2003|p=42}} rendering the carriages redundant. Seven survived, six were given or sold to the [[Talyllyn Railway]] where they were modified{{sfn|Messenger|2008|p=12}} or cannibalised to such an extent that no Penrhyn bodies survive there. The seventh survivor was acquired by the [[Penrhyn Castle Railway Museum]],{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=115}} where it remained on view in 2016.
