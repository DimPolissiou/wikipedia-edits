This led to an invitation to perform in Scandinavia as the guest of the pianist Michael Smith, and to a joint recital in Sweden with the pianist [[Roland Pontinen]]. In 2001, Yedid's second recording, ''Inner Outcry'', was released, also for Musa. Yedid was commissioned to compose the suite [[Tachanun]] for the opening of \"The Third Stream\" festival in Vienna, Austria, in 2002. This composition has been performed many times in Israel including at the Kfar Blum Chamber Music Festival.\n\nMyth of the Cave was commissioned by German record label Between the Lines. It was released in 2002. The five-movement piece has been performed at festivals in Germany and Austria, at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival in Canada and at the Tel Aviv Jazz Festival in Israel. It is based on [[Plato]]'s allegory of the cave, about cave dwellers imprisoned in near-darkness since birth whose sense of reality is distorted. One of them escapes to the outside world, reports on what he has seen and is put to death for his revelations.<ref name = elements />\n\nIn 2003 Yedid composed Passions and Prayers \u2013 Sextet in homage to Jerusalem for Between the Lines. It is a technically complex and conceptually melancholy composition that premiered at the 2004 Israel Festival. The CD was released in August 2005.\n\nReflections upon Six Images was commissioned for the Third Stream Festival in Vienna Austria in 2004. The music depicts the union and division of images, colours, textures, styles and cultures inspired by the world of the imagination. The composition was performed at the Vienna festival in September 2004 and at the Etnakhta concert series in November 2004 in Israel. The CD was released at the end of 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Yedid composed the Oud Bass Piano Trio, performed at the [[Sibiu]] Festival in Romania, as well as in Australia, Canada, and the US in May and September 2005. In 2002, he joined Israeli jazz saxophonist [[Abatte Barihun]] to form the duo Ras Deshen. They recorded their maiden album in September 2002, which featured a blend of Ethiopian music and Free improvisation jazz.\n\nSince immigrating to Australia in 2007, his large scale works include: seven string quartets (Visions, Fantasies & Dances), commissioned by Israel's Sapphire String Quartet; Piano Concerto (2016), commissioned by [[Michael Kieran Harvey]] and the [[Tel Aviv Soloists]]; Kiddushim & Killulim (2017) commissioned by [[Christian Lindberg]] & [[NK Orchestra]]; Delusions of War (2014) for 22 string soloists or string orchestra, commissioned by Divertimenti Ensemble and the [[Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra]]; Mandolin Concerto (2016), for mandolin and a large orchestra.\n\nYedid's chamber and solo works include: Chad Gadya (2017), quartet for clarinet, violin, cello & piano, commissioned by Stradbroke Chamber Music Festival; Sensations (2010) for piano, violin and cello, commissioned by Atar Trio; Angles' Revolt (2017) chaconne for solo piano, commissioned by [[Lev Vlassenko]] Piano Competition; Out to Infinity (2009) for Harp solo, commissioned by the 2009 [[International Harp Contest]] for their 50th Anniversary; The Crying Souls, Lament for Syrian Victims (2013), a cappella choir, commissioned by the [[Australian Voices]] (TAV)\n\nYedid has put out over ten albums as a solo act ([[Challenge Records International]], [[Sony]], [[Naxos]], -btl-, Muse, MCI, and Kaleidos) and has collaborated Ethiopian-born saxophonist and vocalist [[Abate Berihun]] as the Ras-Deshen ensemble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yedidmusic.com/recordings|title=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|website=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nYedid's works for strings \u2013 'Visions, Fantasies and Dances' for string quartet (2006\u201309) and 'Delusions of War' for string orchestra (2014), \"show sophisticated and idiomatic writing for the strings \u2013 both individually and as an ensemble. These works are impressive in their scope and colour and variety of instrumental technique. It's also inventive throughout.\" Yedid's compositions 'Oud Bass Piano Trio' (2006) and 'Arabic Violin Bass Piano Trio' (2008) combine a classical Arabic instrument with Western instruments. Randal McIlroy, Coda Magazine (Canada) wrote \"Pianist/composer Yitzhak Yedid's Oud Bass Piano Trio conveys terrific tension, aggravation and release. It's a stunner. Minimizing the distinction between composition and improvisation, the music is entrusted to supple hands.\", and jazz journalist Alain Drouot wrote for the prestigious Downbeat Magazine (US) that \"Yedid's trio explores a wide range of emotions and tones, even if a dark and mournful mood prevails. The musicians' vivid interpretations produce a positive flow of energy that keeps the music alert and compelling, and Yedid is capable of striking lyricism. Jazz musicians often describe their art as storytelling. Yedid embodies this.\"\n\nSome of Yedid's works have been described as [[Third Stream]], which combines contemporary classical music with jazz improvisation. Much of Yedid's output includes slots where soloists can improvise. Yedid has often said he is delighted when performers surprise him with their inventiveness.<ref name=\"jpost.com1\"/>\n\n==Musical style and influences==\nYedid says his music is influenced by Arabic music. \"When I was a child I went to the Syrian synagogue, where you hear all the melodies in the Arabic scales. I'm using microtonals in my compositions, and also using the Hassidic and Orthodox Jewish scales. This is all with free jazz and classical music, in equal parts.\"<ref name = elements />\n\nYedid's music contains a mix of elements. He says: \"I'm dealing with very classical things, also with jazz and folk things\u2014but it's not classical and it's not jazz and it's not folk. I'm using various techniques, like a painter who's trying to use all the materials he knows about. I'm trying to bring all these different elements together. My music is like a story \u2013 it's like a film or a play.\"<ref name = elements />\n\nYedid writes \"In Israel, I grew up acutely aware of the tensions caused by the animosity between Palestinians and Israelis. Of profound significance were the sensory images of the shocking terror attack that occurred in a mall in central Jerusalem on December 3, 2001. The destruction and suffering caused by the two suicide bombers was devastating and continues to haunt me to this day. This attack killed eleven innocent boys including my relative 19-year-old Moshe Yedid-Levy. However, in my music, my intention is not to refer directly to experiences such as this but rather to look at Arabic and Jewish matters from a human perspective and in conjunction with philosophical and religious concerns. I am a strong believer in the power of music to bring about understanding, change and reform in societies, and perhaps also between nations. It is my wish to convey the idea of cultural pluralism.\"<ref name=\"yedidmusic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yedidmusic.com/personal-notes-|title=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|website=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAnd \"My music presents a philosophy that I believe should also apply in our day-to-day interactions between individuals and between nations and religions. We should acknowledge the past (our tradition and our history) accepting that, no matter what, we are not able to change that which has already occurred but we can try to understand why it occurred. We must also cognizant of the fact that we are the ones who are creating the \"new tradition\" and that to this we are able to make changes. My music reflects my passion to create progress and change in composition and in performance of Western classical music; it is a product of what I believe is a natural process of integration over time. I was born in Jerusalem to a family that migrated to Israel from Syria and Iraq early in the 2oth century. At home, we harboured a deep desire to preserve our musical heritage of hundreds of years. However my formal music education was in Western classical music and I have studied and played the piano. I have an intimate connection to my past, to my historical traditions and culture, and to my musical traditions as well as to Western music. Out of these influences, I was able to compose and to propose new compositional approaches to Western classical music.\n\nRabbi Hillel the Elder, the renowned Jewish sage and the principal of the Sanhedrin, an ancient Jewish court of sages, used to say: \"If I am not for myself who will be for me? Yet, if I am for myself only, what am I? And if not now, when?\" (Avot 1:14).\n\nThis quotation from Rabbi Hillel the Elder about the duty of a person to not only be concerned for himself but also to worry and contribute to society reflects my feeling about composing. I believe that one should strive to develop a personal voice and be an individual, not solely for oneself, but also for others, as individuality is a necessary step in any contribution to broader society.\"<ref name=\"yedidmusic.com\"/>\n\nYedid's style of composition has been described as \"eclectic, multicultural and very personal- a style that combines jazz and Jewish cantor music, classic European and avant-garde, randomness and a blend of techniques.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/.premium-1.544736|title=East vs. West, Religious vs. Secular - A Cutting-edge Composer Weighs In|first=Noam|last=Ben-Zeev|date=2 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2018|via=Haaretz}}</ref> Barry Davis wrote in the ''Jerusalem Post'' (2017), \"Over the past couple of decades or so, Yedid has put out an almost bewilderingly eclectic range of works and recordings. His disciplinary backdrop takes in Western classical music, jazz, free improvisation, Arabic music and liturgical material. His compositions are generally viscerally and cerebrally engaging, and often visually striking, with the piano- playing role requiring a certain amount of calisthenic activity and a significant dosage of emotional and technical investment.\"<ref name=\"jpost.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Playing-it-as-is-490245|title=Playing it as is|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\nYedid writes \"Looking for new compositional approaches and challenging musical conventions through the synthesis of a wide spectrum of contemporary and ancient styles is what motivated my work. Intellectual conflicts such as the confrontation with philosophical matters and religious and political aspects have always been of interest, and also underlie and motivated my work. I have been influenced in particular by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Arnold Schoenberg to develop a personal vision as a composer.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yedidmusic.com|title=Yitzhak Yedid |website=Yitzhak Yedid |accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref> This words by Yedid are inline with what the critics write about his music: John Shand from the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' wrote in 2014 about Yedid's [[Myth of the Cave]] \"a vividly expansive composition\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnshand.com.au/myth-of-the-cave/|title=Myth of the Cave |website=www.johnshand.com.au|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref> Noam Ben-Zeav (Haaretz) wrote in 2013 that \"Yedid music is an authentic expression of new music which incorporates a wide spectrum of contemporary and ancient styles\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/.premium-1.544736|title=East vs. West, Religious vs. Secular - A Cutting-edge Composer Weighs In|first=Noam|last=Ben-Zeev|date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=27 May 2018|via=Haaretz}}</ref> and Ake Holmquist (NorraSk\u00e5ne, Sweden) wrote in 2004 that \"Yedid integrates specific stylistic influences into a personal created unity. The manner in which he describes folkloristic influences and melancholic specific themes can remind of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]; improvisatory float of hovering \u00e0 la [[Keith Jarrett]]\".\nMusically, Yedid creates a confluence between the [[Arabic maqam|Maqamat]] (Arabic music modal system), heterophonic textures of ancient genres, and compositional approaches of contemporary Western classical music, to produce an original sound. Yedid introduces microtonality in his works in a range of different ways. He examined ways of using microtonal pitches that in Arabic music function as ornamentation and as part of improvisational gestures. He has extended the use of traditional ornamentation to compose microtonal sounds with microtonal qualities that unfold at different tempi without a definite pitch. This can be seen in many of his works. In his string quartet Visions, Fantasies and Dances, the microtonal intervals function in the context of diatonic and chromatic intervals and the method of a tension-and-release for intervals of a quarter-tone and three-quarter-tones have been employed.\nYitzhak Yedid also writes \"my work could be viewed as the beginning of my research of integrating classical Arabic music, Arabic-influenced Jewish music and contemporary Western classical music. There are areas that need further exploration in different contexts. These include examining the possibilities in compositions with different types and combinations of instruments. The possibilities drawn in my works should be examined with these instruments and with the new challenges associated with its performance practice. Large ensemble works and the integration of various instrumental combinations of performers from Group A and Group B are other aspects that merit exploration. This includes examining how traditional Arabic instruments can be integrated into Western ensemble as a soloist (perhaps in a concerto format), and also how mixed ensembles of various performers including traditional instruments could be integrated.\"\n\nYedid have shown a new direction in his later works and courage to make a commentary on international currant political/religious problems that continue to find no resolution. The Crying Souls (commissioned by the Australian Voices) and Delusions of War (commissioned by the [[Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra]]) are both anti-war works. The Crying Souls was written as a response to the chemical weapons attacks that happened in August 2013 in Damascus when more than 1,300 innocent civilian including children were massacred. Yedid writes \"This work expresses my endless sadness to the death of innocent people\". In the notes on Delusions of War he writes \"The music aims to make the listeners \"feel\" the human suffering that the war causes, and, without assuming to have answers, to encourage them to pause for a moment and to envisage better ways than force to resolve crises. The music captures emotions of anger and fear, and feelings of sorrow, tragedy and righteousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yedidmusic.com/delusions-of-war|title=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|website=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Compositions==\n===Before 2005===\n* Remembering Yitzhak Rabin (2004) for piano solo (ca. 15')\n:Commissioned by Musa Records 1999\n:CD released in 1999 by Musa records\n:Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Caravan for orchestra and jazz ensemble (ca. 17')\n:The Rubin Academy\n\n* Tachanun (2004), Suite in one movement for piano, double bass and percussions (ca. 66')\n:Commissioned by Vienna music Gallery Festival, Austria\n:Duration: 66 minutes\n:Premiere Performance: September 2005, Vienna Music Gallery Festival\n:Yedid Ensemble (Vlad Nedelin \u2013 drums & percussions, Ora Boasson Horev \u2013 double bass, Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n===2005\u20132018===\n* Myth of the Cave (2005) for clarinet/bass clarinet, double bass and piano (ca. 56')\n:Commissioned by Deutsche Structured Finance GmbH, Germany\n:CD released by Between The Lines\n:Premiere: May 2005, Frankfurt, Germany\n:Yedid Ensemble (Fran\u00e7ois Houle \u2013 clarinet & bass clarinet; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Tachanun (2005), Suite in one movement for piano solo (ca. 50')\n:Commissioned by Vienna Music Gallery Festival, Vienna, Austria\n:Premiere: Chamber Music Festival, Israel\n:Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Full Moon Fantasy (2005) for piano solo (ca. 37')\n:Commissioned by Musa Records 2001\n:CD released in 1999 by Musa records; reissued in 2005\nYitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Oud, Bass, Piano Trio (2006), Parts 3 (ca. 11')\n:Commissioned by the Oud International Festival\n:CD released by Challenge International Records and Between The Lines in August 2007\n:Premiere: 2006, Vancouver Festival\n:Yedid Ensemble (Michael Maroun \u2013 oud; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Reflections upon Six Images (2006), Image 1, for clarinet, viola, double bass and piano (ca. 13')\n:Commissioned by Vienna Music Gallery Festival, Vienna, Austria\n:CD released by Between The Lines\n:Premiere: Vienna Music Gallery Festival\n:Yedid Ensemble (Fran\u00e7ois Houle \u2013 clarinet & bass clarinet; Galia Hai \u2013 viola; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Oud, Bass, Piano Trio (2006), Parts 1\u20132 (ca. 21')\n:Commissioned by the Oud International Festival\n:CD released by Challenge International Records and Between The Lines in August 2007\n:Premiere: May 2005, Sibiu Festival, Romania\n:Yedid Ensemble (Michael Maroun \u2013 oud; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Ras Deshen (2006) for voice, saxophones, krar and piano (ca. 61')\n:Commissioned by MCI\n:CD released by MCI records\n: Premiere: Tel Aviv Arts Festival\n:Ras Deshen Ensemble (Abatte Barihun \u2013 voice and saxophones; Fentahon Malessa \u2013 krar; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Nine Images (2007) for violin, cello and piano (ca. 18')\n:Commissioned by IBA\n:Premiere: March 2007, Jerusalem International YMCA, Jerusalem, Israel\n:[[Orit Wolf]] \u2013 piano; Nathaniel Vallois \u2013 violin; Doo-Min Kim \u2013 cello\n\n* Chagall Project (2007), seven piano solo pieces inspired by Marc Chagall (ca. 42')\n:Commissioned by The Israeli Music Festival\n:Premiere: September 2007\n:CD released by Challenge International Records in September 2010\n:Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Oud, Bass, Piano Trio (2007), Parts 4\u20135 (ca. 32')\n:Commissioned by the Oud International Festival\n:CD released by Challenge International Records and Between The Lines in August 2007\n:Premiere: May 2005, Sibiu Festival, Romania\n:Yedid Ensemble (Michael Maroun \u2013 oud; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double-bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Reflections upon Six Images (2007), Images 2\u20133, for clarinet, viola, double bass and piano (ca. 27')\n:Commissioned by Vienna Music Gallery Festival, Vienna, Austria\n:CD released by Between The Lines\n:Premiere: Vienna Music Gallery Festival, Austria\n:Yedid Ensemble (Fran\u00e7ois Houle \u2013 clarinet & bass-clarinet; Galia Hai \u2013 viola; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Ethiopian voices: Psalms (2008) for three singers, Ethiopian folk dancer, alto, double bass and piano (ca. 51')\n:Commissioned by the Confederation House\n:Premiere: November 2008, Confederation House, Jerusalem, Israel\n:Ras Deshen Ensemble ([[Abatte Barihun]] \u2013 voice and saxophones; Esti Kenan Ofri \u2013 voice; Tzeta Germaye \u2013 voice and dance; Fentahon Malessa \u2013 [[krar]]; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Clowns at Night (2008) for piano solo (ca. 16')\n:Commissioned by Deutsche Media Productions GmbH & Co.

This led to an invitation to perform in Scandinavia as the guest of the pianist Michael Smith, and to a joint recital in Sweden with the pianist [[Roland Pontinen]]. In 2001, Yedid's second recording, ''Inner Outcry'', was released, also for Musa. Yedid was commissioned to compose the suite [[Tachanun]] for the opening of \"The Third Stream\" festival in Vienna, Austria, in 2002. This composition has been performed many times in Israel including at the Kfar Blum Chamber Music Festival.\n\nMyth of the Cave was commissioned by German record label Between the Lines. It was released in 2002. The five-movement piece has been performed at festivals in Germany and Austria, at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival in Canada and at the Tel Aviv Jazz Festival in Israel. It is based on [[Plato]]'s allegory of the cave, about cave dwellers imprisoned in near-darkness since birth whose sense of reality is distorted. One of them escapes to the outside world, reports on what he has seen and is put to death for his revelations.<ref name = elements />\n\nIn 2003 Yedid composed Passions and Prayers \u2013 Sextet in homage to Jerusalem for Between the Lines. It is a technically complex and conceptually melancholy composition that premiered at the 2004 Israel Festival. The CD was released in August 2005.\n\nReflections upon Six Images was commissioned for the Third Stream Festival in Vienna Austria in 2004. The music depicts the union and division of images, colours, textures, styles and cultures inspired by the world of the imagination. The composition was performed at the Vienna festival in September 2004 and at the Etnakhta concert series in November 2004 in Israel. The CD was released at the end of 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Yedid composed the Oud Bass Piano Trio, performed at the [[Sibiu]] Festival in Romania, as well as in Australia, Canada, and the US in May and September 2005. In 2002, he joined Israeli jazz saxophonist [[Abatte Barihun]] to form the duo Ras Deshen. They recorded their maiden album in September 2002, which featured a blend of Ethiopian music and Free improvisation jazz.\n\nSince immigrating to Australia in 2007, his large scale works include: seven string quartets (Visions, Fantasies & Dances), commissioned by Israel's Sapphire String Quartet; Piano Concerto (2016), commissioned by [[Michael Kieran Harvey]] and the [[Tel Aviv Soloists]]; Kiddushim & Killulim (2017) commissioned by [[Christian Lindberg]] & [[NK Orchestra]]; Delusions of War (2014) for 22 string soloists or string orchestra, commissioned by Divertimenti Ensemble and the [[Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra]]; Mandolin Concerto (2016), for mandolin and a large orchestra.\n\nYedid's chamber and solo works include: Chad Gadya (2017), quartet for clarinet, violin, cello & piano, commissioned by Stradbroke Chamber Music Festival; Sensations (2010) for piano, violin and cello, commissioned by Atar Trio; Angles' Revolt (2017) chaconne for solo piano, commissioned by [[Lev Vlassenko]] Piano Competition; Out to Infinity (2009) for Harp solo, commissioned by the 2009 [[International Harp Contest]] for their 50th Anniversary; The Crying Souls, Lament for Syrian Victims (2013), a cappella choir, commissioned by the [[Australian Voices]] (TAV)\n\nYedid has put out over ten albums as a solo act ([[Challenge Records International]], [[Sony]], [[Naxos]], -btl-, Muse, MCI, and Kaleidos) and has collaborated Ethiopian-born saxophonist and vocalist [[Abate Berihun]] as the Ras-Deshen ensemble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yedidmusic.com/recordings|title=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|website=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nYedid's works for strings \u2013 'Visions, Fantasies and Dances' for string quartet (2006\u201309) and 'Delusions of War' for string orchestra (2014), \"show sophisticated and idiomatic writing for the strings \u2013 both individually and as an ensemble. These works are impressive in their scope and colour and variety of instrumental technique. It's also inventive throughout.\" Yedid's compositions 'Oud Bass Piano Trio' (2006) and 'Arabic Violin Bass Piano Trio' (2008) combine a classical Arabic instrument with Western instruments. Randal McIlroy, Coda Magazine (Canada) wrote \"Pianist/composer Yitzhak Yedid's Oud Bass Piano Trio conveys terrific tension, aggravation and release. It's a stunner. Minimizing the distinction between composition and improvisation, the music is entrusted to supple hands.\", and jazz journalist Alain Drouot wrote for the prestigious Downbeat Magazine (US) that \"Yedid's trio explores a wide range of emotions and tones, even if a dark and mournful mood prevails. The musicians' vivid interpretations produce a positive flow of energy that keeps the music alert and compelling, and Yedid is capable of striking lyricism. Jazz musicians often describe their art as storytelling. Yedid embodies this.\"\n\nSome of Yedid's works have been described as [[Third Stream]], which combines contemporary classical music with jazz improvisation. Much of Yedid's output includes slots where soloists can improvise. Yedid has often said he is delighted when performers surprise him with their inventiveness.<ref name=\"jpost.com1\"/>\n\n==Musical style and influences==\nYedid says his music is influenced by Arabic music. \"When I was a child I went to the Syrian synagogue, where you hear all the melodies in the Arabic scales. I'm using microtonals in my compositions, and also using the Hassidic and Orthodox Jewish scales. This is all with free jazz and classical music, in equal parts.\"<ref name = elements />\n\nYedid's music contains a mix of elements. He says: \"I'm dealing with very classical things, also with jazz and folk things\u2014but it's not classical and it's not jazz and it's not folk. I'm using various techniques, like a painter who's trying to use all the materials he knows about. I'm trying to bring all these different elements together. My music is like a story \u2013 it's like a film or a play.\"<ref name = elements />\n\nYedid writes \"In Israel, I grew up acutely aware of the tensions caused by the animosity between Palestinians and Israelis. Of profound significance were the sensory images of the shocking terror attack that occurred in a mall in central Jerusalem on December 3, 2001. The destruction and suffering caused by the two suicide bombers was devastating and continues to haunt me to this day. This attack killed eleven innocent boys including my relative 19-year-old Moshe Yedid-Levy. However, in my music, my intention is not to refer directly to experiences such as this but rather to look at Arabic and Jewish matters from a human perspective and in conjunction with philosophical and religious concerns. I am a strong believer in the power of music to bring about understanding, change and reform in societies, and perhaps also between nations. It is my wish to convey the idea of cultural pluralism.\"<ref name=\"yedidmusic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yedidmusic.com/personal-notes-|title=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|website=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAnd \"My music presents a philosophy that I believe should also apply in our day-to-day interactions between individuals and between nations and religions. We should acknowledge the past (our tradition and our history) accepting that, no matter what, we are not able to change that which has already occurred but we can try to understand why it occurred. We must also cognizant of the fact that we are the ones who are creating the \"new tradition\" and that to this we are able to make changes. My music reflects my passion to create progress and change in composition and in performance of Western classical music; it is a product of what I believe is a natural process of integration over time. I was born in Jerusalem to a family that migrated to Israel from Syria and Iraq early in the 2oth century. At home, we harboured a deep desire to preserve our musical heritage of hundreds of years. However my formal music education was in Western classical music and I have studied and played the piano. I have an intimate connection to my past, to my historical traditions and culture, and to my musical traditions as well as to Western music. Out of these influences, I was able to compose and to propose new compositional approaches to Western classical music.\n\nRabbi Hillel the Elder, the renowned Jewish sage and the principal of the Sanhedrin, an ancient Jewish court of sages, used to say: \"If I am not for myself who will be for me? Yet, if I am for myself only, what am I? And if not now, when?\" (Avot 1:14).\n\nThis quotation from Rabbi Hillel the Elder about the duty of a person to not only be concerned for himself but also to worry and contribute to society reflects my feeling about composing. I believe that one should strive to develop a personal voice and be an individual, not solely for oneself, but also for others, as individuality is a necessary step in any contribution to broader society.\"<ref name=\"yedidmusic.com\"/>\n\nYedid's style of composition has been described as \"eclectic, multicultural and very personal- a style that combines jazz and Jewish cantor music, classic European and avant-garde, randomness and a blend of techniques.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/.premium-1.544736|title=East vs. West, Religious vs. Secular - A Cutting-edge Composer Weighs In|first=Noam|last=Ben-Zeev|date=2 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2018|via=Haaretz}}</ref> Barry Davis wrote in the ''Jerusalem Post'' (2017), \"Over the past couple of decades or so, Yedid has put out an almost bewilderingly eclectic range of works and recordings. His disciplinary backdrop takes in Western classical music, jazz, free improvisation, Arabic music and liturgical material. His compositions are generally viscerally and cerebrally engaging, and often visually striking, with the piano- playing role requiring a certain amount of calisthenic activity and a significant dosage of emotional and technical investment.\"<ref name=\"jpost.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Playing-it-as-is-490245|title=Playing it as is|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\nYedid writes \"Looking for new compositional approaches and challenging musical conventions through the synthesis of a wide spectrum of contemporary and ancient styles is what motivated my work. Intellectual conflicts such as the confrontation with philosophical matters and religious and political aspects have always been of interest, and also underlie and motivated my work. I have been influenced in particular by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Arnold Schoenberg to develop a personal vision as a composer.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yedidmusic.com|title=Yitzhak Yedid |website=Yitzhak Yedid |accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref> This words by Yedid are inline with what the critics write about his music: John Shand from the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' wrote in 2014 about Yedid's [[Myth of the Cave]] \"a vividly expansive composition\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnshand.com.au/myth-of-the-cave/|title=Myth of the Cave |website=www.johnshand.com.au|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref> Noam Ben-Zeav (Haaretz) wrote in 2013 that \"Yedid music is an authentic expression of new music which incorporates a wide spectrum of contemporary and ancient styles\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/.premium-1.544736|title=East vs. West, Religious vs. Secular - A Cutting-edge Composer Weighs In|first=Noam|last=Ben-Zeev|date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=27 May 2018|via=Haaretz}}</ref> and Ake Holmquist (NorraSk\u00e5ne, Sweden) wrote in 2004 that \"Yedid integrates specific stylistic influences into a personal created unity. The manner in which he describes folkloristic influences and melancholic specific themes can remind of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]; improvisatory float of hovering \u00e0 la [[Keith Jarrett]]\".\nMusically, Yedid creates a confluence between the [[Arabic maqam|Maqamat]] (Arabic music modal system), heterophonic textures of ancient genres, and compositional approaches of contemporary Western classical music, to produce an original sound. Yedid introduces microtonality in his works in a range of different ways. He examined ways of using microtonal pitches that in Arabic music function as ornamentation and as part of improvisational gestures. He has extended the use of traditional ornamentation to compose microtonal sounds with microtonal qualities that unfold at different tempi without a definite pitch. This can be seen in many of his works. In his string quartet Visions, Fantasies and Dances, the microtonal intervals function in the context of diatonic and chromatic intervals and the method of a tension-and-release for intervals of a quarter-tone and three-quarter-tones have been employed.\nYitzhak Yedid also writes \"my work could be viewed as the beginning of my research of integrating classical Arabic music, Arabic-influenced Jewish music and contemporary Western classical music. There are areas that need further exploration in different contexts. These include examining the possibilities in compositions with different types and combinations of instruments. The possibilities drawn in my works should be examined with these instruments and with the new challenges associated with its performance practice. Large ensemble works and the integration of various instrumental combinations of performers from Group A and Group B are other aspects that merit exploration. This includes examining how traditional Arabic instruments can be integrated into Western ensemble as a soloist (perhaps in a concerto format), and also how mixed ensembles of various performers including traditional instruments could be integrated.\"\n\nYedid have shown a new direction in his later works and courage to make a commentary on international currant political/religious problems that continue to find no resolution. The Crying Souls (commissioned by the Australian Voices) and Delusions of War (commissioned by the [[Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra]]) are both anti-war works. The Crying Souls was written as a response to the chemical weapons attacks that happened in August 2013 in Damascus when more than 1,300 innocent civilian including children were massacred. Yedid writes \"This work expresses my endless sadness to the death of innocent people\". In the notes on Delusions of War he writes \"The music aims to make the listeners \"feel\" the human suffering that the war causes, and, without assuming to have answers, to encourage them to pause for a moment and to envisage better ways than force to resolve crises. The music captures emotions of anger and fear, and feelings of sorrow, tragedy and righteousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yedidmusic.com/delusions-of-war|title=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|website=Yitzhak Yedid - Composer &amp; Concert Pianist - Official Website|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Compositions==\n===Before 2005===\n* Remembering Yitzhak Rabin (2004) for piano solo (ca. 15')\n:Commissioned by Musa Records 1999\n:CD released in 1999 by Musa records\n:Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Caravan for orchestra and jazz ensemble (ca. 17')\n:The Rubin Academy\n\n* Tachanun (2004), Suite in one movement for piano, double bass and percussions (ca. 66')\n:Commissioned by Vienna music Gallery Festival, Austria\n:Duration: 66 minutes\n:Premiere Performance: September 2005, Vienna Music Gallery Festival\n:Yedid Ensemble (Vlad Nedelin \u2013 drums & percussions, Ora Boasson Horev \u2013 double bass, Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n===2005\u20132018===\n* Myth of the Cave (2005) for clarinet/bass clarinet, double bass and piano (ca. 56')\n:Commissioned by Deutsche Structured Finance GmbH, Germany\n:CD released by Between The Lines\n:Premiere: May 2005, Frankfurt, Germany\n:Yedid Ensemble (Fran\u00e7ois Houle \u2013 clarinet & bass clarinet; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Tachanun (2005), Suite in one movement for piano solo (ca. 50')\n:Commissioned by Vienna Music Gallery Festival, Vienna, Austria\n:Premiere: Chamber Music Festival, Israel\n:Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Full Moon Fantasy (2005) for piano solo (ca. 37')\n:Commissioned by Musa Records 2001\n:CD released in 1999 by Musa records; reissued in 2005\nYitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Oud, Bass, Piano Trio (2006), Parts 3 (ca. 11')\n:Commissioned by the Oud International Festival\n:CD released by Challenge International Records and Between The Lines in August 2007\n:Premiere: 2006, Vancouver Festival\n:Yedid Ensemble (Michael Maroun \u2013 oud; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Reflections upon Six Images (2006), Image 1, for clarinet, viola, double bass and piano (ca. 13')\n:Commissioned by Vienna Music Gallery Festival, Vienna, Austria\n:CD released by Between The Lines\n:Premiere: Vienna Music Gallery Festival\n:Yedid Ensemble (Fran\u00e7ois Houle \u2013 clarinet & bass clarinet; Galia Hai \u2013 viola; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Oud, Bass, Piano Trio (2006), Parts 1\u20132 (ca. 21')\n:Commissioned by the Oud International Festival\n:CD released by Challenge International Records and Between The Lines in August 2007\n:Premiere: May 2005, Sibiu Festival, Romania\n:Yedid Ensemble (Michael Maroun \u2013 oud; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Ras Deshen (2006) for voice, saxophones, krar and piano (ca. 61')\n:Commissioned by MCI\n:CD released by MCI records\n: Premiere: Tel Aviv Arts Festival\n:Ras Deshen Ensemble (Abatte Barihun \u2013 voice and saxophones; Fentahon Malessa \u2013 krar; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Nine Images (2007) for violin, cello and piano (ca. 18')\n:Commissioned by IBA\n:Premiere: March 2007, Jerusalem International YMCA, Jerusalem, Israel\n:[[Orit Wolf]] \u2013 piano; Nathaniel Vallois \u2013 violin; Doo-Min Kim \u2013 cello\n\n* Chagall Project (2007), seven piano solo pieces inspired by Marc Chagall (ca. 42')\n:Commissioned by The Israeli Music Festival\n:Premiere: September 2007\n:CD released by Challenge International Records in September 2010\n:Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Oud, Bass, Piano Trio (2007), Parts 4\u20135 (ca. 32')\n:Commissioned by the Oud International Festival\n:CD released by Challenge International Records and Between The Lines in August 2007\n:Premiere: May 2005, Sibiu Festival, Romania\n:Yedid Ensemble (Michael Maroun \u2013 oud; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double-bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano\n\n* Reflections upon Six Images (2007), Images 2\u20133, for clarinet, viola, double bass and piano (ca. 27')\n:Commissioned by Vienna Music Gallery Festival, Vienna, Austria\n:CD released by Between The Lines\n:Premiere: Vienna Music Gallery Festival, Austria\n:Yedid Ensemble (Fran\u00e7ois Houle \u2013 clarinet & bass-clarinet; Galia Hai \u2013 viola; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Ethiopian voices: Psalms (2008) for three singers, Ethiopian folk dancer, alto, double bass and piano (ca. 51')\n:Commissioned by the Confederation House\n:Premiere: November 2008, Confederation House, Jerusalem, Israel\n:Ras Deshen Ensemble ([[Abatte Barihun]] \u2013 voice and saxophones; Esti Kenan Ofri \u2013 voice; Tzeta Germaye \u2013 voice and dance; Fentahon Malessa \u2013 [[krar]]; Ora Boasson-Horev \u2013 double bass; Yitzhak Yedid \u2013 piano)\n\n* Clowns at Night (2008) for piano solo (ca. 16')\n:Commissioned by Deutsche Media Productions GmbH & Co.

The behaviors included people saying \"hello\" or \"good morning,\" comments on Roberts' appearance, attempts to initiate conversation, angry remarks, and men following her for several minutes.<ref name=huffpo>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/28/walking-in-nyc-as-a-woman_n_6063054.html|title = Watch This Woman Receive 100 Catcalls While Walking Around For A Day|last = Sieczkowski|first = Cavan|date = October 28, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|work = [[Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=wapo/><ref name=time>{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/3543632/street-harassment-hollaback-video/|title = Watch This Woman Get Harassed 108 Times While Walking in New York City|last = Alter|first = Charlotte|date = October 28, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|magazine = [[Time Magazine]]}}</ref><ref name=cnn>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/28/living/hollaback-10-hours-walking-in-nyc/|title = What 10 hours of street harassment in NYC looks like|last = Grinberg|first = Emanuella|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = [[CNN]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Andrew|title=Now Trending: Woman harassed more than 100 times walking streets of New York|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/celebrity-news/the-a-list/now-trending-woman-harassed-more-than-100-times-walking-streets-of-new-york/article21368304/|accessdate=18 June 2015|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=29 October 2014}}</ref> As of January 2020, the video has received over 48 million views on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web |title=10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman |website=Youtube |publisher=Rob Bliss Creative }}</ref>\n\n==Production and goals==\n\nRoberts said that she got involved with the video by responding to a [[Craigslist]] posting by Rob Bliss a few months prior, and that although Rob Bliss told her that this was potentially a viral video, she was skeptical but was open to giving it a try.<ref name=wapo>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/10/29/the-story-behind-that-10-hours-of-walking-in-nyc-viral-street-harassment-video/|title = The story behind that '10 hours of walking in NYC' viral street harassment video|last = Butler|first = Bethonie|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 14, 2015|newspaper = [[Washington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/17/the-woman-in-10-hours-walking-in-nyc-i-got-people-wanting-to-slit-my-throat|title =  The woman in 10 Hours Walking in NYC: 'I got people wanting to slit my throat' The video exposing 10 hours of sexual harassment in New York in October has now had nearly 40m hits.

On April 1, 2017, replays of podcasts specially selected by the hosts, known as SYSK Selects, began running on Saturdays.\n\n==Josh & Chuck==\n''Stuff You Should Know'' is hosted by two podcasters who were formerly senior editors at [[HowStuffWorks.com]], Josh Clark<ref name=\"josh\"/> and Charles Wayne \"Chuck\" Bryant. Their producer is Jeri \"Jerome\" Rowland.<ref name=\"waves\" /><ref name=\"duo\" /><ref name=\"quiz\"/>\n\nClark was a host of the show since the beginning, and before Bryant took over the co-hosting duties Clark was joined by several other editors.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"duo\"/> The chemistry between the two was immediately apparent, and Bryant became a permanent co-host.  Despite his actual knowledge on subject matter, which is researched beforehand, some speculate that Bryant's assertive albeit incorrect statements are meant to be a humorous device. This has not been confirmed by either Clark or Bryant.<ref name=\"featured\"/><ref name=\"way\"/> Bryant started working at HowStuffWorks about a month after Clark.<ref name=\"grows\"/> They had desks catty-corner across from each other and would often pop up to share their research.<ref name=\"liveshow\"/> They became good friends within a week.<ref name=\"grows\"/> \n\n===Josh Clark===\nJosh Malcolm<ref name=\"norris\" /> Clark was born July 15, 1976.<ref name=\"mobs\"/><ref name=\"space\"/><ref name=\"Christmas\" /><!---In the \"Space\" reference, he says July 20, 1969 was 5 years and 360 days before his birthday, which puts his birth date in 1975.  In the \"Christmas\" reference he says he was born in 1976.  In the \"mobs\" reference he gives his birthday as July 15.  This date assumes that he did the math wrong in the \"space\" episode and combines the day in \"mobs\" with the year in \"Christmas\".---> He grew up in [[Toledo, Ohio]]<ref name=\"duo\" /> and was raised Catholic<ref name=\"xmas\"/>, attending a Catholic school.<ref name=\"haunted\"/> He moved to Marietta, Georgia as a teenager.<ref name=\"duo\"/> Clark's father's name is Mal,<ref name=\"born\"/> an HVAC engineer.<ref name=\"geothermal\"/> He had a sister named Karen, who died in 1992 in a car accident when Josh was 16 years old,<ref name=\"cake\"/><ref name=\"born\"/> and two brothers-in-law,<ref name=\"moonshine\"/> one of whom is also named Josh.<ref name=\"drought\"/>\n\nIn 2010 Clark lived with his then-girlfriend Umi<!---Note: The correct spelling is Umi, not Yumi.---> (who is six months younger than him<ref name=\"ticks\"/>) in midtown Atlanta;<ref name=\"duo\"/> he proposed on August 13, 2011<ref name=\"team2\"/><ref name=\"propose\"/> and the couple has since married.<ref name=\"josh\"/> \n\nHe is a former smoker,<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> drinks a lot of coffee,<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> and is an amateur mixologist.<ref name=\"stg\" /> His hero is [[Muhammad Yunus]].<ref name=\"quiz\"/>  His favorite books include ''1491'' and ''1493'' by [[Charles C. Mann]] which he frequently quotes and/or references in the SYSK podcast. Josh is also a fan of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', [[Dollywood]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]].<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nHe attended [[Sprayberry High School]]<ref name=\"duo\"/> and studied history and anthropology at the [[University of Georgia]].<ref name=\"josh\"/><ref name=\"clark\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/><ref name=\"bites\"/> As a youth interested in the [[paranormal]], he wanted to study [[parapsychology]] at [[Duke University]].<ref name=\"Nostradamus\"/> Also as a child, he was an avid reader of [[Uncle John's Bathroom Reader]], as mentioned in many podcasts, and he jokingly cites Uncle John's Bathroom Reader as the source of the majority of his knowledge. This admiration was eventually reciprocated when UJBR mentioned SYSK on their website and had one of their employees feature as a guest on SYSK's Barbie doll podcast.<ref name=\"bath\"/>\n\nAfter college he pursued a career in journalism,<ref name=\"featured\"/> working as \"a cub reporter\" in [[Henry County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"planning\"/> and was the founding editor of The Washboard Weekly, an \"edgy tabloid\" in Johnson City, Tennessee.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"grows\"/> It went out of business due to a lack of advertising.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"grows\"/> \n\nBefore joining HowStuffWorks in 2007<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"sugar\"/> he was a self described [[wikt:factotum#Noun|factotum]] who held many jobs.<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> He had a paper route, washed dogs, and held \"jobs that involved shovels.\"<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> Before recording his first episode in 2008, Clark had never listened to a podcast,<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and didn't know what one was.<ref name=\"popular\"/>\n\n===Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant===\nCharles Wayne<ref name=\"quiz\"/><ref name=\"norris\"/> Bryant is always introduced on the show as Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant, but fans often refer to him as \"Chuckers.\"<ref name=\"team\"/> Born March 15,<ref name=\"birthday\"/><ref name=\"blood\"/> 1971,<ref name=\"Christmas\"/> Bryant was raised Baptist<ref name=\"haunted\"/> and played church league sports,<ref name=\"dog\"/> although his \"constant struggle with [his] religious upbringing\"<ref name=\"gypies\"/> has been \"well documented over the years.\"<ref name=\"gypies\"/>\n\nBryant grew up in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]] but his family lived in \"rural Mississippi since the dawn of time.\"<ref name=\"march\"/> He attended an elementary school where his father was the principal<ref name=\"hinkley\"/> and graduated from [[Redan High School]].<ref name=\"duo\"/> His mother, Diane,<ref name=\"flu\"/> was also a teacher.<ref name=\"teach\"/> He has a brother named Scott<ref name=\"reverse\"/> who is three years older,<ref name=\"jv\"/> and a sister who is six years older,<ref name=\"jv\"/> and a brother-in-law who is a Marine Corps General.<ref name=\"citizen\"/><ref name=\"things\"/> His uncle, [[Ed Bryant]], is a former Republican member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from Tennessee. Bryant once appeared on the cover of ''[[Guideposts]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"satan\"/>\n\nBryant attended the [[University of Georgia]]<ref name=\"duo\"/> where he studied English.<ref name=\"bites\"/> After college, he took classes in screenwriting at New York University's film school and then moved to Los Angeles for four years.<ref name=\"duo\" /> He has also lived in New Jersey.<ref name=\"stonehenge\"/>\n\nBryant is married to Emilie Sennebogen,<ref name=\"stg\"/> and in 2015 the couple adopted a daughter, Ruby Rose, who shares a birthday with Clark.<ref name=\"ruby\"/><ref name=\"racial\"/>  As a self-described \"crazy animal person,\" he has multiple pets.<ref name=\"guide\" /> He plays the guitar in an \"old man band,\" called \"El Cheapo\".<ref name=\"stg\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/> Humorist [[John Hodgman]] is a \"dear friend.\"<ref name=\"Hodgman\"/>\n\nHe is the author of six screenplays,<ref name=\"duo\"/> including one about a Southern Baptist church called \"Sweet, Sweet Spirit,\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> but did not find success in that field.<ref name=\"grows\"/><ref name=\"drink\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> While in Los Angeles, he was a production assistant on TV commercials, a few indie movies, and music videos, which he says helped with the TV version of ''Stuff You Should Know''.<ref name=\"drink\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> He was hired at HowStuffWorks after a friend got a job there, and submitted the first act of a screenplay as a writing sample.<ref name=\"featured\"/>\n\n==Podcast==\n{{main article|List of Stuff You Should Know episodes}}\n\n===History===\nThe podcast was launched on April 17, 2008, with Bryant making his debut on May 13, 2008.<ref name=\"grows\"/> Bryant became the permanent cohost on July 15, 2008.<ref name=\"grows\"/> The podcast, which was named by Clark,<ref name=\"duo\"/> began as an attempt to re-purpose some of the written content on HowStuffWorks.com.<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"QA\"/> Clark had never listened to a podcast before he recorded his first episode in 2008.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/> [[Jesse Thorn]] has held the name up as a model of how a podcast should be named saying \"it's like daring the listener ''not'' to listen to it.\"<ref name=\"purpose\"/>\n\nThe podcast has steadily grown in popularity since its introduction and has made appearances at events including [[South by Southwest]] and [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]]. On October 26, 2017, ''Stuff You Should Know'' released their 1000th episode. Several episodes have been recorded during live events, including two during their World Tour of Canada in September and October 2014.<ref name=\"Canada\"/> While in Canada they also participated in the Northwest Podcast Festival,<ref name=\"northwest\"/> at SXSW in 2011 and 2012,<ref name=\"sxsw\"/> and New York Comic Con in 2012 where they recorded their discussion entitled \"Time Travel: Science Fact or Science Fiction?\"<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"invades\"/>\n\nDuring the 4th of July weekend in 2011 there was a Stuff You Should Know About America [[Marathon (media)|marathon]] on Sirius XM radio.<ref name=\"sirius\"/> It featured previous episodes, as well as a live segment with [[Wyatt Cenac]] and [[Hallie Haglund]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as well as [[Joe Randazzo]], [[Joe Garden]] and [[Jill Morris]] of ''[[The Onion]]''.<ref name=\"sirius\"/> Their [[420 (cannabis culture)|420th]] episode was on [[medical marijuana]], although this was reportedly a coincidence.<ref name=\"mars\"/>\n\nIn 2011 the podcast added \"Bonus Videos\" to the podcast feed. These consist of humorous 60 second videos where Clark and Bryant converse about subjects they covered on previous podcasts while doing a variety of random activities (playing checkers, getting fitted for a suit, going to a doctor, driving through a car wash). As they speak, the scene changes repeatedly to something completely different, though their conversation continues uninterrupted as though nothing had happened. These clips have also aired during [[Television advertisement|commercial]] slots on [[Science Channel|Science]] and appear on their YouTube channel.\n\nThere is one unaired episode on [[animal detectives]] that they hope will never be published.<ref name=\"popular\"/> They have twice repeated a topic. They revisited the topic of [[Murphy's Law]] in 2011 after first doing it in 2008. As one of their first episodes, it was under 6 minutes in length. They also accidentally repeated a podcast on customs.<ref name=\"customs\"/> The first time was in 2010 and the second was in 2016.<ref name=\"customs\"/>\n\n===Format===\nThe podcast has been described as the \"heart and soul of the operation,\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and the \"well researched\" episodes cover a variety topics from the fields of \"science, history, urban legends, and pop culture, with the occasional conspiracy theory thrown in for good measure.\"<ref name=\"way\"/> Clark and Bryant have a conversation about the given topic such that, by the end, listeners have a \"basic working knowledge of that subject.\"<ref name=\"way\"/> Clark has said they are on a \"never ending quest to explain absolutely everything there is on planet earth and beyond.\"<ref name=\"circus\"/>\n\nTheir \"biggest hits\" include episodes on [[Spam (food)|Spam]], hangovers, tipping in restaurants, cheese, Barbie, and pinball.<ref name=\"toronto\"/> The topics that get the greatest response from listeners include death and grieving,<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and episodes that received \"less enthusiastic feedback\" include shows on homelessness/addiction, Tourette's Syndrome, and transgender issues.<ref name=\"way\"/> It was the second podcast on HowStuffWorks.<ref name=\"duo\"/> Episodes are normally around 45 minutes in length, although for more in-depth topics the show occasionally runs long as an hour or more. Initial episodes were much shorter in duration, often less than 10 minutes.\n\nOne of the reasons the hosts believe the show has been so successful is that they are \"definitely not experts\" in the myriad subjects they explore, but are instead \"just guys who enjoy research and [are] very curious.\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> Their formula \"is part self-deprecating humour, part infectious wonder and part self-discipline to go their separate ways and do all their own research and reflection before they get to the studio.\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> They often try to surprise one another with their research,<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> and do not have a script or a time limit before they sit down to record.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/>\n\nMost episodes end with listener mail, although there is an occasional segment known as \"Administrative Details.\" Listener mail debuted on November 25, 2008, in the episode named \"How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked\".<ref name=\"albert\"/> On that episode, they called it \"Correction Time.\" The first time it was known as \"Listener Mail\" was on January 8, 2009, an episode that was inspired by a listener's email.<ref name=\"armor\"/> During the Listener Mail portion of the podcast on April 11, 2013, a new jingle for the show was introduced.<ref name=\"brains\"/> It was written and recorded by Rusty Matyas of Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada, a musician and fan.<ref name=\"brains\"/> [http://www.jonbiegen.com Jon Biegen], another fan who covered Matyas' band, The Sheepdogs, has produced several new jingles for the show.<ref name=\"movies\"/>\n\nThe ''Stuff You Should Know'' staff includes Rebecca, the web producer, Matt and Noel, the occasional guest producers, as well as Sherry and Joe.<ref name=\"placebo\"/> Their studio is slightly larger than a broom closet.<ref name=\"replacing\"/>\n\n==YouTube==\n''Stuff You Should Know'' also has a YouTube channel, but stopped updating it regularly in 2017. Animated shorts are released on Mondays, This Day in History videos are released on Tuesdays, and Clark's series Don't Be Dumb airs a new episode on Thursdays.<ref name=\"welcometext\"/> In addition, the pair also offers live shorts and movie reviews.<ref name=\"welcome\"/>\n\nIn \"Don't Be Dumb,\" Clark explains a topic while wearing a tweed jacket and bow tie. His posture, gestures, and stilted language are intentionally uncomfortable and awkward. Each episode ends with Clark saying: \"So, next time someone tells you [subject of video], you set them straight! And tell them Josh sent you.\"\n\nInternet Roundup is a new video segment filmed in the studio. Chuck and Josh highlight a couple of posts found deep in the web that they find interesting, entreating or amusing. In 2009, Clark and Bryant began a \"short lived\" webscast.<ref name=\"zero\" /><ref name=\"webcast\"/>\n\n==TV show==\nA full-length ''Stuff You Should Know'' TV show premiered on January 19, 2013 on the [[Science Channel]], which was owned by [[Discovery Network]], the then-parent company of HowStuffWorks. The show included a pilot and 10 episodes each 30 minutes in length.<ref name=\"stars\"/><ref name=\"pilot\"/> The series was produced by production company School of Humans.\n\nDescribed as the \"love child of the British version of [[The Office (UK TV series)|''The Office'']] and an overheard conversation about science between two reasonably informed guys,\"<ref name=\"csi\"/> the show was about a real podcast that is set in a fictional world. Each episode followed Josh and Chuck inside and outside the recording booth, combining the factual information of their podcast with humorous, fictional story lines that align with each podcast topic.<ref name=\"tvshow\"/>\n\nThe show had \"the attention span of a teenaged boy\" and \"bounces from scene to scene without explanation or sense.\"<ref name=\"csi\"/> Focus groups at the 2012 South by Southwest screened episodes and provided feedback for the development of the show, and its pacing in particular.<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nThe lead actress on the show was [[Caitlin Bitzegaio]] of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].<ref name=\"popular\" /> The shows were directed by L.C. Crowley<ref name=\"cast\"/> with a theme song and score composed by The Henry Clay People,<ref name=\"sxsw\"/> the \"unofficial house band\" of Stuff You Should Know.<ref name=\"ticks\"/> Guests on the show included [[John Hodgman]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Michio Kaku]].<ref name=\"abouttv\"/>\n\nThe show was canceled after the first season \"due to poor ratings\",<ref name=\"ratings\"/> although each episode is made available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and [[Google Play]]. It was the most expensive pilot episode ever produced by the Discovery Channel.<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\n==Outside activities==\nAs with the other podcasts offered by HowStuffWorks, Stuff You Should Know has its own [[blog]] updated daily by its hosts and often featuring the same type of material found in the podcasts, often with show followups. There is also both a Twitter account and Facebook page for SYSK. Clark and Bryant were the co-hosts for the Science of Cyborgs event hosted by the [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]].<ref name=\"featured\"/>\n\n===Microlending===\nStarting in 2009, after doing an episode on how [[microlending]] works, the show began encouraging listeners to make loans on the online microlending site [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]].<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> A Stuff You Should Know team had raised $150,000 by the middle of 2010,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> and more than $2.75 million by November 2014.<ref name=\"kiva\"/> In 2009 they challenged [[Stephen Colbert]] to see whose team could raise $100,000 first<ref name=\"colbert\"/> and they \"beat the pants off of\" him, reaching that goal in three months.<ref name=\"microlend\"/>\n\nThe lending team is now run by fan volunteers,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> has since consistently ranked among the top five teams in terms of both donations and users. {{As of|2014|11}} the team ranked #7 for new users among new Kiva users, and in the \"Friends\" category of teams, ranked #2 for new users and amount loaned.<ref name=\"kiva\"/>\n\n===Books===\nClark and Bryant also present two longer and more in-depth audio programs featuring interviews and portions recorded [[Location shooting|on location]] available for purchase as [[audiobook]]s, which are entitled ''The Super Stuffed Guide to the Economy'' and ''The Super Stuffed Guide to Happiness''.\n\nThey are also working on a ''Stuff You Should Know'' book, which they hope to have published \"before the end of the decade.\"<ref name=\"stg\"/>\n\n===Cooperative for Education===\nIn February 2010,<ref name=\"CoEd\"/> Clark, Bryant, and Rowland traveled to Guatemala to promote [[Cooperative for Education]], an organization which gives textbooks to schools in Guatemala to be rented by students for a small fee that is then deposited into an account that will be used to replace old textbooks in the future.<ref name=\"bites\"/> They produced a pair of podcasts on the topic.<ref name=\"CoEd\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe show is downloaded more than 1 million times per week and is consistently on the iTunes Top 10 podcast rankings,<ref name=\"stars\"/> peaking at #1.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> It is \"one of the most downloaded podcasts on the planet.\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> The show won the 2014 People's Voice [[Webby Award]] in the Mobile \u2013 Podcast division.<ref name=\"webby\"/> and a place in [[Podcast Awards]]'s Education category.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> At live events the demographics of the audiences are \"all over the map. There are some geeks here and there, but also super cool people, and families and kids, and old people.\"<ref name=\"age\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' chose the TV show in early February 2013 as #7 for their \"The Must List: The Top 10 Things We Love This Week,\" writing, \"Whether you're curious about [[Beehive|bee colonies]] or [[Weather modification|weather control]], Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant have the scoop.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> The podcast has been said to cover \"a truly staggering range of topics.\"<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nClark and Bryant have been described as \"hosts so lovely you may just fall in love with them,\"<ref name=\"cosmo\"/> and provide the show with \"an everyman, conversational feel to the show \u2014 two pals sitting back and picking apart one topic after another.\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> Several couples have been brought together because of their mutual fondness for the podcast, and one even had a ''Stuff You Should Know''-themed wedding.<ref name=\"grows\"/>\n\nThey receive over 350 pieces of fan mail a week.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"featured\"/> After two months, their Facebook page had over 10,000 likes,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> and as of September 2015 it had more than 750,000. One reviewer said of it: \"It is never not fun to listen to.\"<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\n''Stuff You Should Know''{{'}}s \"beautifully, beautifully done\" production has set \"the audio standard,\" according to podcast reviewers [[Pod on Pod]].

video series published by [[Stuff Media]] and hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant, both writers at [[HowStuffWorks]]. Since debuting in 2008, the podcast is consistently ranked in the Top 10 on [[iTunes]] and is one of the most popular podcasts in the world, being downloaded millions of times each month.<ref name=\"replacing\"/>\n\nThe podcast, released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, educates listeners on a wide variety of topics, often using popular culture as a reference giving the podcast comedic value.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> The podcast is available for free on the [[iTunes Store]]<ref name=\"itunes\"/> and consistently appears in the platform's Top 10.<ref name=\"stars\"/> On January 19, 2013, a television show based on the series aired on Science Channel and ran for one season. On April 1, 2017, replays of podcasts specially selected by the hosts, known as SYSK Selects, began running on Saturdays.\n\n==Josh & Chuck==\n''Stuff You Should Know'' is hosted by two podcasters who were formerly senior editors at [[HowStuffWorks.com]], Josh Clark<ref name=\"josh\"/> and Charles Wayne \"Chuck\" Bryant. Their producer is Jeri \"Jerome\" Rowland.<ref name=\"waves\" /><ref name=\"duo\" /><ref name=\"quiz\"/>\n\nClark was a host of the show since the beginning, and before Bryant took over the co-hosting duties Clark was joined by several other editors.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"duo\"/> The chemistry between the two was immediately apparent, and Bryant became a permanent co-host.  Despite his actual knowledge on subject matter, which is researched beforehand, some speculate that Bryant's assertive albeit incorrect statements are meant to be a humorous device. This has not been confirmed by either Clark or Bryant.<ref name=\"featured\"/><ref name=\"way\"/> Bryant started working at HowStuffWorks about a month after Clark.<ref name=\"grows\"/> They had desks catty-corner across from each other and would often pop up to share their research.<ref name=\"liveshow\"/> They became good friends within a week.<ref name=\"grows\"/> \n\n===Josh Clark===\nJosh Malcolm<ref name=\"norris\" /> Clark was born July 15, 1976.<ref name=\"mobs\"/><ref name=\"space\"/><ref name=\"Christmas\" /><!---In the \"Space\" reference, he says July 20, 1969 was 5 years and 360 days before his birthday, which puts his birth date in 1975.  In the \"Christmas\" reference he says he was born in 1976.  In the \"mobs\" reference he gives his birthday as July 15.  This date assumes that he did the math wrong in the \"space\" episode and combines the day in \"mobs\" with the year in \"Christmas\".---> He grew up in [[Toledo, Ohio]]<ref name=\"duo\" /> and was raised Catholic<ref name=\"xmas\"/>, attending a Catholic school.<ref name=\"haunted\"/> He moved to Marietta, Georgia as a teenager.<ref name=\"duo\"/> Clark's father's name is Mal,<ref name=\"born\"/> an HVAC engineer.<ref name=\"geothermal\"/> He had a sister named Karen, who died in 1992 in a car accident when Josh was 16 years old,<ref name=\"cake\"/><ref name=\"born\"/> and two brothers-in-law,<ref name=\"moonshine\"/> one of whom is also named Josh.<ref name=\"drought\"/>\n\nIn 2010 Clark lived with his then-girlfriend Umi<!---Note: The correct spelling is Umi, not Yumi.---> (who is six months younger than him<ref name=\"ticks\"/>) in midtown Atlanta;<ref name=\"duo\"/> he proposed on August 13, 2011<ref name=\"team2\"/><ref name=\"propose\"/> and the couple has since married.<ref name=\"josh\"/> \n\nHe is a former smoker,<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> drinks a lot of coffee,<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> and is an amateur mixologist.<ref name=\"stg\" /> His hero is [[Muhammad Yunus]].<ref name=\"quiz\"/>  His favorite books include ''1491'' and ''1493'' by [[Charles C. Mann]] which he frequently quotes and/or references in the SYSK podcast. Josh is also a fan of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', [[Dollywood]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]].<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nHe attended [[Sprayberry High School]]<ref name=\"duo\"/> and studied history and anthropology at the [[University of Georgia]].<ref name=\"josh\"/><ref name=\"clark\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/><ref name=\"bites\"/> As a youth interested in the [[paranormal]], he wanted to study [[parapsychology]] at [[Duke University]].<ref name=\"Nostradamus\"/> Also as a child, he was an avid reader of [[Uncle John's Bathroom Reader]], as mentioned in many podcasts, and he jokingly cites Uncle John's Bathroom Reader as the source of the majority of his knowledge. This admiration was eventually reciprocated when UJBR mentioned SYSK on their website and had one of their employees feature as a guest on SYSK's Barbie doll podcast.<ref name=\"bath\"/>\n\nAfter college he pursued a career in journalism,<ref name=\"featured\"/> working as \"a cub reporter\" in [[Henry County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"planning\"/> and was the founding editor of The Washboard Weekly, an \"edgy tabloid\" in Johnson City, Tennessee.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"grows\"/> It went out of business due to a lack of advertising.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"grows\"/> \n\nBefore joining HowStuffWorks in 2007<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"sugar\"/> he was a self described [[wikt:factotum#Noun|factotum]] who held many jobs.<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> He had a paper route, washed dogs, and held \"jobs that involved shovels.\"<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> Before recording his first episode in 2008, Clark had never listened to a podcast,<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and didn't know what one was.<ref name=\"popular\"/>\n\n===Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant===\nCharles Wayne<ref name=\"quiz\"/><ref name=\"norris\"/> Bryant is always introduced on the show as Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant, but fans often refer to him as \"Chuckers.\"<ref name=\"team\"/> Born March 15,<ref name=\"birthday\"/><ref name=\"blood\"/> 1971,<ref name=\"Christmas\"/> Bryant was raised Baptist<ref name=\"haunted\"/> and played church league sports,<ref name=\"dog\"/> although his \"constant struggle with [his] religious upbringing\"<ref name=\"gypies\"/> has been \"well documented over the years.\"<ref name=\"gypies\"/>\n\nBryant grew up in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]] but his family lived in \"rural Mississippi since the dawn of time.\"<ref name=\"march\"/> He attended an elementary school where his father was the principal<ref name=\"hinkley\"/> and graduated from [[Redan High School]].<ref name=\"duo\"/> His mother, Diane,<ref name=\"flu\"/> was also a teacher.<ref name=\"teach\"/> He has a brother named Scott<ref name=\"reverse\"/> who is three years older,<ref name=\"jv\"/> and a sister who is six years older,<ref name=\"jv\"/> and a brother-in-law who is a Marine Corps General.<ref name=\"citizen\"/><ref name=\"things\"/> His uncle, [[Ed Bryant]], is a former Republican member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from Tennessee. Bryant once appeared on the cover of ''[[Guideposts]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"satan\"/>\n\nBryant attended the [[University of Georgia]]<ref name=\"duo\"/> where he studied English.<ref name=\"bites\"/> After college, he took classes in screenwriting at New York University's film school and then moved to Los Angeles for four years.<ref name=\"duo\" /> He has also lived in New Jersey.<ref name=\"stonehenge\"/>\n\nBryant is married to Emilie Sennebogen,<ref name=\"stg\"/> and in 2015 the couple adopted a daughter, Ruby Rose, who shares a birthday with Clark.<ref name=\"ruby\"/><ref name=\"racial\"/>  As a self-described \"crazy animal person,\" he has multiple pets.<ref name=\"guide\" /> He plays the guitar in an \"old man band,\" called \"El Cheapo\".<ref name=\"stg\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/> Humorist [[John Hodgman]] is a \"dear friend.\"<ref name=\"Hodgman\"/>\n\nHe is the author of six screenplays,<ref name=\"duo\"/> including one about a Southern Baptist church called \"Sweet, Sweet Spirit,\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> but did not find success in that field.<ref name=\"grows\"/><ref name=\"drink\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> While in Los Angeles, he was a production assistant on TV commercials, a few indie movies, and music videos, which he says helped with the TV version of ''Stuff You Should Know''.<ref name=\"drink\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> He was hired at HowStuffWorks after a friend got a job there, and submitted the first act of a screenplay as a writing sample.<ref name=\"featured\"/>\n\n==Podcast==\n{{main article|List of Stuff You Should Know episodes}}\n\n===History===\nThe podcast was launched on April 17, 2008, with Bryant making his debut on May 13, 2008.<ref name=\"grows\"/> Bryant became the permanent cohost on July 15, 2008.<ref name=\"grows\"/> The podcast, which was named by Clark,<ref name=\"duo\"/> began as an attempt to re-purpose some of the written content on HowStuffWorks.com.<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"QA\"/> Clark had never listened to a podcast before he recorded his first episode in 2008.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/> [[Jesse Thorn]] has held the name up as a model of how a podcast should be named saying \"it's like daring the listener ''not'' to listen to it.\"<ref name=\"purpose\"/>\n\nThe podcast has steadily grown in popularity since its introduction and has made appearances at events including [[South by Southwest]] and [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]]. On October 26, 2017, ''Stuff You Should Know'' released their 1000th episode. Several episodes have been recorded during live events, including two during their World Tour of Canada in September and October 2014.<ref name=\"Canada\"/> While in Canada they also participated in the Northwest Podcast Festival,<ref name=\"northwest\"/> at SXSW in 2011 and 2012,<ref name=\"sxsw\"/> and New York Comic Con in 2012 where they recorded their discussion entitled \"Time Travel: Science Fact or Science Fiction?\"<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"invades\"/>\n\nDuring the 4th of July weekend in 2011 there was a Stuff You Should Know About America [[Marathon (media)|marathon]] on Sirius XM radio.<ref name=\"sirius\"/> It featured previous episodes, as well as a live segment with [[Wyatt Cenac]] and [[Hallie Haglund]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as well as [[Joe Randazzo]], [[Joe Garden]] and [[Jill Morris]] of ''[[The Onion]]''.<ref name=\"sirius\"/> Their [[420 (cannabis culture)|420th]] episode was on [[medical marijuana]], although this was reportedly a coincidence.<ref name=\"mars\"/>\n\nIn 2011 the podcast added \"Bonus Videos\" to the podcast feed. These consist of humorous 60 second videos where Clark and Bryant converse about subjects they covered on previous podcasts while doing a variety of random activities (playing checkers, getting fitted for a suit, going to a doctor, driving through a car wash). As they speak, the scene changes repeatedly to something completely different, though their conversation continues uninterrupted as though nothing had happened. These clips have also aired during [[Television advertisement|commercial]] slots on [[Science Channel|Science]] and appear on their YouTube channel.\n\nThere is one unaired episode on [[animal detectives]] that they hope will never be published.<ref name=\"popular\"/> They have twice repeated a topic. They revisited the topic of [[Murphy's Law]] in 2011 after first doing it in 2008. As one of their first episodes, it was under 6 minutes in length. They also accidentally repeated a podcast on customs.<ref name=\"customs\"/> The first time was in 2010 and the second was in 2016.<ref name=\"customs\"/>\n\n===Format===\nThe podcast has been described as the \"heart and soul of the operation,\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and the \"well researched\" episodes cover a variety topics from the fields of \"science, history, urban legends, and pop culture, with the occasional conspiracy theory thrown in for good measure.\"<ref name=\"way\"/> Clark and Bryant have a conversation about the given topic such that, by the end, listeners have a \"basic working knowledge of that subject.\"<ref name=\"way\"/> Clark has said they are on a \"never ending quest to explain absolutely everything there is on planet earth and beyond.\"<ref name=\"circus\"/>\n\nTheir \"biggest hits\" include episodes on [[Spam (food)|Spam]], hangovers, tipping in restaurants, cheese, Barbie, and pinball.<ref name=\"toronto\"/> The topics that get the greatest response from listeners include death and grieving,<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and episodes that received \"less enthusiastic feedback\" include shows on homelessness/addiction, Tourette's Syndrome, and transgender issues.<ref name=\"way\"/> It was the second podcast on HowStuffWorks.<ref name=\"duo\"/> Episodes are normally around 45 minutes in length, although for more in-depth topics the show occasionally runs long as an hour or more. Initial episodes were much shorter in duration, often less than 10 minutes.\n\nOne of the reasons the hosts believe the show has been so successful is that they are \"definitely not experts\" in the myriad subjects they explore, but are instead \"just guys who enjoy research and [are] very curious.\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> Their formula \"is part self-deprecating humour, part infectious wonder and part self-discipline to go their separate ways and do all their own research and reflection before they get to the studio.\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> They often try to surprise one another with their research,<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> and do not have a script or a time limit before they sit down to record.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/>\n\nMost episodes end with listener mail, although there is an occasional segment known as \"Administrative Details.\" Listener mail debuted on November 25, 2008, in the episode named \"How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked\".<ref name=\"albert\"/> On that episode, they called it \"Correction Time.\" The first time it was known as \"Listener Mail\" was on January 8, 2009, an episode that was inspired by a listener's email.<ref name=\"armor\"/> During the Listener Mail portion of the podcast on April 11, 2013, a new jingle for the show was introduced.<ref name=\"brains\"/> It was written and recorded by Rusty Matyas of Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada, a musician and fan.<ref name=\"brains\"/> [http://www.jonbiegen.com Jon Biegen], another fan who covered Matyas' band, The Sheepdogs, has produced several new jingles for the show.<ref name=\"movies\"/>\n\nThe ''Stuff You Should Know'' staff includes Rebecca, the web producer, Matt and Noel, the occasional guest producers, as well as Sherry and Joe.<ref name=\"placebo\"/> Their studio is slightly larger than a broom closet.<ref name=\"replacing\"/>\n\n==YouTube==\n''Stuff You Should Know'' also has a YouTube channel, but stopped updating it regularly in 2017. Animated shorts are released on Mondays, This Day in History videos are released on Tuesdays, and Clark's series Don't Be Dumb airs a new episode on Thursdays.<ref name=\"welcometext\"/> In addition, the pair also offers live shorts and movie reviews.<ref name=\"welcome\"/>\n\nIn \"Don't Be Dumb,\" Clark explains a topic while wearing a tweed jacket and bow tie. His posture, gestures, and stilted language are intentionally uncomfortable and awkward. Each episode ends with Clark saying: \"So, next time someone tells you [subject of video], you set them straight! And tell them Josh sent you.\"\n\nInternet Roundup is a new video segment filmed in the studio. Chuck and Josh highlight a couple of posts found deep in the web that they find interesting, entreating or amusing. In 2009, Clark and Bryant began a \"short lived\" webscast.<ref name=\"zero\" /><ref name=\"webcast\"/>\n\n==TV show==\nA full-length ''Stuff You Should Know'' TV show premiered on January 19, 2013 on the [[Science Channel]], which was owned by [[Discovery Network]], the then-parent company of HowStuffWorks. The show included a pilot and 10 episodes each 30 minutes in length.<ref name=\"stars\"/><ref name=\"pilot\"/> The series was produced by production company School of Humans.\n\nDescribed as the \"love child of the British version of [[The Office (UK TV series)|''The Office'']] and an overheard conversation about science between two reasonably informed guys,\"<ref name=\"csi\"/> the show was about a real podcast that is set in a fictional world. Each episode followed Josh and Chuck inside and outside the recording booth, combining the factual information of their podcast with humorous, fictional story lines that align with each podcast topic.<ref name=\"tvshow\"/>\n\nThe show had \"the attention span of a teenaged boy\" and \"bounces from scene to scene without explanation or sense.\"<ref name=\"csi\"/> Focus groups at the 2012 South by Southwest screened episodes and provided feedback for the development of the show, and its pacing in particular.<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nThe lead actress on the show was [[Caitlin Bitzegaio]] of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].<ref name=\"popular\" /> The shows were directed by L.C. Crowley<ref name=\"cast\"/> with a theme song and score composed by The Henry Clay People,<ref name=\"sxsw\"/> the \"unofficial house band\" of Stuff You Should Know.<ref name=\"ticks\"/> Guests on the show included [[John Hodgman]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Michio Kaku]].<ref name=\"abouttv\"/>\n\nThe show was canceled after the first season \"due to poor ratings\",<ref name=\"ratings\"/> although each episode is made available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and [[Google Play]]. It was the most expensive pilot episode ever produced by the Discovery Channel.<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\n==Outside activities==\nAs with the other podcasts offered by HowStuffWorks, Stuff You Should Know has its own [[blog]] updated daily by its hosts and often featuring the same type of material found in the podcasts, often with show followups. There is also both a Twitter account and Facebook page for SYSK. Clark and Bryant were the co-hosts for the Science of Cyborgs event hosted by the [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]].<ref name=\"featured\"/>\n\n===Microlending===\nStarting in 2009, after doing an episode on how [[microlending]] works, the show began encouraging listeners to make loans on the online microlending site [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]].<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> A Stuff You Should Know team had raised $150,000 by the middle of 2010,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> and more than $2.75 million by November 2014.<ref name=\"kiva\"/> In 2009 they challenged [[Stephen Colbert]] to see whose team could raise $100,000 first<ref name=\"colbert\"/> and they \"beat the pants off of\" him, reaching that goal in three months.<ref name=\"microlend\"/>\n\nThe lending team is now run by fan volunteers,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> has since consistently ranked among the top five teams in terms of both donations and users. {{As of|2014|11}} the team ranked #7 for new users among new Kiva users, and in the \"Friends\" category of teams, ranked #2 for new users and amount loaned.<ref name=\"kiva\"/>\n\n===Books===\nClark and Bryant also present two longer and more in-depth audio programs featuring interviews and portions recorded [[Location shooting|on location]] available for purchase as [[audiobook]]s, which are entitled ''The Super Stuffed Guide to the Economy'' and ''The Super Stuffed Guide to Happiness''.\n\nThey are also working on a ''Stuff You Should Know'' book, which they hope to have published \"before the end of the decade.\"<ref name=\"stg\"/>\n\n===Cooperative for Education===\nIn February 2010,<ref name=\"CoEd\"/> Clark, Bryant, and Rowland traveled to Guatemala to promote [[Cooperative for Education]], an organization which gives textbooks to schools in Guatemala to be rented by students for a small fee that is then deposited into an account that will be used to replace old textbooks in the future.<ref name=\"bites\"/> They produced a pair of podcasts on the topic.<ref name=\"CoEd\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe show is downloaded more than 1 million times per week and is consistently on the iTunes Top 10 podcast rankings,<ref name=\"stars\"/> peaking at #1.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> It is \"one of the most downloaded podcasts on the planet.\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> The show won the 2014 People's Voice [[Webby Award]] in the Mobile \u2013 Podcast division.<ref name=\"webby\"/> and a place in [[Podcast Awards]]'s Education category.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> At live events the demographics of the audiences are \"all over the map. There are some geeks here and there, but also super cool people, and families and kids, and old people.\"<ref name=\"age\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' chose the TV show in early February 2013 as #7 for their \"The Must List: The Top 10 Things We Love This Week,\" writing, \"Whether you're curious about [[Beehive|bee colonies]] or [[Weather modification|weather control]], Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant have the scoop.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> The podcast has been said to cover \"a truly staggering range of topics.\"<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nClark and Bryant have been described as \"hosts so lovely you may just fall in love with them,\"<ref name=\"cosmo\"/> and provide the show with \"an everyman, conversational feel to the show \u2014 two pals sitting back and picking apart one topic after another.\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> Several couples have been brought together because of their mutual fondness for the podcast, and one even had a ''Stuff You Should Know''-themed wedding.<ref name=\"grows\"/>\n\nThey receive over 350 pieces of fan mail a week.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"featured\"/> After two months, their Facebook page had over 10,000 likes,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> and as of September 2015 it had more than 750,000. One reviewer said of it: \"It is never not fun to listen to.\"<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\n''Stuff You Should Know''{{'}}s \"beautifully, beautifully done\" production has set \"the audio standard,\" according to podcast reviewers [[Pod on Pod]]. They added that the audio quality \"could not be improved\" on the NPR-level production.<ref name=\"pod\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"abouttv\">{{cite web | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/about/about-the-tv-show/ | title = About the TV Show | accessdate = December 23, 2014 | publisher = Stuff You Should Know}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"age\">{{cite AV media | url = http://earlystart.blogs.cnn.com/2013/02/05/stuff-you-should-know-podcast-hosts-the-age-of-being-dumb-is-over/ | title = 'Stuff You Should Know' podcast hosts: The age of being dumb...is over | medium = video | date = February 5, 2015 | accessdate = February 20, 2015 | publisher = CNN}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite AV media | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-albert-einsteins-brain-worked | title = How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked | website = Stuff You Should Know | host = Josh Clark and Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant | date = November 25, 2008 | accessdate = September 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"armor\">{{cite podcast | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-body-armor-works-a-special-request/ | title = How Body Armor Works | website = Stuff You Should Know | host = Josh Clark and Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant | date = January 8, 2009 | accessdate = January 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"bath\">{{cite web | url = http://www.bathroomreader.com/2012/12/stuff-you-should-know/ | title = Stuff You Should Know | date = December 24, 2012 | publisher = Uncle John's Bathroom Reader | accessdate = September 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/StuffYouShouldKnow/photos/a.116136575072083.15004.114186148600459/962443020441430/?type=1&theater | date = March 15, 2015 | accessdate = March 15, 2015 | title = Hey everybody, it's Chuck's birthday!

It is primarily found in [[Judaism]]. Jews were killed in higher proportions than other groups; some scholars limit the definition of the Holocaust to the Jewish victims of the Nazis as Jews alone were targeted for the [[Final Solution]]. Others include the additional five million non-Jewish victims, bringing the total to about 11 million.<ref name =\"Niewyk\">{{cite book | title = The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust | authors = Donald L.

However, these views are in apparent contrast with the [[injustice]] and [[suffering]] in the world. [[Monotheism|Monotheists]] seek to reconcile this view of God with the existence of evil and suffering. In so doing, they are confronting what is known as the [[problem of evil]]. An elegant solution to the problem of evil is [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualism]], which envisions a second God with evil characteristics. A less elegant solution is to propose that God is actually an evil entity with the goal of increasing suffering in the world.   \n\nWithin all of the monotheistic faiths many answers ([[theodicy|theodicies]]) have been proposed. In light of the magnitude of depravity seen in the Holocaust, many people have also re-examined classical views on this subject. A common question raised in Holocaust theology is \"How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust?\"\n\nA scholarly literature, including a variety of anthologies and commentaries, has developed that reflects upon Holocaust theology as a religio-cultural phenomenon.<ref>Useful surveys include: Daniel R. Langton, 'Theology' in Writing the Holocaust, D. Langton and J-M Dreyfus, eds (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2011), 76-99; Stephen Katz, Shlomo Biderman, Gershon Greenberg, eds, Wrestling with God: Jewish Theological Responses During and After the Holocaust (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007); Dan Cohn-Sherbok, Holocaust Theology: A Reader (Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 2002).</ref>\n\n==Orthodox Jewish responses==\n{{Judaism}}\n\n===Biblical origin===\nAlthough the risks and obstacles were great, the promise of the covenant, already with the Jewish patriarchs and for the Land of Israel, is held up as eternally sealed in holiness:\n\n''To the point of destroying them''<ref>Leviticus 26:42-44</ref>: LeKhaLotam (\u05dc\u05db\u05dc\u05ea\u05dd, to destroy them) also implies KhaLah (\u05db\u05dc\u05d4, desire and yearning); God is saying, \"Even though you have sinned, I do not despise you, because you still desire to serve Me\" (''Likutey Halakhot V'').<ref>[[Rebbe Nachman of Breslov]]. ''REBBE NACHMAN'S TORAH: EXODUS-LEVITICUS''</ref>\n\n===Haredi and Hardal===\n[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] leader [[Joel Teitelbaum]] writes:\n<blockquote>Because of our sinfulness we have suffered greatly, suffering as bitter as [[Wormwood (Bible)|wormwood]], worse than any Israel has known since it became a people.... In former times, whenever troubles befell Jacob, the matter was pondered and reasons sought\u2013which sin had brought the troubles about\u2013so that we could make amends and return to the Lord, may He be blessed.... But in our generation one need not look far for the sin responsible for our calamity.... The heretics have made all kinds of efforts to violate these oaths, to go up by force and to seize sovereignty and freedom by themselves, before the appointed time.... [They] have lured the majority of the Jewish people into awful heresy, the likes of which have not been seen since the world was created.... And so it is no wonder that the Lord has lashed out in anger.... And there were also righteous people who perished because of the iniquity of the sinners and corrupters, so great was the [divine] wrath.<ref name=\"University of Chicago\">{{cite book|last1=Ravitzky|first1=Aviezer|title=Messianism, Zionism and Jewish Religious Radicalism|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago|page=124}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere were Messianist [[Zionists]], at the other end of the spectrum, who also saw the [[Holocaust]] as a collective punishment for ongoing Jewish unfaithfulness to God. Mordecai Atiyah was a leading advocate of this idea. [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]] and his disciples, for their part, avoided this harsh position, but they too theologically related the [[Holocaust]] to the Jewish recognition of God's divine wrath upon them. Kook writes: \"When the end comes and Israel fails to recognize it, there comes a cruel divine operation that removes [the Jewish people] from its exile.<ref name=\"University of Chicago\"/>\n\n[[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]], in 1939, stated that the Nazi persecution of the Jews was the fault of non-Orthodox Jews (Achiezer, volume III, Vilna 1939).<ref name=\"Hill & Wang\">{{cite book|last1=Landau|first1=David|title=Piety & Power: The World of Jewish Fundamentalism|url=https://archive.org/details/pietypowerworldo0000land|url-access=registration|date=1993|publisher=Hill & Wang}}</ref> [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] had similar views.<ref name=\"Hill & Wang\"/>\n\nMany [[Haredi]] rabbis today warn that a failure to follow ultra-Orthodox interpretations of religious law will cause God to send another Holocaust. [[Elazar Shach]], a former leader of the Lithuanian yeshiva Orthodoxy in Israel, made this claim on the eve of the 1991 [[Gulf War]], stating that there would be a new Holocaust for the abandonment of religion and \"desecration\" of [[Shabbat]] in Israel.\n\nBoth [[Meir Kahane]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=In Defense of G-d - Confronting the Holocaust|url=http://mkwords.com/text/index.php?i=195&a=In%20Defense%20of%20G~d%20-%20Confronting%20the%20Holocaust|website=mkwords.com|publisher=Jewish Press|date=1985}}</ref> and [[Avigdor Miller]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Avigdor|title=A Divine Madness: Rabbi Avigdor Miller's Defense of Hashem in the Matter of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifmsnQEACAAJ|publisher=Simchas Hachayim|date=2013|isbn=9780989621908}}</ref> have written extensively in defense of God during the Holocaust, while criticizing the European Jewish community's abandonment of traditional [[Jewish]] values.\n\n=== Chabad ===\nAccording to [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the seventh [[Rebbe]] of [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]], no explanation that human reason can provide can afford a satisfactory theodicy of Auschwitz, especially no explanation along the lines of divine punition. In his published discourses, for example, the following critique of any rational Auschwitz theodicy is to be found.\n\n<blockquote>In our own times, the destruction of six million Jews that took place with such great and terrible cruelty\u2014a tremendous desolation the likes of which never was (and never will be, may the Merciful One save us!) throughout all generations\u2014cannot be considered a matter of punishment for transgressions, for even the Satan himself could not configure a calculus of transgressions for that generation which could justify\u2014Heaven forbid!\u2014a punishment so severe. There is no rational explanation and no elucidation based on Torah wisdom whatsoever for the Devastation, nothing but the knowledge that \"thus it arises in My [God's] Mind!\" and \"It is a decree before Me.\" And even then, it is certainly not in the sense of a divine desire or innermost will of God\u2014Heaven forbid!\u2014for, as it says in Torah, \"When man suffers, what does the ''Shekhinah'' [the Divine Presence] say? 'My head is too heavy for me, etc.'\" [''Sanhedrin'' 46a [http://halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_46.html]. It is but \"for a small moment that have I forsaken thee\" [Is. 54:7]). And most certainly there is no explanation in terms of punishment for sins. On the contrary, all those who were killed in the Desolation are called ''kedoshim'' [holy ones] ... because they were killed in sanctification of God's Name (on account of being Jews) [\u2026]<ref>R. M. M. Schneerson, ''Sefer HaSi\u1e25ot 5751,'' Vol. 1 (Brooklyn: Kehot, 1992), pp. 233-34.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same approach, in which all forms of rational [[theodicy]] are categorically rejected, is adopted by Schneerson in his correspondence with [[Elie Wiesel]] (R. M. M. Schneerson, ''Iggerot Hakodesh,'' no. 8969, 23:370-71).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chighel.com/opening-statement-7a/|title=Opening Statement - 7(A) - Chighel|author=|date=|website=www.chighel.com}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Schneerson also suggested on occasion that the Holocaust could be compared to surgery. Thus Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote a condemnatory article on this comparison (\"God as surgeon,\" ''Haaretz'', Jun. 1, 2007 [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/god-as-surgeon-1.221983]). In this article he cites the following statement attributed to Rabbi Schneerson (in ''Mada Ve'emuna,'' Machon Lubavitch, 1980, Kfar Chabad). \"It is clear that 'no evil descends from Above,' and buried within torment and suffering is a core of exalted spiritual good. Not all human beings are able to perceive it, but it is very much there. So it is not impossible for the physical destruction of the Holocaust to be spiritually beneficial. On the contrary, it is quite possible that physical affliction is good for the spirit.\" The Rebbe is also quoted as saying: \"Hitler was a messenger of God in the same sense that Nebuchadnezzar is called 'God's servant' in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] (Chapter 25).\"\n\nAs Bauer notes in his article, [[Haika Grossman|Chaika Grossman]], a former Knesset member, had published an article in ''Hamishmar'' on 22 August 1980 quoting Schneerson and expressing her profound shock at his surgery analogue. On 28 August 1980, the Rebbe sent her a reply on his personal stationery in which he confirmed the substance of the analogue\u2014albeit not the import drawn by her.<ref>The letter is reprinted in ''Likutei Si\u1e25ot,'' Vol. 21, page 397.</ref>\n\nWhether the citation of the analogy, taken out of context and of dubious authority, indicates a \"justification of God's ways to man\" remains unclear, in any case, especially in light of Schneerson's authorized published works.\n\nWhat systematic scholarly studies of Schneerson's philosophy do show is that such questions in general must be understood in their specifically ''[[epistemology|epistemological]]'' character.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZw4AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=wolfson+open+secret&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMIhoKJ_MD5xgIVBBgsCh1BAAoZ#v=snippet&q=theodicy&f=false E.g. Elliot R. Wolfson, ''Open Secret'' (Columbia University Press, 2009), pp. 67ff]</ref> The surgery analogue is meant to illustrate the limits of human knowledge regarding the problem of evil and Auschwitz, not to provide positive knowledge regarding the problem. As the Rebbe explained in his letter to Grossman, it is because we have no understanding why the Holocaust had to happen that we must believe, as a matter of faith or trust in God (''emunah''), that it is ultimately for the benefit for those who perished as well as Jews and humanity at large. The Rebbe does not attempt to explain what the benefit is. But it is evidently [[Jewish eschatology|eschatological]]-[[Jewish messianism|messianic]]. As is the rationale for the \"surgery.\" The nature of the benefit can only become revealed in a messianic dimension wherein the human intellect has already undergone a radical cognitive revolution, a total epistemic paradigm shift. The analogy only works if human beings in their present state of understanding are compared to an unwitting person who has never heard of surgery who suddenly sees, for the first time, surgeons cutting open an apparently \"healthy\" human being.\n\nSomewhat in the spirit in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1791 essay on theodicy,<ref>http://cas.uchicago.edu/workshops/germanphilosophy/files/2013/02/Kant-On-the-Miscarriage-of-all-Philosophical-Trials-at-Theodicy.pdf</ref> the only \"Holocaust theology\" clearly propounded and endorsed by the Lubavitcher Rebbe is practical, rather than theoretical, [[Chabad Messianism|messianism]]. It is within a pragmatic-messianic framework of thinking that ''emunah'' (\"faith\") shows itself to be the transcendental condition of the very questioning and prosecution of God and the indignant revolt against God.\n\n<blockquote>... it is no mere coincidence that all authentic questioners [like Abraham and Moses] remained by their trust in God. For it could in no way be otherwise. Why so? If only the problem is meant with truth, and it is the expression and product of a true feeling of justice and uprightness, then it is logical that such a deep feeling can only come from being convinced that true justice is the justice that stems from a super-human source, that is, from something higher than both human intellect and human feeling. [...] after the initial tempestuous assault [on God by the sufferer], he has to see that the entire process of posing the problem and of wishing to understand with the intellect that which is higher than the intellect, is something that cannot take place. Moreover, he must\u2014after a rattling outrage and a thorough grieving\u2014ultimately come to the conclusion: Nevertheless I remain confident [''ani maamin'']. On the contrary: even ''more'' strongly!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chighel.com/the-argument-7b/|title=The Argument - 7(B) - Chighel|author=|date=|website=www.chighel.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Modern Orthodox Jewish views===\nMost Modern Orthodox Jews reject the idea that the Holocaust was God's fault. Modern Orthodox rabbis such as [[Joseph Soloveitchik]], [[Norman Lamm]], Randalf Stolzman, Abraham Besdin, [[Emanuel Rackman]], [[Eliezer Berkovits]], and others have written on this issue; many of their works have been collected in a volume published by the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] in a volume entitled: ''Theological and Halakhic Reflections on the Holocaust.''{{citation needed|date=March 2014|reason=original citation read: (edited by Bernhard H. Rosenberg and Fred Heuman, Ktav/RCA, 1992)}}\n\n==Works of important Jewish theologians==\n{{Unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}\n\n===Richard Rubenstein===\nProf. [[Richard L. Rubenstein|Richard Rubenstein]]'s original piece on this issue, ''After Auschwitz'', held that the only intellectually honest response to the Holocaust is to reject God, and to recognize that all existence is ultimately meaningless. According to this piece, there is no divine plan or purpose, no God that reveals His will to humankind, and God does not care about the world. Humans must assert and create their own value in life. This view has been rejected by Jews of all religious denominations, but his works were widely read in the Jewish community in the 1970s. Since that time Rubenstein has begun to move away from this view; his later works affirm a form of deism in which one may believe that God may exist as the basis for reality and some also include Kabbalistic notions of the nature of God.\n\n<blockquote>No man can really say that God is dead. How can we know that? Nevertheless, I am compelled to say that we live in the time of the \"death of God\". This is more a statement about man and his culture than about God. The death of God is a cultural fact ... When I say we live in the time of the death of God, I mean that the thread uniting God and man, heaven and earth, has been broken ...<ref name=RR>{{cite book | last=Rubenstein | first=Richard | title=After Auschwitz | url=https://archive.org/details/afterauschwitzra00rube | url-access=registration | location=Indianapolis | publisher=Bobbs-Merrill | year=1966}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Emil Fackenheim===\n[[Emil Fackenheim]] is known for his view that people must look carefully at the Holocaust, and to find within it a new revelation from God. For Fackenheim, the Holocaust was an \"epoch-making event\". In contrast to Richard Rubenstein's views, Fackenheim holds that people must still affirm their belief in God and God's continued role in the world. Fackenheim holds that the Holocaust reveals unto us a new Biblical commandment: we are forbidden to hand Hitler yet another, posthumous victory. He said that rejecting God because of the Holocaust was like giving in to Hitler.\n\n===Ignaz Maybaum===\nIn a rare view that has not been adopted by any sizable element of the Jewish or Christian community, [[Ignaz Maybaum]] has proposed that the Holocaust is the ultimate form of vicarious atonement. The Jewish people become in fact the \"suffering servant\" of Isaiah. The Jewish people suffer for the sins of the world. In his view: \"In Auschwitz Jews suffered vicarious atonement for the sins of mankind.\"\n\n===Eliezer Berkovits===\n[[Eliezer Berkovits]] held that man's free will depends on God's decision to remain hidden. If God were to reveal himself in history and hold back the hand of tyrants, man's free will would be rendered non-existent. This is a view that is loosely based on the kabbalistic concept of ''nahama d'kissufa'' (bread of shame)- the idea that greater satisfaction is achieved when one becomes deserving of a blessing rather than when it is given as a gift. [[Kabbalah]] teaches that this is one of the reasons God created humans with free will and with obligations, and that in order to maintain that free will, God reduces the extent to which he manifests himself in the world (''[[tzimtzum]]'').<ref name=AR>{{cite news|last=Rosenak | first=Avinoam | title=Faith, Crisis and Silence in Jewish Thought After the Holocaust in the Writings of Andre Neher\" (Hebrew), Y.

Kaufman]] and [[Milton Steinberg]] believe that God is not omnipotent, and thus is not to blame for humankind's abuse of free will. Thus, there is no contradiction between the existence of a good God and the existence of massive evil caused by part of humankind. It is claimed by them that this is also the view expressed by some classical Jewish authorities, such as [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], and [[Gersonides]].\n\n===David Weiss Halivni===\n[[David Weiss Halivni]], a Holocaust survivor from Hungary, says that the effort to associate the Shoah and sin is morally outrageous. He holds that it is unwarranted on a strict reading of the Tanakh. He claims that it reinforces an alarming tendency among ultra-Orthodox leaders to exploit such arguments on behalf of their own authority.  In \"Prayer in the Shoah\" he gives his response to the idea that the Holocaust was a punishment from God:\n\n<blockquote>What happened in the Shoah is above and beyond measure (l'miskpat): above and beyond suffering, above and beyond any punishment. There is no transgression that merits such punishment... and it cannot be attributed to sin.\" <ref>\"Prayer in the Shoah\". From: ''Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought''.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Irving Greenberg===\n[[Irving Greenberg]] is a Modern Orthodox rabbi who has written extensively on how the Holocaust should affect Jewish theology. Greenberg has an Orthodox understanding of God, he does not believe that God forces people to follow Jewish law; rather he believes that Jewish law is God's will for the Jewish people, and that Jews should follow Jewish law as normative.\n\nGreenberg's break with Orthodox theology comes with his analysis of the implications of the Holocaust. He writes that the worst thing that God could do to the Jewish people for failing to follow the law is Holocaust-level devastation, yet this has already occurred. Greenberg is not claiming that God did use the Holocaust to punish Jews; he is just saying that if God chose to do so, that would be the worst possible thing. There really is nothing worse that God could do. Therefore, since God cannot punish us any worse than what actually has happened, and since God does not force Jews to follow Jewish law, then we cannot claim that these laws are enforceable on us. Therefore, he argues that the covenant between God and the Jewish people is effectively broken and unenforceable.\n\nGreenberg notes that there have been several terrible destructions of the Jewish community, each with the effect of distancing the Jewish people further from God. According to rabbinic literature, after the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem and the mass-killing of Jerusalem's Jews, the Jews received no more direct prophecy. After the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem and the mass-killing of Jerusalem's Jews, the Jews no longer could present sacrifices at the Temple. This way of reaching God was at an end. After the Holocaust, Greenberg concludes that God does not respond to the prayers of Jews anymore.\n\nThus, God has unilaterally broken his covenant with the Jewish people. In this view, God no longer has the [[moral authority]] to command people to follow his will. Greenberg does not conclude that Jews and God should part ways; rather he holds that we should heal the covenant between Jews and God, and that the Jewish people should accept Jewish law on a voluntary basis.\n\nHis views on this subject have made him the subject of much criticism within the Orthodox community.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Elie Wiesel===\nA Romanian Jewish-American writer, professor, political activist, Nobel Laureate, and Holocaust survivor, [[Elie Wiesel]] was the author of 57 books, including ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'', a work based on his experiences as a prisoner in the Auschwitz, Buna, and Buchenwald concentration camps. Wiesel's 1979 play ''[[The Trial of God]]'' is about a trial in which God is the defendant, and is reportedly based on events that Wiesel himself witnessed as a teenager in Auschwitz. Over the course of the trial, a number of arguments are made, both for and against God's guilt. Wiesel's theological stance, illustrated through the intuitive possibilities of literature, is a theology of existentialist protest, which neither denies God, nor accepts theodicies.<ref>''All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs vol 1'', Elie Wiesel, Schocken 1996.

However, these views are in apparent contrast with the [[injustice]] and [[suffering]] in the world. [[Monotheism|Monotheists]] seek to reconcile this view of God with the existence of evil and suffering. In so doing, they are confronting what is known as the [[problem of evil]]. An elegant solution to the problem of evil is [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualism]], which envisions a second God with evil characteristics. A less elegant solution is to propose that God is actually an evil entity with the goal of increasing suffering in the world.   \n\nWithin all of the monotheistic faiths many answers ([[theodicy|theodicies]]) have been proposed. In light of the magnitude of depravity seen in the Holocaust, many people have also re-examined classical views on this subject. A common question raised in Holocaust theology is \"How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust?\"\n\nA scholarly literature, including a variety of anthologies and commentaries, has developed that reflects upon Holocaust theology as a religio-cultural phenomenon.<ref>Useful surveys include: Daniel R.

In his published discourses, for example, the following critique of any rational Auschwitz theodicy is to be found.\n\n<blockquote>In our own times, the destruction of six million Jews that took place with such great and terrible cruelty\u2014a tremendous desolation the likes of which never was (and never will be, may the Merciful One save us!) throughout all generations\u2014cannot be considered a matter of punishment for transgressions, for even the Satan himself could not configure a calculus of transgressions for that generation which could justify\u2014Heaven forbid!\u2014a punishment so severe. There is no rational explanation and no elucidation based on Torah wisdom whatsoever for the Devastation, nothing but the knowledge that \"thus it arises in My [God's] Mind!\" and \"It is a decree before Me.\" And even then, it is certainly not in the sense of a divine desire or innermost will of God\u2014Heaven forbid!\u2014for, as it says in Torah, \"When man suffers, what does the ''Shekhinah'' [the Divine Presence] say? 'My head is too heavy for me, etc.'\" [''Sanhedrin'' 46a [http://halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_46.html]. It is but \"for a small moment that have I forsaken thee\" [Is. 54:7]). And most certainly there is no explanation in terms of punishment for sins. On the contrary, all those who were killed in the Desolation are called ''kedoshim'' [holy ones] ... because they were killed in sanctification of God's Name (on account of being Jews) [\u2026]<ref>R. M. M. Schneerson, ''Sefer HaSi\u1e25ot 5751,'' Vol. 1 (Brooklyn: Kehot, 1992), pp. 233-34.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same approach, in which all forms of rational [[theodicy]] are categorically rejected, is adopted by Schneerson in his correspondence with [[Elie Wiesel]] (R. M. M. Schneerson, ''Iggerot Hakodesh,'' no. 8969, 23:370-71).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chighel.com/opening-statement-7a/|title=Opening Statement - 7(A) - Chighel|author=|date=|website=www.chighel.com}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Schneerson also suggested on occasion that the Holocaust could be compared to surgery. Thus Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote a condemnatory article on this comparison (\"God as surgeon,\" ''Haaretz'', Jun. 1, 2007 [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/god-as-surgeon-1.221983]). In this article he cites the following statement attributed to Rabbi Schneerson (in ''Mada Ve'emuna,'' Machon Lubavitch, 1980, Kfar Chabad). \"It is clear that 'no evil descends from Above,' and buried within torment and suffering is a core of exalted spiritual good. Not all human beings are able to perceive it, but it is very much there. So it is not impossible for the physical destruction of the Holocaust to be spiritually beneficial. On the contrary, it is quite possible that physical affliction is good for the spirit.\" The Rebbe is also quoted as saying: \"Hitler was a messenger of God in the same sense that Nebuchadnezzar is called 'God's servant' in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] (Chapter 25).\"\n\nAs Bauer notes in his article, [[Haika Grossman|Chaika Grossman]], a former Knesset member, had published an article in ''Hamishmar'' on 22 August 1980 quoting Schneerson and expressing her profound shock at his surgery analogue. On 28 August 1980, the Rebbe sent her a reply on his personal stationery in which he confirmed the substance of the analogue\u2014albeit not the import drawn by her.<ref>The letter is reprinted in ''Likutei Si\u1e25ot,'' Vol. 21, page 397.</ref>\n\nWhether the citation of the analogue, taken out of context and of dubious authority, indicates a \"justification of God's ways to man\" remains unclear, in any case, especially in light of Schneerson's authorized published works.\n\nWhat systematic scholarly studies of Schneerson's philosophy do show is that such questions in general must be understood in their specifically ''[[epistemology|epistemological]]'' character.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZw4AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=wolfson+open+secret&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMIhoKJ_MD5xgIVBBgsCh1BAAoZ#v=snippet&q=theodicy&f=false E.g. Elliot R. Wolfson, ''Open Secret'' (Columbia University Press, 2009), pp. 67ff]</ref> The surgery analogue is meant to illustrate the limits of human knowledge regarding the problem of evil and Auschwitz, not to provide positive knowledge regarding the problem. As the Rebbe explained in his letter to Grossman, it is because we have no understanding why the Holocaust had to happen that we must believe, as a matter of faith or trust in God (''emunah''), that it is ultimately for the benefit for those who perished as well as Jews and humanity at large. The Rebbe does not attempt to explain what the benefit is. But it is evidently [[Jewish eschatology|eschatological]]-[[Jewish messianism|messianic]]. As is the rationale for the \"surgery.\" The nature of the benefit can only become revealed in a messianic dimension wherein the human intellect has already undergone a radical cognitive revolution, a total epistemic paradigm shift. The analogue only works if human beings in their present state of understanding are compared to an unwitting person who has never heard of surgery who suddenly sees, for the first time, surgeons cutting open an apparently \"healthy\" human being.\n\nSomewhat in the spirit in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1791 essay on theodicy,<ref>http://cas.uchicago.edu/workshops/germanphilosophy/files/2013/02/Kant-On-the-Miscarriage-of-all-Philosophical-Trials-at-Theodicy.pdf</ref> the only \"Holocaust theology\" clearly propounded and endorsed by the Lubavitcher Rebbe is practical, rather than theoretical, [[Chabad Messianism|messianism]]. It is within a pragmatic-messianic framework of thinking that ''emunah'' (\"faith\") shows itself to be the transcendental condition of the very questioning and prosecution of God and the indignant revolt against God.\n\n<blockquote>... it is no mere coincidence that all authentic questioners [like Abraham and Moses] remained by their trust in God. For it could in no way be otherwise. Why so? If only the problem is meant with truth, and it is the expression and product of a true feeling of justice and uprightness, then it is logical that such a deep feeling can only come from being convinced that true justice is the justice that stems from a super-human source, that is, from something higher than both human intellect and human feeling. [...] after the initial tempestuous assault [on God by the sufferer], he has to see that the entire process of posing the problem and of wishing to understand with the intellect that which is higher than the intellect, is something that cannot take place.

Modern Orthodox rabbis such as [[Joseph Soloveitchik]], [[Norman Lamm]], Randalf Stolzman, Abraham Besdin, [[Emanuel Rackman]], [[Eliezer Berkovits]], and others have written on this issue; many of their works have been collected in a volume published by the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] in a volume entitled: ''Theological and Halakhic Reflections on the Holocaust.''{{citation needed|date=March 2014|reason=original citation read: (edited by Bernhard H. Rosenberg and Fred Heuman, Ktav/RCA, 1992)}}\n\n==Works of important Jewish theologians==\n{{Unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}\n\n===Richard Rubenstein===\nProf. [[Richard L. Rubenstein|Richard Rubenstein]]'s original piece on this issue, ''After Auschwitz'', held that the only intellectually honest response to the Holocaust is to reject God, and to recognize that all existence is ultimately meaningless. According to this piece, there is no divine plan or purpose, no God that reveals His will to humankind, and God does not care about the world. Humans must assert and create their own value in life. This view has been rejected by Jews of all religious denominations, but his works were widely read in the Jewish community in the 1970s. Since that time Rubenstein has begun to move away from this view; his later works affirm a form of deism in which one may believe that God may exist as the basis for reality and some also include Kabbalistic notions of the nature of God.\n\n<blockquote>No man can really say that God is dead. How can we know that? Nevertheless, I am compelled to say that we live in the time of the \"death of God\". This is more a statement about man and his culture than about God. The death of God is a cultural fact ... When I say we live in the time of the death of God, I mean that the thread uniting God and man, heaven and earth, has been broken ...<ref name=RR>{{cite book | last=Rubenstein | first=Richard | title=After Auschwitz | url=https://archive.org/details/afterauschwitzra00rube | url-access=registration | location=Indianapolis | publisher=Bobbs-Merrill | year=1966}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Emil Fackenheim===\n[[Emil Fackenheim]] is known for his view that people must look carefully at the Holocaust, and to find within it a new revelation from God. For Fackenheim, the Holocaust was an \"epoch-making event\". In contrast to Richard Rubenstein's views, Fackenheim holds that people must still affirm their belief in God and God's continued role in the world. Fackenheim holds that the Holocaust reveals unto us a new Biblical commandment: we are forbidden to hand Hitler yet another, posthumous victory. He said that rejecting God because of the Holocaust was like giving in to Hitler.\n\n===Ignaz Maybaum===\nIn a rare view that has not been adopted by any sizable element of the Jewish or Christian community, [[Ignaz Maybaum]] has proposed that the Holocaust is the ultimate form of vicarious atonement. The Jewish people become in fact the \"suffering servant\" of Isaiah. The Jewish people suffer for the sins of the world. In his view: \"In Auschwitz Jews suffered vicarious atonement for the sins of mankind.\"\n\n===Eliezer Berkovits===\n[[Eliezer Berkovits]] held that man's free will depends on God's decision to remain hidden. If God were to reveal himself in history and hold back the hand of tyrants, man's free will would be rendered non-existent. This is a view that is loosely based on the kabbalistic concept of ''nahama d'kissufa'' (bread of shame)- the idea that greater satisfaction is achieved when one becomes deserving of a blessing rather than when it is given as a gift. [[Kabbalah]] teaches that this is one of the reasons God created humans with free will and with obligations, and that in order to maintain that free will, God reduces the extent to which he manifests himself in the world (''[[tzimtzum]]'').<ref name=AR>{{cite news|last=Rosenak | first=Avinoam | title=Faith, Crisis and Silence in Jewish Thought After the Holocaust in the Writings of Andre Neher\" (Hebrew), Y. Amir (ed.), Andre Neher and Jewish Thought in Post-Holocaust France | publisher=Van Leer Institute and Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publication House | year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Harold Kushner, William Kaufman and Milton Steinberg===\n[[Harold Kushner]], [[William E. Kaufman]] and [[Milton Steinberg]] believe that God is not omnipotent, and thus is not to blame for humankind's abuse of free will. Thus, there is no contradiction between the existence of a good God and the existence of massive evil caused by part of humankind. It is claimed by them that this is also the view expressed by some classical Jewish authorities, such as [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], and [[Gersonides]].\n\n===David Weiss Halivni===\n[[David Weiss Halivni]], a Holocaust survivor from Hungary, says that the effort to associate the Shoah and sin is morally outrageous. He holds that it is unwarranted on a strict reading of the Tanakh. He claims that it reinforces an alarming tendency among ultra-Orthodox leaders to exploit such arguments on behalf of their own authority.  In \"Prayer in the Shoah\" he gives his response to the idea that the Holocaust was a punishment from God:\n\n<blockquote>What happened in the Shoah is above and beyond measure (l'miskpat): above and beyond suffering, above and beyond any punishment. There is no transgression that merits such punishment... and it cannot be attributed to sin.\" <ref>\"Prayer in the Shoah\". From: ''Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought''.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Irving Greenberg===\n[[Irving Greenberg]] is a Modern Orthodox rabbi who has written extensively on how the Holocaust should affect Jewish theology. Greenberg has an Orthodox understanding of God, he does not believe that God forces people to follow Jewish law; rather he believes that Jewish law is God's will for the Jewish people, and that Jews should follow Jewish law as normative.\n\nGreenberg's break with Orthodox theology comes with his analysis of the implications of the Holocaust. He writes that the worst thing that God could do to the Jewish people for failing to follow the law is Holocaust-level devastation, yet this has already occurred. Greenberg is not claiming that God did use the Holocaust to punish Jews; he is just saying that if God chose to do so, that would be the worst possible thing. There really is nothing worse that God could do. Therefore, since God cannot punish us any worse than what actually has happened, and since God does not force Jews to follow Jewish law, then we cannot claim that these laws are enforceable on us. Therefore, he argues that the covenant between God and the Jewish people is effectively broken and unenforceable.\n\nGreenberg notes that there have been several terrible destructions of the Jewish community, each with the effect of distancing the Jewish people further from God. According to rabbinic literature, after the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem and the mass-killing of Jerusalem's Jews, the Jews received no more direct prophecy. After the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem and the mass-killing of Jerusalem's Jews, the Jews no longer could present sacrifices at the Temple. This way of reaching God was at an end. After the Holocaust, Greenberg concludes that God does not respond to the prayers of Jews anymore.\n\nThus, God has unilaterally broken his covenant with the Jewish people. In this view, God no longer has the [[moral authority]] to command people to follow his will. Greenberg does not conclude that Jews and God should part ways; rather he holds that we should heal the covenant between Jews and God, and that the Jewish people should accept Jewish law on a voluntary basis.\n\nHis views on this subject have made him the subject of much criticism within the Orthodox community.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Elie Wiesel===\nA Romanian Jewish-American writer, professor, political activist, Nobel Laureate, and Holocaust survivor, [[Elie Wiesel]] was the author of 57 books, including ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'', a work based on his experiences as a prisoner in the Auschwitz, Buna, and Buchenwald concentration camps. Wiesel's 1979 play ''[[The Trial of God]]'' is about a trial in which God is the defendant, and is reportedly based on events that Wiesel himself witnessed as a teenager in Auschwitz. Over the course of the trial, a number of arguments are made, both for and against God's guilt. Wiesel's theological stance, illustrated through the intuitive possibilities of literature, is a theology of existentialist protest, which neither denies God, nor accepts theodicies.<ref>''All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs vol 1'', Elie Wiesel, Schocken 1996. Chapter \"God's Suffering: A Commentary\" p 101-106 and other references in the book</ref> Regarding the theme of protest in particular, Menachem Mendel Schneerson maintained a correspondence with Wiesel, urging him to perceive faith (''emunah'') as the transcendental precondition of authentic protest.<ref>Michael Chighel, [http://www.chighel.com/hosanna/ ''Hosanna!

The ending sees the hope of renewed mystical reconciliation with God.\n\n==Post-Holocaust and child abuse theology==\nDavid R. Blumenthal, in his book ''Facing the Abusing God'' (1993), has drawn on data from the field of [[child abuse]] and has proposed \"worship of God through protest\" as a legitimate response of survivors of both the Holocaust and child abuse.<ref>Blumenthal, D (1993): [https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNKpfyAOH0C&lpg=PA249&ots=4x5bh-_wYb&dq=facing%20the%20abusing%20god&pg=PA250#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Facing the Abusing God: A Theology of Protest'']. Despite the term \"abuse\" being new in Jewish theology, as shown on page 261 of the book, the arguments connected to it have a long tradition in Jewish theology.</ref>\n\nAnother writer addressing survivors of the Holocaust and child abuse is John K. Roth, whose essay \"A Theodicy of Protest\" is included in ''Encountering Evil: Live Options in Theodicy'' (1982).<ref>Roth et al. (1982) - Extracted from a  [http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Articles/Philosophy_of_religion/Evil/roth_theodicy_protest2.html review] of Roth's essay, in which the author comments that \"Roth is painting a picture of God as the ultimate example of a bad and abusive parent!\"</ref>\n\n=={{anchor |Christianity}} Works of important Christian theologians==\n{{See also|Death of God theology}}\n\n===J\u00fcrgen Moltmann===\nIn ''The Crucified God'' [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]] speaks of how in a theology after Auschwitz the traditional notion of God needed to be revised:\n:Shattered and broken, the survivors of my generation were then returning from camps and hospitals to the lecture room. A theology which did not speak of God in the sight of the one who was abandoned and crucified would have had nothing to say to us then.<ref name=\"Moltmann\">J\u00fcrgen Moltmann, ''The Crucified God: The Cross of Christ as the Foundation and Criticism of Christian Theology'' (Augsburg Fortress:Minneapolis, 1993).</ref>{{rp|1}}\n\nThe traditional notion of an impassible <!--this spelling appears to be correct though very rare: impassible = immune to pain; cf. impassable = cannot be passed--> unmoved mover had died in those camps and was no longer tenable. Moltmann proposes instead a crucified God who is both a suffering and protesting God.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} That is, God is not detached from suffering but willingly enters into human suffering in compassion.\n\n:God in Auschwitz and Auschwitz in the crucified God&nbsp;\u2013 that is the basis for real hope that both embraces and overcomes the world.<ref name=\"Moltmann\"/>{{rp|278}}\n\nThis is in contrast both with the move of theism to justify God's actions and the move of atheism to accuse God.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Moltmann's trinitarian theology of the cross instead says that God is a protesting God who opposes the gods of this world of power and domination by entering into human pain and suffering on the cross and on the gallows of Auschwitz.  Moltmann's theology of the cross was later developed into  [[Liberation Theology|liberation theologies]] from suffering people under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ism in Eastern Europe and military dictatorships in South America and South Korea.\n\n===Pope Benedict XVI===\nIn the address given on the occasion of his visit to the extermination camp of [[Auschwitz]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] suggested a reading of the events of the Holocaust as motivated by a hatred of God himself.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The address begins by acknowledging the impossibility of an adequate theological response:\n\n:In a place like this, words fail; in the end, there can only be a dread silence&nbsp;\u2013 a silence which is itself a heartfelt cry to God: Why, Lord, did you remain silent?  How could you tolerate all this?  In silence, then, we bow our heads before the endless line of those who suffered and were put to death here; yet our silence becomes in turn a plea for forgiveness and reconciliation, a plea to the living God never to let this happen again.<ref name=\"pope\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/may/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060528_auschwitz-birkenau_en.html|title=Apostolic voyage in Poland: Prayer to commemorate the victims of the Concentration Camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau (May 28, 2006) - BENEDICT XVI|author=|date=|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, he proposes that the actions of the Nazis can be seen as having been motivated by a hatred of God and a desire to exalt human power, with the Holocaust serving as a means by which to erase witness to God and his Law:\n\n:The rulers of the [[Third Reich]] wanted to crush the entire Jewish people, to cancel it from the register of the peoples of the earth.  Thus the words of the [[Psalm]]: \"We are being killed, accounted as sheep for the slaughter\" were fulfilled in a terrifying way. Deep down, those vicious criminals, by wiping out this people, wanted to kill the God who called [[Abraham]], who spoke on [[Mount Sinai|Sinai]] and laid down principles to serve as a guide for mankind, principles that are eternally valid. If this people, by its very existence, was a witness to the God who spoke to humanity and took us to himself, then that God finally had to die and power had to belong to man alone&nbsp;\u2013 to those men, who thought that by force they had made themselves masters of the world. By destroying Israel, by the Shoah, they ultimately wanted to tear up the taproot of the Christian faith and to replace it with a faith of their own invention: faith in the rule of man, the rule of the powerful.<ref name=\"pope\"/>\n\nMost coverage of the address was positive, with praise from Italian and Polish rabbis.

The major site of action in the nephron appears on an electroneutral NaCl co-transporter by competing for the chloride site on the transporter. By impairing Na<sup>+</sup> transport in the distal convoluted tubule, hydrochlorothiazide induces a [[natriuresis]] and concomitant water loss. Thiazides increase the reabsorption of calcium in this segment in a manner unrelated to sodium transport.<ref>Uniformed Services University Pharmacology Note Set #3 2010, Lectures #39 & #40, Eric

The major site of action in the nephron appears on an electroneutral NaCl co-transporter by competing for the chloride site on the transporter. By impairing Na<sup>+</sup> transport in the distal convoluted tubule, hydrochlorothiazide induces a [[natriuresis]] and concomitant water loss. Thiazides increase the reabsorption of calcium in this segment in a manner unrelated to sodium transport.<ref>Uniformed Services University Pharmacology Note Set #3 2010, Lectures #39 & #40, Eric Marks</ref> Additionally, by other mechanisms, HCTZ is believed to lower peripheral vascular resistance.<ref name=Du2010/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:Two boxes and a blister pack of Co-Diovan (Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide), Singapore - 20150210.jpg|thumb|Co-Diovan ([[Valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide|valsartan and HCTZ]])]]\n[[File:001850277lg Benazepril hydrochloride 20 MG Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet.jpg|right|thumb|Two generic [[Benazepril|benazepril HCl]] 20&nbsp;mg and HCTZ 25&nbsp;mg oral tablets]]\n\n===Trade names===\nHydrochlorothiazide is available as a [[generic drug]] under a large number of brand names, including Apo-Hydro, Aquazide, BPZide, Dichlotride, Esidrex, Hydrochlorot, Hydrodiuril, HydroSaluric, Hypothiazid, Microzide, Oretic and many others.{{mcn|date=January 2020}}\n\nTo reduce [[Polypharmacy#Pill burden|pill burden]] and in order to reduce side effects, hydrochlorothiazide is often used in [[Combination drug|fixed-dose combinations]] with many other classes of antihypertensive drugs such as:\n* [[ACE inhibitor]]s \u2014 e.g. Prinzide or Zestoretic ([[ACE inhibitor and thiazide combination|with lisinopril]]), Co-Renitec (with [[enalapril]]), Capozide (with [[captopril]]), Accuretic (with [[quinapril]]), Monopril HCT (with [[fosinopril]]), Lotensin HCT (with [[benazepril]]), etc.\n* [[Angiotensin II receptor antagonist|Angiotensin receptor blocker]]s \u2014 e.g. Hyzaar ([[Losartan/hydrochlorothiazide|with losartan]]), Co-Diovan or Diovan HCT ([[Valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide|with valsartan]]), Teveten Plus (with [[eprosartan]]), Avalide or CoAprovel (with [[irbesartan]]), Atacand HCT or Atacand Plus (with [[candesartan]]), etc.\n* [[Beta blocker]]s \u2014 e.g. Ziac or Lodoz (with [[bisoprolol]]), Nebilet Plus or Nebilet HCT (with [[nebivolol]]), Dutoprol or Lopressor HCT (with [[metoprolol]]), etc.\n* Direct [[renin inhibitor]]s \u2014 e.g. Co-Rasilez or Tekturna HCT (with [[aliskiren]])\n* [[Potassium sparing diuretics]]: Dyazide and Maxzide [[triamterene]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Triamterene and Hydrochlorothiazide | website=MedlinePlus | date=1 January 2020 | url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601125.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102052553/https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601125.html | archive-date=2 January 2020 | url-status=live | access-date=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Sport===\nUse of hydrochlorothiazide is prohibited by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] for its ability to mask the use of performance-enhancing drugs.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/prohibited_list_2018_en.pdf | title = Prohibited List | date = January 2018 | publisher = [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web| url = https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/name/hydrochlorothiazide | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine| work = Drug Information Portal| title = Hydrochlorothiazide }}\n\n{{Diuretics}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = [[Pharmacodynamics]]\n| titlestyle = background:#ccccff\n| list1 = \n{{Ionotropic glutamate receptor modulators}}\n{{Symporter inhibitors}}\n}}\n\n{{portal bar|Pharmacy and pharmacology|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators]]\n[[Category:Antihypertensive agents]]\n[[Category:Benzothiadiazines]]\n[[Category:Merck brands]]\n[[Category:Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]]\n[[Category:Diuretics]]\n[[Category:IARC Group 2B carcinogens]]\n[[Category:Sulfonamides]]\n[[Category:Thiazides]]\n[[Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances]]\n[[Category:World Health Organization essential medicines]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "name_user": "Dwwren", "label": "safe", "comment": "Inserted the word study", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochlorothiazide"}

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[Second World War]], when the newly-independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History & Traditions: Pearls & pearling |work=UAEinteract |accessdate=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |archivedate=6 February 2016  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates.

This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962.

The smaller islands, as well as many [[coral reef]]s and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the [[Al Batinah Region|Al B\u0101\u0163inah]] coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]], the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] of Oman separated by the UAE.\n\nSouth and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling [[dune|sand dunes]] merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive [[Liwa Oasis]] is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia. About {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} to the northeast of Liwa is the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Al-Buraimi]] oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. [[Lake Zakher]] is a [[Man-made lake|human-made lake]] near the border with Oman.\n\nPrior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Al-Hajar al-Gharbi]] Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n{{main|Wildlife of the United Arab Emirates}}\n[[File:1501200713074 Acacia tortilis.jpg|thumb|[[Acacia]] trees growing in desert suburbs near [[Fujairah]]]]\nThe oases grow [[Phoenix dactylifera|date palms]], [[acacia]] and [[eucalyptus]] trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of [[grasses]] and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on [[Sir Bani Yas]] Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, [[Arabian Oryx]], [[Arabian camel]] and [[leopard]]s. [[Coastal fish]] and [[mammals]] consist mainly of [[mackerel]], [[Estuary perch|perch]], and [[tuna]], as well as [[shark]]s and whales.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of the UAE is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters.

This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[Second World War]], when the newly-independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History & Traditions: Pearls & pearling |work=UAEinteract |accessdate=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |archivedate=6 February 2016  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven [[sheikhs]] of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office.

BP joined with [[Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles]] (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA).

In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama, a rock formation that would provide many valuable oil finds. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962.

Nowadays the UAE is one of the world's richest countries, with GDP per capita almost 80% higher than OECD average.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs impressive as economic growth has been in the UAE, the total population has increased from just around 550,000 in 1975 to close to 10 million in 2018. This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.

The Romans themselves did not see being \"Roman\" as something based on shared language or inherited ethnicity, but saw it as something based on being part of the same larger religious or political community and sharing common customs, values, morals and ways of life.  \n\nInitially, this larger community was the city of [[Rome]] itself, but as the land under Roman dominion continued to increase, [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]] was gradually granted to the various peoples under Roman rule. The number of Romans rapidly increased due to the creation of colonies throughout the empire, through grants of citizenship to veterans of the [[Roman army]], and through personal grants by the [[Roman emperors]]. In 212 AD, Emperor [[Caracalla]] extended citizenship rights to all the inhabitants of the Roman Empire through his [[Antonine Constitution]].  \n\nRoman identity in [[Western Europe]] survived the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century as a diminished but still important political resource. It was only with the wars of the eastern Emperor [[Justinian I]], aimed at restoring the western provinces to imperial control, that \"Roman\" began to fade as an identity in Western Europe, more or less disappearing in the 8th and 9th centuries and increasingly being applied by westerners only to the citizens of the city of Rome. The city itself continued to be important to Western Europeans but this importance stemmed from Rome being the seat of the [[Pope]], not from it once having been the capital of a great empire. In the primarily Greek-speaking eastern empire, often called the [[Byzantine Empire]] by modern historians, Roman identity survived uninterrupted until its fall in 1453 and beyond. \n\nRoman identity survives in a significantly reduced capacity today. \"Roman\" is still used to refer to a citizen of the city itself and the term ''Romioi'' is sometimes (albeit rarely) used as an identity by [[Greeks]]. Additionally, the names and identities of some [[Romance peoples]] remain connected to their Roman roots, especially in the [[Alps]] (such as the [[Romansh people]] and the [[Romands]]) and the [[Balkans]] (such as the [[Romanians]], [[Aromanians]] and [[Istro-Romanians]]). \n\n== Meaning of \"Roman\" ==\n{{See also|Romanitas}}\n[[File:Pompeii_family_feast_painting_Naples.jpg|alt=|thumb|1st century AD wall painting from [[Pompeii]] depicting a multigenerational banquet.]]\nThe term \"Roman\" is typically used interchangeably to describe a historical timespan, a material culture, a geographical location and a personal identity. Though these concepts are obviously related, they are not identical. Although modern historians tend to have a preferred idea of what being Roman meant, so-called ''[[Romanitas]]'' (a term rarely used in [[Ancient Rome]] itself), the idea of \"Romanness\" was never static or unchanging.'''{{Sfn|Revell|2009|p=x}}''' What being Roman meant and what Rome itself was would have been viewed considerably different by a Roman under the [[Roman Republic]] in the 2nd century BC and a Roman living in [[Constantinople]] in the 6th century AD. Even then, some elements remained common throughout much of Roman history.'''{{Sfn|Revell|2009|p=x}}'''\n\nCrucial to understanding Roman identity is that unlike other ancient peoples, such as the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] or [[Gauls]], the Romans did not see their common identity as one necessarily based on shared language or inherited ethnicity. Instead, the important factors of being Roman were being part of the same larger religious or political community and sharing common customs, values, morals and ways of life.'''{{Sfn|Woolf|2000|p=120}}'''\n\n== Roman Republic ==\n\n=== Political history ===\n{{See also|Rise of Rome}}[[File:Roman_Republic_Empire_map_fast.gif|alt=|left|thumb|A graphic showing border changes of the Roman state from the 6th century BC to the 5th century AD.]]\nOne of the most important aspects of ancient Roman life was warfare; the Romans went on military campaigns almost every year, rituals marked the beginning and the end of the campaigning seasons and elections of chief magistrates (commanders of the army) generally took place on the [[Campus Martius]] (\"Field of Mars\", Mars being the Roman god of war). All Roman citizens were liable for military service, with most serving for several years during their youth. All soldiers could earn honors and rewards for valor in battle, though the highest military reward of all, the [[Roman triumph|triumph]], was reserved for commanders and generals.'''{{Sfn|Rich|Shipley|p=1|1995}}''' Roman warfare was not overwhelmingly successful for the first few centuries of the city's history, with most campaigns being small engagements with the other Latin city-states in the immediate vicinity, but from the middle of the 4th century BC onwards, the Romans won a series of victories which saw them rise to rule all of Italy south of the [[Po (river)|Po river]] by 270 BC. Following the conquest of Italy, the Romans waged war against the great powers of their time; [[Carthage]] to the south and west and the various [[Diadochi|Hellenistic kingdoms]] to the east, and by the middle of the second century BC, all rivals had been defeated and Rome became recognized by other countries as the definite masters of the Mediterranean.'''{{Sfn|Rich|Shipley|p=2|1995}}'''\n[[File:The Growth of Roman Power in Italy.jpg|thumb|Political divisions in [[Roman Italy|Roman-controlled Italy]] before the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]]. Roman communities are indicated with green.]]\nAlthough Roman technological prowess and their ability to adopt strategies and technology from their enemies made their army among the most formidable in the ancient world, the Roman war machine was also made powerful by the vast pool of manpower available for the [[Roman legion|Roman legions]]. This manpower derived from the way in which the Romans had organized their conquered land in Italy. By the late 3rd century BC, about a third of the people in Italy south of the Po river had been made Roman citizens (meaning they were liable for military service) and the rest had been made allies, frequently called on to join Roman wars.'''{{Sfn|Rich|Shipley|p=2|1995}}''' These allies were eventually made Roman citizens as well after refusal by the Roman government to make them so was met with the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)]], after which Roman citizenship was extended to all the people south of the Po river.'''{{Sfn|Rich|Shipley|p=3|1995}}''' In 49 BC, citizenship rights were also extended to the people of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] by [[Julius Caesar]].'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=2}}'''\n\nThough Rome had throughout its history been continually generous with its granting of citizenship than other city states, granting significant rights to peoples of conquered territories, immigrants and their freed slaves, it was only with the Social War that a majority of the people in Italy became recognized as Romans, with the number of Romans rapidly increasing throughout the centuries that followed due to further extensions of citizenship.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=2}}'''\n\n=== Roman citizenship ===\n{{See also|Roman citizenship}}\n[[File:Romans, Vatican Museum, Rome, Sept. 2011 - Flickr - PhillipC.jpg|left|thumb|A collection of ancient [[Roman portraiture|Roman busts]] displayed in the [[Vatican Museums]] in [[Rome]].]]\nThough it could be explicitly granted by the Roman people to non-citizens, Roman citizenship (or ''civitas'') was automatically granted to children whose parents consisted of either two Roman citizens or one citizen and one ''peregrinus'' (\"foreigner\") who possessed ''connubium'' (the right to a Roman marriage). Citizenship allowed for participation in Roman affairs, such as voting rights. By the time of the 3rd century BC, Romans of all social classes held nominally equal voting rights, though the value of your vote was tied to your personal wealth. In addition to voting rights, citizenship also made citizens eligible for military service and public office, both of these rights also tied to wealth and property qualifications.'''{{Sfn|Britannica|}}'''\n\nThe [[Latin Rights]], which originally encompassed [[Latium]] but was then extended to encompass most of Italy, ensured that most of the people in Italy enjoyed the benefits of Roman citizenship but lacked voting rights. Because they were bound to Rome and often called upon for military service but lacked the rights of the Roman citizens, Rome's Italian allies rebelled in the Social War, after which the Latin Rights in their traditional sense were more or less abolished in favor of a complete integration of the people in Italy as Romans.'''{{Sfn|Britannica|}}'''\n\nTypically, a non-citizen could acquire Roman citizenship through five different mechanisms:\n\n* Non-citizens who served in the Roman army were typically granted citizenship.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n* Men without citizenship could obtain it through holding office in cities and other settlements with the [[Latin Rights|Latin right]].'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n* Specific individuals could be granted citizenship directly.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n* Whole communities could receive \"block grants\", with all their inhabitants becoming citizens.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n* Slaves freed by Roman citizens became Roman citizens themselves.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n\n== Roman Empire ==\n{{See also|Demography of the Roman Empire}}\n\n=== Extensions of citizenship ===\n[[File:Caracalla MAN Napoli Inv6033 n01.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Caracalla]]'s ({{Reign}}211\u2013217) [[Antonine Constitution]] (212) formally made all the inhabitants of the [[Roman Empire]] into [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]].]]\nThe populace in the early Roman Empire was composed of several groups of distinct legal standing, including the Roman citizens themselves (''cives romani''), the provincials (''provinciales''), foreigners (''peregrini'') and free non-citizens such as freedmen (freed slaves) and slaves. Roman citizens were subject to the Roman legal system while provincials were subject to whatever laws and legal systems had been in place in their area at the time it was annexed by the Romans. Over time, Roman citizenship was gradually extended more and more and there was a regular \"siphoning\" of people from less privileged legal groups to more privileged groups, increasing the total percentage of subjects recognized as Roman citizens (e.g. Romans) though the incorporation of the ''provinciales'' and ''peregrini''.'''{{Sfn|Mathisen|2015|p=153}}'''\n\nThe Roman Empire's capability to integrate peoples in this way was one of the key elements which ensured its success. In Antiquity, it was significantly easier to become a Roman than it was to become a member or citizen of any other contemporary state. This aspect of the Roman state was seen as important even by some of the emperors. For instance, Emperor [[Claudius]] pointed it out when questioned by the senate on admitting Gauls to join the senate:\n\n{{Quote| quote = What else proved fatal to [[Sparta|Lacedaemon]] or [[History of Athens|Athens]], in spite of their power in arms, but their policy of holding the conquered aloof as alien-born? But the sagacity of our own founder [[Romulus]] was such that several times he fought and naturalized a people in the course of the same day!{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFrom the [[Principate]] onwards, \"barbarians\" (peoples from beyond Rome's borders) settled and integrated into the Roman world. Such settlers would have been granted certain legal rights simply by being within Roman territory, becoming ''provinciales'' and thus being eligible to serve as ''[[auxilia]]'' (auxiliary soldiers), which in turn made them eligible to become full ''cives Romani''. Through this relatively rapid process, thousands of former barbarians could quickly become Romans. This tradition of straightforward integration eventually culminated in the [[Antonine Constitution]], issued by Emperor [[Caracalla]] in 212, in which \"all the people of the Roman world\" (e.g. ''provinciales'', ''peregrini'' and freedmen alike) were formally granted Roman citizenship.'''{{Sfn|Mathisen|2015|p=154}}''' At this point, Roman citizenship in the empire was not as significant as it had been in the republic, chiefly due to the change from a republican to an imperial government invalidating the need for voting rights and because service in the Roman military was no longer compulsory.'''{{Sfn|Britannica|}}''' Caracalla's grant contributed to a vast increase in the number of people with the ''[[Nomen (Roman name)|nomen]]'' (name indicating familial association) ''Aurelius'' (Caracalla was a nickname for the emperor, whose actual name was ''Marcus '''Aurelius''' Severus Antoninus'').'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=5}}'''\n\nBy the time of Caracalla's edict, there were already many people throughout the provinces who were considered (and considered themselves) Romans; through the centuries of Roman expansion large numbers of veterans and opportunists had settled in the provinces. Colonies founded by Julius Caesar and [[Augustus]] alone saw between 500.000 and a million people from Italy settled in Rome's provinces. Around the time of Augustus's death, four to seven percent of the free people in the provinces of the empire were Roman citizens.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=2}}''' In addition to colonists, many provincials had also become citizens through grants by emperors (who sometimes granted citizenship to individuals, families or cities), holding offices in certain cities or serving in the army.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=3}}'''\n\n=== Romans in Late Antiquity ===\n[[File:Epoca romana, ritratto femminile del fayum, IV sec dc.JPG|left|thumb|4th century [[Fayum mummy portraits|portrait]] of a woman from [[Roman Egypt]].]]\nBy Late Antiquity, many inhabitants of the Roman Empire had become ''Romani'', with the term no longer simply being a civic designation for a citizen of the city of Rome, but referred to a citizen of the ''orbis Romanus'', the Roman world. By this time, the city of Rome had lost its exceptional status in the empire. The historian Ammianus Marcellinus, definitely one of the ''Romani'', hailing from modern-day Greece, wrote in the 4th century and refers to Rome almost as a foreign city, full of vice and corruption. Few of the ''Romani'' probably embodied all aspects of what the term had previously meant, many of them would have come from remote or less prestigious provinces and practiced religions and cults unheard of in Rome itself. Many of them would also have spoken \"Barbarian\" languages or Greek instead of Latin.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe prelevant view of the Romans themselves was that the ''populus Romanus'', Roman people, represented a \"people by constitution\" as opposed to Barbarian peoples such as the [[Franks]] or [[Goths]], who were described as ''gentes'' (\"people by descent\"; ethnicities). To the people of the empire, \"Roman\" was just one layer of identification, in addition to local identities (similar to local and national identities today, a person from [[California]] can identify as a \"Californian\" within the context of the [[United States]] and an \"American\" in the context of the world).'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' If a person originated from one of the major imperial regions, such as Gaul or Britannia, one might have been viewed as a Roman, but still distinct from Romans of other major regions. It is clear from the writings of later historians, such as the Gallo-Roman [[Gregory of Tours]], that such lower levels of identity, such as being the citizen of a particular region, province or city, were important within the empire. This importance, combined with there being clearly understood differences between local populations (the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus comments on the difference between \"Gauls\" and \"Italians\" for instance) illustrates that there were no fundamental differences between the local Roman identities and the ''gentes''-identities applied to Barbarians, though the Romans themselves would not have seen the two as equivalent concepts. In the [[late Roman army]], there were regiments named after Roman sub-identities (such as \"[[Celts]]\" and \"[[Batavians]]\") as well as regiments named after ''gentes'', such as the Franks or Saxons.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nReligion had been an important aspect of ''Romanitas'' since Pagan times and as Christianity gradually became the dominant religion in the empire, Pagan aristocrats became aware that power was slipping from their hands as times changed. Some of them began to emphasize that they were the only \"true Romans\" because they preserved the traditional Roman literary culture and religion. This view enjoyed some support by poets and orators, such as the orator Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, who saw these Pagan aristocrats as preserving the ancient Roman way of life, which would eventually allow Rome to triumph over all of its enemies, as it had before. This movement was met with strong opposition from the leaders of the church in Rome, with some church leaders, such as [[Ambrose]], the [[Archbishop of Milan|Archbishop of Mediolanum]], launching formal and vicious assaults on paganism and those members of the elite which defended it. Followers of paganism viewed Rome as the greatest city in the empire because of its glorious Pagan past, and though Christians accepted Rome as a great city, it was great because of its glorious Christian present, not its Pagan past. This gave ''Romanitas'' a new Christian element, which would become important in later centuries. Though the city would be important as the source of ''auctoritas'' and the self-perception of the imperial elite, it was not as important politically during the late empire as it had been before.'''{{Sfn|Hen|2018|p=}}'''\n\n== Later history in Western Europe ==\n\n=== Romans in the post-Roman west ===\n[[File:Theodoric_brick.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Brick with the emblem of [[Theodoric the Great]], [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|King of the Ostrogoths]], found in the [[Temple of Vesta]], Rome.

The Romans in Western Europe at the time appear to have been somewhat confused; they were well aware that the Western Roman Empire was no longer functioning but seem to have been unaware that it had ended.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe Barbarian kings in Western Europe often assumed imperial powers and took over imperial institutions, this practice was especially prominent in Italy since it was the empire's ancient heartland.'''{{Sfn|Jones|1962|p=127}}''' The early Barbarian kings of Italy, first [[Odoacer]] and later [[Theodoric the Great|Theoderic the Great]], acted ostensibly as viceroys to the remaining Roman emperor in Constantinople. Like the Western Roman emperors had done before them, these Barbarian kings continued to appoint western consuls which would in turn be accepted by the emperors in the east and by other Barbarian kings throughout Western Europe.'''{{Sfn|Jones|1962|p=126}}''' Although the Romans detested kings, a holdover from the anti-monarchical sentiment that had led to the foundation of the Roman Republic almost a thousand years prior, the title of ''rex'', assumed by the Barbarian kings, formed a useful basis of authority that Barbarian rulers could use in diplomacy with other kingdoms and with the surviving imperial court in Constantinople.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Diptych_Rufus_Gennadius_Probus_Orestes_VandA_139-1866.jpg|thumb|[[Consular diptych]] of [[Rufius Gennadius Probus Orestes]] exhibited at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

Theoderic's laws, the ''Edictum Theoderici'', were also clearly connected to Roman law in both content and form.'''{{Sfn|Hen|2018|p=}}''' Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] returned the Western Roman imperial regalia, held in Constantinople since they had been sent there by Odoacer in 476, to Italy, then ruled by Theoderic.'''{{Sfn|Jones|1962|p=127}}''' These imperial regalia appear to have been worn by Theoderic and there are references by Roman senators to Theoderic as an emperor, indicating that the citizens of Rome itself viewed these Barbarian kings as taking on the traditional role of the emperor. An inscription by [[Caecina Mavortius Basilius Decius]] (western consul in 486, [[Praetorian prefect of Italy]] 486\u2013493) titles Theoderic as ''dominus noster gloriosissimus adque inclytus rex Theodericus victor ac triumfator semper Augustus'', but Theoderic himself appears to have preferred to title himself simply as \"king\".'''{{Sfn|Jones|1962|p=128}}'''  Theoderic's unwillingness to assume the imperial title may have been mainly due to being careful not to insult the emperors in Constantinople.'''{{Sfn|Hen|2018|p=}}'''\n\nRoman law continued to be in use and be important in Western Europe through the early Middle Ages. Both the Visigoths and the Franks issued law collections which either explicitly mention, or presuppose, the existence of a large population of Romans within their territories as Barbarian laws distinguish between the Barbarians who live by their own laws and the Romans, who live by Roman law.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\nIt was still possible to become a \"Roman citizen\" in the west in the 7th century, as indicated by Visigothic and Frankish works referencing the benefits of doing so. There is preserved letters from both East and West around this time which reference the act of freeing slaves and making them Roman citizens; Pope Gregory the Great is recorded as having freed slaves and made them ''cives Romanos'' and there is documentation in Bari, part of Byzantine Italy, on a slave who was freed and thus became a ''polit\u0113s R\u014dmai\u014dn''. Roman status could also be conferred on people who weren't slaves, a 731 law by the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] specifies that if a \"Roman\" married a Lombard wife, that wife and all children of the couple would become Roman and the wife's relatives would no longer have the right to sue her, perhaps an idea which seemed attractive to Lombard women who wanted to escape the control of their relatives.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\n=== Possibility of reunification and Justinian's wars ===\n[[File:Empire_of_Theodoric_the_Great_523.gif|left|thumb|Map of the realm of the Gothic king [[Theodoric the Great]] at its height in 523, following the annexation of the southern parts of the [[Kingdom of the Burgundians|Burgundian kingdom]]. Theoderic ruled both the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] and [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic kingdoms]] and exerted hegemony over the Burgundians and [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]]. Though Theoderic was sometimes called by the title ''Augustus'' (emperor) by his subjects, he never formally assumed the title, using ''rex'' (king) instead.]]\nWestern Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire was not destined to develop into what later historians have referred to as the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]]. One of many possibilities for Europe's future at the time was reunification through military action. In 510, most of Western Europe was under the control of two Barbarian kings; [[Clovis I]] of the Franks and Theoderic of the Goths. Both of these kings were called by the title ''Augustus'' by their Roman subjects, though neither formally adopted the title, and they were poised to war against each other. To their contemporaries, the looming conflict between the Goths and Franks might have looked like the next, perhaps decisive war in the struggle between the Gallic and Italian factions which had dominated inter-imperial relations in the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century (such as the war between Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and the usurper [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]]). Had the war happened, and been as decisive as other battles in this period typically were, it is likely that the victorious king would have re-established the Western Roman Empire under his own rule.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe war between Theoderic and Clovis never transpired, but the idea that a powerful Barbarian king might restore the Western Roman Empire under Barbarian rule saw the court at Constantinople beginning to emphasize its exclusive Roman legitimacy. Through the remaining part of its thousand-year history, the eastern empire would repeatedly attempt to assert its right to govern the West through military campaigns. A key development was what later historians have termed the \"Justiniaic ideological offensive\"; a re-writing of 5th century history which portrayed the West as lost to barbarian invasions (rather than the true situation, that the Barbarian rulers had been gradually given power by the Western emperors themselves and worked within a fundamentally Roman framework). This ideology is prominently seen in [[Procopius]]'s ''Wars'' and [[Marcellinus Comes]]'s ''Chronicle''.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Justinien_527-565.svg|thumb|Though the Eastern emperor [[Justinian I]] restored much of the former [[Western Roman Empire]] to imperial Roman control, his wars also brought with them the end of the ancient [[Roman Senate]] (though [[Byzantine Senate|a senate]] survived in Constantinople) and ensured the gradual disappearance of Roman identity in Western Europe.]]\nA fundamental turning point in what it meant to be Roman was the eastern emperor Justinian I's wars aimed at reconquering the lost provinces of the Western Roman Empire. By the end of his wars (533\u2013555), the Justiniaic ideology that the west was no longer part of the Roman Empire had been asserted. Though Italy and North Africa were restored to imperial control, there could be no doubt in the aftermath of the wars that areas beyond Justinian's authority were no longer part of the Roman Empire and instead remained lost to Barbarians. This resulted in a dramatic decline in Roman identity beyond the regions controlled by the Byzantine Empire and led to the decisive end of the \"Roman world\" that had existed since the days of the Roman Republic.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe [[Roman Senate]] continued to function during Gothic rule of Italy and senators dominated the politics within the city of Rome well into the Gothic Wars, during which the senate in the city eventually disappeared and most of its members moved to Constantinople instead. The Senate as an idea achieved a certain legacy in the west. In Gaul, members of the aristocracy were sometimes identified as \"senators\" from the 5th century to the 7th century and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] claimed to be descended from a former Roman senatorial family. In Spain, references to people of \"senatorial stock\" appear as late as the 7th century and in Lombard Italy, \"Senator\" became a personal name, with at least two people known to have had the name in the 8th century. The practice of representing themselves as \"the Senate\" was revived by the aristocracy within the city of Rome in the 8th century, though the institution itself was not revived.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\n=== Disappearance of the Romans ===\n{{See also|Romano-Germanic culture}}\n[[File:Salic_Law.png|alt=|left|thumb|King [[Clovis I]] of the [[Franks]] dictates the [[Salic law|Salic Law]] surrounded by his military chiefs. In Salic Law, the Romans were recognized as a parallel population alongside the Franks within Clovis's [[Frankish kingdom|Frankish Kingdom]].]]\nThere is substantial evidence that the meaning of \"Roman\" changed significantly during the 6th century. In the East, being Roman became defined not only by loyalty to the emperor but also increasingly by religious orthodoxy (though what that explicitly meant also changed through the ages). The Gothic Wars in Italy had split the Roman elite unto those who supported the Goths and later enjoyed Lombard rule and those who supported the emperor and later withdrew to regions still governed by the empire. With this, Roman identity no longer provided a sense of social cohesion. This, combined with the abolition of the senate in Rome itself, removed groups of people who had previously always set the standard for what \"Roman\" was supposed to mean. Through the centuries that followed, the division between the non-Roman and Roman parts of the population faded in the west as Roman political unity collapsed.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThis decline in people identifying as Romans in the west can be prominently seen in northern Gaul. In the 6th century, the personnel of churches in northern Gaul had been dominated by people with Roman names, for instance only a handful of names of non-Roman and non-Biblical origin are recorded in the episcopal list of [[Metz]] from before the year 600, a situation that is reversed after 600 when bishops had predominantly Frankish names. The reason for this change in naming practices might be a change in naming practices in Gaul, that people entering church services no longer adopted Roman names or that the Roman families which had provided the church personnel dropped in status.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nIn [[Salic law]], produced under Clovis I around the year 500, the Romans and the Franks are two parallel major populations in the [[Frankish kingdom]] and although the Franks have somewhat of an advantage, both have well-defined legal statuses. A century later in the ''[[Lex Ripuaria]]'', the ''Romani'' are just one of many smaller semi-free populations, restricted in their legal capacity. This legal arrangement would have been unthinkable during the rule of the Roman Empire, and even under the reign of Clovis.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThrough the early Middle Ages, the legal significance of having Roman status also faded away in Western Europe and spoken Latin fragmented and split into what would develop into the modern [[Romance languages]]. The unifying and sometimes contradictory Roman identity was replaced with local identities based on the region one was from (such as [[Provence]] or [[Aquitania]]). Where Romans had once been accepted as composing the majority of the population, such as in Hispania and Gaul, they quietly faded away as their descendants accepted other names and identities.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' The benefit of abandoning the identity as Roman and reverting to more local identities was that local identities were not binary opposed to the identity as a \"Frank\" or \"Goth\" and could exist together with them, providing legal advantages that \"Roman\" no longer did.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}''' Furthermore, it is possible that people who identified as \"Romans\" were victims of anti-Roman prejudice, as experienced by the 7th century Saint [[Goar of Aquitaine]]. Although Roman identity would linger on in Western Europe in some places, mostly being restricted to a few minorities in the [[Alps|alpine regions]], some residual meanings of \"Roman\" would remain important through the Middle Ages, such as \"Roman\" as a citizen of the Byzantine Empire or \"Roman\" as a citizen of the city of Rome or representative of the Roman Catholic Church.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe significance of being a Roman thus eventually completely disappeared in Western Europe, together with the Roman identity itself. 8th century sources from [[Salzburg]] still reference that there was a social group in the city called the ''Romani tributales'' but Romans at this time mostly merged with the wider ''tributales'' (tributary peoples) distinction rather than having a separate Roman distinction in Frankish documents. Throughout most of former Gaul, the Roman elite which had lingered for centuries merged with the Frankish elite and lost their previously distinct identity and though \"Romans\" continued to be a dominant identity in regional politics in southern Gaul for a while, the specific references to some individuals as \"Romans\" or \"descendants of Romans\" indicates that the Roman status of some people in Gaul was perhaps no longer being taken for granted and needed pointing out. The last groups of ''Romani'' in the Frankish realm lingered for some time, especially in Salzburg and [[Raetia]], but seem to fade away in the early 9th century'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' (except for the [[Romansh people]] in southeastern Raetia).{{Sfn|Billigmeier|1979|p=}}\n\nBy 800, when Charlemagne was crowned as a new Roman emperor in Rome, the first time an emperor was crowned in Rome itself since antiquity, self-identification as a Roman was largely gone in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the name of Rome was to remain a source of power and prestige throughout history, becoming associated with Europe's two most powerful figures (the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor) and also being invoked by later aristocratic medieval families who sometimes proclaimed and were proud of their alleged Roman origins.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\n=== Association with the city of Rome ===\n[[File:4 Gift Bringers of Otto III.jpg|thumb|Personifications of (from left to right) the [[Slavs|Slavic]], [[Germans|German]], Gallic ([[French people|French]]) and Roman peoples bringing gifts to [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], depicted in the 10th or 11th century [[Gospels of Otto III]].]]\nAs the seat of the Pope, the city of Rome continued to hold significance despite the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the city having been sacked by both the Visigoths and the Vandals.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' Although the glorious past of Rome was remembered in medieval times, whatever power Rome had once held was completely overshadowed by the city being the location of the Papal see. In the 6th century writings of Gregory of Tours, Rome is always described as a Christian city, first being mentioned once [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] arrives there. The longest discussion on Rome is about the election of [[Pope Gregory the Great]] and Gregory of Tours appears indifferent to Rome at one point having been the capital of a great empire.'''{{Sfn|Hen|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThrough the early Middle Ages, the term ''Romani'' became more and more heavily associated by authors in Western Europe with the population of the city itself, or the population of the larger [[Duchy of Rome]]. The change from an identity applied to people throughout Italy to an identity applied to the city itself can be pinpointed to the 6th century; [[Cassiodorus]], who served the Gothic kings, use the term ''Romani'' to describe Roman people across Italy and Pope Gregory the Great, at the end of the 6th century, uses ''Romani'' almost exclusively for the people in the city. The ''[[Historia langobardorum|Historia Langobardorum]]'', written by [[Paul the Deacon]] in the 8th century, postulates that the term ''civis Romanus'' (\"Roman citizen\") is applied solely to someone who either lived in, or was born in, the city of Rome and it could for instance be applied to the [[Archbishop of Ravenna]], [[Marinianus of Ravenna|Marinianus]], only because he had originally been born in Rome. This indicates that the term at some point ceased to generally refer to all the Latin-speaking subjects of the Lombard kings and became restricted to the city itself.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' \n\nAfter the Byzantine Empire restored imperial control over Rome, the city had become a peripheral city within the empire. Its importance stemmed from being the seat of the Pope, one of the Patriarchs of the Church, and the city's population was not specially administrated and lacked political participation in wider imperial affairs except for its interactions with the papacy.'''{{Sfn|Delogu|2018|p=}}''' Under Byzantine rule, the Popes often used the fact that they had the backing of the \"people of Rome\" as a legitimizing factor when clashing with the emperors. The political implications of the name and citizenry of Rome thus remained somewhat important, at least in the eyes of the westerners.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Sack_of_Rome_by_Alaric_-_sacred_vessels_are_brought_to_a_church_for_safety_(2nd_of_2).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the [[Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]].]]\nWhen the temporal power of the popes was established through the foundation of the [[Papal States]] (established through the Frankish king [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] granting control of former Byzantine provinces conquered from the Lombards to the Pope), the population of the city of Rome became a constitutional identity which accompanied and supported the sovereignty of the popes. In the minds of the contemporary popes, the sovereign of the Papal States was St. Peter, who delegated control to his vicars on Earth, the popes. However, the popes were too deeply rooted in the Roman imperial system to imagine a wordly government established only on religious relationships. As such, the \"Romans\" became the political body of this new state and the term, once used for all the inhabitants of Byzantine Italy, became increasingly used to exclusively refer to the inhabitants of the city. After [[Donation of Pepin|Pepin's donations]] the Popes also revived the concept of ''respublica Romanorum'' as something associated with, but distinct from, the Church. In the new version of the idea, the Pope was the lord of the Romans but the Romans themselves, as citizens of Rome, had a share in the public rights connected to the sovereignty of the city.'''{{Sfn|Delogu|2018|p=}}'''\n\nMedieval sources on the \"Romans\" as the people living in Rome are generally quite hostile. The Romans are frequently described as being \"as proud as they are helpless\" and as speaking the ugliest of all the Italian dialects. Because they repeatedly attempted to take a position independent from the Papacy and/or the Holy Roman emperors (both of whom were considered as more universal rulers whose policies extended much further than the city itself), the Romans were often seen as intruders in affairs that exceeded their competence. The Romans people were in turn overwhelmingly negatively oriented towards the Franks, which they identified as \"the Gauls\". The Frankish emperors from Charlemagne onwards decreed that Frankish law could be used in the courts of their empire when demanded, which soured relations, and Frankish nobility which visited Italy and Rome would often speak in their own Frankish language when they did not want the Romans to understand them. Roman sources from this time typically describe \"the Gauls\" as vain, aggressive and insolent. The Roman dislike for the Franks sometimes turned into fear as the Franks would more and more frequently appear outside their gates with armies.'''{{Sfn|Delogu|2018|p=}}'''\n\nDespite this fear, the population of Rome and people in most other parts of Italy (with the exception of southern Italy, still under Byzantine influence) saw Charlemagne and his successors as true Roman emperors.'''{{Sfn|Granier|2018|p=}}''' The reasons for this were many. Although the Romans accepted that there was continuity between Rome and Constantinople, and saw the Carolingian emperors as having more to do with the Lombard kings of Italy than the ancient Roman emperors,'''{{Sfn|Granier|2018|p=}}''' the Byzantines were often seen as ''Grieci'' (\"Greeks\") rather than Romans and were seen as having abandoned Rome, the seat of empire, and lost the Roman way of life and the Latin language; thus the empire ruling in Constantinople hadn't survived, but had fled from its responsibilities. This disconnect shows that the city of Rome and the Byzantines had grown very far apart from each other.{{Sfn|West|2016}} To the Romans and Italians of the 8th and 9th century, the original Roman Empire was a thing of the past. There definitely used to be an empire, such as during the time of Constantine the Great, but it had now transferred itself to the Eastern Mediterranean and ceased to be properly Roman, now inhabited by \"Greeks\". Rome was no longer a city of emperors, but was the city of St. Peter only. A real Roman Empire could have only one capital, Rome, and its possible existence rested on the man who ruled in Rome, the Pope. As such, the new emperors in the West (an office that eventually developed into the Holy Roman emperors) could be emperors only because they were crowned and anointed by the Pope.'''{{Sfn|Granier|2018|p=}}''' The support of what was perceived by Western Europe as the ''populus Romanus'' was a highly important factor during Charlemagne's coronation. Charlemagne himself actively hoped to suppress the idea of ''Romani'' as an ethnicity in an effort to avoid that the imperial title could be bestowed by the population of Rome in the same way that the Franks could proclaim a ''rex Francorum'' (King of the Franks).'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\n== Later history in the Eastern Mediterranean ==\n=== Romans in the Byzantine Empire ===\n{{Main|Byzantine Greeks}}\n[[File:Justinian mosaik ravenna.jpg|thumb|6th century mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]] depicting Emperor [[Justinian I]] (center) surrounded by court officials and guards. The figures to his immediate left and right are assumed to be the prominent generals [[Belisarius]] (left) and [[Narses]] (right).]]\nIn stark contrast to the catastrophic collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire (frequently called the [[Byzantine Empire]] by modern historians) survived the 5th century more or less intact and its predominantly Greek-speaking population continued to identify themselves as Romans (''Rhomaioi''), as they remained inhabitants of the Roman Empire. The name ''Romania'' (\"land of the Romans\"), a later popular designation by the people of the Byzantine Empire for their country, is attested as early as 582 when it was used by the inhabitants of the city of [[Sirmium]] for their country. Although rarely expressed as an idea before the 9th century, the earliest mention of the Byzantine Empire as being \"Greek\" is from the 6th century, written by Bishop [[Avitus of Vienne]] in the context of the Frankish king Clovis I's baptism; \"Let Greece, to be sure, rejoice in having an orthodox ruler, but she is no longer the only one to deserve such a great gift\".'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' To the early Byzantines (up until around the 11th century) the term \"Greeks\" or \"Hellenes\" was offensive as it downplayed their Roman nature and furthermore associated them with the ancient Pagan Greeks rather than the more recent Christian Romans.'''{{Sfn|Cameron|2009|p=7}}'''\n\nThe idea of the ''res publica'' remained an important imperial concept for centuries. In the Frankish king [[Childebert II]]'s letters to Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], the emperor is called the ''princeps Romanae reipublicae'' and through the 6th and 8th centuries, terms such as ''res publica'' and ''sancta res publica'' was still sometimes applied to the Byzantine Empire by authors in Western Europe. This practice only ceased as Byzantine control over Italy and Rome itself crumbled and \"Roman\" as a name and concept became more heavily associated by Western authors with the city itself. The use of the term ''Romani'' was somewhat similar, usually often used in reference to the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire by early Medieval western authors when not used for the population of the city itself. In [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''History of the Goths'', the term ''Romani'' refers to the Byzantine Empire and their remaining garrisons in Spain and the term is never applied to the population of the former western provinces.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Byzantinischer_Mosaizist_um_1020_001.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|11th century [[Hagia Sophia]] mosaic. On the left, Emperor [[Constantine IX]] is identified as \"faithful in Christ the God, [[Basileus|Emperor]] of the Romans\".]]\nReferences to the Romans as a ''gens'', like the Barbarian ''gentes'', begin to appear around the time of Justinian's conquests. [[Priscian]], a [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|grammarian]] who was born in Roman North Africa and later lived in Constantinople during the late 5th century and early 6th century, refers in his work to the existence of a ''gens Romana''. Letters written by the Frankish king Childebert II to Emperor Maurice in Constantinople in the 580s talk of the peace between the two \"gentes of the Franks and the Romans\". The 6th century historian [[Jordanes]], himself identifying as a Roman, refers to the existence of a Roman ''gens'' in the title of his work on Roman history, ''De summa temporum vel de origine actibusque <u>gentis Romanorum</u>''. The idea of Romans as a ''gens'' like any other didn't become generally accepted in the East until the 11th century.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' For instance, Emperor [[Basil I]] ({{Reign}}867\u2013886) still considered \"Roman\" to be an identity that was defined as an opposite to being of a Barbarian ''gens''.{{Sfn|West|2016}} Before the 11th century, the \"Romans\" discussed in Byzantine texts usually refer to individuals loyal to the Byzantine emperor who followed Chalcedonian Christianity. As such, the Romans were all the Christian subjects of the emperor.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Byzantine_fresca_from_St-Lucas.jpg|thumb|The biblical [[Joshua]] portrayed as a [[Byzantine army|Byzantine soldier]] wearing the lamellar ''klivanion'' cuirass and a straight ''spathion'' sword ([[Hosios Loukas]]).|alt=]]\nIn the 27th chapter of Emperor Constantine VII's 10th century political treatise ''De administrando imperio'', the emperor expressed the idea that the ''imperium'' had been transferred from Rome to Constantinople once Rome stopped being ruled by an emperor. The 12th century historian John Kinnamos expresses similar views, seeing the rights to the ''imperium'' as having disappeared from Rome and the west since power passed there from the last Western Roman emperors to Barbarian kings who had no claim to being Roman. As such, the ruler in Constantinople was the sole ruler in Europe who could claim to be a true Roman. As such, the transfer of power from Rome to Constantinople that had begun under Constantine the Great had been finished once the last few Western Roman emperors were dethroned or killed. This view was important in Byzantine ideology as it served as the basis for their idea of unbroken continuity between Rome and Constantinople.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=72}}'''    \n\nThe population within the Byzantine Empire saw themselves as living within the Roman Empire but were aware that their empire was no longer as powerful as it once had been. The 7th century text ''[[Doctrina Jacobi]]'', set in Carthage, states that the territory ruled by the Romans had once stretched from Spain in the west to Persia in the east and Africa in the south to Britain in the north, with all the people in it having been subordinated to the Romans by the will of God. Though the old borders were still visible through the presence of monuments erected by the ancient emperors, the author of the ''Doctrina Jacobi'' stated that one could now see that the present Roman realm (the ''Romania'') had been humbled.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=74}}'''    \n\nThe losses that the empire had experienced, in particular the loss of Northern Africa and the Levant in the Muslim conquests in the 7th century, were typically blamed on the heresy of the emperors (e.g. [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclasm]]) and the Christians who had once lived in these lost regions ceased to be recognized by the Byzantines as \"Romans\". This eventually led to \"Roman\" being applied more to the dominant Greek-speaking population of the remaining empire than to inhabitants of the empire in general. The late 7th century was the first time (in the writings of St. [[Anastasios the Persian]]) that Greek, rather than Latin, was referred to as the ''rhomaisti'' (Roman way of speaking).'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=74}}''' In [[Leo the Deacon]]'s 10th century histories, Emperor Nikephoros Phokas is described as having settled communities of Armenians, ''Rhomaioi'' and other ethnicities on Crete, indicating that Romans by this time were just one of the groups within the empire (for instance alongside the Armenians).'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=79}}''' By the late 11th century, the transformation of \"Roman\" to an identity by descent rather than political or religious affiliation was complete, with references to people as \"''Rhomaios'' by birth\" beginning to appear in the writings of Byzantine historians. The label was now also applied to Greek-speakers outside of the empire's borders, such as the Greek-speaking Christians under [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] rule in Anatolia, who were referred to as ''Rhomaioi'' despite actively resisting attempts at re-integration by the Byzantine emperors.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=80}}'''\n\n=== Late Byzantine identity ===\n[[File:Alexios Apokaukos.jpg|left|thumb|Byzantine portrait of [[Alexios Apokaukos]], a 14th-century ''[[megas doux]]'' in the service of Emperors [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos III]] and [[John V Palaiologos|John V]].]]\nAfter the crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] captured Constantinople in 1204 and shattered the Byzantine view of unbroken continuity from Rome to Constantinople, new alternative sources were required for the legitimacy of the Byzantines as Romans. The Byzantine elite thus began to increasingly detach their self-identity from the Roman Empire as a unit and look to Greek cultural heritage and Orthodox Christianity as the markers of what Romans were, and connected the modern Romans to the ancient Greeks as the precursors who had once ruled the current homeland of the Romans. Ethnic Romanness became increasingly identified as someone who was ethno-culturally Hellenic, an idea which was taken a step further by Emperors John III and Theodore II (who ruled at Nicaea while the Crusaders and their descendants occupied Constantinople), who stated that the present ''Rhomaioi'' were ''Hellenes'', descendants of the Ancient Greeks.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=85}}'''\n\nThis is not to say that the Byzantines stopped identifying as Romans. The Byzantine view changed from Constantine the Great bestowing the empire to Constantinople to Constantine the Great bestowing the empire to the ''Hellenes'' and as such a Roman and a Greek was the same thing. This in no way invalidated them as Romans; though the Nicaean emperors explicitly referred to their lands and subjects as Hellenic, they also identified themselves as the only true Roman emperors. \"Greek\" and \"Roman\" were not contrasting or distinct identities, but building blocks of the same identity as ''Rhomaioi''. This double-identity lasted beyond the 1261 [[Reconquest of Constantinople|reconquest]] of the city under Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] and remained the main view on the issue by the time of the last few Byzantine emperors. In the text ''Comparison of the Old and the New Rome'' by Manuel Chrysoloras, addressed to Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], Rome is presented as the mother of the daughter Constantinople, a city founded by the two most wise and powerful peoples in the world, the Romans and the Hellenes, who came together to create a city destined to rule the entire world.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=86}}'''\n\n=== Romans in the Ottoman Empire ===\n{{Main|Ottoman Greeks|R\u00fbm}}\n[[File:Illustration_from_Views_in_the_Ottoman_Dominions_by_Luigi_Mayer,_digitally_enhanced_by_rawpixel-com_1.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman Greeks]] in [[Constantinople]], painted by [[Luigi Mayer]] (1755\u20131803)]]\n''Rhomaioi'' survived the 1453 [[Fall of Constantinople]], the end of the Byzantine Empire, as the primary self-designation for the Christian Greek-speaking inhabitants in the new Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. The popular historical memory of these ''Rhomaioi'' was not occupied with the glorious past of the Roman Empire of old or the Hellenism in the Byzantine Empire but by legends of the fall and loss of their Christian homeland and Constantinople, such as the myth that the last emperor, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] (who had died fighting the Ottomans at Constantinople in 1453), would one day return from the dead to reconquer the city.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=88}}'''\n\nIn the [[early modern period]], an educated, urban-dwelling Turkish-speaker who was not a member of the military-administrative class would often refer to himself neither as an ''Osmanl\u0131'' (\"Ottoman\") nor as a ''T\u00fcrk'' (\"Turk\"), but rather as a ''R\u016bm\u012b'' (\u0631\u0648\u0645\u0649\u200e), or \"Roman\", meaning an inhabitant of the territory of the former Byzantine Empire in the Balkans and Anatolia.

Among these factors were that names such as \"Hellene\", \"Hellas\" or \"Greece\" were already in use for the country and its people by the other nations in Europe, the absence of the old Byzantine government to reinforce Roman identity, and the term ''Romioi'' becoming associated with those Greeks still under Ottoman rule rather than those actively fighting for independence.

Examples of this are the [[Romansh people]] (descended from the ''Romani'' recorded in the Alps in the 8th and 9th centuries) and the [[Romands]].'''{{Sfn|Minahan|2000|p=776}}''' Romands represent the [[French language|French]]-speaking community of [[Switzerland]], with French being the native language of 20% of the [[Swiss people]].

This region, anciently known as Raetia, was inhabited by the [[Rhaetian people]], with the Celtic [[Helvetii]] at their west. The ethnicity of the Rhaetians is uncertain, but [[Raetian language|their language]] was probably [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] with [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and perhaps [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] influences. The Rhaetians were conquered by the Romans in 15 AD. They were seen by the Romans as excellent fighters and were included in several legions, where their usage of Latin would start. Over the centuries, Latin would replace indigenous languages in Raetia, with Roman culture only strongly consolidated in the province during the times of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. After this, [[Germanic tribes]] would settle in the province, where they would eventually assimilate most of this Romanized Rhaetian population. The ones that resisted the Germanic invasions evolved into the modern Romansh people, who call their language and themselves as ''rumantsch'' or ''romontsch'', derived from the Latin word ''romanice'', which means \"Romance\".{{Sfn|Billigmeier|1979|p=}}\n\n=== Balkan Romance peoples ===\nThe [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance peoples]] have also maintained their Roman identity over the centuries, and it has remained especially prominent in the [[Romanians]]. One of the main principles of Romanian identity and [[Romanian nationalism|nationalism]] is the [[Origin of the Romanians#Theory of Daco-Roman continuity|theory of Daco-Roman continuity]]. This theory claims that [[Dacia]], after its conquest by [[Trajan]], was so extensively colonized that the indigenous [[Dacians]] mixed with the Roman settlers, thus creating a culture of [[Daco-Roman]]s. These would resist the invasions of [[Slavs]] and other peoples by hiding in the [[Carpathians]], eventually evolving into the modern day Romanians. This theory is not universally accepted, however.{{Sfn|Light|Dumbraveanu&nbsp;Andone|1997|p=}} One of the earliest records of the Romanians being referred to as Romans is given in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', a German [[epic poem]] written before 1200 in which a \"Duke Ramunc from the land of [[Vlach]]s ([[Wallachia]])\" is mentioned. \"Vlach\" was an [[exonym]] (name employed by forgeiners) used almost exclusively for the Romanians during the Middle Ages. It has been argued that \"Ramunc\" was not the name of the duke, but a collective name that highlighted his ethnicity. Other documents, especially Byzantine or [[Hungary|Hungarian]] ones, also mention the old Romanians as Romans or their descendants.{{Sfn|Druga\u0219|2016|p=}} Today, Romanians call themselves ''rom\u00e2ni'' and their nation ''Rom\u00e2nia''.{{Sfn|Berciu&nbsp;Dr\u0103ghicescu|2012|p=}}\n\nThe [[Aromanians]] are another Balkan Romance ethnic group scattered in the Balkans. Their origins are highly uncertain. Romanians often say that they originally were Romanians who migrated from north to south of the [[Danube]] and that they are still Romanians. The Greeks, on the other hand, say that they descend from indigenous Greeks and Roman soldiers placed there to guard the [[Mountain pass|passes]] of the [[Pindus]] (and that they are therefore ethnic Greeks who speak [[Aromanian language|a Romance language]]). The debates of their origins have been widely discussed throughout recent history, and the opinions of the Aromanians themselves are divided.

The Romans themselves did not see being \"Roman\" as something based on shared language or inherited ethnicity, but saw it as something based on being part of the same larger religious or political community and sharing common customs, values, morals and ways of life.  \n\nInitially, this larger community was the city of [[Rome]] itself, but as the land under Roman dominion continued to increase, [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]] was gradually granted to the various peoples under Roman rule. The number of Romans rapidly increased due to the creation of colonies throughout the empire, through grants of citizenship to veterans of the [[Roman army]], and through personal grants by the [[Roman emperors]]. In 212 AD, Emperor [[Caracalla]] extended citizenship rights to all the inhabitants of the Roman Empire through his [[Antonine Constitution]].  \n\nRoman identity in [[Western Europe]] survived the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century as a diminished but still important political resource. It was only with the wars of the eastern Emperor [[Justinian I]], aimed at restoring the western provinces to imperial control, that \"Roman\" began to fade as an identity in Western Europe, more or less disappearing in the 8th and 9th centuries and increasingly being applied by westerners only to the citizens of the city of Rome. The city itself continued to be important to Western Europeans but this importance stemmed from Rome being the seat of the [[Pope]], not from it once having been the capital of a great empire. In the primarily Greek-speaking eastern empire, often called the [[Byzantine Empire]] by modern historians, Roman identity survived uninterrupted until its fall in 1453 and beyond. \n\nRoman identity survives in a significantly reduced capacity today. \"Roman\" is still used to refer to a citizen of the city itself and the term ''Romioi'' is sometimes (albeit rarely) used as an identity by [[Greeks]]. Additionally, the names and identities of some [[Romance peoples]] remain connected to their Roman roots, especially in the [[Alps]] (such as the [[Romansh people]] and the [[Romands]]) and the [[Balkans]] (such as the [[Romanians]], [[Aromanians]] and [[Istro-Romanians]]). \n\n== Meaning of \"Roman\" ==\n{{See also|Romanitas}}\n[[File:Pompeii_family_feast_painting_Naples.jpg|alt=|thumb|1st century AD wall painting from [[Pompeii]] depicting a multigenerational banquet.]]\nThe term \"Roman\" is typically used interchangeably to describe a historical timespan, a material culture, a geographical location and a personal identity. Though these concepts are obviously related, they are not identical. Although modern historians tend to have a preferred idea of what being Roman meant, so-called ''[[Romanitas]]'' (a term rarely used in [[Ancient Rome]] itself), the idea of \"Romanness\" was never static or unchanging.'''{{Sfn|Revell|2009|p=x}}''' What being Roman meant and what Rome itself was would have been viewed considerably different by a Roman under the [[Roman Republic]] in the 2nd century BC and a Roman living in [[Constantinople]] in the 6th century AD. Even then, some elements remained common throughout much of Roman history.'''{{Sfn|Revell|2009|p=x}}'''\n\nCrucial to understanding Roman identity is that unlike other ancient peoples, such as the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] or [[Gauls]], the Romans did not see their common identity as one necessarily based on shared language or inherited ethnicity. Instead, the important factors of being Roman were being part of the same larger religious or political community and sharing common customs, values, morals and ways of life.'''{{Sfn|Woolf|2000|p=120}}'''\n\n== Roman Republic ==\n\n=== Political history ===\n{{See also|Rise of Rome}}[[File:Roman_Republic_Empire_map_fast.gif|alt=|left|thumb|A graphic showing border changes of the Roman state from the 6th century BC to the 5th century AD.]]\nOne of the most important aspects of ancient Roman life was warfare; the Romans went on military campaigns almost every year, rituals marked the beginning and the end of the campaigning seasons and elections of chief magistrates (commanders of the army) generally took place on the [[Campus Martius]] (\"Field of Mars\", Mars being the Roman god of war). All Roman citizens were liable for military service, with most serving for several years during their youth. All soldiers could earn honors and rewards for valor in battle, though the highest military reward of all, the [[Roman triumph|triumph]], was reserved for commanders and generals.'''{{Sfn|Rich|Shipley|p=1|1995}}''' Roman warfare was not overwhelmingly successful for the first few centuries of the city's history, with most campaigns being small engagements with the other Latin city-states in the immediate vicinity, but from the middle of the 4th century BC onwards, the Romans won a series of victories which saw them rise to rule all of Italy south of the [[Po (river)|Po river]] by 270 BC. Following the conquest of Italy, the Romans waged war against the great powers of their time; [[Carthage]] to the south and west and the various [[Diadochi|Hellenistic kingdoms]] to the east, and by the middle of the second century BC, all rivals had been defeated and Rome became recognized by other countries as the definite masters of the Mediterranean.'''{{Sfn|Rich|Shipley|p=2|1995}}'''\n[[File:The Growth of Roman Power in Italy.jpg|thumb|Political divisions in [[Roman Italy|Roman-controlled Italy]] before the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]]. Roman communities are indicated with green.]]\nAlthough Roman technological prowess and their ability to adopt strategies and technology from their enemies made their army among the most formidable in the ancient world, the Roman war machine was also made powerful by the vast pool of manpower available for the [[Roman legion|Roman legions]]. This manpower derived from the way in which the Romans had organized their conquered land in Italy. By the late 3rd century BC, about a third of the people in Italy south of the Po river had been made Roman citizens (meaning they were liable for military service) and the rest had been made allies, frequently called on to join Roman wars.'''{{Sfn|Rich|Shipley|p=2|1995}}''' These allies were eventually made Roman citizens as well after refusal by the Roman government to make them so was met with the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)]], after which Roman citizenship was extended to all the people south of the Po river.'''{{Sfn|Rich|Shipley|p=3|1995}}''' In 49 BC, citizenship rights were also extended to the people of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] by [[Julius Caesar]].'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=2}}'''\n\nThough Rome had throughout its history been continually generous with its granting of citizenship than other city states, granting significant rights to peoples of conquered territories, immigrants and their freed slaves, it was only with the Social War that a majority of the people in Italy became recognized as Romans, with the number of Romans rapidly increasing throughout the centuries that followed due to further extensions of citizenship.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=2}}'''\n\n=== Roman citizenship ===\n{{See also|Roman citizenship}}\n[[File:Romans, Vatican Museum, Rome, Sept. 2011 - Flickr - PhillipC.jpg|left|thumb|A collection of ancient [[Roman portraiture|Roman busts]] displayed in the [[Vatican Museums]] in [[Rome]].]]\nThough it could be explicitly granted by the Roman people to non-citizens, Roman citizenship (or ''civitas'') was automatically granted to children whose parents consisted of either two Roman citizens or one citizen and one ''peregrinus'' (\"foreigner\") who possessed ''connubium'' (the right to a Roman marriage). Citizenship allowed for participation in Roman affairs, such as voting rights. By the time of the 3rd century BC, Romans of all social classes held nominally equal voting rights, though the value of your vote was tied to your personal wealth. In addition to voting rights, citizenship also made citizens eligible for military service and public office, both of these rights also tied to wealth and property qualifications.'''{{Sfn|Britannica|}}'''\n\nThe [[Latin Rights]], which originally encompassed [[Latium]] but was then extended to encompass most of Italy, ensured that most of the people in Italy enjoyed the benefits of Roman citizenship but lacked voting rights. Because they were bound to Rome and often called upon for military service but lacked the rights of the Roman citizens, Rome's Italian allies rebelled in the Social War, after which the Latin Rights in their traditional sense were more or less abolished in favor of a complete integration of the people in Italy as Romans.'''{{Sfn|Britannica|}}'''\n\nTypically, a non-citizen could acquire Roman citizenship through five different mechanisms:\n\n* Non-citizens who served in the Roman army were typically granted citizenship.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n* Men without citizenship could obtain it through holding office in cities and other settlements with the [[Latin Rights|Latin right]].'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n* Specific individuals could be granted citizenship directly.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n* Whole communities could receive \"block grants\", with all their inhabitants becoming citizens.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n* Slaves freed by Roman citizens became Roman citizens themselves.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=7}}'''\n\n== Roman Empire ==\n{{See also|Demography of the Roman Empire}}\n\n=== Extensions of citizenship ===\n[[File:Caracalla MAN Napoli Inv6033 n01.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Caracalla]]'s ({{Reign}}211\u2013217) [[Antonine Constitution]] (212) formally made all the inhabitants of the [[Roman Empire]] into [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]].]]\nThe populace in the early Roman Empire was composed of several groups of distinct legal standing, including the Roman citizens themselves (''cives romani''), the provincials (''provinciales''), foreigners (''peregrini'') and free non-citizens such as freedmen (freed slaves) and slaves. Roman citizens were subject to the Roman legal system while provincials were subject to whatever laws and legal systems had been in place in their area at the time it was annexed by the Romans. Over time, Roman citizenship was gradually extended more and more and there was a regular \"siphoning\" of people from less privileged legal groups to more privileged groups, increasing the total percentage of subjects recognized as Roman citizens (e.g. Romans) though the incorporation of the ''provinciales'' and ''peregrini''.'''{{Sfn|Mathisen|2015|p=153}}'''\n\nThe Roman Empire's capability to integrate peoples in this way was one of the key elements which ensured its success. In Antiquity, it was significantly easier to become a Roman than it was to become a member or citizen of any other contemporary state. This aspect of the Roman state was seen as important even by some of the emperors. For instance, Emperor [[Claudius]] pointed it out when questioned by the senate on admitting Gauls to join the senate:\n\n{{Quote| quote = What else proved fatal to [[Sparta|Lacedaemon]] or [[History of Athens|Athens]], in spite of their power in arms, but their policy of holding the conquered aloof as alien-born? But the sagacity of our own founder [[Romulus]] was such that several times he fought and naturalized a people in the course of the same day!{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFrom the [[Principate]] onwards, \"barbarians\" (peoples from beyond Rome's borders) settled and integrated into the Roman world. Such settlers would have been granted certain legal rights simply by being within Roman territory, becoming ''provinciales'' and thus being eligible to serve as ''[[auxilia]]'' (auxiliary soldiers), which in turn made them eligible to become full ''cives Romani''. Through this relatively rapid process, thousands of former barbarians could quickly become Romans. This tradition of straightforward integration eventually culminated in the [[Antonine Constitution]], issued by Emperor [[Caracalla]] in 212, in which \"all the people of the Roman world\" (e.g. ''provinciales'', ''peregrini'' and freedmen alike) were formally granted Roman citizenship.'''{{Sfn|Mathisen|2015|p=154}}''' At this point, Roman citizenship in the empire was not as significant as it had been in the republic, chiefly due to the change from a republican to a imperial government invalidating the need for voting rights and because service in the Roman military was no longer compulsory.'''{{Sfn|Britannica|}}''' Caracalla's grant contributed to a vast increase in the number of people with the ''[[Nomen (Roman name)|nomen]]'' (name indicating familial association) ''Aurelius'' (Caracalla was a nickname for the emperor, whose actual name was ''Marcus '''Aurelius''' Severus Antoninus'').'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=5}}'''\n\nBy the time of Caracalla's edict, there were already many people throughout the provinces who were considered (and considered themselves) Romans; through the centuries of Roman expansion large numbers of veterans and opportunists had settled in the provinces. Colonies founded by Julius Caesar and [[Augustus]] alone saw between 500.000 and a million people from Italy settled in Rome's provinces. Around the time of Augustus's death, four to seven percent of the free people in the provinces of the empire were Roman citizens.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=2}}''' In addition to colonists, many provincials had also become citizens through grants by emperors (who sometimes granted citizenship to individuals, families or cities), holding offices in certain cities or serving in the army.'''{{Sfn|Lavan|2016|p=3}}'''\n\n=== Romans in Late Antiquity ===\n[[File:Epoca romana, ritratto femminile del fayum, IV sec dc.JPG|left|thumb|4th century [[Fayum mummy portraits|portrait]] of a woman from [[Roman Egypt]].]]\nBy Late Antiquity, many inhabitants of the Roman Empire had become ''Romani'', with the term no longer simply being a civic designation for a citizen of the city of Rome, but referred to a citizen of the ''orbis Romanus'', the Roman world. By this time, the city of Rome had lost its exceptional status in the empire. The historian Ammianus Marcellinus, definitely one of the ''Romani'', hailing from modern-day Greece, wrote in the 4th century and refers to Rome almost as a foreign city, full of vice and corruption. Few of the ''Romani'' probably embodied all aspects of what the term had previously meant, many of them would have come from remote or less prestigious provinces and practiced religions and cults unheard of in Rome itself. Many of them would also have spoken \"Barbarian\" languages or Greek instead of Latin.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe prelevant view of the Romans themselves was that the ''populus Romanus'', Roman people, represented a \"people by constitution\" as opposed to Barbarian peoples such as the [[Franks]] or [[Goths]], who were described as ''gentes'' (\"people by descent\"; ethnicities). To the people of the empire, \"Roman\" was just one layer of identification, in addition to local identities (similar to local and national identities today, a person from [[California]] can identify as a \"Californian\" within the context of the [[United States]] and an \"American\" in the context of the world).'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' If a person originated from one of the major imperial regions, such as Gaul or Britannia, one might have been viewed as a Roman, but still distinct from Romans of other major regions. It is clear from the writings of later historians, such as the Gallo-Roman [[Gregory of Tours]], that such lower levels of identity, such as being the citizen of a particular region, province or city, were important within the empire. This importance, combined with there being clearly understood differences between local populations (the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus comments on the difference between \"Gauls\" and \"Italians\" for instance) illustrates that there were no fundamental differences between the local Roman identities and the ''gentes''-identities applied to Barbarians, though the Romans themselves would not have seen the two as equivalent concepts. In the [[late Roman army]], there were regiments named after Roman sub-identities (such as \"[[Celts]]\" and \"[[Batavians]]\") as well as regiments named after ''gentes'', such as the Franks or Saxons.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nReligion had been an important aspect of ''Romanitas'' since Pagan times and as Christianity gradually became the dominant religion in the empire, Pagan aristocrats became aware that power was slipping from their hands as times changed. Some of them began to emphasize that they were the only \"true Romans\" because they preserved the traditional Roman literary culture and religion. This view enjoyed some support by poets and orators, such as the orator Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, who saw these Pagan aristocrats as preserving the ancient Roman way of life, which would eventually allow Rome to triumph over all of its enemies, as it had before. This movement was met with strong opposition from the leaders of the church in Rome, with some church leaders, such as [[Ambrose]], the [[Archbishop of Milan|Archbishop of Mediolanum]], launching formal and vicious assaults on paganism and those members of the elite which defended it. Followers of paganism viewed Rome as the greatest city in the empire because of its glorious Pagan past, and though Christians accepted Rome as a great city, it was great because of its glorious Christian present, not its Pagan past. This gave ''Romanitas'' a new Christian element, which would become important in later centuries. Though the city would be important as the source of ''auctoritas'' and the self-perception of the imperial elite, it was not as important politically during the late empire as it had been before.'''{{Sfn|Hen|2018|p=}}'''\n\n== Later history in Western Europe ==\n\n=== Romans in the post-Roman west ===\n[[File:Theodoric_brick.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Brick with the emblem of [[Theodoric the Great]], [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|King of the Ostrogoths]], found in the [[Temple of Vesta]], Rome.

The Romans in Western Europe at the time appear to have been somewhat confused; they were well aware that the Western Roman Empire was no longer functioning but seem to have been unaware that it had ended.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe Barbarian kings in Western Europe often assumed imperial powers and took over imperial institutions, this practice was especially prominent in Italy since it was the empire's ancient heartland.'''{{Sfn|Jones|1962|p=127}}''' The early Barbarian kings of Italy, first [[Odoacer]] and later [[Theodoric the Great|Theoderic the Great]], acted ostensibly as viceroys to the remaining Roman emperor in Constantinople. Like the Western Roman emperors had done before them, these Barbarian kings continued to appoint western consuls which would in turn be accepted by the emperors in the east and by other Barbarian kings throughout Western Europe.'''{{Sfn|Jones|1962|p=126}}''' Although the Romans detested kings, a holdover from the anti-monarchical sentiment that had led to the foundation of the Roman Republic almost a thousand years prior, the title of ''rex'', assumed by the Barbarian kings, formed a useful basis of authority that Barbarian rulers could use in diplomacy with other kingdoms and with the surviving imperial court in Constantinople.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Diptych_Rufus_Gennadius_Probus_Orestes_VandA_139-1866.jpg|thumb|[[Consular diptych]] of [[Rufius Gennadius Probus Orestes]] exhibited at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

Theoderic's laws, the ''Edictum Theoderici'', were also clearly connected to Roman law in both content and form.'''{{Sfn|Hen|2018|p=}}''' Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] returned the Western Roman imperial regalia, held in Constantinople since they had been sent there by Odoacer in 476, to Italy, then ruled by Theoderic.'''{{Sfn|Jones|1962|p=127}}''' These imperial regalia appear to have been worn by Theoderic and there are references by Roman senators to Theoderic as an emperor, indicating that the citizens of Rome itself viewed these Barbarian kings as taking on the traditional role of the emperor. An inscription by [[Caecina Mavortius Basilius Decius]] (western consul in 486, [[Praetorian prefect of Italy]] 486\u2013493) titles Theoderic as ''dominus noster gloriosissimus adque inclytus rex Theodericus victor ac triumfator semper Augustus'', but Theoderic himself appears to have preferred to title himself simply as \"king\".'''{{Sfn|Jones|1962|p=128}}'''  Theoderic's unwillingness to assume the imperial title may have been mainly due to being careful not to insult the emperors in Constantinople.'''{{Sfn|Hen|2018|p=}}'''\n\nRoman law continued to be in use and be important in Western Europe through the early Middle Ages. Both the Visigoths and the Franks issued law collections which either explicitly mention, or presuppose, the existence of a large population of Romans within their territories as Barbarian laws distinguish between the Barbarians who live by their own laws and the Romans, who live by Roman law.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\nIt was still possible to become a \"Roman citizen\" in the west in the 7th century, as indicated by Visigothic and Frankish works referencing the benefits of doing so. There is preserved letters from both East and West around this time which reference the act of freeing slaves and making them Roman citizens; Pope Gregory the Great is recorded as having freed slaves and made them ''cives Romanos'' and there is documentation in Bari, part of Byzantine Italy, on a slave who was freed and thus became a ''polit\u0113s R\u014dmai\u014dn''. Roman status could also be conferred on people who weren't slaves, a 731 law by the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] specifies that if a \"Roman\" married a Lombard wife, that wife and all children of the couple would become Roman and the wife's relatives would no longer have the right to sue her, perhaps an idea which seemed attractive to Lombard women who wanted to escape the control of their relatives.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\n=== Possibility of reunification and Justinian's wars ===\n[[File:Empire_of_Theodoric_the_Great_523.gif|left|thumb|Map of the realm of the Gothic king [[Theodoric the Great]] at its height in 523, following the annexation of the southern parts of the [[Kingdom of the Burgundians|Burgundian kingdom]]. Theoderic ruled both the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] and [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic kingdoms]] and exerted hegemony over the Burgundians and [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]]. Though Theoderic was sometimes called by the title ''Augustus'' (emperor) by his subjects, he never formally assumed the title, using ''rex'' (king) instead.]]\nWestern Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire was not destined to develop into what later historians have referred to as the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]]. One of many possibilities for Europe's future at the time was reunification through military action. In 510, most of Western Europe was under the control of two Barbarian kings; [[Clovis I]] of the Franks and Theoderic of the Goths. Both of these kings were called by the title ''Augustus'' by their Roman subjects, though neither formally adopted the title, and they were poised to war against each other. To their contemporaries, the looming conflict between the Goths and Franks might have looked like the next, perhaps decisive war in the struggle between the Gallic and Italian factions which had dominated inter-imperial relations in the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century (such as the war between Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and the usurper [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]]). Had the war happened, and been as decisive as other battles in this period typically were, it is likely that the victorious king would have re-established the Western Roman Empire under his own rule.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe war between Theoderic and Clovis never transpired, but the idea that a powerful Barbarian king might restore the Western Roman Empire under Barbarian rule saw the court at Constantinople beginning to emphasize its exclusive Roman legitimacy. Through the remaining part of its thousand year history, the eastern empire would repeatedly attempt to assert its right to govern the West through military campaigns. A key development was what later historians have termed the \"Justiniaic ideological offensive\"; a re-writing of 5th century history which portrayed the West as lost to barbarian invasions (rather than the true situation, that the Barbarian rulers had been gradually given power by the Western emperors themselves and worked within a fundamentally Roman framework). This ideology is prominently seen in [[Procopius]]'s ''Wars'' and [[Marcellinus Comes]]'s ''Chronicle''.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Justinien_527-565.svg|thumb|Though the Eastern emperor [[Justinian I]] restored much of the former [[Western Roman Empire]] to imperial Roman control, his wars also brought with them the end of the ancient [[Roman Senate]] (though [[Byzantine Senate|a senate]] survived in Constantinople) and ensured the gradual disappearance of Roman identity in Western Europe.]]\nA fundamental turning point in what it meant to be Roman was the eastern emperor Justinian I's wars aimed at reconquering the lost provinces of the Western Roman Empire. By the end of his wars (533\u2013555), the Justiniaic ideology that the west was no longer part of the Roman Empire had been asserted. Though Italy and North Africa were restored to imperial control, there could be no doubt in the aftermath of the wars that areas beyond Justinian's authority were no longer part of the Roman Empire and instead remained lost to Barbarians. This resulted in a dramatic decline in Roman identity beyond the regions controlled by the Byzantine Empire and led to the decisive end of the \"Roman world\" that had existed since the days of the Roman Republic.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe [[Roman Senate]] continued to function during Gothic rule of Italy and senators dominated the politics within the city of Rome well into the Gothic Wars, during which the senate in the city eventually disappeared and most of its members moved to Constantinople instead. The Senate as an idea achieved a certain legacy in the west. In Gaul, members of the aristocracy were sometimes identified as \"senators\" from the 5th century to the 7th century and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] claimed to be descended from a former Roman senatorial family. In Spain, references to people of \"senatorial stock\" appear as late as the 7th century and in Lombard Italy, \"Senator\" became a personal name, with at least two people known to have had the name in the 8th century. The practice of representing themselves as \"the Senate\" was revived by the aristocracy within the city of Rome in the 8th century, though the institution itself was not revived.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\n=== Disappearance of the Romans ===\n{{See also|Romano-Germanic culture}}\n[[File:Salic_Law.png|alt=|left|thumb|King [[Clovis I]] of the [[Franks]] dictates the [[Salic law|Salic Law]] surrounded by his military chiefs. In Salic Law, the Romans were recognized as a parallel population alongside the Franks within Clovis's [[Frankish kingdom|Frankish Kingdom]].]]\nThere is substantial evidence that the meaning of \"Roman\" changed significantly during the 6th century. In the East, being Roman became defined not only by loyalty to the emperor but also increasingly by religious orthodoxy (though what that explicitly meant also changed through the ages). The Gothic Wars in Italy had split the Roman elite unto those who supported the Goths and later enjoyed Lombard rule and those who supported the emperor and later withdrew to regions still governed by the empire. With this, Roman identity no longer provided a sense of social cohesion. This, combined with the abolition of the senate in Rome itself, removed groups of people who had previously always set the standard for what \"Roman\" was supposed to mean. Through the centuries that followed, the division between the non-Roman and Roman parts of the population faded in the west as Roman political unity collapsed.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThis decline in people identifying as Romans in the west can be prominently seen in northern Gaul. In the 6th century, the personnel of churches in northern Gaul had been dominated by people with Roman names, for instance only a handful of names of non-Roman and non-Biblical origin are recorded in the episcopal list of [[Metz]] from before the year 600, a situation that is reversed after 600 when bishops had predominantly Frankish names. The reason for this change in naming practices might be a change in naming practices in Gaul, that people entering church services no longer adopted Roman names or that the Roman families which had provided the church personnel dropped in status.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nIn [[Salic law]], produced under Clovis I around the year 500, the Romans and the Franks are two parallel major populations in the [[Frankish kingdom]] and although the Franks have somewhat of an advantage, both have well-defined legal statuses. A century later in the ''[[Lex Ripuaria]]'', the ''Romani'' are just one of many smaller semi-free populations, restricted in their legal capacity. This legal arrangement would have been unthinkable during the rule of the Roman Empire, and even under the reign of Clovis.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThrough the early Middle Ages, the legal significance of having Roman status also faded away in Western Europe and spoken Latin fragmented and split into what would develop into the modern [[Romance languages]]. The unifying and sometimes contradictory Roman identity was replaced with local identities based on the region one was from (such as [[Provence]] or [[Aquitania]]). Where Romans had once been accepted as composing the majority of the population, such as in Hispania and Gaul, they quietly faded away as their descendants accepted other names and identities.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' The benefit of abandoning the identity as Roman and reverting to more local identities was that local identities were not binary opposed to the identity as a \"Frank\" or \"Goth\" and could exist together with them, providing legal advantages that \"Roman\" no longer did.'''{{Sfn|Halsall|2018|p=}}''' Furthermore, it is possible that people who identified as \"Romans\" were victims of anti-Roman prejudice, as experienced by the 7th century Saint [[Goar of Aquitaine]]. Although Roman identity would linger on in Western Europe in some places, mostly being restricted to a few minorities in the [[Alps|alpine regions]], some residual meanings of \"Roman\" would remain important through the Middle Ages, such as \"Roman\" as a citizen of the Byzantine Empire or \"Roman\" as a citizen of the city of Rome or representative of the Roman Catholic Church.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThe significance of being a Roman thus eventually completely disappeared in Western Europe, together with the Roman identity itself. 8th century sources from [[Salzburg]] still reference that there was a social group in the city called the ''Romani tributales'' but Romans at this time mostly merged with the wider ''tributales'' (tributary peoples) distinction rather than having a separate Roman distinction in Frankish documents. Throughout most of former Gaul, the Roman elite which had lingered for centuries merged with the Frankish elite and lost their previously distinct identity and though \"Romans\" continued to be a dominant identity in regional politics in southern Gaul for a while, the specific references to some individuals as \"Romans\" or \"descendants of Romans\" indicates that the Roman status of some people in Gaul was perhaps no longer being taken for granted and needed pointing out. The last groups of ''Romani'' in the Frankish realm lingered for some time, especially in Salzburg and [[Raetia]], but seem to fade away in the early 9th century'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' (except for the [[Romansh people]] in southeastern Raetia).{{Sfn|Billigmeier|1979|p=}}\n\nBy 800, when Charlemagne was crowned as a new Roman emperor in Rome, the first time an emperor was crowned in Rome itself since antiquity, self-identification as a Roman was largely gone in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the name of Rome was to remain a source of power and prestige throughout history, becoming associated with Europe's two most powerful figures (the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor) and also being invoked by later aristocratic medieval families who sometimes proclaimed and were proud of their alleged Roman origins.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\n=== Association with the city of Rome ===\n[[File:4 Gift Bringers of Otto III.jpg|thumb|Personifications of (from left to right) the [[Slavs|Slavic]], [[Germans|German]], Gallic ([[French people|French]]) and Roman peoples bringing gifts to [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], depicted in the 10th or 11th century [[Gospels of Otto III]].]]\nAs the seat of the Pope, the city of Rome continued to hold significance despite the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the city having been sacked by both the Visigoths and the Vandals.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' Although the glorious past of Rome was remembered in medieval times, whatever power Rome had once held was completely overshadowed by the city being the location of the Papal see. In the 6th century writings of Gregory of Tours, Rome is always described as a Christian city, first being mentioned once [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] arrives there. The longest discussion on Rome is about the election of [[Pope Gregory the Great]] and Gregory of Tours appears indifferent to Rome at one point having been the capital of a great empire.'''{{Sfn|Hen|2018|p=}}'''\n\nThrough the early Middle Ages, the term ''Romani'' became more and more heavily associated by authors in Western Europe with the population of the city itself, or the population of the larger [[Duchy of Rome]]. The change from an identity applied to people throughout Italy to an identity applied to the city itself can be pinpointed to the 6th century; [[Cassiodorus]], who served the Gothic kings, use the term ''Romani'' to describe Roman people across Italy and Pope Gregory the Great, at the end of the 6th century, uses ''Romani'' almost exclusively for the people in the city. The ''[[Historia langobardorum|Historia Langobardorum]]'', written by [[Paul the Deacon]] in the 8th century, postulates that the term ''civis Romanus'' (\"Roman citizen\") is applied solely to someone who either lived in, or was born in, the city of Rome and it could for instance be applied to the [[Archbishop of Ravenna]], [[Marinianus of Ravenna|Marinianus]], only because he had originally been born in Rome. This indicates that the term at some point ceased to generally refer to all the Latin-speaking subjects of the Lombard kings and became restricted to the city itself.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' \n\nAfter the Byzantine Empire restored imperial control over Rome, the city had become a peripheral city within the empire. Its importance stemmed from being the seat of the Pope, one of the Patriarchs of the Church, and the city's population was not specially administrated and lacked political participation in wider imperial affairs except for its interactions with the papacy.'''{{Sfn|Delogu|2018|p=}}''' Under Byzantine rule, the Popes often used the fact that they had the backing of the \"people of Rome\" as a legitimizing factor when clashing with the emperors. The political implications of the name and citizenry of Rome thus remained somewhat important, at least in the eyes of the westerners.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Sack_of_Rome_by_Alaric_-_sacred_vessels_are_brought_to_a_church_for_safety_(2nd_of_2).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the [[Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]].]]\nWhen the temporal power of the popes was established through the foundation of the [[Papal States]] (established through the Frankish king [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] granting control of former Byzantine provinces conquered from the Lombards to the Pope), the population of the city of Rome became a constitutional identity which accompanied and supported the sovereignty of the popes. In the minds of the contemporary popes, the sovereign of the Papal States was St. Peter, who delegated control to his vicars on Earth, the popes. However, the popes were too deeply rooted in the Roman imperial system to imagine a wordly government established only on religious relationships. As such, the \"Romans\" became the political body of this new state and the term, once used for all the inhabitants of Byzantine Italy, became increasingly used to exclusively refer to the inhabitants of the city. After [[Donation of Pepin|Pepin's donations]] the Popes also revived the concept of ''respublica Romanorum'' as something associated with, but distinct from, the Church. In the new version of the idea, the Pope was the lord of the Romans but the Romans themselves, as citizens of Rome, had a share in the public rights connected to the sovereignty of the city.'''{{Sfn|Delogu|2018|p=}}'''\n\nMedieval sources on the \"Romans\" as the people living in Rome are generally quite hostile. The Romans are frequently described as being \"as proud as they are helpless\" and as speaking the ugliest of all the Italian dialects. Because they repeatedly attempted to take a position independent from the Papacy and/or the Holy Roman emperors (both of whom were considered as more universal rulers whose policies extended much further than the city itself), the Romans were often seen as intruders in affairs that exceeded their competence. The Romans people were in turn overwhelmingly negatively oriented towards the Franks, which they identified as \"the Gauls\". The Frankish emperors from Charlemagne onwards decreed that Frankish law could be used in the courts of their empire when demanded, which soured relations, and Frankish nobility which visited Italy and Rome would often speak in their own Frankish language when they did not want the Romans to understand them. Roman sources from this time typically describe \"the Gauls\" as vain, aggressive and insolent. The Roman dislike for the Franks sometimes turned into fear as the Franks would more and more frequently appear outside their gates with armies.'''{{Sfn|Delogu|2018|p=}}'''\n\nDespite this fear, the population of Rome and people in most other parts of Italy (with the exception of southern Italy, still under Byzantine influence) saw Charlemagne and his successors as true Roman emperors.'''{{Sfn|Granier|2018|p=}}''' The reasons for this were many. Although the Romans accepted that there was continuity between Rome and Constantinople, and saw the Carolingian emperors as having more to do with the Lombard kings of Italy than the ancient Roman emperors,'''{{Sfn|Granier|2018|p=}}''' the Byzantines were often seen as ''Grieci'' (\"Greeks\") rather than Romans and were seen as having abandoned Rome, the seat of empire, and lost the Roman way of life and the Latin language; thus the empire ruling in Constantinople hadn't survived, but had fled from its responsibilities. This disconnect shows that the city of Rome and the Byzantines had grown very far apart from each other.{{Sfn|West|2016}} To the Romans and Italians of the 8th and 9th century, the original Roman Empire was a thing of the past. There definitely used to be an empire, such as during the time of Constantine the Great, but it had now transferred itself to the Eastern Mediterranean and ceased to be properly Roman, now inhabited by \"Greeks\". Rome was no longer a city of emperors, but was the city of St. Peter only. A real Roman Empire could have only one capital, Rome, and its possible existence rested on the man who ruled in Rome, the Pope. As such, the new emperors in the West (an office that eventually developed into the Holy Roman emperors) could be emperors only because they were crowned and anointed by the Pope.'''{{Sfn|Granier|2018|p=}}''' The support of what was perceived by Western Europe as the ''populus Romanus'' was a highly important factor during Charlemagne's coronation. Charlemagne himself actively hoped to suppress the idea of ''Romani'' as an ethnicity in an effort to avoid that the imperial title could be bestowed by the population of Rome in the same way that the Franks could proclaim a ''rex Francorum'' (King of the Franks).'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n\n== Later history in the Eastern Mediterranean ==\n=== Romans in the Byzantine Empire ===\n{{Main|Byzantine Greeks}}\n[[File:Justinian mosaik ravenna.jpg|thumb|6th century mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]] depicting Emperor [[Justinian I]] (center) surrounded by court officials and guards. The figures to his immediate left and right are assumed to be the prominent generals [[Belisarius]] (left) and [[Narses]] (right).]]\nIn stark contrast to the catastrophic collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire (frequently called the [[Byzantine Empire]] by modern historians) survived the 5th century more or less intact and its predominantly Greek-speaking population continued to identify themselves as Romans (''Rhomaioi''), as they remained inhabitants of the Roman Empire. The name ''Romania'' (\"land of the Romans\"), a later popular designation by the people of the Byzantine Empire for their country, is attested as early as 582 when it was used by the inhabitants of the city of [[Sirmium]] for their country. Although rarely expressed as an idea before the 9th century, the earliest mention of the Byzantine Empire as being \"Greek\" is from the 6th century, written by Bishop [[Avitus of Vienne]] in the context of the Frankish king Clovis I's baptism; \"Let Greece, to be sure, rejoice in having an orthodox ruler, but she is no longer the only one to deserve such a great gift\".'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' To the early Byzantines (up until around the 11th century) the term \"Greeks\" or \"Hellenes\" was offensive as it downplayed their Roman nature and furthermore associated them with the ancient Pagan Greeks rather than the more recent Christian Romans.'''{{Sfn|Cameron|2009|p=7}}'''\n\nThe idea of the ''res publica'' remained an important imperial concept for centuries. In the Frankish king [[Childebert II]]'s letters to Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], the emperor is called the ''princeps Romanae reipublicae'' and through the 6th and 8th centuries, terms such as ''res publica'' and ''sancta res publica'' was still sometimes applied to the Byzantine Empire by authors in Western Europe. This practice only ceased as Byzantine control over Italy and Rome itself crumbled and \"Roman\" as a name and concept became more heavily associated by Western authors with the city itself. The use of the term ''Romani'' was somewhat similar, usually often used in reference to the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire by early Medieval western authors when not used for the population of the city itself. In [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''History of the Goths'', the term ''Romani'' refers to the Byzantine Empire and their remaining garrisons in Spain and the term is never applied to the population of the former western provinces.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Byzantinischer_Mosaizist_um_1020_001.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|11th century [[Hagia Sophia]] mosaic. On the left, Emperor [[Constantine IX]] is identified as \"faithful in Christ the God, [[Basileus|Emperor]] of the Romans\".]]\nReferences to the Romans as a ''gens'', like the Barbarian ''gentes'', begin to appear around the time of Justinian's conquests. [[Priscian]], a [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|grammarian]] who was born in Roman North Africa and later lived in Constantinople during the late 5th century and early 6th century, refers in his work to the existence of a ''gens Romana''. Letters written by the Frankish king Childebert II to Emperor Maurice in Constantinople in the 580s talk of the peace between the two \"gentes of the Franks and the Romans\". The 6th century historian [[Jordanes]], himself identifying as a Roman, refers to the existence of a Roman ''gens'' in the title of his work on Roman history, ''De summa temporum vel de origine actibusque <u>gentis Romanorum</u>''. The idea of Romans as a ''gens'' like any other didn't become generally accepted in the East until the 11th century.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}''' For instance, Emperor [[Basil I]] ({{Reign}}867\u2013886) still considered \"Roman\" to be an identity that was defined as an opposite to being of a Barbarian ''gens''.{{Sfn|West|2016}} Before the 11th century, the \"Romans\" discussed in Byzantine texts usually refer to individuals loyal to the Byzantine emperor who followed Chalcedonian Christianity. As such, the Romans were all the Christian subjects of the emperor.'''{{Sfn|Pohl|2018|p=}}'''\n[[File:Byzantine_fresca_from_St-Lucas.jpg|thumb|The biblical [[Joshua]] portrayed as a [[Byzantine army|Byzantine soldier]] wearing the lamellar ''klivanion'' cuirass and a straight ''spathion'' sword ([[Hosios Loukas]]).|alt=]]\nIn the 27th chapter of Emperor Constantine VII's 10th century political treatise ''De administrando imperio'', the emperor expressed the idea that the ''imperium'' had been transferred from Rome to Constantinople once Rome stopped being ruled by an emperor. The 12th century historian John Kinnamos expresses similar views, seeing the rights to the ''imperium'' as having disappeared from Rome and the west since power passed there from the last Western Roman emperors to Barbarian kings who had no claim to being Roman. As such, the ruler in Constantinople was the sole ruler in Europe who could claim to be a true Roman. As such, the transfer of power from Rome to Constantinople that had begun under Constantine the Great had been finished once the last few Western Roman emperors were dethroned or killed. This view was important in Byzantine ideology as it served as the basis for their idea of unbroken continuity between Rome and Constantinople.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=72}}'''    \n\nThe population within the Byzantine Empire saw themselves as living within the Roman Empire but were aware that their empire was no longer as powerful as it once had been. The 7th century text ''[[Doctrina Jacobi]]'', set in Carthage, states that the territory ruled by the Romans had once stretched from Spain in the west to Persia in the east and Africa in the south to Britain in the north, with all the people in it having been subordinated to the Romans by the will of God. Though the old borders were still visible through the presence of monuments erected by the ancient emperors, the author of the ''Doctrina Jacobi'' stated that one could now see that the present Roman realm (the ''Romania'') had been humbled.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=74}}'''    \n\nThe losses that the empire had experienced, in particular the loss of Northern Africa and the Levant in the Muslim conquests in the 7th century, were typically blamed on the heresy of the emperors (e.g. [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclasm]]) and the Christians who had once lived in these lost regions ceased to be recognized by the Byzantines as \"Romans\". This eventually led to \"Roman\" being applied more to the dominant Greek-speaking population of the remaining empire than to inhabitants of the empire in general. The late 7th century was the first time (in the writings of St. [[Anastasios the Persian]]) that Greek, rather than Latin, was referred to as the ''rhomaisti'' (Roman way of speaking).'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=74}}''' In [[Leo the Deacon]]'s 10th century histories, Emperor Nikephoros Phokas is described as having settled communities of Armenians, ''Rhomaioi'' and other ethnicities on Crete, indicating that Romans by this time were just one of the groups within the empire (for instance alongside the Armenians).'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=79}}''' By the late 11th century, the transformation of \"Roman\" to an identity by descent rather than political or religious affiliation was complete, with references to people as \"''Rhomaios'' by birth\" beginning to appear in the writings of Byzantine historians. The label was now also applied to Greek-speakers outside of the empire's borders, such as the Greek-speaking Christians under [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] rule in Anatolia, who were referred to as ''Rhomaioi'' despite actively resisting attempts at re-integration by the Byzantine emperors.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=80}}'''\n\n=== Late Byzantine identity ===\n[[File:Alexios Apokaukos.jpg|left|thumb|Byzantine portrait of [[Alexios Apokaukos]], a 14th century ''[[megas doux]]'' in the service of Emperors [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos III]] and [[John V Palaiologos|John V]].]]\nAfter the crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] captured Constantinople in 1204 and shattered the Byzantine view of unbroken continuity from Rome to Constantinople, new alternative sources were required for the legitimacy of the Byzantines as Romans. The Byzantine elite thus began to increasingly detach their self-identity from the Roman Empire as a unit and look to Greek cultural heritage and Orthodox Christianity as the markers of what Romans were, and connected the modern Romans to the ancient Greeks as the precursors who had once ruled the current homeland of the Romans. Ethnic Romanness became increasingly identified as someone who was ethno-culturally Hellenic, an idea which was taken a step further by Emperors John III and Theodore II (who ruled at Nicaea while the Crusaders and their descendants occupied Constantinople), who stated that the present ''Rhomaioi'' were ''Hellenes'', descendants of the Ancient Greeks.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=85}}'''\n\nThis is not to say that the Byzantines stopped identifying as Romans. The Byzantine view changed from Constantine the Great bestowing the empire to Constantinople to Constantine the Great bestowing the empire to the ''Hellenes'' and as such a Roman and a Greek was the same thing. This in no way invalidated them as Romans; though the Nicaean emperors explicitly referred to their lands and subjects as Hellenic, they also identified themselves as the only true Roman emperors. \"Greek\" and \"Roman\" were not contrasting or distinct identities, but building blocks of the same identity as ''Rhomaioi''. This double-identity lasted beyond the 1261 [[Reconquest of Constantinople|reconquest]] of the city under Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] and remained the main view on the issue by the time of the last few Byzantine emperors. In the text ''Comparison of the Old and the New Rome'' by Manuel Chrysoloras, addressed to Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], Rome is presented as the mother of the daughter Constantinople, a city founded by the two most wise and powerful peoples in the world, the Romans and the Hellenes, who came together to create a city destined to rule the entire world.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=86}}'''\n\n=== Romans in the Ottoman Empire ===\n{{Main|Ottoman Greeks|R\u00fbm}}\n[[File:Illustration_from_Views_in_the_Ottoman_Dominions_by_Luigi_Mayer,_digitally_enhanced_by_rawpixel-com_1.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman Greeks]] in [[Constantinople]], painted by [[Luigi Mayer]] (1755\u20131803)]]\n''Rhomaioi'' survived the 1453 [[Fall of Constantinople]], the end of the Byzantine Empire, as the primary self-designation for the Christian Greek-speaking inhabitants in the new Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. The popular historical memory of these ''Rhomaioi'' was not occupied with the glorious past of the Roman Empire of old or the Hellenism in the Byzantine Empire but by legends of the fall and loss of their Christian homeland and Constantinople, such as the myth that the last emperor, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] (who had died fighting the Ottomans at Constantinople in 1453), would one day return from the dead to reconquer the city.'''{{Sfn|Stouraitis|2017|p=88}}'''\n\nIn the [[early modern period]], an educated, urban-dwelling Turkish-speaker who was not a member of the military-administrative class would often refer to himself neither as an ''Osmanl\u0131'' (\"Ottoman\") nor as a ''T\u00fcrk'' (\"Turk\"), but rather as a ''R\u016bm\u012b'' (\u0631\u0648\u0645\u0649\u200e), or \"Roman\", meaning an inhabitant of the territory of the former Byzantine Empire in the Balkans and Anatolia.

Among these factors were that names such as \"Hellene\", \"Hellas\" or \"Greece\" were already in use for the country and its people by the other nations in Europe, the absence of the old Byzantine government to reinforce Roman identity, and the term ''Romioi'' becoming associated with those Greeks still under Ottoman rule rather than those actively fighting for independence.

Examples of this are the [[Romansh people]] (descended from the ''Romani'' recorded in the Alps in the 8th and 9th centuries) and the [[Romands]].'''{{Sfn|Minahan|2000|p=776}}''' Romands represent the [[French language|French]]-speaking community of [[Switzerland]], with French being the native language of 20% of the [[Swiss people]].

This region, anciently known as Raetia, was inhabited by the [[Rhaetian people]], with the Celtic [[Helvetii]] at their west. The ethnicity of the Rhaetians is uncertain, but [[Raetian language|their language]] was probably [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] with [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and perhaps [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] influences. The Rhaetians were conquered by the Romans in 15 AD. They were seen by the Romans as excellent fighters and were included in several legions, where their usage of Latin would start. Over the centuries, Latin would replace indigenous languages in Raetia, with Roman culture only strongly consolidated in the province during the times of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. After this, [[Germanic tribes]] would settle in the province, where they would eventually assimilate most of this Romanized Rhaetian population. The ones that resisted the Germanic invasions evolved into the modern Romansh people, who call their language and themselves as ''rumantsch'' or ''romontsch'', derived from the Latin word ''romanice'', which means \"Romance\".{{Sfn|Billigmeier|1979|p=}}\n\n=== Balkan Romance peoples ===\nThe [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance peoples]] have also maintained their Roman identity over the centuries, and it has remained especially prominent in the [[Romanians]]. One of the main principles of Romanian identity and [[Romanian nationalism|nationalism]] is the [[Origin of the Romanians#Theory of Daco-Roman continuity|theory of Daco-Roman continuity]]. This theory claims that [[Dacia]], after its conquest by [[Trajan]], was so extensively colonized that the indigenous [[Dacians]] mixed with the Roman settlers, thus creating a culture of [[Daco-Roman]]s. These would resist the invasions of [[Slavs]] and other peoples by hiding in the [[Carpathians]], eventually evolving into the modern day Romanians. This theory is not universally accepted, however.{{Sfn|Light|Dumbraveanu&nbsp;Andone|1997|p=}} One of the earliest records of the Romanians being referred to as Romans is given in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', a German [[epic poem]] written before 1200 in which a \"Duke Ramunc from the land of [[Vlach]]s ([[Wallachia]])\" is mentioned. \"Vlach\" was an [[exonym]] (name employed by forgeiners) used almost exclusively for the Romanians during the Middle Ages. It has been argued that \"Ramunc\" was not the name of the duke, but a collective name that highlighted his ethnicity. Other documents, especially Byzantine or [[Hungary|Hungarian]] ones, also mention the old Romanians as Romans or their descendants.{{Sfn|Druga\u0219|2016|p=}} Today, Romanians call themselves ''rom\u00e2ni'' and their nation ''Rom\u00e2nia''.{{Sfn|Berciu&nbsp;Dr\u0103ghicescu|2012|p=}}\n\nThe [[Aromanians]] are another Balkan Romance ethnic group scattered in the Balkans. Their origins are highly uncertain. Romanians often say that they originally were Romanians who migrated from north to south of the [[Danube]] and that they are still Romanians. The Greeks, on the other hand, say that they descend from indigenous Greeks and Roman soldiers placed there to guard the [[Mountain pass|passes]] of the [[Pindus]] (and that they are therefore ethnic Greeks who speak [[Aromanian language|a Romance language]]).

{"title_page": "Eastern Hunter-Gatherer", "text_new": "{{short description|Archaeogenetic name for an ancestral genetic component}}\nIn [[archaeogenetics]], the term '''Eastern Hunter-Gatherer''', '''East European Hunter-Gatherer''', or '''Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer''', is the name given to a distinct ancestral component that represents descent from [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s of [[Eastern Europe]]. The term is often abbreviated as '''EHG'''. During the Mesolithic, the EHGs inhabited an area stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Urals]] and downwards to the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=27}}\n\nAlong with [[Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (SHG) and [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WHG), the EHGs constituted one of the three main genetic groups in the postglacial period of early [[Holocene]] Europe.{{sfn|Kashuba|2019|ps=: \"Earlier aDNA studies suggest the presence of three genetic groups in early postglacial Europe: Western hunter\u2013gatherers (WHG), Eastern hunter\u2013gatherers (EHG), and Scandinavian hunter\u2013gatherers (SHG)4. The SHG have been modelled as a mixture of WHG and EHG.\"}} The border between WHGs and EHGs ran roughly from the lower [[Danube]], northward along the western forests of the [[Dnieper]] towards the western [[Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=28}}\n\nEHGs are believed to have been of about 75% [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) descent, and to have contributed significantly to the ancestry of the WHGs and SHGs (who were a mixture of WHG and EHG). During the [[Neolithic]] and early [[Eneolithic]], EHGs on the Pontic-Caspian steppe formed the [[Yamnaya culture]], perhaps after some admixture with [[Caucasus hunter-gatherer|Caucasus hunter-gatherers]] (CHGs). The genetic cluster formed from this admixture is known as [[Western Steppe Herders|Western Steppe Herder]] (WSH). The Yamnaya culture is supposed to have embarked on a massive expansion leading to the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] throughout large parts of Eurasia.\n\n==Research==\nIn their groundbreaking genetic study, Haak et al. (2015) identified the Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG) as a distinct genetic cluster in samples of two males. The EHG male buried in [[Karelia]] ca. 5500-5000 BC was found to be carrying [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a1]] and [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C1g]]. The EHG male buried in [[Samara Oblast|Samara]] ca. 5650-5550 BC was found to be carrying [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b1]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U5a1d]]. The authors of the study also identified a [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] (WHG) cluster and a [[Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer]] (SHG) cluster, with SHG being intermediate between WHG and EHG. It was suggested that EHGs harbored mixed ancestry from [[Ancient North Eurasian]]s (ANEs) and WHGs. The people of the [[Yamnaya culture]] were found to be a mix of EHG and [[Near East|Near Eastern]] populations. During the 3rd millennium BC, the Yamnaya people embarked on a massive expansion throughout [[Europe]], which significantly altered the genetic landscape of the continent. The expansion gave rise to cultures such as [[Corded Ware culture|Corded Ware]], and was possibly the source of the distribution of [[Indo-European languages]] in Europe.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}\n\nEHGs may have mixed with Near Eastern populations, which formed the Yamnaya culture,as early as the [[Eneolithic]] (5200-4000 BC).{{sfn|Mathieson|2015}} Researchers have found that EHGs may have derived 75% of their ancestry from ANEs. WHGs were in turn a mix of EHGs and the [[Upper Paleolithic]] people ([[Cro-Magnon]]) of the [[Grotte du Bichon]] in [[Switzerland]]. SHGs were determined to be a mix of EHGs and WHGs.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016|ps=, Eastern Hunter Gatherers (EHG) derive 3/4 of their ancestry from the ANE... Scandinavian hunter-gatherers (SHG) are a mix of EHG and WHG; and WHG are a mix of EHG and the Upper Paleolithic Bichon from Switzerland.}}\n\nThe people of the Mesolithic [[Kunda culture]] and the [[Narva culture]] of the eastern [[Baltic sea|Baltic]] were a mix of WHG and EHG, showing the closest affinity with WHG. Samples from the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Mesolithic and [[Neolithic]] were found to cluster tightly together between WHG and EHG, suggesting genetic continuity in the [[Dnieper Rapids]] for a period of 4,000 years. The Ukrainian samples belonged exclusively to the maternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]], which is found in around 80% of all European hunter-gatherer samples.{{sfn|Jones|2017}}\n\nMeanwhile, the people of the [[Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture]] (CCC) of the eastern Baltic appear to be closely related to EHG. This is in contrast to earlier hunter-gatherers in the area, who were more closely related to WHG. This was demonstrated using a sample of [[Y-DNA]] extracted from a Pit\u2013Comb Ware individual.

The authors of the study suggested that the SHGs were a mix of WHGs who had migrated into Scandinavia from the south, and EHGs who had later migrated into Scandinavia from the northeast along the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coast. EHGs and WHGs displayed lower allele frequences of [[Membrane-associated transporter protein|SLC45A2]] and [[Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 5|SLC24A5]], which cause depigmentation, and [[OCA2|OCA/Herc2]], which causes light [[eye color]], than SHGs.{{sfn|G\u00fcnther|2018}}{{clarify |date=February 2020 }}\n\nMembers of the Kunda culture and Narva culture were also found to be more closely related with WHG, while the Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture was more closely related to EHG.

The term is often abbreviated as '''EHG'''. During the Mesolithic, the EHGs inhabited an area stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Urals]] and downwards to the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=27}}\n\nAlong with [[Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (SHG) and [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WHG), the EHGs constituted one of the three main genetic groups in the postglacial period of early [[Holocene]] Europe.{{sfn|Kashuba|2019|ps=: \"Earlier aDNA studies suggest the presence of three genetic groups in early postglacial Europe: Western hunter\u2013gatherers (WHG), Eastern hunter\u2013gatherers (EHG), and Scandinavian hunter\u2013gatherers (SHG)4. The SHG have been modelled as a mixture of WHG and EHG.\"}} The border between WHGs and EHGs ran roughly from the lower [[Danube]], northward along the western forests of the [[Dnieper]] towards the western [[Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=28}}\n\nEHGs are believed to have been of about 75% [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) descent, and to have contributed significantly to the ancestry of the WHGs and SHGs (who were a mixture of WHG and EHG). During the [[Neolithic]] and early [[Eneolithic]], EHGs on the Pontic-Caspian steppe formed the [[Yamnaya culture]], perhaps after some admixture with [[Caucasus hunter-gatherer|Caucasus hunter-gatherers]] (CHGs). The genetic cluster formed from this admixture is known as [[Western Steppe Herders|Western Steppe Herder]] (WSH). The Yamnaya culture is supposed to have embarked on a massive expansion leading to the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] throughout large parts of Eurasia.\n\n==Research==\nIn their groundbreaking genetic study, Haak et al. (2015) identified the Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG) as a distinct genetic cluster in samples of two males. The EHG male buried in [[Karelia]] ca. 5500-5000 BC was found to be carrying [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a1]] and [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C1g]]. The EHG male buried in [[Samara Oblast|Samara]] ca. 5650-5550 BC was found to be carrying [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b1]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U5a1d]]. The authors of the study also identifed a [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] (WHG) cluster and a [[Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer]] (SHG) cluster, with SHG being intermediate between WHG and EHG. It was suggested that EHGs harbored mixed ancestry from [[Ancient North Eurasian]]s (ANEs) and WHGs. The people of the [[Yamnaya culture]] were found to be a mix of EHG and [[Near East|Near Eastern]] populations. During the 3rd millenium BC, the Yamnaya people embarked on a massive expansion throughout [[Europe]], which significantly altered the genetic landscape of the continent. The expansion gave rise to cultures such as [[Corded Ware culture|Corded Ware]], and was possibly the source of the distribution of [[Indo-European languages]] in Europe.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}\n\nEHGs may have mixed with Near Eastern populations, which formed the Yamnaya culture,as early as the [[Eneolithic]] (5200-4000 BC).{{sfn|Mathieson|2015}} Researchers have found that EHGs may have derived 75% of their ancestry from ANEs. WHGs were in turn a mix of EHGs and the [[Upper Paleolithic]] people ([[Cro-Magnon]]) of the [[Grotte du Bichon]] in [[Switzerland]]. SHGs were determined to be a mix of EHGs and WHGs.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016|ps=, Eastern Hunter Gatherers (EHG) derive 3/4 of their ancestry from the ANE... Scandinavian hunter-gatherers (SHG) are a mix of EHG and WHG; and WHG are a mix of EHG and the Upper Paleolithic Bichon from Switzerland.}}\n\nThe people of the Mesolithic [[Kunda culture]] and the [[Narva culture]] of the eastern [[Baltic sea|Baltic]] were a mix of WHG and EHG, showing the closest affinity with WHG. Samples from the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Mesolithic and [[Neolithic]] were found to cluster tightly together between WHG and EHG, suggesting genetic continuity in the [[Dnieper Rapids]] for a period of 4,000 years. The Ukrainian samples belonged exclusively to the maternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]], which is found in around 80% of all European hunter-gatherer samples.{{sfn|Jones|2017}}\n\nMeanwhile the people of the [[Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture]] (CCC) of the eastern Baltic appear to be closely related to EHG. This is in contrast to earlier hunter-gatherers in the area, who were more closely related to WHG. This was demonstrated using a sample of [[Y-DNA]] extracted from a Pit\u2013Comb Ware individual. This belonged to [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a15-YP172]].{{clarify |date=February 2020 |reason=Haplogroup numbers are too technical for average readers without some explanation}} The four samples of mtDNA extracted constituted two samples of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5b1d1]], one sample of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5a2d]], and one sample of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4a]].{{clarify |date=February 2020 |reason=Haplogroup numbers are too technical for average readers without some explanation}}{{sfn|Saag|2017}}\n\nIn January 2018 researchers published details of an analysis of 13 SHGs and found all of them to be of EHG ancestry. SHGs from western and northern Scandinavia had more EHG ancestry (ca 49%) than individuals from eastern Scandinavia (ca. 38%). The authors of the study suggested that the SHGs were a mix of WHGs who had migrated into Scandinavia from the south, and EHGs who had later migrated into Scandinavia from the northeast along the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coast. EHGs and WHGs displayed lower allele frequences of [[Membrane-associated transporter protein|SLC45A2]] and [[Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 5|SLC24A5]], which cause depigmentation, and [[OCA2|OCA/Herc2]], which causes light [[eye color]], than SHGs.{{sfn|G\u00fcnther|2018}}{{clarify |date=February 2020 }}\n\nMembers of the Kunda culture and Narva culture were also found to be more closely related with WHG, while the Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture was more closely related to EHG. Northern and eastern areas of the eastern Baltic were found to be more closely related to EHG than southern areas. The study noted that EHGs, like SHGs and Baltic hunter-gatherers, carried high frequencies of the derived [[alleles]] for SLC24A5 and SLC45A2, which are codings for [[light skin]].{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}}\n\n===The Genomic History of Southeastern Europe===\nIn an analysis of a large number of individuals of prehistoric Eastern Europe, thirty-seven samples were collected from Mesolithic and Neolithic Ukraine (9500-6000 BC). These were determined to be an intermediate between EHG and SHG. Samples of Y-DNA extracted from these individuals belonged exclusively to [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R]] haplotypes (particularly subclades of [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b1]] and [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]]) and [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]] haplotypes (particlarly subclades of [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]]). [[mtDNA]] belonged almost exclusively to [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]] (particularly subclades of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]]).{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} {{clarify |date=February 2020 |reason=Haplogroup numbers are too technical for average readers without some explanation}}\n\nA large number of individuals from the [[Zvejnieki burial ground]], which mostly belonged to the Kunda culture and Narva culture in the eastern Baltic, were analyzed. These individuals were mostly of WHG descent in the earlier phases, but over time EHG ancestry became predominant. The Y-DNA of this site belonged almost exclusively to haplotypes of [[Haplogroup R1b#R1b1a1a (R-P297)|haplogroup R1b1a1a]] and [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a1]]. The mtDNA belonged exclusively to [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|haplogroup U]] (particularly subclades of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U2|U2]], [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]]).{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} {{clarify |date=February 2020 |reason=Haplogroup numbers are too technical for average readers without some explanation}}\n\nForty individuals from three sites of the [[Iron Gates Mesolithic]] in the [[Balkans]] were also analyzed. These individuals were estimated to be of 85% WHG and 15% EHG descent. The males at these sites carried exclusively [[Haplogroup R1b#R1b1a (R-L754)|R1b1a]] and [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]] (mostly subclades of [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a]]) haplotypes. [[mtDNA]] belonged mostly to [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]] (particularly subclades of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]]).{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} {{clarify |date=February 2020 |reason=Haplogroup numbers are too technical for average readers without some explanation}}\n\nPeople of the [[Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture]] were found to harbor about 20% hunter-gatherer ancestry, which was intermediate between EHG and WHG.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}}\n\n===The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia===\nIn a genetic study published in [[Science (journal)|Science]] in September 2019, a new ancestral component called [[West Siberian Hunter-Gatherer]] (WSG) was discovered. WSGs were found to be of about 30% EHG ancestry, 50% ANE ancestry, and 20% East Asian ancestry.{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nThe EHGs are believed to have been light-skinned and [[brown eyes|brown eyed]].{{sfn|G\u00fcnther|2018}} \n\n==See also==\n* [[Dnieper-Donets culture]]\n* [[Sredny Stog culture]]\n* [[Deriivka]]\n* [[Samara culture]]\n* [[Khvalynsk culture]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Anthony |first1=David W. |author-link1=David W.
