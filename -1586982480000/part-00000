To take advantage of the breathtaking scenery, it was filmed in two versions, a standard [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] version and another in the new [[70 mm Grandeur film]] process, using an innovative camera and lenses. Many in the audience who saw it in Grandeur stood and cheered. However, only a handful of theaters were equipped to show the film in its widescreen process, and the effort was largely wasted.

They conceived it as a Western that would bring the final curtain down on Hollywood Westerns. Stewart and Fonda both agreed to appear in it, but after long consideration, Wayne turned it down, citing his feeling that his character was more underdeveloped and uninteresting than those of his co-stars, which was largely based on John Ford's recommendation after perusing the script. The project was shelved for some twenty years, until McMurtry rewrote and expanded the original screenplay co-written with Bogdanovich to make the novel and subsequent TV miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'', with [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in Wayne's role and [[Robert Duvall]] playing the part originally written for Stewart in the extremely popular miniseries.\n* [[Mel Brooks]] offered Wayne the role of the Waco Kid (eventually played by [[Gene Wilder]]) in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974). After reading the script Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was \"too dirty\" for his family image, but told Brooks that he would be \"first in line\" to see the movie.<ref>Interview: [[Mel Brooks]].

Spielberg recalled, \"[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn't waste my time making it.

Only [[Clark Gable]] sold more tickets than Wayne, although the ticket prices paid during the span of their respective careers are not really commensurate. While both men began performing on screen at the same time, the height of Gable's celebrity preceded Wayne's by approximately fifteen years.\n\n==Missed roles==\n* Wayne rebuffed the lead role in the 1952 film ''[[High Noon]]'' because he felt the film's story was an allegory against [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]], which he actively supported. In a 1971 interview, Wayne said he considered ''High Noon'' \"the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life\", and that he would \"never regret having helped run screenwriter [[Carl Foreman]], [who was later blacklisted] out of the country\".<ref name=davis/>{{rp|142}}\n* An urban legend has it that in 1955, Wayne turned down the role of Matt Dillon in the long-running television series ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and recommended [[James Arness]] instead. While he did suggest Arness for the part and introduced him in a prologue to the first episode, no film star of Wayne's stature would have considered a television role at the time.<ref>Barabas, S.

J. \"King\" Kong in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) was originally written with Wayne in mind, and that [[Stanley Kubrick]] offered him the part after [[Peter Sellers]] injured his ankle during filming; he immediately turned it down.<ref name=Hill>Lee Hill, ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' (Bloomsbury, 2001), pp.118\u2013119</ref>\n* In 1966, Wayne accepted the role of Major Reisman in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967), and asked [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for some script changes, but eventually withdrew from the project to make ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''.

They conceived it as a Western that would bring the final curtain down on Hollywood Westerns. Stewart and Fonda both agreed to appear in it, but after long consideration, Wayne turned it down, citing his feeling that his character was more underdeveloped and uninteresting than those of his co-stars, which was largely based on John Ford's recommendation after perusing the script. The project was shelved for some twenty years, until McMurtry rewrote and expanded the original screenplay co-written with Bogdanovich to make the novel and subsequent TV miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'', with [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in Wayne's role and [[Robert Duvall]] playing the part originally written for Stewart in the extremely popular miniseries.\n* [[Mel Brooks]] offered Wayne the role of the Waco Kid (eventually played by [[Gene Wilder]]) in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974). After reading the script Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was \"too dirty\" for his family image, but told Brooks that he would be \"first in line\" to see the movie.<ref>Interview: [[Mel Brooks]].

After reading the script, Wayne decided not to participate due to ill health, but also urged Spielberg not to pursue the project. Both Wayne and Heston felt the film was unpatriotic. Spielberg recalled, \"[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn't waste my time making it. He said, 'You know, that was an important war, and you're making fun of a war that cost thousands of lives at Pearl Harbor.
