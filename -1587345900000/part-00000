A dry sample is collected with a swab or filter paper. A few drops of alcohol, then a few drops of phenolphthalin, and finally a few drops of [[hydrogen peroxide]] are dripped onto the sample. If the sample contains [[hemoglobin]], it will turn pink immediately upon addition of the peroxide, because of the generation of phenolphthalein. A positive test indicates the sample contains hemoglobin and, therefore, is likely blood. A false positive can result from the presence of substances with catalytic activity similar to hemoglobin. This test is not destructive to the sample; it can be kept and used in further tests. This test has the same reaction with blood from any animal whose blood contains hemoglobin, including almost all vertebrates; further testing would be required to determine whether it originated from a human.\n\n==Synthesis==\nPhenolphthalein can be synthesized by condensation of [[phthalic anhydride]] with two equivalents of [[phenol]] under acidic conditions (hence the name).

A dry sample is collected with a swab or filter paper. A few drops of alcohol, then a few drops of phenolphthalin, and finally a few drops of [[hydrogen peroxide]] are dripped onto the sample. If the sample contains [[hemoglobin]], it will turn pink immediately upon addition of the peroxide, because of the generation of phenolphthalein. A positive test indicates the sample contains hemoglobin and, therefore, is likely blood. A false positive can result from the presence of substances with catalytic activity similar to hemoglobin. This test is not destructive to the sample; it can be kept and used in further tests. This test has the same reaction with blood from any animal whose blood contains hemoglobin, including almost all vertebrates; further testing would be required to determine whether it originated from a human.\n\n==Synthesis==\nPhenolphthalein can be synthesized by condensation of [[phthalic anhydride]] with two equivalents of [[phenol]] under acidic conditions (hence the name).

Afterwards, the U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, repeated the claim. However, the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing. Hansen said he received the information from ''Dateline'' expert Ken Lanning, but Lanning admitted that he made up the number 50,000 because there was no solid data on the number. According to Lanning, he used 50,000 because it sounds like a real number, not too big and not too small, and referred to it as a \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] number\". Reporter Carl Bialik says that the number 50,000 is used often in the media to estimate numbers when reporters are unsure of the exact data.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Influencing Machine|last=Gladstone|first=Brooke|publisher=W.

[[News media]] companies broadcast stories 24 hours a day, and break the latest news in hopes of taking audience share from their competitors. News is also produced at a pace that does not always allow for [[fact-checking]], or for all of the facts to be collected or released to the media at one time, letting readers or viewers insert their own opinions, and possibly leading to the spread of misinformation.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Croteau | display-authors=etal | title=Media Technology | pages=285\u2013321 | url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | journal= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102172415/http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | archive-date=January 2, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nMisinformation can affect all aspects of life. When [[eavesdropping]] on conversations, one can gather facts that may not always be true, or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others. On the Internet, one can read content that is stated to be factual but that that may not have been checked or may be erroneous. In the news, companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts. These developments contribute to the way misinformation will continue to complicate the public's understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Jo7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT246&dq=misinformation+causes#v=onepage&q=misinformation%20causes&f=false|title=Misinformation and Mass Audiences|last=Southwell|first=Brian G.|last2=Thorson|first2=Emily A.|last3=Sheble|first3=Laura|date=2018|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-1477314586|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[politics]], some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen. Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and in turn affect elections and policies.

The profusion of information sources makes the reader's task of weighing the reliability of information more challenging, heightened by the untrustworthy social signals that go with such information.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Messerole |first1=Chris |title=How misinformation spreads on social media&nbsp;\u2013 And what to do about it |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/05/09/how-misinformation-spreads-on-social-media-and-what-to-do-about-it/ |website=Brookings Institution |accessdate=24 February 2019 |date=2018-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225044815/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/05/09/how-misinformation-spreads-on-social-media-and-what-to-do-about-it/ |archive-date=25 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The inclination of people to follow or support like-minded individuals leads to the formation of echo chambers and [[filter bubble]]s. With no differing information to counter the untruths or the general agreement within isolated social clusters, the outcome is a dearth, and worse, the absence of a collective reality, some writers argue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cjr.org/analysis/breitbart-media-trump-harvard-study.php|title=Study: Breitbart-led rightwing media ecosystem altered broader media agenda|last=Benkler|first=Y.|date=2017|access-date=8 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180604140114/https://www.cjr.org/analysis/breitbart-media-trump-harvard-study.php|archive-date=4 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Although social media sites have changed their algorithms to prevent the spread of fake news, the problem still exits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fake-news-trends.pdf|title=Trends in the Diffusion of Misinformation on Social Media|last=Allcott|first=Hunt|date=October 2018|website=Stanford Education|bibcode=2018arXiv180905901A|arxiv=1809.05901|access-date=2019-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728160530/https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fake-news-trends.pdf|archive-date=2019-07-28|url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, research has shown that while people may know what the scientific community has proved as a fact, they may still refuse to accept it as such.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Nicole M.|last2=Scheufele|first2=Dietram A.|date=2019-04-16|title=Science audiences, misinformation, and fake news|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=116|issue=16|pages=7662\u20137669|doi=10.1073/pnas.1805871115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=30642953|pmc=6475373}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been observed that misinformation and disinformation come back, multiple times on social media sites.

Whereas a book found in a library generally has been reviewed and edited by a second person, Internet sources cannot be assumed to be vetted by anyone other than their authors. They may be produced and posted as soon as the writing is finished.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Stapleton | first=Paul | title=Assessing the quality and bias of web-based sources: implications for academic writing | journal=Journal of English for Academic Purposes | year=2003 | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=229\u2013245 | doi=10.1016/S1475-1585(03)00026-2}}</ref> In addition, the presence of trolls and bots used to spread willful misinformation has been a problem for social media platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Milman|first=Oliver|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/21/climate-tweets-twitter-bots-analysis|title=Revealed: quarter of all tweets about climate crisis produced by bots|date=2020-02-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222193221/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/21/climate-tweets-twitter-bots-analysis|archive-date=2020-02-22|url-status=live}}</ref> As many as 60 million trolls could be spreading misinformation on Facebook.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Douglas S.|last2=Iyengar|first2=Shanto|date=2019-04-16|title=Scientific communication in a post-truth society|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=116|issue=16|pages=7656\u20137661|doi=10.1073/pnas.1805868115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=30478050|pmc=6475392}}</ref>\n\n===Bad information from media sources===\nAn example of bad information from media sources that led to the spread of misinformation occurred in November 2005, when Chris Hansen on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' made a claim that [[law enforcement]] officials estimate 50,000 predators are online at any moment. Afterwards, the U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, repeated the claim. However, the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing. Hansen said he received the information from ''Dateline'' expert Ken Lanning, but Lanning admitted that he made up the number 50,000 because there was no solid data on the number. According to Lanning, he used 50,000 because it sounds like a real number, not too big and not too small, and referred to it as a \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] number\". Reporter Carl Bialik says that the number 50,000 is used often in the media to estimate numbers when reporters are unsure of the exact data.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Influencing Machine|last=Gladstone|first=Brooke|publisher=W.

[[News media]] companies broadcast stories 24 hours a day, and break the latest news in hopes of taking audience share from their competitors. News is also produced at a pace that does not always allow for fact-checking, or for all of the facts to be collected or released to the media at one time, letting readers or viewers insert their own opinions, and possibly leading to the spread of misinformation.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Croteau | display-authors=etal | title=Media Technology | pages=285\u2013321 | url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | journal= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102172415/http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | archive-date=January 2, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nMisinformation can affect all aspects of life. When [[eavesdropping]] on conversations, one can gather facts that may not always be true, or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others. On the Internet, one can read content that is stated to be factual but that that may not have been checked or may be erroneous. In the news, companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts. These developments contribute to the way misinformation will continue to complicate the public's understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Jo7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT246&dq=misinformation+causes#v=onepage&q=misinformation%20causes&f=false|title=Misinformation and Mass Audiences|last=Southwell|first=Brian G.|last2=Thorson|first2=Emily A.|last3=Sheble|first3=Laura|date=2018|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-1477314586|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[politics]], some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen. Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and in turn affect elections and policies. This type of misinformation comes from speakers not always being upfront and straightforward. When information is presented as vague, ambiguous, sarcastic, or partial, receivers are forced to piece the information together and assume what is correct.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barker | first=David | title=Rushed to Judgement: Talk Radio, Persuasion, and American Political Behavior | year=2002 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York | pages=106\u2013109}}</ref> Aside from [[Propaganda|political propaganda]], misinformation can also be employed in industrial propaganda. Using tools such as advertising, a company can undermine reliable evidence or influence belief through concerted misinformation campaign. For instance, [[tobacco]] companies employed misinformation in the second half of the twentieth century to diminish the reliability of studies that demonstrated the link between [[smoking]] and [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Misinformation Age: How False Beliefs Spread|last=O'Connor|first=Cailin|last2=Weatherall|first2=James Owen|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0300234015|location=New Haven|pages=10}}</ref> In the medical field, misinformation can immediately lead to life endangerment as seen in the case of the public's negative perception towards vaccines or the use of herbs instead of medicines to treat diseases.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9ZuMDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT22&dq=misinformation+causes#v=onepage&q=misinformation%20causes&f=false|title=India Misinformed: The True Story|last=Sinha|first=P.|last2=Shaikh|first2=S.|last3=Sidharth|first3=A.|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2019|isbn=978-9353028381|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWebsites have been created to help people to discern fact from fiction.

In 1989, Kimmel landed his first paying job alongside Voss as morning drive co-host of ''The Me and Him Show'' at [[KZOK-FM]] in Seattle, Washington. Over the next 10 months, the hosts performed several stunts on air, including one that led to an $8,000 loss in advertising.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Boss |first1=Kit |title=Sonic Boom: Kzok-Am Turns Up The Volume {{!}} The Seattle Times |url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900201&slug=1053812 |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=February 1, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Garrett |first1=Shawn |title=Jimmy Kimmel Comes To Seattle and Complains About Being Fired in 1990 |url=https://kzok.iheart.com/content/2019-03-27-jimmy-kimmel-comes-to-seattle-and-complains-about-being-fired-in-1990/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[KZOK-FM]] |date=March 27, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Kimmel and Voss were fired by KZOK and were fired again a year later at [[WRBQ-FM]] in [[Tampa, Florida]].

He declined several offers for television shows from producer [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]], being uninterested in the projects, until he was offered a place as the comedic counterpart to [[Ben Stein]] on the game show ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'', which began airing on [[Comedy Central]] in 1997. His quick wit and \"[[everyman]]\" personality were counterpoints to Stein's monotonous vocal style and faux-[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] demeanor. The combination earned the pair an [[Emmy]] award for Best Game Show Host.<ref name=\"variety2016\"/>\n\nIn 1999, during his time with ''Win Ben Stein's Money'', Kimmel co-hosted (with [[Adam Carolla]]) and co-produced (with [[Daniel Kellison]]), Comedy Central's ''[[The Man Show]]''. Kimmel left ''Win Ben Stein's Money'' in 2001 and was replaced by comedian [[Nancy Pimental]], who was eventually replaced by Kimmel's cousin [[Sal Iacono]]. ''[[The Man Show]]''{{'}}s success allowed Kimmel, Carolla, and Kellison to create and produce, under the banner [[Jackhole Productions]], ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' for [[Comedy Central]] (on which Kimmel plays the characters \"Elmer Higgins\", \"Terrence Catheter\", \"The Nudge\", \"[[Karl Malone]]\" and himself) and later ''[[The Andy Milonakis Show]]'' for MTV2.

In the April 2007 issue of Stuffmagazine.com, Kimmel was named the \"biggest badass on TV\". Kimmel said it was an honor but clearly a mistake.\n\nDespite its name, the show has not actually aired live since 2004, when censors were unable to properly [[bleep censor]] a barrage of swearing from actor [[Thomas Jane]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url = https://www.vulture.com/2012/10/jimmy-kimmel-live-gets-new-time-slot.html |title = Jimmy Kimmel Takes On Brooklyn And Two New Rivals |last = Yuan |first = Jada |magazine = [[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] |date = October 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring an incident during the [[2004 NBA Finals]] in Detroit, Kimmel appeared on ABC's halftime show to make an on-air plug for his show. He suggested that if the [[Detroit Pistons]] defeated the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], \"they're gonna burn the city of Detroit down&nbsp;... and it's not worth it.\" Officials with Detroit's ABC affiliate, [[WXYZ-TV]], immediately announced that that night's show would not air on the station.

He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon on the red carpet one time and before he could finish the interview he said, \"Sorry, we are out of time.\" The most recent encounter was titled \"The Handsome Men's Club\" which featured Kimmel, along with the \"Handsome Men\", who were: [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Keith Urban]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Tony Romo]], [[Ted Danson]], [[Taye Diggs]], [[Gilles Marini]], and [[Ben Affleck]], speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it. At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by none other than [[Matt Damon]], saying they had run out of time and then Damon continues with a sinister laugh. [[Jennifer Garner]] also makes a surprise appearance. As a tradition, celebrities voted off ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' appear on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'', causing Kimmel to describe himself as \"the [[Cerberus|three-headed dog]] the stars must pass on their way to No-Dancing Hell.\"\n\nIn October 2013, a new segment of the show, \"Kids Table\", showcased five- and six-year-olds discussing the U.S. government shutdown and U.S. debts. When one of the children suggested \"killing all the people in China\", as a way of resolving the U.S. debt, Kimmel responded that that was \"an interesting idea\" and soon jokingly asked a follow up: \"Should we allow the Chinese to live?\"<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite web |url =https://ew.com/article/2013/10/28/jimmy-kimmel-live-china-joke-apology/ |title =ABC apology for 'Kimmel' segment|date = October 28, 2013 |work = Entertainment Weekly |accessdate = November 6, 2019}}</ref> The incident triggered discussions and protests on Internet, even from [[Mainland China]].

He is known for his work as [[executive producer]] and [[showrunner]] of the [[cartoon series|animated]] sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'' from 1997 to 2001. Scully grew up in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] and long had an interest in writing. He was an [[underachiever]] at school and dropped out of college, going on to work in a series of jobs. Eventually, in 1986, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he worked as a stand-up comic and wrote for [[Yakov Smirnoff]].\n\nScully went on to write for several television sitcoms before 1993, when he was hired to write for ''The Simpsons''. There, he wrote twelve episodes, including \"[[Lisa on Ice]]\" and \"[[Team Homer]]\", and served as showrunner from [[The Simpsons (season 9)|seasons 9]] to [[The Simpsons (season 12)|12]]. Scully won three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for his work on the series, with many publications praising his episodes, but others criticizing his tenure as a period of decline in the show's quality. Scully still works on the show and also co-wrote 2007's ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.\n\nMore recently, Scully co-created ''[[The Pitts]]'' and ''[[Complete Savages]]'' as well as working on ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''. He co-developed the short-lived animated television version of ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]''. Scully is married to fellow writer [[Julie Thacker]].\n\n==Early life==\nScully was born October 2, 1956 at [[Baystate Medical Center|Springfield Hospital]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] and grew up in the Merrick section of [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]].<ref name=spring>{{cite news|title=His television success is no joke|work=[[The Republican (Springfield)|The Republican]]|date=2003-12-08|author=Freeman, Stan|page=A01}}</ref><ref name=live>{{cite news|url=http://www.masslive.com/television/index.ssf/2009/11/mike_scully_discusses_the_simp.html|title=Mike Scully discusses 'The Simpsons' and growing up in West Springfield|date=2009-11-09|author=Fritz, Steve |accessdate=2010-02-15|work=Mass Live.com}}</ref> His father, Richard, was a salesman and owned a dry cleaning business, his mother Geraldine (d. 1985) worked for the [[Baystate Medical Center]] once Scully and his brothers were old enough to be left at home alone.<ref name=live/> Scully is of Irish ancestry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/5395565.html?new_layout=1&page_no=1&show_comments=1|title=Homer thoughts from abroad|accessdate=2012-06-08|date=2009-04-21|work=[[Hot Press]]|author=Clark, Stuart}}</ref>\n\nAs a child he \"hoped to be a musician or a hockey player.\"<ref name=mass/> At Main Street Elementary School, with the encouragement of his teacher James Doyle, he developed an interest in writing, serving as editor for his school newspaper.<ref name=spring/><ref name=live/> He graduated from [[West Springfield High School (Massachusetts)|West Springfield High School]] in 1974, having been voted \"Most Likely Not to Live Up to Potential\" by his classmates,<ref name=neil/> and dropped out of [[Holyoke Community College]] after one day, undecided about what he wanted to do with his life.<ref name=spring/><ref name=mass/><ref name=degree1/> He took up work in the clothing department at Steiger's department store,<ref name=spring/> as a [[janitor]] at the Baystate Medical Center and also as a driving instructor.<ref name=live/> He commented: \"I think if I had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something, I might have given up too quickly on writing.

(born October 2, 1956) is an American [[television writer]] and producer. He is known for his work as [[executive producer]] and [[showrunner]] of the [[cartoon series|animated]] sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'' from 1997 to 2001. Scully grew up in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] and long had an interest in writing. He was an [[underachiever]] at school and dropped out of college, going on to work in a series of jobs. Eventually, in 1986, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he worked as a stand-up comic and wrote for [[Yakov Smirnoff]].\n\nScully went on to write for several television sitcoms before 1993, when he was hired to write for ''The Simpsons''. There, he wrote twelve episodes, including \"[[Lisa on Ice]]\" and \"[[Team Homer]]\", and served as showrunner from [[The Simpsons (season 9)|seasons 9]] to [[The Simpsons (season 12)|12]]. Scully won three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for his work on the series, with many publications praising his episodes, but others criticizing his tenure as a period of decline in the show's quality. Scully still works on the show and also co-wrote 2007's ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.\n\nMore recently, Scully co-created ''[[The Pitts]]'' and ''[[Complete Savages]]'' as well as working on ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''. He co-developed the short-lived animated television version of ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]''.

With the formation of Allegheny County in 1788, Franklin Park was part of [[Pitt Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pitt Township]], which included all land north of the Ohio River. Following the path of Pine Creek as a boundary, Pitt Township was divided in half (1800), with the newly created Pine Township containing what would become Franklin Park. Three years later, Ohio Township was created from Pine, extending nine miles along the Ohio River and northward to Butler County. It included the area that would later become Franklin Park.\nEarly in 1823, Ohio Township residents in the northwestern most corner of Allegheny County petitioned the county courts for permission to secede from the township and create their own municipality. Despite a counter-petition being filed, the county courts approved the motion and in August 1823, Franklin Township was created, which included what are today Franklin Park and Bradford Woods boroughs and Marshall Township. Forty years later, Marshall Township was created from Franklin with Bradford Woods seceding from Marshall in 1915. Franklin would remain a second class township until August 1961 when it became the Borough of Franklin Park.\n \nThroughout most of its history, Franklin moved forward at its own unhurried pace. There were no towns or business districts. Churches, one-room schools, blacksmith shops and country stores were scattered across gently rolling farmlands. Throughout the late 1800 and early 1900s, the area had a thriving oil and gas industry.\n \nBy the end of the Great Depression, farming declined as a livelihood because men were taking better paying jobs in the mills of Pittsburgh, Ambridge and Coraopolis. The first subdivisions appeared in Franklin Township following World War II. Population growth brought demands for public services and schools. It was during this time, that the community enacted its first ordinances and building codes, along with providing public water and sewers. Faced with increasing numbers of students, the Franklin Township School District along with its counterparts in Marshall, Bradford Woods, McCandless and Pine joined in 1948 to create the North Allegheny School District. Despite Pine Township leaving the jointure a year later, the other communities opened a newly built high school in 1954. Today, the North Allegheny School District is home to two high schools, three middle and seven elementary schools.\n \nThe opening of Interstates 79 and 279 through the heart of Franklin Park brought more change and challenges to this once rural community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Franklin Park Borough's History Webpage|url=http://www.franklinparkborough.us/history/history_prt.html|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nFranklin Park is located at {{coord|40|35|26|N|80|5|31|W|type:city}} (40.590459, -80.092046).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|13.6|sqmi}}, all of it land.\n\nIt is part of the [[North Allegheny School District]], along with the [[McCandless, Pennsylvania|Town of McCandless]], [[Marshall Township, Pennsylvania|Marshall Township]] and the borough of [[Bradford Woods, Pennsylvania|Bradford Woods]], and participates in the multi-municipality [[Northland Public Library]].\n\n==Surrounding neighborhoods==\nFranklin Park has eight borders, including [[Marshall Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Marshall Township]] to the north, [[Pine Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pine Township]] in the northeast corner, [[McCandless Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|McCandless]] to the east, [[Ross Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Ross Township]] to the southeast, [[Ohio Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Ohio Township]] to the south, [[Sewickley Hills, Pennsylvania|Sewickley Hills]] to the west, [[Bell Acres, Pennsylvania|Bell Acres]] from the west-northwest to northwest, and [[Economy, Pennsylvania|Economy]] in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]] in the northwest corner.\n\n==Recreation==\nRecreational areas of Franklin Park include:<ref>https://www.franklinparkborough.us/Facilities?clear=False \"Parks in Franklin Park, PA\", retrieved 4 November 2018</ref>\n* Acorn Park \n* Blueberry Hill Park\n* Linbrook Park\n* Fifer\u2019s fields Conservation Area\n* [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]] [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 203|Number 203]]<ref name=\"nationalmap\">https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/advanced-viewer/ \"The National Map\" retrieved 24 September 2018</ref><ref name=\"PASGL\">[https://www.pgc.pa.gov/HuntTrap/StateGameLands/Documents/SGL%20Maps/SGL__203.pdf Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 203], retrieved 24 September 2018</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 5310\n|1980= 6135\n|1990= 10109\n|2000= 11364\n|2010= 13470\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=14749\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 5, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-40.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019235623/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|archivedate=19 October 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 11,364 people, 3,866 households, and 3,282 families residing in the borough.

With the formation of Allegheny County in 1788, Franklin Park was part of [[Pitt Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pitt Township]], which included all land north of the Ohio River. Following the path of Pine Creek as a boundary, Pitt Township was divided in half (1800), with the newly created Pine Township containing what would become Franklin Park. Three years later, Ohio Township was created from Pine, extending nine miles along the Ohio River and northward to Butler County. It included the area that would later become Franklin Park.\nEarly in 1823, Ohio Township residents in the northwestern most corner of Allegheny County petitioned the county courts for permission to secede from the township and create their own municipality. Despite a counter-petition being filed, the county courts approved the motion and in August 1823, Franklin Township was created, which included what are today Franklin Park and Bradford Woods boroughs and Marshall Township. Forty years later, Marshall Township was created from Franklin with Bradford Woods seceding from Marshall in 1915. Franklin would remain a second class township until August 1961 when it became the Borough of Franklin Park.\n \nThroughout most of its history, Franklin moved forward at its own unhurried pace. There were no towns or business districts. Churches, one-room schools, blacksmith shops and country stores were scattered across gently rolling farmlands. Throughout the late 1800 and early 1900s, the area had a thriving oil and gas industry.\n \nBy the end of the Great Depression, farming declined as a livelihood because men were taking better paying jobs in the mills of Pittsburgh, Ambridge and Coraopolis. The first subdivisions appeared in Franklin Township following World War II. Population growth brought demands for public services and schools. It was during this time, that the community enacted its first ordinances and building codes, along with providing public water and sewers. Faced with increasing numbers of students, the Franklin Township School District along with its counterparts in Marshall, Bradford Woods, McCandless and Pine joined in 1948 to create the North Allegheny School District. Despite Pine Township leaving the jointure a year later, the other communities opened a newly built high school in 1954. Today, the North Allegheny School District is home to two high schools, three middle and seven elementary schools.\n \nThe opening of Interstates 79 and 279 through the heart of Franklin Park brought more change and challenges to this once rural community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Franklin Park Borough's History Webpage|url=http://www.franklinparkborough.us/history/history_prt.html|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nFranklin Park is located at {{coord|40|35|26|N|80|5|31|W|type:city}} (40.590459, -80.092046).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|13.6|sqmi}}, all of it land.\n\nIt is part of the [[North Allegheny School District]], along with the [[McCandless, Pennsylvania|Town of McCandless]], [[Marshall Township, Pennsylvania|Marshall Township]] and the borough of [[Bradford Woods, Pennsylvania|Bradford Woods]], and participates in the multi-municipality [[Northland Public Library]].\n\n==Surrounding neighborhoods==\nFranklin Park has eight borders, including [[Marshall Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Marshall Township]] to the north, [[Pine Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pine Township]] in the northeast corner, [[McCandless Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|McCandless]] to the east, [[Ross Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Ross Township]] to the southeast, [[Ohio Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Ohio Township]] to the south, [[Sewickley Hills, Pennsylvania|Sewickley Hills]] to the west, [[Bell Acres, Pennsylvania|Bell Acres]] from the west-northwest to northwest, and [[Economy, Pennsylvania|Economy]] in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]] in the northwest corner.\n\n==Recreation==\nRecreational areas of Franklin Park include:<ref>https://www.franklinparkborough.us/Facilities?clear=False \"Parks in Franklin Park, PA\", retrieved 4 November 2018</ref>\n* Acorn Park \n* Blueberry Hill Park\n* Linbrook Park\n* Fifer\u2019s fields Conservation Area\n* [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]] [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 203|Number 203]]<ref name=\"nationalmap\">https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/advanced-viewer/ \"The National Map\" retrieved 24 September 2018</ref><ref name=\"PASGL\">[https://www.pgc.pa.gov/HuntTrap/StateGameLands/Documents/SGL%20Maps/SGL__203.pdf Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 203], retrieved 24 September 2018</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 5310\n|1980= 6135\n|1990= 10109\n|2000= 11364\n|2010= 13470\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=14749\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 5, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-40.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019235623/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|archivedate=19 October 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 11,364 people, 3,866 households, and 3,282 families residing in the borough.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]].

The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n:: d. He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency,<ref name=\"frederica\"/> though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n=====Japanese=====\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker AKK=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || AKK || hated || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi''''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe '''told''' us '''that''' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\nThe newer quotative verb ''be like'' in English is used to only introduce direct quotations. ''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]].

The first is as the complement of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative adjunct (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The verb phrase can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the simple present or the simple past. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a nominal subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, noun phrases are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n:: d. He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency,<ref name=\"frederica\"/> though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n=====Japanese=====\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker AKK=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || AKK || hated || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi''''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

Instead use something else.\n'''Air traffic control''' ('''ATC''') is a service provided by ground-based [[air traffic controller]]s who direct aircraft on the ground and through controlled [[airspace]], and can provide advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace. The primary purpose of ATC worldwide is to prevent collisions, organize and expedite the flow of air traffic, and provide information and other support for pilots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0201.html |title=FAA 7110.65 2-1-1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607105632/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0201.html |archivedate=June 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In some countries, ATC plays a security or defensive role, or is operated by the military.\n\nAir traffic controllers monitor the location of aircraft in their assigned airspace by [[radar]] and communicate with the pilots by radio. To prevent collisions, ATC enforces [[Separation (air traffic control)|traffic separation]] rules, which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it at all times. In many countries, ATC provides services to all private, military, and commercial aircraft operating within its airspace. Depending on the type of flight and the class of airspace, ATC may issue ''instructions'' that pilots are required to obey, or ''advisories'' (known as ''flight information'' in some countries) that pilots may, at their discretion, disregard. The [[pilot in command]] is the final authority for the safe operation of the aircraft and may, in an emergency, deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain safe operation of their aircraft.\n\n==Language==\n{{see also|Aeronautical phraseology|Aviation English}}\n\nPursuant to requirements of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), ATC operations are conducted either in the English language or the language used by the station on the ground.<ref name=\"IDAO FAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/trivia/peltrgFAQ.htm#23 |title=IDAO FAQ |accessdate=2009-03-03 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142943/http://icao.int/icao/en/trivia/peltrgFAQ.htm| archivedate= February 20, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> In practice, the native language for a region is normally used; however, the English language must be used upon request.<ref name=\"IDAO FAQ\" />\n\n==History==\nIn 1920, [[Croydon Airport]], London was the first airport in the world to introduce air traffic control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportheritage.com/find-heritage-locations.html?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=91&sobi2Id=273|title=Heritage Locations \u2013 South East \u2013 Surrey \u2013 Croydon Airport|author =Green Jersey Web Design|publisher=|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> The \"aerodrome control tower\" was actually a wooden hut {{cvt|15|ft}} high with windows on all four sides.

The first of air mail radio stations (AMRS) was created in 1922 after World War I when the U.S. Post Office began using techniques developed by the Army to direct and track the movements of reconnaissance aircraft. Over time, the AMRS morphed into [[flight service station]]s. Today's flight service stations do not issue control instructions, but provide pilots with many other flight related informational services. They do relay control instructions from ATC in areas where flight service is the only facility with radio or phone coverage. The first airport traffic control tower, regulating arrivals, departures and surface movement of aircraft at a specific airport, opened in Cleveland in 1930. Approach/departure control facilities were created after adoption of [[radar]] in the 1950s to monitor and control the busy airspace around larger airports. The first air route traffic control center, which directs the movement of aircraft between departure and destination was opened in Newark, NJ in 1935, followed in 1936 by Chicago and Cleveland.<ref>FAA HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY, 1926\u20131996</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision]], killing all 128 on board, the FAA was given the air-traffic responsibility over America in 1958, and this was followed by other countries.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nIn 1960, Britain, France, Germany and the Benelux countries set up Eurocontrol, intending to merge their airspaces.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nThe first and only attempt to pool controllers between countries is the [[Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre]] (MUAC), founded in 1972 by [[Eurocontrol]] and covering Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and north-western Germany.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nIn 2001, the EU aimed to create a \"Single European Sky\", hoping to boost efficiency and gain economies of scale.<ref name=Economist15jun2019>{{cite news |url= https://www.economist.com/international/2019/06/15/air-traffic-control-is-a-mess |title= Air-traffic control is a mess |date= Jun 15, 2019 |work= The Economist}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|ATCT}}Airport traffic control tower==\n[[File:AeroportoGuarulhos Torre2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport]]'s control tower]]\n[[File:Control tower at Birmingham Airport, England 27June2019 arp.jpg|thumb|upright|Control tower at [[Birmingham Airport]], England]]\n\nThe primary method of controlling the immediate airport environment is visual observation from the airport control tower. The tower is a tall, windowed structure located on the airport grounds. [[Air traffic controller]]s are responsible for the separation and efficient movement of aircraft and vehicles operating on the taxiways and runways of the airport itself, and aircraft in the air near the airport, generally 5 to 10 [[nautical miles]] (9 to 18&nbsp;km) depending on the airport procedures.\n\nSurveillance displays are also available to controllers at larger airports to assist with controlling air traffic. Controllers may use a radar system called [[secondary surveillance radar]] for airborne traffic approaching and departing. These displays include a map of the area, the position of various aircraft, and data tags that include aircraft identification, speed, altitude, and other information described in local procedures. In adverse weather conditions the tower controllers may also use surface movement radar (SMR), surface movement guidance and control systems (SMGCS) or advanced SMGCS to control traffic on the manoeuvring area (taxiways and runway).\n\nThe areas of responsibility for tower controllers fall into three general operational disciplines: local control or air control, ground control, and flight data / clearance delivery\u2014other categories, such as [[Airport ramp|Apron]] control or ground movement planner, may exist at extremely busy airports. While each tower may have unique airport-specific procedures, such as multiple teams of controllers ('crews') at major or complex airports with multiple runways, the following provides a general concept of the delegation of responsibilities within the tower environment.\n\n[[Remote and virtual tower]] (RVT) is a system based on air traffic controllers being located somewhere other than at the local airport tower and still able to provide air traffic control services. Displays for the air traffic controllers may be live video, synthetic images based on surveillance sensor data, or both.\n\n===Ground control===\n[[File:Pope Field Air Traffic Control Tower (9206250542).jpg|thumb|left|Inside [[Pope Field]] air traffic control tower]]\n\nGround control (sometimes known as ''ground movement control'') is responsible for the airport \"movement\" areas, as well as areas not released to the airlines or other users. This generally includes all taxiways, inactive runways, holding areas, and some transitional aprons or intersections where aircraft arrive, having vacated the runway or departure gate. Exact areas and control responsibilities are clearly defined in local documents and agreements at each airport. Any aircraft, vehicle, or person walking or working in these areas is required to have clearance from ground control. This is normally done via VHF/UHF radio, but there may be special cases where other procedures are used. Aircraft or vehicles without radios must respond to ATC instructions via [[aviation light signals]] or else be led by vehicles with radios. People working on the airport surface normally have a communications link through which they can communicate with ground control, commonly either by handheld radio or even [[Mobile phone|cell phone]]. Ground control is vital to the smooth operation of the airport, because this position impacts the sequencing of departure aircraft, affecting the safety and efficiency of the airport's operation.\n\nSome busier airports have surface movement radar (SMR), such as, ASDE-3, AMASS or [[ASDE-X]], designed to display aircraft and vehicles on the ground. These are used by ground control as an additional tool to control ground traffic, particularly at night or in poor visibility. There are a wide range of capabilities on these systems as they are being modernized. Older systems will display a map of the airport and the target. Newer systems include the capability to display higher quality mapping, radar target, data blocks, and safety alerts, and to interface with other systems such as digital flight strips.\n\n\n===Air control or local control===\nAir control (known to pilots as \"tower\" or \"tower control\") is responsible for the active runway surfaces. Air control clears aircraft for takeoff or landing, ensuring that prescribed runway separation will exist at all times. If the air controller detects any unsafe conditions, a landing aircraft may be instructed to \"[[go-around]]\" and be re-sequenced into the landing pattern. This re-sequencing will depend on the type of flight and may be handled by the air controller, approach or terminal area controller.\n\nWithin the tower, a highly disciplined communications process between air control and ground control is an absolute necessity. Air control must ensure that ground control is aware of any operations that will impact the taxiways, and work with the approach radar controllers to create \"gaps\" in the arrival traffic to allow taxiing traffic to cross runways and to allow departing aircraft to take off. Ground control need to keep the air controllers aware of the traffic flow towards their runways in order to maximise runway utilisation through effective approach spacing. [[Crew resource management]] (CRM) procedures are often used to ensure this communication process is efficient and clear. Within ATC, it is usually known as TRM (Team Resource Management) and the level of focus on TRM varies within different ATC organisations.\n\n===Flight data and clearance delivery===\nClearance delivery is the position that issues route clearances to aircraft, typically before they commence taxiing. These clearances contain details of the route that the aircraft is expected to fly after departure. Clearance delivery or, at busy airports, Ground Movement Planner (GMP) or Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) will, if necessary, coordinate with the relevant radar center or flow control unit to obtain releases for aircraft. At busy airports, these releases are often automatic and are controlled by local agreements allowing \"free-flow\" departures. When weather or extremely high demand for a certain airport or airspace becomes a factor, there may be ground \"stops\" (or \"slot delays\") or re-routes may be necessary to ensure the system does not get overloaded. The primary responsibility of clearance delivery is to ensure that the aircraft have the correct aerodrome information, such as weather and airport conditions, the correct route after departure and time restrictions relating to that flight. This information is also coordinated with the relevant radar center or flow control unit and ground control in order to ensure that the aircraft reaches the runway in time to meet the time restriction provided by the relevant unit. At some airports, clearance delivery also plans aircraft push-backs and engine starts, in which case it is known as the Ground Movement Planner (GMP): this position is particularly important at heavily congested airports to prevent taxiway and apron gridlock.\n\nFlight data (which is routinely combined with clearance delivery) is the position that is responsible for ensuring that both controllers and pilots have the most current information: pertinent weather changes, outages, airport ground delays/ground stops, runway closures, etc. Flight data may inform the pilots using a recorded continuous loop on a specific frequency known as the [[automatic terminal information service]] (ATIS).\n\n==Approach and terminal control==\n[[File:Potomac Consolidated TRACON.jpg|thumb|[[Potomac Consolidated TRACON]] in [[Warrenton, Virginia]], United States]]\n\nMany airports have a radar control facility that is associated with the airport. In most countries, this is referred to as ''terminal control''; in the U.S., it is referred to as a TRACON (terminal radar approach control). While every airport varies, terminal controllers usually handle traffic in a {{convert|30|to|50|nmi|km|adj=on}} radius from the airport. Where there are many busy airports close together, one consolidated terminal control center may service all the airports. The airspace boundaries and altitudes assigned to a terminal control center, which vary widely from airport to airport, are based on factors such as traffic flows, neighboring airports and terrain. A large and complex example was the [[London Terminal Control Centre]], which controlled traffic for five main London airports up to {{convert|20000|ft|m}} and out to {{convert|100|nmi|km}}.\n\nTerminal controllers are responsible for providing all ATC services within their airspace. Traffic flow is broadly divided into departures, arrivals, and overflights. As aircraft move in and out of the terminal airspace, they are handed off to the next appropriate control facility (a control tower, an en-route control facility, or a bordering terminal or approach control). Terminal control is responsible for ensuring that aircraft are at an appropriate altitude when they are handed off, and that aircraft arrive at a suitable rate for landing.\n\nNot all airports have a radar approach or terminal control available. In this case, the en-route center or a neighboring terminal or approach control may co-ordinate directly with the tower on the airport and vector inbound aircraft to a position from where they can land visually. At some of these airports, the tower may provide a non-radar [[procedural control|procedural approach]] service to arriving aircraft handed over from a radar unit before they are visual to land. Some units also have a dedicated approach unit which can provide the [[procedural control|procedural approach]] service either all the time or for any periods of radar outage for any reason.\n\nIn the U.S., TRACONs are additionally designated by a three-digit alphanumeric code. For example, the Chicago TRACON is designated C90.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACON)|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/tracon/|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==En route, center, or area control==\n{{Main|Area control center}}\n[[File:AirTraffic-8.jpg|thumb|The training department at the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, [[Leesburg, Virginia]], United States]]\n\nATC provides services to aircraft in flight between airports as well. Pilots fly under one of two sets of rules for separation: [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) or [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR). Air traffic controllers have different responsibilities to aircraft operating under the different sets of rules. While IFR flights are under positive control, in the US and Canada VFR pilots can request flight following, which provides traffic advisory services on a time permitting basis and may also provide assistance in avoiding areas of weather and flight restrictions, as well as allowing pilots into the ATC system prior to the need to a clearance into certain airspace. Across Europe, pilots may request for a \"[[Flight Information Service]]\", which is similar to flight following. In the UK it is known as a \"basic service\".\n\nEn-route air traffic controllers issue clearances and instructions for airborne aircraft, and pilots are required to comply with these instructions. En-route controllers also provide air traffic control services to many smaller airports around the country, including clearance off of the ground and clearance for approach to an airport. Controllers adhere to a set of separation standards that define the minimum distance allowed between aircraft. These distances vary depending on the equipment and procedures used in providing ATC services.\n\n===General characteristics===\nEn-route air traffic controllers work in facilities called air traffic control centers, each of which is commonly referred to as a \"center\". The United States uses the equivalent term air route traffic control center (ARTCC). Each center is responsible for many thousands of square miles of airspace (known as a [[flight information region]]) and for the airports within that airspace. Centers control IFR aircraft from the time they depart from an airport or terminal area's airspace to the time they arrive at another airport or terminal area's airspace. Centers may also \"pick up\" VFR aircraft that are already airborne and integrate them into the IFR system. These aircraft must, however, remain VFR until the center provides a clearance.\n\nCenter controllers are responsible for issuing instructions to pilots to climb their aircraft to their assigned altitude while, at the same time, ensuring that the aircraft is properly separated from all other aircraft in the immediate area. Additionally, the aircraft must be placed in a flow consistent with the aircraft's route of flight. This effort is complicated by crossing traffic, severe weather, special missions that require large airspace allocations, and traffic density. When the aircraft approaches its destination, the center is responsible for issuing instructions to pilots so that they will meet altitude restrictions by specific points, as well as providing many destination airports with a traffic flow, which prohibits all of the arrivals being \"bunched together\". These \"flow restrictions\" often begin in the middle of the route, as controllers will position aircraft landing in the same destination so that when the aircraft are close to their destination they are sequenced.\n\nAs an aircraft reaches the boundary of a center's control area it is \"handed off\" or \"handed over\" to the next [[Area Control Center]]. In some cases this \"hand-off\" process involves a transfer of identification and details between controllers so that air traffic control services can be provided in a seamless manner; in other cases local agreements may allow \"silent handovers\" such that the receiving center does not require any co-ordination if traffic is presented in an agreed manner. After the hand-off, the aircraft is given a frequency change and begins talking to the next controller. This process continues until the aircraft is handed off to a terminal controller (\"approach\").\n\n===Radar coverage===<!-- This section is linked from [[Radar]]. -->\nSince centers control a large airspace area, they will typically use long range radar that has the capability, at higher altitudes, to see aircraft within {{convert|200|nmi|km}} of the radar antenna. They may also use [[TRACON]] radar data to control when it provides a better \"picture\" of the traffic or when it can fill in a portion of the area not covered by the long range radar.\n\nIn the U.S. system, at higher altitudes, over 90% of the U.S. airspace is covered by radar and often by multiple radar systems; however, coverage may be inconsistent at lower altitudes used by unpressurized aircraft due to high terrain or distance from radar facilities. A center may require numerous radar systems to cover the airspace assigned to them, and may also rely on pilot position reports from aircraft flying below the floor of radar coverage. This results in a large amount of data being available to the controller. To address this, automation systems have been designed that consolidate the radar data for the controller. This consolidation includes eliminating duplicate radar returns, ensuring the best radar for each geographical area is providing the data, and displaying the data in an effective format.\n\n[[File:Grandballonsud.jpg|thumb|Unmanned radar on a remote mountain]]\n\nCenters also exercise control over traffic travelling over the world's ocean areas. These areas are also [[flight information region]]s (FIRs). Because there are no radar systems available for oceanic control, oceanic controllers provide ATC services using [[procedural control]]. These procedures use aircraft position reports, time, altitude, distance, and speed to ensure separation. Controllers record information on [[flight progress strip]]s and in specially developed oceanic computer systems as aircraft report positions. This process requires that aircraft be separated by greater distances, which reduces the overall capacity for any given route. See for example the [[North Atlantic Track]] system.\n\nSome air navigation service providers (e.g., Airservices Australia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, [[Nav Canada]], etc.) have implemented [[automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast]] (ADS-B) as part of their surveillance capability. This new technology reverses the radar concept. Instead of radar \"finding\" a target by interrogating the transponder, the ADS-equipped aircraft sends a position report as determined by the [[navigation]] equipment on board the aircraft. Normally, ADS operates in the \"contract\" mode where the aircraft reports a position, automatically or initiated by the pilot, based on a predetermined time interval. It is also possible for controllers to request more frequent reports to more quickly establish aircraft position for specific reasons. However, since the cost for each report is charged by the ADS service providers to the company operating the aircraft,{{dispute-inline|ADS-B|date=March 2014}} more frequent reports are not commonly requested except in emergency situations. ADS is significant because it can be used where it is not possible to locate the infrastructure for a radar system (e.g., over water). Computerized radar displays are now being designed to accept ADS inputs as part of the display. This technology is currently used in portions of the North Atlantic and the Pacific by a variety of states who share responsibility for the control of this airspace.\n\n'''Precision approach radars''' (PAR) are commonly used by military controllers of air forces of several countries, to assist the pilot in final phases of landing in places where instrument landing system and other sophisticated airborne equipment are unavailable to assist the pilots in marginal or ''near zero visibility'' conditions. This procedure is also called '''talkdowns'''.\n\nA radar archive system (RAS) keeps an electronic record of all radar information, preserving it for a few weeks. This information can be useful for search and rescue. When an aircraft has 'disappeared' from radar screens, a controller can review the last radar returns from the aircraft to determine its likely position. For example, see this crash report.<ref>{{cite web |title=crash report |url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/aviation/1996/a96a0207/a96a0207.asp |publisher=tsb.gc.ca |access-date=August 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307102104/http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/aviation/1996/a96a0207/a96a0207.asp |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }} retrieved on August 21, 2010</ref> RAS is also useful to technicians who are maintaining radar systems.\n\n===Flight traffic mapping===\nThe [[Flight traffic mapping|mapping of flights]] in real-time is based on the air traffic control system. In 1991, data on the location of aircraft was made available by the Federal Aviation Administration to the airline industry. The [[National Business Aviation Association]] (NBAA), the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots  Association, the Helicopter Association International, and the National Air Transportation Association petitioned the FAA to make [[ASDI]] information available on a \"need-to-know\" basis.  Subsequently, [[National Business Aviation Association|NBAA]] advocated the broad-scale dissemination of air traffic data. The Aircraft Situational Display to Industry ([[ASDI]]) system now conveys up-to-date flight information to the airline industry and the public. Some companies that distribute [[ASDI]] information are FlightExplorer, FlightView, and FlyteComm. Each company maintains a website that provides free updated information to the public on flight status. Stand-alone programs are also available for displaying the geographic location of airborne [[Instrument flight rules|IFR]] (instrument flight rules) air traffic anywhere in the FAA air traffic system. Positions are reported for both commercial and general aviation traffic. The programs can overlay air traffic with a wide selection of maps such as, geo-political boundaries, air traffic control center boundaries, high altitude jet routes, satellite cloud and radar imagery.\n\n==Problems==\n\n===Traffic===\n:''For more information see [[Air traffic flow management]]''.\n\n[[File:Air traffic heathrow.JPG|thumb|Intersecting [[contrail]]s of aircraft over London, an area of high air traffic]]\n\nThe day-to-day problems faced by the air traffic control system are primarily related to the volume of air traffic demand placed on the system and weather. Several factors dictate the amount of traffic that can land at an airport in a given amount of time. Each landing aircraft must touch down, slow, and exit the [[runway]] before the next crosses the approach end of the runway. This process requires at least one and up to four minutes for each aircraft. Allowing for departures between arrivals, each runway can thus handle about 30 arrivals per hour. A large airport with two arrival runways can handle about 60 arrivals per hour in good weather. Problems begin when airlines schedule more arrivals into an airport than can be physically handled, or when delays elsewhere cause groups of aircraft \u2013 that would otherwise be separated in time \u2013 to arrive simultaneously. Aircraft must then be delayed in the air by [[holding (aviation)|holding]] over specified locations until they may be safely sequenced to the runway. Up until the 1990s, holding, which has significant environmental and cost implications, was a routine occurrence at many airports. Advances in computers now allow the sequencing of planes hours in advance. Thus, planes may be delayed before they even take off (by being given a \"slot\"), or may reduce speed in flight and proceed more slowly thus significantly reducing the amount of holding.\n\nAir traffic control errors occur when the separation (either vertical or horizontal) between airborne aircraft falls below the minimum prescribed separation set (for the domestic United States) by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Separation minimums for terminal control areas (TCAs) around airports are lower than en-route standards. Errors generally occur during periods following times of intense activity, when controllers tend to relax and overlook the presence of traffic and conditions that lead to loss of minimum separation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Effects of Sector Complexity and Controller Experience on Probability of Operational Errors in Air Route Traffic Control Centers |author1=Breitler, Alan  |author2=Kirk, Kevin |date=September 1996 |publisher =Center for Naval Analyses Document (IPR 95-0092)|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->&#123;&#123;inconsistent citations&#125;&#125; }}</ref>\n\n===Weather===\n[[File: PSX 20150807 202515.jpg|thumb|Airplane taking off from [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] with the ATC tower in the background]]\n\nBeyond runway capacity issues, the weather is a major factor in traffic capacity. Rain, [[ice]], snow or [[hail]] on the runway cause landing aircraft to take longer to slow and exit, thus reducing the safe arrival rate and requiring more space between landing aircraft. [[Fog]] also requires a decrease in the landing rate. These, in turn, increase airborne delay for holding aircraft. If more aircraft are scheduled than can be safely and efficiently held in the air, a ground delay program may be established, delaying aircraft on the ground before departure due to conditions at the arrival airport.\n\nIn Area Control Centers, a major weather problem is [[thunderstorms]], which present a variety of hazards to aircraft. Aircraft will deviate around storms, reducing the capacity of the en-route system by requiring more space per aircraft or causing congestion as many aircraft try to move through a single hole in a line of thunderstorms. Occasionally weather considerations cause delays to aircraft prior to their departure as routes are closed by thunderstorms.\n\nMuch money has been spent on creating software to streamline this process. However, at some ACCs, air traffic controllers still record data for each flight on strips of paper and personally coordinate their paths. In newer sites, these [[flight progress strip]]s have been replaced by electronic data presented on computer screens. As new equipment is brought in, more and more sites are upgrading away from paper flight strips.\n\n=== Congestion ===\nConstrained control capacity and growing traffic lead to [[flight cancellation and delay]]s:<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* in America, delays caused by ATC grew by 69% between 2012 and 2017,<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* in China, the average delay per domestic flight spiked by 50% in 2017 to 15 minutes per flight,<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* in Europe, en route delays grew by 105% in 2018, due to a lack of capacity or staff (60%), weather (25%) or strikes (14%), costing the European economy \u20ac17.6bn ($20.8bn), up by 28% on 2017.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nBy then the market for air-traffic services was worth $14bn.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nMore efficient ATC could save 5-10% of aviation fuel by avoiding [[holding pattern]]s and indirect [[Airway (aviation)|airway]]s.<ref name=Economist15jun2019/>\n\n<!--military-->\nThe military takes 80% of Chinese air space, congesting the thin corridors open to airliners.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nBritain is closing military air space only during air-force exercises.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nBritain and France want to retain sovereignty over their skies.<ref name=Economist15jun2019/>\n\n==Callsigns==\nA prerequisite to safe air traffic separation is the assignment and use of distinctive [[callsign|call signs]]. These are permanently allocated by [[ICAO]] on request usually to [[scheduled air transport|scheduled flights]] and some air forces and other military services for [[military aviation|military flights]]. There are written callsigns with a 3-letter combination like KLM, BAW, VLG followed by the flight number, like AAL872, VLG1011. As such they appear on flight plans and ATC radar labels. There are also the ''audio'' or ''Radiotelephony'' callsigns used on the radio contact between pilots and air traffic control. These are not always identical to their written counterparts. An example of an audio callsign would be \"Speedbird 832\", instead of the written \"BAW832\". This is used to reduce the chance of confusion between ATC and the aircraft. By default, the callsign for any other flight is the [[Aircraft registration|registration number]] (tail number) of the aircraft, such as \"N12345\", \"C-GABC\" or \"EC-IZD\". The short ''Radiotelephony'' callsigns for these tail numbers is the last 3 letters using the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] (i.e. ABC spoken ''alpha-bravo-charlie'' for C-GABC) or the last 3 numbers (i.e. ''three-four-five'' for N12345). In the United States, the prefix may be an aircraft type, model or manufacturer in place of the first registration character, for example, \"N11842\" could become \"Cessna 842\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atccommunication.com/what-is-an-abbreviated-aircraft-call-sign|title=What is an Abbreviated Aircraft Call Sign?*|work=ATC Communication|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> This abbreviation is only allowed after communications have been established in each sector.\n\nBefore around 1980 [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) and [[ICAO]] were using the same 2-letter callsigns. Due to the larger number of new airlines after deregulation, [[ICAO]] established the 3-letter callsigns as mentioned above. The [[IATA]] callsigns are currently used in aerodromes on the announcement tables but never used any longer in air traffic control. For example, AA is the [[IATA]] callsign for [[American Airlines]] \u2013 ATC equivalent AAL. Other examples include LY/ELY for [[El Al]], DL/DAL for [[Delta Air Lines]], VY/VLG for [[Vueling Airlines]], JL/JAL for [[Japan Airlines]], NH/ANA for [[All Nippon Airways]], etc. Flight numbers in regular commercial flights are designated by the aircraft operator and identical callsign might be used for the same scheduled journey each day it is operated, even if the departure time varies a little across different days of the week. The callsign of the return flight often differs only by the final digit from the outbound flight. Generally, airline flight numbers are even if eastbound, and odd if westbound. In order to reduce the possibility of two callsigns on one frequency at any time sounding too similar, a number of airlines, particularly in Europe, have started using [[alphanumeric]] callsigns that are not based on flight numbers (i.e. DLH23LG, spoken as [[Lufthansa]]-two-three-lima-golf, to prevent confusion between incoming DLH23 and outgoing DLH24 in the same frequency). Additionally, it is the right of the air traffic controller to change the 'audio' callsign for the period the flight is in his sector if there is a risk of confusion, usually choosing the tail number instead.\n\n==Technology==\nMost ATC still rely on WWII technologies:<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* [[radar]] localisation though [[satellite navigation]] is cheaper and more accurate,<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* [[Two-way radio]] communication instead of [[Controller\u2013pilot data link communications]] like at the MUAC,<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* in America, controllers hand each other paper [[flight progress strip]]s.<ref name=Economist15jun2019/>\n\nMany technologies are used in air traffic control systems. Primary and secondary [[radar]] are used to enhance a controller's [[situation awareness]] within his assigned airspace \u2013 all types of aircraft send back primary echoes of varying sizes to controllers' screens as radar energy is bounced off their skins, and [[transponder]]-equipped aircraft reply to secondary radar interrogations by giving an ID (Mode A), an altitude (Mode C) and/or a unique callsign (Mode S). Certain types of weather may also register on the radar screen.\n\nThese inputs, added to data from other radars, are correlated to build the air situation. Some basic processing occurs on the radar tracks, such as calculating ground speed and magnetic headings.\n\nUsually, a flight data processing system manages all the [[flight plan]] related data, incorporating \u2013 in a low or high degree \u2013 the information of the track once the correlation between them (flight plan and track) is established. All this information is distributed to modern [[operational display system]]s, making it available to controllers.\n\nThe [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] has spent over US$3&nbsp;billion on software, but a fully automated system is still over the horizon. In 2002 the UK brought a new area control centre into service at the [[London Area Control Centre]], Swanwick, [[Hampshire]], relieving a busy suburban centre at [[West Drayton]], Middlesex, north of [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Software from [[Lockheed-Martin]] predominates at the London Area Control Centre. However, the centre was initially troubled by software and communications problems causing delays and occasional shutdowns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Air Traffic Control|url=https://sites.google.com/site/zagorakis1977/theory/air-traffic-control/technology|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome tools are available in different domains to help the controller further:\n* Flight data processing systems: this is the system (usually one per center) that processes all the information related to the flight (the flight plan), typically in the time horizon from gate to gate (airport departure/arrival gates). It uses such processed information to invoke other flight plan related tools (such as e.g. MTCD), and distributes such processed information to all the stakeholders (air traffic controllers, collateral centers, airports, etc.).\n* [[Short-term conflict alert]] (STCA) that checks possible conflicting trajectories in a time horizon of about 2 or 3 minutes (or even less in approach context \u2013 35 seconds in the French Roissy & Orly approach centres<ref>{{cite web|title=Le filet de sauvegarde resserre ses mailles|url=http://www.dgac.fr/html/publicat/av_civil/them_1/them_1_34_35.pdf|website=dgac.fr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327181434/http://www.dgac.fr/html/publicat/av_civil/them_1/them_1_34_35.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009|language=French}}</ref>) and alerts the controller prior to the loss of separation. The algorithms used may also provide in some systems a possible vectoring solution, that is, the manner in which to turn, descend, increase/decrease speed, or climb the aircraft in order to avoid infringing the minimum safety distance or altitude clearance.\n* [[Minimum safe altitude warning]] (MSAW): a tool that alerts the controller if an aircraft appears to be flying too low to the ground or will impact terrain based on its current altitude and heading.\n*System coordination (SYSCO) to enable controller to negotiate the release of flights from one sector to another.\n*Area penetration warning (APW) to inform a controller that a flight will penetrate a restricted area.\n*Arrival and departure manager to help sequence the takeoff and landing of aircraft.\n**The [[DMAN|departure manager (DMAN)]]: A system aid for the ATC at airports, that calculates a planned departure flow with the goal to maintain an optimal throughput at the runway, reduce queuing at holding point and distribute the information to various stakeholders at the airport (i.e. the airline, ground handling and air traffic control (ATC)).\n**The arrival manager (AMAN): A system aid for the ATC at airports, that calculates a planned arrival flow with the goal to maintain an optimal throughput at the runway, reduce arrival queuing and distribute the information to various stakeholders.\n** Passive final approach spacing tool (pFAST), a CTAS tool, provides runway assignment and sequence number advisories to terminal controllers to improve the arrival rate at congested airports. pFAST was deployed and operational at five US TRACONs before being cancelled. NASA research included an active FAST capability that also provided vector and speed advisories to implement the runway and sequence advisories.\n*Converging runway display aid (CRDA) enables approach controllers to run two final approaches that intersect and make sure that go arounds are minimized.\n*Center TRACON automation system (CTAS) is a suite of human centered decision support tools developed by NASA Ames Research Center. Several of the CTAS tools have been field tested and transitioned to the FAA for operational evaluation and use. Some of the CTAS tools are: traffic management advisor (TMA), passive final approach spacing tool (pFAST), collaborative arrival planning (CAP), direct-to (D2), en route descent advisor (EDA) and multi-center TMA. The software is running on Linux.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix02/tech/techthurs.html |title=Technical Sessions |publisher=usenix.org |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref>\n* Traffic management advisor (TMA), a CTAS tool, is an en route decision support tool that automates time based metering solutions to provide an upper limit of aircraft to a TRACON from the center over a set period of time. Schedules are determined that will not exceed the specified arrival rate and controllers use the scheduled times to provide the appropriate delay to arrivals while in the en route domain. This results in an overall reduction in en route delays and also moves the delays to more efficient airspace (higher altitudes) than occur if holding near the TRACON boundary, which is required in order to prevent overloading the TRACON controllers. TMA is operational at most en route air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs) and continues to be enhanced to address more complex traffic situations (e.g. adjacent center metering (ACM) and en route departure capability (EDC))\n* MTCD & URET\n**In the US, user request evaluation tool (URET) takes paper strips out of the equation for en route controllers at ARTCCs by providing a display that shows all aircraft that are either in or currently routed into the sector.\n**In Europe, several MTCD tools are available: iFACTS ([[National Air Traffic Services|NATS]]), VAFORIT ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|DFS]]), new FDPS ([[Eurocontrol#Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre|MUAC]]).

It is especially useful in areas where difficult-to-use [[High Frequency|HF]] radiotelephony was previously used for communication with aircraft, e.g. oceans. This is currently in use in various parts of the world including the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n*[[ADS-B]]: automatic dependent surveillance broadcast \u2013 provides a data downlink of various flight parameters to air traffic control systems via the transponder (1090&nbsp;MHz) and reception of those data by other aircraft in the vicinity. The most important is the aircraft's latitude, longitude and level: such data can be utilized to create a radar-like display of aircraft for controllers and thus allows a form of pseudo-radar control to be done in areas where the installation of radar is either prohibitive on the grounds of low traffic levels, or technically not feasible (e.g. oceans). This is currently in use in Australia, Canada and parts of the Pacific Ocean and Alaska.\n*[[Flight progress strip#Digital Flight Progress Strips .2F Electronic Flight Progress Strip (EFPS)|The electronic flight strip system (e-strip)]]:\n\n[[File:TATIC Electronic Flight Strip system at Sao Paulo Itnl.jpg|thumb|Electronic flight progress strip system at S\u00e3o Paulo Intl. control tower \u2013 ground control]]\n\nA system of electronic flight strips replacing the old paper strips is being used by several service providers, such as Nav Canada, MASUAC, DFS, DECEA.

The first is to have the ATC services be part of a government agency as is currently the case in the United States. The problem with this model is that funding can be inconsistent and can disrupt the development and operation of services. Sometimes funding can disappear when lawmakers cannot approve budgets in time. Both proponents and opponents of privatization recognize that stable funding is one of the major factors for successful upgrades of ATC infrastructure. Some of the funding issues include sequestration and politicization of projects.<ref>{{cite web|author1=American Federation of Government Employees|display-authors=et al|url=https://www.passmember.org/images/congressional_letters/FAA%20Labor%20Unions%20Oppose%20ATC%20Privatization.pdf|title=FAA Labor Unions Oppose ATC Privatization|website=Professional Aviation Safety Specialists|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Proponents argue that moving ATC services to a private corporation could stabilize funding over the long term which will result in more predictable planning and rollout of new technology as well as training of personnel.\n\nAnother model is to have ATC services provided by a government corporation. This model is used in Germany, where funding is obtained through user fees. Yet another model is to have a for-profit corporation operate ATC services. This is the model used in the United Kingdom, but there have been several issues with the system there including a large-scale failure in December 2014 which caused delays and cancellations and has been attributed to cost-cutting measures put in place by this corporation. In fact, earlier that year, the corporation owned by the German government won the bid to provide ATC services for Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom. The last model, which is often the suggested model for the United States to transition to is to have a non-profit organization that would handle ATC services as is used in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rinaldi|first1=Paul|title=Safety and Efficiency Must Remain the Main Mission|journal=The Journal of Air Traffic Control|date=2015|volume=57|issue=2|pages=21\u201323}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian system is the one most often used as a model by proponents of privatization.

The primary purpose of ATC worldwide is to prevent collisions, organize and expedite the flow of air traffic, and provide information and other support for pilots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0201.html |title=FAA 7110.65 2-1-1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607105632/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0201.html |archivedate=June 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In some countries, ATC plays a security or defensive role, or is operated by the military.\n\nAir traffic controllers monitor the location of aircraft in their assigned airspace by [[radar]] and communicate with the pilots by radio. To prevent collisions, ATC enforces [[Separation (air traffic control)|traffic separation]] rules, which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it at all times. In many countries, ATC provides services to all private, military, and commercial aircraft operating within its airspace. Depending on the type of flight and the class of airspace, ATC may issue ''instructions'' that pilots are required to obey, or ''advisories'' (known as ''flight information'' in some countries) that pilots may, at their discretion, disregard. The [[pilot in command]] is the final authority for the safe operation of the aircraft and may, in an emergency, deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain safe operation of their aircraft.\n\n==Language==\n{{see also|Aeronautical phraseology|Aviation English}}\n\nPursuant to requirements of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), ATC operations are conducted either in the English language or the language used by the station on the ground.<ref name=\"IDAO FAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/trivia/peltrgFAQ.htm#23 |title=IDAO FAQ |accessdate=2009-03-03 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142943/http://icao.int/icao/en/trivia/peltrgFAQ.htm| archivedate= February 20, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> In practice, the native language for a region is normally used; however, the English language must be used upon request.<ref name=\"IDAO FAQ\" />\n\n==History==\nIn 1920, [[Croydon Airport]], London was the first airport in the world to introduce air traffic control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportheritage.com/find-heritage-locations.html?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=91&sobi2Id=273|title=Heritage Locations \u2013 South East \u2013 Surrey \u2013 Croydon Airport|author =Green Jersey Web Design|publisher=|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> The \"aerodrome control tower\" was actually a wooden hut {{cvt|15|ft}} high with windows on all four sides.

The first of air mail radio stations (AMRS) was created in 1922 after World War I when the U.S. Post Office began using techniques developed by the Army to direct and track the movements of reconnaissance aircraft. Over time, the AMRS morphed into [[flight service station]]s. Today's flight service stations do not issue control instructions, but provide pilots with many other flight related informational services. They do relay control instructions from ATC in areas where flight service is the only facility with radio or phone coverage. The first airport traffic control tower, regulating arrivals, departures and surface movement of aircraft at a specific airport, opened in Cleveland in 1930. Approach/departure control facilities were created after adoption of [[radar]] in the 1950s to monitor and control the busy airspace around larger airports. The first air route traffic control center, which directs the movement of aircraft between departure and destination was opened in Newark, NJ in 1935, followed in 1936 by Chicago and Cleveland.<ref>FAA HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY, 1926\u20131996</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision]], killing all 128 on board, the FAA was given the air-traffic responsibility over America in 1958, and this was followed by other countries.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nIn 1960, Britain, France, Germany and the Benelux countries set up Eurocontrol, intending to merge their airspaces.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nThe first and only attempt to pool controllers between countries is the [[Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre]] (MUAC), founded in 1972 by [[Eurocontrol]] and covering Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and north-western Germany.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nIn 2001, the EU aimed to create a \"Single European Sky\", hoping to boost efficiency and gain economies of scale.<ref name=Economist15jun2019>{{cite news |url= https://www.economist.com/international/2019/06/15/air-traffic-control-is-a-mess |title= Air-traffic control is a mess |date= Jun 15, 2019 |work= The Economist}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|ATCT}}Airport traffic control tower==\n[[File:AeroportoGuarulhos Torre2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport]]'s control tower]]\n[[File:Control tower at Birmingham Airport, England 27June2019 arp.jpg|thumb|upright|Control tower at [[Birmingham Airport]], England]]\n\nThe primary method of controlling the immediate airport environment is visual observation from the airport control tower. The tower is a tall, windowed structure located on the airport grounds. [[Air traffic controller]]s are responsible for the separation and efficient movement of aircraft and vehicles operating on the taxiways and runways of the airport itself, and aircraft in the air near the airport, generally 5 to 10 [[nautical miles]] (9 to 18&nbsp;km) depending on the airport procedures.\n\nSurveillance displays are also available to controllers at larger airports to assist with controlling air traffic. Controllers may use a radar system called [[secondary surveillance radar]] for airborne traffic approaching and departing. These displays include a map of the area, the position of various aircraft, and data tags that include aircraft identification, speed, altitude, and other information described in local procedures. In adverse weather conditions the tower controllers may also use surface movement radar (SMR), surface movement guidance and control systems (SMGCS) or advanced SMGCS to control traffic on the manoeuvring area (taxiways and runway).\n\nThe areas of responsibility for tower controllers fall into three general operational disciplines: local control or air control, ground control, and flight data / clearance delivery\u2014other categories, such as [[Airport ramp|Apron]] control or ground movement planner, may exist at extremely busy airports. While each tower may have unique airport-specific procedures, such as multiple teams of controllers ('crews') at major or complex airports with multiple runways, the following provides a general concept of the delegation of responsibilities within the tower environment.\n\n[[Remote and virtual tower]] (RVT) is a system based on air traffic controllers being located somewhere other than at the local airport tower and still able to provide air traffic control services. Displays for the air traffic controllers may be live video, synthetic images based on surveillance sensor data, or both.\n\n===Ground control===\n[[File:Pope Field Air Traffic Control Tower (9206250542).jpg|thumb|left|Inside [[Pope Field]] air traffic control tower]]\n\nGround control (sometimes known as ''ground movement control'') is responsible for the airport \"movement\" areas, as well as areas not released to the airlines or other users. This generally includes all taxiways, inactive runways, holding areas, and some transitional aprons or intersections where aircraft arrive, having vacated the runway or departure gate. Exact areas and control responsibilities are clearly defined in local documents and agreements at each airport. Any aircraft, vehicle, or person walking or working in these areas is required to have clearance from ground control. This is normally done via VHF/UHF radio, but there may be special cases where other procedures are used. Aircraft or vehicles without radios must respond to ATC instructions via [[aviation light signals]] or else be led by vehicles with radios. People working on the airport surface normally have a communications link through which they can communicate with ground control, commonly either by handheld radio or even [[Mobile phone|cell phone]]. Ground control is vital to the smooth operation of the airport, because this position impacts the sequencing of departure aircraft, affecting the safety and efficiency of the airport's operation.\n\nSome busier airports have surface movement radar (SMR), such as, ASDE-3, AMASS or [[ASDE-X]], designed to display aircraft and vehicles on the ground. These are used by ground control as an additional tool to control ground traffic, particularly at night or in poor visibility. There are a wide range of capabilities on these systems as they are being modernized. Older systems will display a map of the airport and the target. Newer systems include the capability to display higher quality mapping, radar target, data blocks, and safety alerts, and to interface with other systems such as digital flight strips.\n\n\n===Air control or local control===\nAir control (known to pilots as \"tower\" or \"tower control\") is responsible for the active runway surfaces. Air control clears aircraft for takeoff or landing, ensuring that prescribed runway separation will exist at all times. If the air controller detects any unsafe conditions, a landing aircraft may be instructed to \"[[go-around]]\" and be re-sequenced into the landing pattern. This re-sequencing will depend on the type of flight and may be handled by the air controller, approach or terminal area controller.\n\nWithin the tower, a highly disciplined communications process between air control and ground control is an absolute necessity. Air control must ensure that ground control is aware of any operations that will impact the taxiways, and work with the approach radar controllers to create \"gaps\" in the arrival traffic to allow taxiing traffic to cross runways and to allow departing aircraft to take off. Ground control need to keep the air controllers aware of the traffic flow towards their runways in order to maximise runway utilisation through effective approach spacing. [[Crew resource management]] (CRM) procedures are often used to ensure this communication process is efficient and clear. Within ATC, it is usually known as TRM (Team Resource Management) and the level of focus on TRM varies within different ATC organisations.\n\n===Flight data and clearance delivery===\nClearance delivery is the position that issues route clearances to aircraft, typically before they commence taxiing. These clearances contain details of the route that the aircraft is expected to fly after departure. Clearance delivery or, at busy airports, Ground Movement Planner (GMP) or Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) will, if necessary, coordinate with the relevant radar center or flow control unit to obtain releases for aircraft. At busy airports, these releases are often automatic and are controlled by local agreements allowing \"free-flow\" departures. When weather or extremely high demand for a certain airport or airspace becomes a factor, there may be ground \"stops\" (or \"slot delays\") or re-routes may be necessary to ensure the system does not get overloaded. The primary responsibility of clearance delivery is to ensure that the aircraft have the correct aerodrome information, such as weather and airport conditions, the correct route after departure and time restrictions relating to that flight. This information is also coordinated with the relevant radar center or flow control unit and ground control in order to ensure that the aircraft reaches the runway in time to meet the time restriction provided by the relevant unit. At some airports, clearance delivery also plans aircraft push-backs and engine starts, in which case it is known as the Ground Movement Planner (GMP): this position is particularly important at heavily congested airports to prevent taxiway and apron gridlock.\n\nFlight data (which is routinely combined with clearance delivery) is the position that is responsible for ensuring that both controllers and pilots have the most current information: pertinent weather changes, outages, airport ground delays/ground stops, runway closures, etc. Flight data may inform the pilots using a recorded continuous loop on a specific frequency known as the [[automatic terminal information service]] (ATIS).\n\n==Approach and terminal control==\n[[File:Potomac Consolidated TRACON.jpg|thumb|[[Potomac Consolidated TRACON]] in [[Warrenton, Virginia]], United States]]\n\nMany airports have a radar control facility that is associated with the airport. In most countries, this is referred to as ''terminal control''; in the U.S., it is referred to as a TRACON (terminal radar approach control). While every airport varies, terminal controllers usually handle traffic in a {{convert|30|to|50|nmi|km|adj=on}} radius from the airport. Where there are many busy airports close together, one consolidated terminal control center may service all the airports. The airspace boundaries and altitudes assigned to a terminal control center, which vary widely from airport to airport, are based on factors such as traffic flows, neighboring airports and terrain. A large and complex example was the [[London Terminal Control Centre]], which controlled traffic for five main London airports up to {{convert|20000|ft|m}} and out to {{convert|100|nmi|km}}.\n\nTerminal controllers are responsible for providing all ATC services within their airspace. Traffic flow is broadly divided into departures, arrivals, and overflights. As aircraft move in and out of the terminal airspace, they are handed off to the next appropriate control facility (a control tower, an en-route control facility, or a bordering terminal or approach control). Terminal control is responsible for ensuring that aircraft are at an appropriate altitude when they are handed off, and that aircraft arrive at a suitable rate for landing.\n\nNot all airports have a radar approach or terminal control available. In this case, the en-route center or a neighboring terminal or approach control may co-ordinate directly with the tower on the airport and vector inbound aircraft to a position from where they can land visually. At some of these airports, the tower may provide a non-radar [[procedural control|procedural approach]] service to arriving aircraft handed over from a radar unit before they are visual to land. Some units also have a dedicated approach unit which can provide the [[procedural control|procedural approach]] service either all the time or for any periods of radar outage for any reason.\n\nIn the U.S., TRACONs are additionally designated by a three-digit alphanumeric code. For example, the Chicago TRACON is designated C90.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACON)|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/tracon/|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==En route, center, or area control==\n{{Main|Area control center}}\n[[File:AirTraffic-8.jpg|thumb|The training department at the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, [[Leesburg, Virginia]], United States]]\n\nATC provides services to aircraft in flight between airports as well. Pilots fly under one of two sets of rules for separation: [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) or [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR). Air traffic controllers have different responsibilities to aircraft operating under the different sets of rules. While IFR flights are under positive control, in the US and Canada VFR pilots can request flight following, which provides traffic advisory services on a time permitting basis and may also provide assistance in avoiding areas of weather and flight restrictions, as well as allowing pilots into the ATC system prior to the need to a clearance into certain airspace. Across Europe, pilots may request for a \"[[Flight Information Service]]\", which is similar to flight following. In the UK it is known as a \"basic service\".\n\nEn-route air traffic controllers issue clearances and instructions for airborne aircraft, and pilots are required to comply with these instructions. En-route controllers also provide air traffic control services to many smaller airports around the country, including clearance off of the ground and clearance for approach to an airport. Controllers adhere to a set of separation standards that define the minimum distance allowed between aircraft. These distances vary depending on the equipment and procedures used in providing ATC services.\n\n===General characteristics===\nEn-route air traffic controllers work in facilities called air traffic control centers, each of which is commonly referred to as a \"center\". The United States uses the equivalent term air route traffic control center (ARTCC). Each center is responsible for many thousands of square miles of airspace (known as a [[flight information region]]) and for the airports within that airspace. Centers control IFR aircraft from the time they depart from an airport or terminal area's airspace to the time they arrive at another airport or terminal area's airspace. Centers may also \"pick up\" VFR aircraft that are already airborne and integrate them into the IFR system. These aircraft must, however, remain VFR until the center provides a clearance.\n\nCenter controllers are responsible for issuing instructions to pilots to climb their aircraft to their assigned altitude while, at the same time, ensuring that the aircraft is properly separated from all other aircraft in the immediate area. Additionally, the aircraft must be placed in a flow consistent with the aircraft's route of flight. This effort is complicated by crossing traffic, severe weather, special missions that require large airspace allocations, and traffic density. When the aircraft approaches its destination, the center is responsible for issuing instructions to pilots so that they will meet altitude restrictions by specific points, as well as providing many destination airports with a traffic flow, which prohibits all of the arrivals being \"bunched together\". These \"flow restrictions\" often begin in the middle of the route, as controllers will position aircraft landing in the same destination so that when the aircraft are close to their destination they are sequenced.\n\nAs an aircraft reaches the boundary of a center's control area it is \"handed off\" or \"handed over\" to the next [[Area Control Center]]. In some cases this \"hand-off\" process involves a transfer of identification and details between controllers so that air traffic control services can be provided in a seamless manner; in other cases local agreements may allow \"silent handovers\" such that the receiving center does not require any co-ordination if traffic is presented in an agreed manner. After the hand-off, the aircraft is given a frequency change and begins talking to the next controller. This process continues until the aircraft is handed off to a terminal controller (\"approach\").\n\n===Radar coverage===<!-- This section is linked from [[Radar]]. -->\nSince centers control a large airspace area, they will typically use long range radar that has the capability, at higher altitudes, to see aircraft within {{convert|200|nmi|km}} of the radar antenna. They may also use [[TRACON]] radar data to control when it provides a better \"picture\" of the traffic or when it can fill in a portion of the area not covered by the long range radar.\n\nIn the U.S. system, at higher altitudes, over 90% of the U.S. airspace is covered by radar and often by multiple radar systems; however, coverage may be inconsistent at lower altitudes used by unpressurized aircraft due to high terrain or distance from radar facilities. A center may require numerous radar systems to cover the airspace assigned to them, and may also rely on pilot position reports from aircraft flying below the floor of radar coverage. This results in a large amount of data being available to the controller. To address this, automation systems have been designed that consolidate the radar data for the controller. This consolidation includes eliminating duplicate radar returns, ensuring the best radar for each geographical area is providing the data, and displaying the data in an effective format.\n\n[[File:Grandballonsud.jpg|thumb|Unmanned radar on a remote mountain]]\n\nCenters also exercise control over traffic travelling over the world's ocean areas. These areas are also [[flight information region]]s (FIRs). Because there are no radar systems available for oceanic control, oceanic controllers provide ATC services using [[procedural control]]. These procedures use aircraft position reports, time, altitude, distance, and speed to ensure separation. Controllers record information on [[flight progress strip]]s and in specially developed oceanic computer systems as aircraft report positions. This process requires that aircraft be separated by greater distances, which reduces the overall capacity for any given route. See for example the [[North Atlantic Track]] system.\n\nSome air navigation service providers (e.g., Airservices Australia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, [[Nav Canada]], etc.) have implemented [[automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast]] (ADS-B) as part of their surveillance capability. This new technology reverses the radar concept. Instead of radar \"finding\" a target by interrogating the transponder, the ADS-equipped aircraft sends a position report as determined by the [[navigation]] equipment on board the aircraft. Normally, ADS operates in the \"contract\" mode where the aircraft reports a position, automatically or initiated by the pilot, based on a predetermined time interval. It is also possible for controllers to request more frequent reports to more quickly establish aircraft position for specific reasons. However, since the cost for each report is charged by the ADS service providers to the company operating the aircraft,{{dispute-inline|ADS-B|date=March 2014}} more frequent reports are not commonly requested except in emergency situations. ADS is significant because it can be used where it is not possible to locate the infrastructure for a radar system (e.g., over water). Computerized radar displays are now being designed to accept ADS inputs as part of the display. This technology is currently used in portions of the North Atlantic and the Pacific by a variety of states who share responsibility for the control of this airspace.\n\n'''Precision approach radars''' (PAR) are commonly used by military controllers of air forces of several countries, to assist the pilot in final phases of landing in places where instrument landing system and other sophisticated airborne equipment are unavailable to assist the pilots in marginal or ''near zero visibility'' conditions. This procedure is also called '''talkdowns'''.\n\nA radar archive system (RAS) keeps an electronic record of all radar information, preserving it for a few weeks. This information can be useful for search and rescue. When an aircraft has 'disappeared' from radar screens, a controller can review the last radar returns from the aircraft to determine its likely position. For example, see this crash report.<ref>{{cite web |title=crash report |url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/aviation/1996/a96a0207/a96a0207.asp |publisher=tsb.gc.ca |access-date=August 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307102104/http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/aviation/1996/a96a0207/a96a0207.asp |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }} retrieved on August 21, 2010</ref> RAS is also useful to technicians who are maintaining radar systems.\n\n===Flight traffic mapping===\nThe [[Flight traffic mapping|mapping of flights]] in real-time is based on the air traffic control system. In 1991, data on the location of aircraft was made available by the Federal Aviation Administration to the airline industry. The [[National Business Aviation Association]] (NBAA), the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots  Association, the Helicopter Association International, and the National Air Transportation Association petitioned the FAA to make [[ASDI]] information available on a \"need-to-know\" basis.  Subsequently, [[National Business Aviation Association|NBAA]] advocated the broad-scale dissemination of air traffic data. The Aircraft Situational Display to Industry ([[ASDI]]) system now conveys up-to-date flight information to the airline industry and the public. Some companies that distribute [[ASDI]] information are FlightExplorer, FlightView, and FlyteComm. Each company maintains a website that provides free updated information to the public on flight status. Stand-alone programs are also available for displaying the geographic location of airborne [[Instrument flight rules|IFR]] (instrument flight rules) air traffic anywhere in the FAA air traffic system. Positions are reported for both commercial and general aviation traffic. The programs can overlay air traffic with a wide selection of maps such as, geo-political boundaries, air traffic control center boundaries, high altitude jet routes, satellite cloud and radar imagery.\n\n==Problems==\n\n===Traffic===\n:''For more information see [[Air traffic flow management]]''.\n\n[[File:Air traffic heathrow.JPG|thumb|Intersecting [[contrail]]s of aircraft over London, an area of high air traffic]]\n\nThe day-to-day problems faced by the air traffic control system are primarily related to the volume of air traffic demand placed on the system and weather. Several factors dictate the amount of traffic that can land at an airport in a given amount of time. Each landing aircraft must touch down, slow, and exit the [[runway]] before the next crosses the approach end of the runway. This process requires at least one and up to four minutes for each aircraft. Allowing for departures between arrivals, each runway can thus handle about 30 arrivals per hour. A large airport with two arrival runways can handle about 60 arrivals per hour in good weather. Problems begin when airlines schedule more arrivals into an airport than can be physically handled, or when delays elsewhere cause groups of aircraft \u2013 that would otherwise be separated in time \u2013 to arrive simultaneously. Aircraft must then be delayed in the air by [[holding (aviation)|holding]] over specified locations until they may be safely sequenced to the runway. Up until the 1990s, holding, which has significant environmental and cost implications, was a routine occurrence at many airports. Advances in computers now allow the sequencing of planes hours in advance. Thus, planes may be delayed before they even take off (by being given a \"slot\"), or may reduce speed in flight and proceed more slowly thus significantly reducing the amount of holding.\n\nAir traffic control errors occur when the separation (either vertical or horizontal) between airborne aircraft falls below the minimum prescribed separation set (for the domestic United States) by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Separation minimums for terminal control areas (TCAs) around airports are lower than en-route standards. Errors generally occur during periods following times of intense activity, when controllers tend to relax and overlook the presence of traffic and conditions that lead to loss of minimum separation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Effects of Sector Complexity and Controller Experience on Probability of Operational Errors in Air Route Traffic Control Centers |author1=Breitler, Alan  |author2=Kirk, Kevin |date=September 1996 |publisher =Center for Naval Analyses Document (IPR 95-0092)|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->&#123;&#123;inconsistent citations&#125;&#125; }}</ref>\n\n===Weather===\n[[File: PSX 20150807 202515.jpg|thumb|Airplane taking off from [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] with the ATC tower in the background]]\n\nBeyond runway capacity issues, the weather is a major factor in traffic capacity. Rain, [[ice]], snow or [[hail]] on the runway cause landing aircraft to take longer to slow and exit, thus reducing the safe arrival rate and requiring more space between landing aircraft. [[Fog]] also requires a decrease in the landing rate. These, in turn, increase airborne delay for holding aircraft. If more aircraft are scheduled than can be safely and efficiently held in the air, a ground delay program may be established, delaying aircraft on the ground before departure due to conditions at the arrival airport.\n\nIn Area Control Centers, a major weather problem is [[thunderstorms]], which present a variety of hazards to aircraft. Aircraft will deviate around storms, reducing the capacity of the en-route system by requiring more space per aircraft or causing congestion as many aircraft try to move through a single hole in a line of thunderstorms. Occasionally weather considerations cause delays to aircraft prior to their departure as routes are closed by thunderstorms.\n\nMuch money has been spent on creating software to streamline this process. However, at some ACCs, air traffic controllers still record data for each flight on strips of paper and personally coordinate their paths. In newer sites, these [[flight progress strip]]s have been replaced by electronic data presented on computer screens. As new equipment is brought in, more and more sites are upgrading away from paper flight strips.\n\n=== Congestion ===\nConstrained control capacity and growing traffic lead to [[flight cancellation and delay]]s:<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* in America, delays caused by ATC grew by 69% between 2012 and 2017,<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* in China, the average delay per domestic flight spiked by 50% in 2017 to 15 minutes per flight,<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* in Europe, en route delays grew by 105% in 2018, due to a lack of capacity or staff (60%), weather (25%) or strikes (14%), costing the European economy \u20ac17.6bn ($20.8bn), up by 28% on 2017.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nBy then the market for air-traffic services was worth $14bn.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nMore efficient ATC could save 5-10% of aviation fuel by avoiding [[holding pattern]]s and indirect [[Airway (aviation)|airway]]s.<ref name=Economist15jun2019/>\n\n<!--military-->\nThe military takes 80% of Chinese air space, congesting the thin corridors open to airliners.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nBritain is closing military air space only during air-force exercises.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nBritain and France want to retain sovereignty over their skies.<ref name=Economist15jun2019/>\n\n==Callsigns==\nA prerequisite to safe air traffic separation is the assignment and use of distinctive [[callsign|call signs]]. These are permanently allocated by [[ICAO]] on request usually to [[scheduled air transport|scheduled flights]] and some air forces and other military services for [[military aviation|military flights]]. There are written callsigns with a 3-letter combination like KLM, BAW, VLG followed by the flight number, like AAL872, VLG1011. As such they appear on flight plans and ATC radar labels. There are also the ''audio'' or ''Radiotelephony'' callsigns used on the radio contact between pilots and air traffic control. These are not always identical to their written counterparts. An example of an audio callsign would be \"Speedbird 832\", instead of the written \"BAW832\". This is used to reduce the chance of confusion between ATC and the aircraft. By default, the callsign for any other flight is the [[Aircraft registration|registration number]] (tail number) of the aircraft, such as \"N12345\", \"C-GABC\" or \"EC-IZD\". The short ''Radiotelephony'' callsigns for these tail numbers is the last 3 letters using the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] (i.e. ABC spoken ''alpha-bravo-charlie'' for C-GABC) or the last 3 numbers (i.e. ''three-four-five'' for N12345). In the United States, the prefix may be an aircraft type, model or manufacturer in place of the first registration character, for example, \"N11842\" could become \"Cessna 842\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atccommunication.com/what-is-an-abbreviated-aircraft-call-sign|title=What is an Abbreviated Aircraft Call Sign?*|work=ATC Communication|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> This abbreviation is only allowed after communications have been established in each sector.\n\nBefore around 1980 [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) and [[ICAO]] were using the same 2-letter callsigns. Due to the larger number of new airlines after deregulation, [[ICAO]] established the 3-letter callsigns as mentioned above. The [[IATA]] callsigns are currently used in aerodromes on the announcement tables but never used any longer in air traffic control. For example, AA is the [[IATA]] callsign for [[American Airlines]] \u2013 ATC equivalent AAL. Other examples include LY/ELY for [[El Al]], DL/DAL for [[Delta Air Lines]], VY/VLG for [[Vueling Airlines]], JL/JAL for [[Japan Airlines]], NH/ANA for [[All Nippon Airways]], etc. Flight numbers in regular commercial flights are designated by the aircraft operator and identical callsign might be used for the same scheduled journey each day it is operated, even if the departure time varies a little across different days of the week. The callsign of the return flight often differs only by the final digit from the outbound flight. Generally, airline flight numbers are even if eastbound, and odd if westbound. In order to reduce the possibility of two callsigns on one frequency at any time sounding too similar, a number of airlines, particularly in Europe, have started using [[alphanumeric]] callsigns that are not based on flight numbers (i.e. DLH23LG, spoken as [[Lufthansa]]-two-three-lima-golf, to prevent confusion between incoming DLH23 and outgoing DLH24 in the same frequency). Additionally, it is the right of the air traffic controller to change the 'audio' callsign for the period the flight is in his sector if there is a risk of confusion, usually choosing the tail number instead.\n\n==Technology==\nMost ATC still rely on WWII technologies:<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* [[radar]] localisation though [[satellite navigation]] is cheaper and more accurate,<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* [[Two-way radio]] communication instead of [[Controller\u2013pilot data link communications]] like at the MUAC,<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n* in America, controllers hand each other paper [[flight progress strip]]s.<ref name=Economist15jun2019/>\n\nMany technologies are used in air traffic control systems. Primary and secondary [[radar]] are used to enhance a controller's [[situation awareness]] within his assigned airspace \u2013 all types of aircraft send back primary echoes of varying sizes to controllers' screens as radar energy is bounced off their skins, and [[transponder]]-equipped aircraft reply to secondary radar interrogations by giving an ID (Mode A), an altitude (Mode C) and/or a unique callsign (Mode S). Certain types of weather may also register on the radar screen.\n\nThese inputs, added to data from other radars, are correlated to build the air situation. Some basic processing occurs on the radar tracks, such as calculating ground speed and magnetic headings.\n\nUsually, a flight data processing system manages all the [[flight plan]] related data, incorporating \u2013 in a low or high degree \u2013 the information of the track once the correlation between them (flight plan and track) is established. All this information is distributed to modern [[operational display system]]s, making it available to controllers.\n\nThe [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] has spent over US$3&nbsp;billion on software, but a fully automated system is still over the horizon. In 2002 the UK brought a new area control centre into service at the [[London Area Control Centre]], Swanwick, [[Hampshire]], relieving a busy suburban centre at [[West Drayton]], Middlesex, north of [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Software from [[Lockheed-Martin]] predominates at the London Area Control Centre. However, the centre was initially troubled by software and communications problems causing delays and occasional shutdowns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Air Traffic Control|url=https://sites.google.com/site/zagorakis1977/theory/air-traffic-control/technology|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome tools are available in different domains to help the controller further:\n* Flight data processing systems: this is the system (usually one per center) that processes all the information related to the flight (the flight plan), typically in the time horizon from gate to gate (airport departure/arrival gates). It uses such processed information to invoke other flight plan related tools (such as e.g. MTCD), and distributes such processed information to all the stakeholders (air traffic controllers, collateral centers, airports, etc.).\n* [[Short-term conflict alert]] (STCA) that checks possible conflicting trajectories in a time horizon of about 2 or 3 minutes (or even less in approach context \u2013 35 seconds in the French Roissy & Orly approach centres<ref>{{cite web|title=Le filet de sauvegarde resserre ses mailles|url=http://www.dgac.fr/html/publicat/av_civil/them_1/them_1_34_35.pdf|website=dgac.fr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327181434/http://www.dgac.fr/html/publicat/av_civil/them_1/them_1_34_35.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009|language=French}}</ref>) and alerts the controller prior to the loss of separation. The algorithms used may also provide in some systems a possible vectoring solution, that is, the manner in which to turn, descend, increase/decrease speed, or climb the aircraft in order to avoid infringing the minimum safety distance or altitude clearance.\n* [[Minimum safe altitude warning]] (MSAW): a tool that alerts the controller if an aircraft appears to be flying too low to the ground or will impact terrain based on its current altitude and heading.\n*System coordination (SYSCO) to enable controller to negotiate the release of flights from one sector to another.\n*Area penetration warning (APW) to inform a controller that a flight will penetrate a restricted area.\n*Arrival and departure manager to help sequence the takeoff and landing of aircraft.\n**The [[DMAN|departure manager (DMAN)]]: A system aid for the ATC at airports, that calculates a planned departure flow with the goal to maintain an optimal throughput at the runway, reduce queuing at holding point and distribute the information to various stakeholders at the airport (i.e. the airline, ground handling and air traffic control (ATC)).\n**The arrival manager (AMAN): A system aid for the ATC at airports, that calculates a planned arrival flow with the goal to maintain an optimal throughput at the runway, reduce arrival queuing and distribute the information to various stakeholders.\n** Passive final approach spacing tool (pFAST), a CTAS tool, provides runway assignment and sequence number advisories to terminal controllers to improve the arrival rate at congested airports. pFAST was deployed and operational at five US TRACONs before being cancelled. NASA research included an active FAST capability that also provided vector and speed advisories to implement the runway and sequence advisories.\n*Converging runway display aid (CRDA) enables approach controllers to run two final approaches that intersect and make sure that go arounds are minimized.\n*Center TRACON automation system (CTAS) is a suite of human centered decision support tools developed by NASA Ames Research Center. Several of the CTAS tools have been field tested and transitioned to the FAA for operational evaluation and use. Some of the CTAS tools are: traffic management advisor (TMA), passive final approach spacing tool (pFAST), collaborative arrival planning (CAP), direct-to (D2), en route descent advisor (EDA) and multi-center TMA. The software is running on Linux.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix02/tech/techthurs.html |title=Technical Sessions |publisher=usenix.org |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref>\n* Traffic management advisor (TMA), a CTAS tool, is an en route decision support tool that automates time based metering solutions to provide an upper limit of aircraft to a TRACON from the center over a set period of time. Schedules are determined that will not exceed the specified arrival rate and controllers use the scheduled times to provide the appropriate delay to arrivals while in the en route domain. This results in an overall reduction in en route delays and also moves the delays to more efficient airspace (higher altitudes) than occur if holding near the TRACON boundary, which is required in order to prevent overloading the TRACON controllers. TMA is operational at most en route air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs) and continues to be enhanced to address more complex traffic situations (e.g. adjacent center metering (ACM) and en route departure capability (EDC))\n* MTCD & URET\n**In the US, user request evaluation tool (URET) takes paper strips out of the equation for en route controllers at ARTCCs by providing a display that shows all aircraft that are either in or currently routed into the sector.\n**In Europe, several MTCD tools are available: iFACTS ([[National Air Traffic Services|NATS]]), VAFORIT ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|DFS]]), new FDPS ([[Eurocontrol#Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre|MUAC]]).

It is especially useful in areas where difficult-to-use [[High Frequency|HF]] radiotelephony was previously used for communication with aircraft, e.g. oceans. This is currently in use in various parts of the world including the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n*[[ADS-B]]: automatic dependent surveillance broadcast \u2013 provides a data downlink of various flight parameters to air traffic control systems via the transponder (1090&nbsp;MHz) and reception of those data by other aircraft in the vicinity. The most important is the aircraft's latitude, longitude and level: such data can be utilized to create a radar-like display of aircraft for controllers and thus allows a form of pseudo-radar control to be done in areas where the installation of radar is either prohibitive on the grounds of low traffic levels, or technically not feasible (e.g. oceans). This is currently in use in Australia, Canada and parts of the Pacific Ocean and Alaska.\n*[[Flight progress strip#Digital Flight Progress Strips .2F Electronic Flight Progress Strip (EFPS)|The electronic flight strip system (e-strip)]]:\n\n[[File:TATIC Electronic Flight Strip system at Sao Paulo Itnl.jpg|thumb|Electronic flight progress strip system at S\u00e3o Paulo Intl. control tower \u2013 ground control]]\n\nA system of electronic flight strips replacing the old paper strips is being used by several service providers, such as Nav Canada, MASUAC, DFS, DECEA.

The first is to have the ATC services be part of a government agency as is currently the case in the United States. The problem with this model is that funding can be inconsistent and can disrupt the development and operation of services. Sometimes funding can disappear when lawmakers cannot approve budgets in time. Both proponents and opponents of privatization recognize that stable funding is one of the major factors for successful upgrades of ATC infrastructure. Some of the funding issues include sequestration and politicization of projects.<ref>{{cite web|author1=American Federation of Government Employees|display-authors=et al|url=https://www.passmember.org/images/congressional_letters/FAA%20Labor%20Unions%20Oppose%20ATC%20Privatization.pdf|title=FAA Labor Unions Oppose ATC Privatization|website=Professional Aviation Safety Specialists|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Proponents argue that moving ATC services to a private corporation could stabilize funding over the long term which will result in more predictable planning and rollout of new technology as well as training of personnel.\n\nAnother model is to have ATC services provided by a government corporation. This model is used in Germany, where funding is obtained through user fees. Yet another model is to have a for-profit corporation operate ATC services. This is the model used in the United Kingdom, but there have been several issues with the system there including a large-scale failure in December 2014 which caused delays and cancellations and has been attributed to cost-cutting measures put in place by this corporation. In fact, earlier that year, the corporation owned by the German government won the bid to provide ATC services for Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom. The last model, which is often the suggested model for the United States to transition to is to have a non-profit organization that would handle ATC services as is used in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rinaldi|first1=Paul|title=Safety and Efficiency Must Remain the Main Mission|journal=The Journal of Air Traffic Control|date=2015|volume=57|issue=2|pages=21\u201323}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian system is the one most often used as a model by proponents of privatization. Air traffic control privatization has been successful in Canada with the creation of Nav Canada, a private nonprofit organization which has reduced costs and has allowed new technologies to be deployed faster due to the elimination of much of the bureaucratic red tape. This has resulted in shorter flights and less fuel usage. It has also resulted in flights being safer due to new technology. Nav Canada is funded from fees that are collected from the airlines based on the weight of the aircraft and the distance flown.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crichton|first1=John|title=The NAV CANADA Model|journal=The Journal of Air Traffic Control|date=2015|volume=57|issue=2|pages=33\u201335}}</ref>\n\n<!--privatisation-->\nATC is still run by national governments with few exceptions: in the European Union, only Britain and Italy have private shareholders.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\n[[Nav Canada]] is an independent company allowed to borrow and can invest to boost productivity and in 2017 its cost were a third less than in America where the FAA is exposed to budget cuts and cannot borrow.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nPrivatisation does not guarantee lower prices: the profit margin of MUAC was 70% in 2017, as there is no competition, but governments could offer fixed terms [[Concession (contract)|concession]]s.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nAustralia, Fiji and New Zealand run the upper-air space for the Pacific islands' governments, like Hungary for Kosovo since 2014.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nHungaroControl offers [[Remote and virtual tower|remote airport tower]] services from Budapest.<!--ref name=Economist15jun2019-->\nIn America, ATC could be split from the FAA into a separate entity, supported by airlines, airports and controller unions but was opposed by the [[business aviation]] as their free ATC service would become paid.<ref name=Economist15jun2019/>\n\n==ATC regulations in the United States==\n[[FAA]] [[control tower operator]]s (CTO) / [[air traffic controller]]s use [[FAA Order 7110.65]] as the authority for all procedures regarding air traffic.
