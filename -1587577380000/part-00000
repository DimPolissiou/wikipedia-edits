Arunkumar. Production began in September 2018, and the film released worldwide on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with the psycho beheading a woman. Gautham ([[Udhayanidhi Stalin]]), a blind musician, is in love with a radio jockey named Dahini ([[Aditi Rao Hydari]]). After multiple attempts by Gautham, Dahini asks him to meet her at a place that she will be talking about in her radio session. Gautham listens to the radio all day and manages to find the place, which is a train railway station. Dahini, hopefully waiting for him, sees the psycho-killer all of a sudden. She feels afraid and tries to escape, but the psycho manages to sedate her. \n\nGautham reaches the place in time but fails to save her due to his blindness. However, using his sense of smell, he realizes that something is wrong. The psycho later spares Gautham's life and takes Dahini to his secret lair. The next day, the police goes to Gautham and extracts information from him. A total of 14 girls were abducted, 13 of whom got murdered, and the recently kidnapped Dahini. Gautham soon realizes that the police cannot find anything, and he decides to seek out and save Dahini on his own terms. The psycho is about to behead Dahini, but he notices that there is no sense of fear in her. He asks her for the reason, to which she replies that Gautham will find her within a week regardless of her death and that the psycho will be answering for his crimes soon. The psycho leaves her chained to a wall and accepts that as a challenge. Gautham uses various methods to find the killer with the help of Kamala ([[Nithya Menen]]), a handicapped ex-police officer who was previously dealing with the case. Together, they both deduce that the psycho must be a rich man who owns pig farms using the smell from the decayed bodies of the murdered girls. Realizing that Gautham is getting closer to him, the psycho goes on a killing spree. Gautham, Kamala and their associates all visit and enquire the owners of pig farms in the area, but they have failed in their attempts. Depressed, Gautham goes to his house and stays there alone. The psycho visits him, and Gautham acknowledges his presence. However, Gautham's friend Rajanayakam ([[Singampuli]]) defends him and tries to chase down the psycho in his car. \n\nUnfortuntely, the psycho hides himself in a dense area of tall grass and finally manages to kill Rajanayakam. The next day, Gautham mourns over the death of his friend and plans to drop his plan due to a large number of people's deaths. Later, Kamala reveals that she had prior notice that the killer had gone to a college function. With regained hope, they all go back to the college and look at the recordings during that day. They manage to find someone suspicious, but his face got blurred. However, they notice a college staff sitting beside him. \n\nUsing relevant information from him, they manage to find the killer. In the meantime, Dahini manages to go around the psycho's lair and sees a jailed woman and a dead police corpse. She reveals to her that the psycho was her former student at an orphanage and the psycho used to masturbate, so she used to beat him 60 times everyday, for all 365 days in a year for his mistake. Around 11:45 PM, Gautham reaches the psycho's lair. The psycho is about to behead Dahini, the intruder alarms gets activated. The enraged psycho runs to kill Gautham, but eventually, Gautham manages to cuff the psycho's leg. Gautham later runs and rescues Dahini. They both manage to run away.\n\nHowever, the psycho begs out, \"Teacher, please don't leave me alone here\". Dahini, who sees the light in him, places the keys to the cuff a few metres in front of him. Later, they both escape together with Kamala. The psycho is about to take the key, but the imprisoned teacher takes the key and swallows it, trying to punish him. The psycho gets infuriated and tears her stomach to get the key. He later releases himself and runs to find them both. Fortunately, they both leave, and he screams as he failed.\n\nLater on, it is evident that Dahini has been affected by the [[Stockholm Syndrome]], as she sympathizes with the psychopath when questioned by the press and refuses to consider him a killer but understands his innocent heart filled with pain and if it was his mother or sister, she would have cared for him so that he would not have become the killer that he was. The psycho sees the interview and realizes his mistakes after finally feeling loved by someone. The movie ends of with the psycho falling off a cliff with a smile on his face with the song ''Thai Madiyil'' (Mother's Lap).\n\nAccording to Mysskin, the film is inspired from a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tale on [[A\u1e45gulim\u0101la]], an important figure in the religion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mysskin's Psycho based on Buddhist tale of Angulimala.

It typically has a range of six and a half octaves (47 strings), weighs about {{convert|80|lb|kg|order=flip}}, is about {{convert|1.85|m|ftin}} high, has a depth of {{convert|1|m|ftin}}, and is {{convert|55|cm|ftin}} wide at the bass end of the soundboard. The notes range from the C{{music|b}} three octaves below [[middle C]] to three and a half octaves above, usually ending on G{{music|b}}. Using [[Scientific pitch notation|octave designations]], the range is C{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> to G{{music|b}}<sub>7</sub>. At least one manufacturer{{which|date=January 2017}} gives the harp a 48th string, a high A{{music|b}} (A{{music|b}}<sub>7</sub>) giving the instrument a range of C{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> to A{{music|#}}<sub>7</sub>.\n\nThe role of the pedals in this type of harp is to alter the pitch of the strings, so that - unlike early kinds of harp - the pedal harp can easily play works written in any [[key (music)|key]]. This is particularly important in the harmonically complex music of the [[Romantic (music)|Romantic]] period and later 20th-century classical music. Nonetheless, the two lowest strings, C{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> and D{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub>, are not affected by the pedal mechanism (i.e. their tuning is not affected by the position of, respectively, the C and D pedals). They must be tuned manually in advance for the whole piece (or section of a piece).\n\n==Parts==\n\n===Body and strings===\nA pedal harp typically has a range of six and a half octaves (46 or 47 strings), weighs about {{convert|80|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}, is about {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, has a depth of {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and is {{convert|21+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide at the bass end of the soundboard. The notes range from three octaves below middle C to three and a half octaves above, usually ending on G. The tension of the strings on the soundboard is roughly equal to a ton (10 [[kilonewton]]s). The lowest strings are made of copper or steel-wound nylon, the middle-lower of gut, and the middle to highest of nylon, or more or all gut.\n\nThe pedal harp is identifiable as a large instrument with a straight pillar for support sometimes adorned with a crown at the top; a soundboard, which is pear-shaped with an extended width at the bottom in most harps, while some older pedal harps have soundboards that are straight-sided though widening toward the bottom; a mechanical action made up of over 1,400 parts attached to a harmonically curved neck; and a base with seven pedals that are arranged in the following: D, C, B (left) and E, F, G, A (right). The D, E, G, A, and B strings are normally colored white while the C strings are colored red and the F strings either black or blue. The strings are tuned to all flat pitches: the scale of [[C flat major|C{{music|flat}} major]]. C {{music|flat}} major is [[enharmonic equivalence|the same]] as B major, and for most instruments B major is a far more common key to use as it has five sharps rather than seven flats. However, for convenience, harp parts are notated in C {{music|flat}} rather than B, even when other instruments are written in B.\n[[File:ErardHarp2.jpg|thumb|[[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard]] harp mechanism]]\n\n===Pedals===\n[[Image:Harp pedals bigger.jpg|thumb|left|Pedals of a harp]]\n\n[[File:Harp pedal.svg|thumb|left|The action of the wheels in the pedal system to change the pitch of a string. The tip of a string is shown in blue, points in contact with the string are shown in red, and points not in contact with the string are in green.]]\n\nPedals were first used in 1697.<ref name=celt>{{cite web|url=http://www.alisonvardy.com/harp-info/celtic-harp-history.htm |title=Celtic harp history|first=Alison|last=Vardy}}</ref> Pedal harps use the mechanical action of pedals to change the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] of the strings. The seven pedals each affect the tuning of all strings of one [[pitch-class]]. The pedals, from left to right, are D, C, B on the left side and E, F, G, A on the right. Each pedal attaches to a rod or cable in the column of the harp, which connects to a mechanism in the neck. When the player presses a pedal, small discs at the top of the harp rotate. The discs are studded with two pegs that pinch the string as they turn, shortening its vibrating length. \n\nEach pedal has three positions. In the top position, no pegs touch the string and all notes are [[Flat (music)|flat]]. In the middle position, the top disc pins press against the string, resulting in a [[Natural (music)|natural]], giving the scale of [[C major|C{{music|natural}} major]] if all pedals are in the middle position. In the bottom position, the second, lower disc turns, shortening the string again to create a [[Sharp (music)|sharp]], giving the scale of [[C-sharp major|C{{music|sharp}} major]] if all pedals are in the bottom position.\n\nMany other scales, diatonic and synthetic, can be obtained by combining the pedals. It is also possible to play many chords in traditional harmony by adjusting pedals so some notes are [[enharmonic]]. This is central to pedal harp technique. In each position the pedal can be secured in a notch so the foot does not have to continuously hold it in position (unlike piano pedals).\n\nThree strings have no pedal tuning mechanism: the lowest  C and D and the highest G.<ref>Inglefield and Neill (1985), 3.  A few modern harps have a pedal mechanism for the high G string.</ref>  These strings are normally tuned to C{{music|natural}}, D{{music|natural}}, and G{{music|natural}} respectively.  However, they can also be tuned sharp or flat prior to performance.  This can be indicated by verbal statements at the beginning of a composition, for example, \"Tune low C to C{{music|flat}}\", or \"If necessary, tune high G to G{{music|sharp}}\".<ref>Inglefield and Neill (1985), 'Scordatura', p.49.</ref>\n\nPedal harps are essentially diatonic instruments with the double-action pedal mechanism providing chromatic alterations and key changes. No matter how the pedals are set, the pedal harp still has only seven strings per octave. Smaller harps, often called folk, lever or Celtic harps, are equally diatonic, with seven strings per octave, and use a mechanical lever on each string that the player must move manually for chromatic alterations.  The only completely chromatic harps are the double (arpa doppia) and triple (Welsh) harps and [[cross-strung harp]].\n\nThe pedal mechanism is called the ''double-action pedal system'', first patented in London by [[Sebastien Erard]] in 1801 (patent number 2502) and 1802 (patent number 2595). In 1807 Charles Groll was the first to register a patent (patent number 3059) where the harp mechanism was doubled with two lines of fourchettes (forks). Earlier pedal harps had a single-action mechanism that provided only sharped notes, the first of which was made in [[1720 in science|1720]] by [[Jacob Hochbrucker]] in Bavaria.<ref name=celt/>\n\n==Technique==\n[[File:Harpist Elaine Christy at Unitarian Church 2.jpg|thumb|right|Harpist [[Elaine Christy]] plays with both hands approaching the strings from either side of the harp; foot pedals (not shown) can change the pitch of specific strings by a half step.]]\nThe pedal harp is played with the fingertips of the first four fingers (thumb, index, middle and ring fingers). The little fingers are not used because they are too short and cannot reach the correct position without distorting the position of the other fingers (although on some folk harps with light tension and closely spaced strings they may occasionally be used).  The fifth finger may also have been used on earlier, more lightly strung modern harps. [[Madame de Genlis]], for example, in her ''M\u00e9thode'', published in Paris in the early 19th century, promotes the use of all fingers,<ref>Rensch (2007/1989), 164\u2013165.</ref> while Roslyn Rensch suggests that Mlle de Gu\u00eenes, the harpist for whom [[Mozart]] wrote his [[Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra (Mozart)|Concerto for Flute and Harp]], might occasionally have used all five fingers when playing the harp.<ref>Rensch (2007./1989), 170.</ref> In more modern music, the little finger is used very rarely, for example in simultaneous cluster chords, such as in Daniel Kessner's ''Sonatina''.<ref>Inglewood and Neill (1985), 77.</ref> The fingertips are drawn in to meet the palm, thus releasing the string from whatever pressure was placed upon it by the fingers. The fingers are naturally curved or rounded as they touch it, and the thumb is gently curved as the tip rises to it as an arc from its base.\n\nPlucking with varying degrees of force creates [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness). Different types of plucking can also create different tones and sounds. Depending on finger position, different tones can be produced: a full sound in the middle of the string and a nasal, guitar-like sound at the very bottom. Tone is also affected by the skin of the harpist, how much oil and moisture it contains, and the amount of thickening by callus formation and its surface texture.\n\nThere are differing schools of technique for playing the pedal harp. The largest are the various French schools. There are specific Russian, Viennese, and other schools across Europe. One is the Attl technique, after Kajetan Attl, in which apparently only the uppermost parts of the fingers move and the hand is largely still. There is a St. Petersburg school (more than one) in Russia in which the player moves the thumbs in a circular fashion rather than in and out toward the hand.\n\nThe differences between the French schools lie in the posture of the arms, shape of the hand, and musical aesthetics. The traditional French schooling lets the player lightly rest the right arm against the harp, using the wrist to sometimes bring the hand only away from the string. The left arm moves more freely. Finger technique and control are the emphasis of the technical approach, with extensive use of exercises and etudes to develop this. Two very influential 20th-century teachers of this approach were [[Henriette Reni\u00e9]] and [[Marcel Grandjany]], who studied with [[Alphonse Hasselmans]]. The other major French school is the Salzedo school, developed by [[Carlos Salzedo]], who also studied with [[Alphonse Hasselmans]] at the Paris Conservatoire. Salzedo's technique generally calls for the arms to be held horizontally<ref>Lawrence and Salzedo (1929), 6.</ref> and emphasises the role of aesthetic hand and arm gestures after the string has been plucked: \"Each of the thirty-seven tone colors and effects of the harp calls for a gesture corresponding to its sonorous meaning.\"<ref>Lawrence and Salzedo (1929), 17.</ref>\n\n==Orchestral role==\nThe harp found its early orchestral use as a solo instrument in concerti by many baroque and classical composers (Handel, Mozart, Boieldieu, Albrechtsberger, Schenk, Dussek, Spohr) and in the opera houses of London, Paris and Berlin and most other capitals. Hector Berlioz began to use it in symphonic music, but he found performances frustrating in countries such as Germany, which had few harps or sufficiently proficient harpists. Franz Liszt was seminal using the harp in his orchestral music. The French and Russian Romantic composers particularly expanded its symphonic use. In opera, the Italian composers used it regularly, and Puccini was a particular master of its expressive and coloristic use. Debussy can be said to have put the harp on the map in his many works that use one or more harps. Tchaikovsky also was of great influence, followed by Rimsky-Korsakov, Richard Strauss and Wagner. The greatest influence on use of the harp has always been the availability of fine harps and skilled players, and the great increase of them in the US of the 20th century resulted in its spread into popular music.\n\n==Jazz==\nThe first harpist known to play jazz was [[Casper Reardon]], a pioneer in the world of \"hot\" music. [[Dorothy Ashby]] (sampled by hip-hop artists) and [[Alice Coltrane]] are other jazz harpists.[[File:Harpist performing.jpg|thumb|Harpist performing]]\n\n==Ballet==\nMany passages for solo harp can be found in 19th-century ballet music, particularly in scores for the ballets staged for the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] of [[St. Petersburg]], where the harpist [[Albert Zabel]] played in the orchestra. In ballet, the harp was utilised to a great extent to embellish the dancing of the [[ballerina]]. Elaborate cadenzas were composed by [[Tchaikovsky]] for his ballets ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]''; as well as [[Alexander Glazunov]] for his score for the ballet ''[[Raymonda]]''. In particular, the scores of [[Riccardo Drigo]] contained many pieces for harp in such works as ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|Le Talisman]]'' (1889), ''[[Le R\u00e9veil de Flore]]'' (1894) and ''[[Harlequinade (ballet)|Les Millions d'Arlequin]]'' (1900).\n\n[[Cesare Pugni]] wrote extensively for the harp as well\u2014his ballet ''[[\u00c9oline, ou La Dryade]]'' included music written for harp to accompany the ballerina's numerous variations and enhance the atmosphere of the ballet's many fantastical scenes. [[Ludwig Minkus]] was celebrated for his harp cadenzas, most notably the ''Variation de la Reine du jour'' from his ballet ''La Nuit et le Jour'' (1881), the elaborate ''[[entr'acte]]'' composed for Albert Zabel from his ballet ''Roxana'' (1878), and numerous passages found in his score for the ballet ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'', which in some passages were used to represent a [[veena]], which was used on stage as a prop. French ballet composers such as Delibes, Gounod, and Massenet made use of the harp in their music.\n\n==Pop music==\nThere is a prominent harp part in \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\" by [[The Beatles]] in their 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s, harp parts were common in popular music, and can be heard in such hits as [[Cher]]'s \"[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]\" and \"[[Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves]]\", as well as \"[[Boogie Nights (song)|Boogie Nights]]\" by [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]. Most often it was played by Los Angeles studio harpist [[Gayle Levant]], who has played on hundreds of recordings. Irish band [[Clannad]] featured the harp heavily in their music during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nIn current pop music, the harp appears relatively rarely. [[Joanna Newsom]], [[Dee Carstensen]], [[Darian Scatton]], [[Habiba Doorenbos]], and [[Jessa Callen]] of [[Callen Sisters|The Callen Sisters]] have separately established images as harp-playing singer-songwriters with signature harp and vocal sounds. Canadian singer-songwriter [[Sarah McLachlan]] plays the harp in her 2006 holiday album, [[Wintersong]]. In Hong Kong, a notable example of harp in pop music is the song \"[[Tian Shui Walled City]]\" ({{zh|t=\u5929\u6c34\u570d\u57ce|labels=no}}) performed by [[Hacken Lee]] with harp played by Korean harpist [[Jung Kwak]] (Harpist K).\n\nThe harp is also used as a central instrument by many [[Alternative music|alternative]] popular musicians. A pedal harpist, [[Ricky Rasura]], is a member of the \"symphonic pop\" band, [[The Polyphonic Spree]]. Also, [[Bj\u00f6rk]] sometimes features acoustic and electric harp in her work, often played by [[Zeena Parkins]]. Philadelphia based Indie Pop Band [[Br'er]] uses a pedal harp as the foundation for their cinematic live sets. [[Art in America (band)|Art in America]] was the first known rock band featuring a pedal harp to appear on a major record label, released in 1983. The pedal harp was also present in the [[Michael Kamen]] and [[Metallica]] concert and album, [[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]], as part of the [[San Francisco Symphony]] orchestra. R&B singer [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]] featured harpist [[Gloria Agostini]] in 1997 on his cover of [[Kate Bush]]'s \"This Woman's Work\". On his 7th solo album [[Finding Forever]], [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] artist [[Common (rapper)|Common]] features harpist [[Brandee Younger]] on the introductory track, followed by a [[Dorothy Ashby]] [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from her 1969 recording of \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\".\n\nSome Celtic-pop crossover bands and artists such as [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and [[Loreena McKennitt]] include folk harps, following [[Alan Stivell]]'s work. Additionally [[Florence Welch]] of [[Florence and the Machine]] uses the harp frequently in both [[Lungs (album)|Lungs]] and [[Ceremonials (album)|Ceremonials]], notably on \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\". [[The Webb Sisters]] from UK use different size harps in almost all their material during live performances. Sierra Casady, of the [[freak-folk]] group [[CocoRosie]] plays harp on several of their songs. Another musician from the UK [[Patrick Wolf]] has used the [[Celtic harp]] throughout his career, often playing it himself while singing.\n\n==Electroacoustic harps==\n[[Lyon and Healy]], [[Camac Harps]], [[Salvi Harps]], and other manufacturers also make electroacoustic pedal harps.<ref>[http://www.salviharpsinc.com/HarpEchoSalvi.htm Salvi Echo]</ref><ref>[http://www.lyonhealy.com/pedal-style-2000-electroacoustic.htm Lyon and Healy electroacoustic]</ref><ref>[http://www.camac-harps.com/camac-harps-eng/littlebb.html Camac electroacoustic]</ref> The electroacoustic pedal harp is a modified concert harp, with piezoelectric pickups at the base of each string and an amplifier. Electroacoustic harps are a blend of electric and acoustic, with the option of using an amplifier or playing the harp just like a normal pedal harp. The '''[[electric harp]]''' is different from the electroacoustic harp, as it is entirely electric, lacking a soundbox and being nearly mute without an amplifier.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of compositions for harp]]\n* [[Claviharp]] (A harp combined with a keyboard)\n* [[Triple harp|Triple Harp]] (Baroque Harp)\n* [[Celtic harp|Celtic Harp]] (Medieval Harp)\n* [[Epigonion]]\n* [[Lyre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Harps}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pedal Harp}}\n[[Category:Frame harps]]\n[[Category:Pedals]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox Instrument\n|name=Harp\n|names= \n|image=Harfe-Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg-1995.245.png\n|image_size=200px\n|classification=[[String instrument]] ([[Pizzicato|plucked]])\n|range= [[Image:Range harp.svg|150px|center]]\n|related= \n* [[\u00c7eng]]\n* [[Konghou]]\n* [[Lyre]]\n}}\n[[Image:Eliza Ridgely with a Harp NGA.jpg|thumb|right|''Lady with Harp: [[Eliza Ridgely]]'', depicts a Regency-era single-action pedal harp ([[Thomas Sully]], 1818)]]\n{{listen|filename=Glissando Imprecision for 2 Harps.ogg|title=Tudor Tulok \u2013 Glissando Imprecision for 2 Harps|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe '''pedal harp''' (also known as the '''concert harp''') is a large and technically modern [[harp]], designed primarily for [[art music]] and may be played either solo, as part of a chamber ensemble, or in an [[orchestra]].

No matter how the pedals are set, the pedal harp still has only seven strings per octave. Smaller harps, often called folk, lever or Celtic harps, are equally diatonic, with seven strings per octave, and use a mechanical lever on each string that the player must move manually for chromatic alterations.  The only completely chromatic harps are the double (arpa doppia) and triple (Welsh) harps and [[cross-strung harp]].\n\nThe pedal mechanism is called the ''double-action pedal system'', first patented in London by [[Sebastien Erard]] in 1801 (patent number 2502) and 1802 (patent number 2595). In 1807 Charles Groll was the first to register a patent (patent number 3059) where the harp mechanism was doubled with two lines of fourchettes (forks). Earlier pedal harps had a single-action mechanism that provided only sharped notes, the first of which was made in [[1720 in science|1720]] by [[Jacob Hochbrucker]] in Bavaria.<ref name=celt/>\n\n==Technique==\n[[File:Harpist Elaine Christy at Unitarian Church 2.jpg|thumb|right|Harpist [[Elaine Christy]] plays with both hands approaching the strings from either side of the harp; foot pedals (not shown) can change the pitch of specific strings by a half step.]]\nThe pedal harp is played with the fingertips of the first four fingers (thumb, index, middle and ring fingers). The little fingers are not used because they are too short and cannot reach the correct position without distorting the position of the other fingers (although on some folk harps with light tension and closely spaced strings they may occasionally be used).  The fifth finger may also have been used on earlier, more lightly strung modern harps. [[Madame de Genlis]], for example, in her ''M\u00e9thode'', published in Paris in the early 19th century, promotes the use of all fingers,<ref>Rensch (2007/1989), 164\u2013165.</ref> while Roslyn Rensch suggests that Mlle de Gu\u00eenes, the harpist for whom [[Mozart]] wrote his [[Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra (Mozart)|Concerto for Flute and Harp]], might occasionally have used all five fingers when playing the harp.<ref>Rensch (2007./1989), 170.</ref> In more modern music, the little finger is used very rarely, for example in simultaneous cluster chords, such as in Daniel Kessner's ''Sonatina''.<ref>Inglewood and Neill (1985), 77.</ref> The fingertips are drawn in to meet the palm, thus releasing the string from whatever pressure was placed upon it by the fingers. The fingers are naturally curved or rounded as they touch it, and the thumb is gently curved as the tip rises to it as an arc from its base.\n\nPlucking with varying degrees of force creates [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness). Different types of plucking can also create different tones and sounds. Depending on finger position, different tones can be produced: a full sound in the middle of the string and a nasal, guitar-like sound at the very bottom. Tone is also affected by the skin of the harpist, how much oil and moisture it contains, and the amount of thickening by callus formation and its surface texture.\n\nThere are differing schools of technique for playing the pedal harp. The largest are the various French schools. There are specific Russian, Viennese, and other schools across Europe. One is the Attl technique, after Kajetan Attl, in which apparently only the uppermost parts of the fingers move and the hand is largely still. There is a St. Petersburg school (more than one) in Russia in which the player moves the thumbs in a circular fashion rather than in and out toward the hand.\n\nThe differences between the French schools lie in the posture of the arms, shape of the hand, and musical aesthetics. The traditional French schooling lets the player lightly rest the right arm against the harp, using the wrist to sometimes bring the hand only away from the string. The left arm moves more freely. Finger technique and control are the emphasis of the technical approach, with extensive use of exercises and etudes to develop this. Two very influential 20th-century teachers of this approach were [[Henriette Reni\u00e9]] and [[Marcel Grandjany]], who studied with [[Alphonse Hasselmans]]. The other major French school is the Salzedo school, developed by [[Carlos Salzedo]], who also studied with [[Alphonse Hasselmans]] at the Paris Conservatoire. Salzedo's technique generally calls for the arms to be held horizontally<ref>Lawrence and Salzedo (1929), 6.</ref> and emphasises the role of aesthetic hand and arm gestures after the string has been plucked: \"Each of the thirty-seven tone colors and effects of the harp calls for a gesture corresponding to its sonorous meaning.\"<ref>Lawrence and Salzedo (1929), 17.</ref>\n\n==Orchestral role==\nThe harp found its early orchestral use as a solo instrument in concerti by many baroque and classical composers (Handel, Mozart, Boieldieu, Albrechtsberger, Schenk, Dussek, Spohr) and in the opera houses of London, Paris and Berlin and most other capitals. Hector Berlioz began to use it in symphonic music, but he found performances frustrating in countries such as Germany, which had few harps or sufficiently proficient harpists. Franz Liszt was seminal using the harp in his orchestral music. The French and Russian Romantic composers particularly expanded its symphonic use. In opera, the Italian composers used it regularly, and Puccini was a particular master of its expressive and coloristic use. Debussy can be said to have put the harp on the map in his many works that use one or more harps. Tchaikovsky also was of great influence, followed by Rimsky-Korsakov, Richard Strauss and Wagner. The greatest influence on use of the harp has always been the availability of fine harps and skilled players, and the great increase of them in the US of the 20th century resulted in its spread into popular music.\n\n==Jazz==\nThe first harpist known to play jazz was [[Casper Reardon]], a pioneer in the world of \"hot\" music. [[Dorothy Ashby]] (sampled by hip-hop artists) and [[Alice Coltrane]] are other jazz harpists.[[File:Harpist performing.jpg|thumb|Harpist performing]]\n\n==Ballet==\nMany passages for solo harp can be found in 19th-century ballet music, particularly in scores for the ballets staged for the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] of [[St. Petersburg]], where the harpist [[Albert Zabel]] played in the orchestra. In ballet, the harp was utilised to a great extent to embellish the dancing of the [[ballerina]]. Elaborate cadenzas were composed by [[Tchaikovsky]] for his ballets ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]''; as well as [[Alexander Glazunov]] for his score for the ballet ''[[Raymonda]]''. In particular, the scores of [[Riccardo Drigo]] contained many pieces for harp in such works as ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|Le Talisman]]'' (1889), ''[[Le R\u00e9veil de Flore]]'' (1894) and ''[[Harlequinade (ballet)|Les Millions d'Arlequin]]'' (1900).\n\n[[Cesare Pugni]] wrote extensively for the harp as well\u2014his ballet ''[[\u00c9oline, ou La Dryade]]'' included music written for harp to accompany the ballerina's numerous variations and enhance the atmosphere of the ballet's many fantastical scenes. [[Ludwig Minkus]] was celebrated for his harp cadenzas, most notably the ''Variation de la Reine du jour'' from his ballet ''La Nuit et le Jour'' (1881), the elaborate ''[[entr'acte]]'' composed for Albert Zabel from his ballet ''Roxana'' (1878), and numerous passages found in his score for the ballet ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'', which in some passages were used to represent a [[veena]], which was used on stage as a prop. French ballet composers such as Delibes, Gounod, and Massenet made use of the harp in their music.\n\n==Pop music==\nThere is a prominent harp part in \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\" by [[The Beatles]] in their 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s, harp parts were common in popular music, and can be heard in such hits as [[Cher]]'s \"[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]\" and \"[[Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves]]\", as well as \"[[Boogie Nights (song)|Boogie Nights]]\" by [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]. Most often it was played by Los Angeles studio harpist [[Gayle Levant]], who has played on hundreds of recordings. Irish band [[Clannad]] featured the harp heavily in their music during the 1970s and 1980s. In current pop music, the harp appears relatively rarely. [[Joanna Newsom]], [[Dee Carstensen]], [[Darian Scatton]], [[Habiba Doorenbos]], and [[Jessa Callen]] of [[Callen Sisters|The Callen Sisters]] have separately established images as harp-playing singer-songwriters with signature harp and vocal sounds. Canadian singer-songwriter [[Sarah McLachlan]] plays the harp in her 2006 holiday album, [[Wintersong]]. In Hong Kong, a notable example of harp in pop music is the song \"[[Tian Shui Walled City]]\" ({{zh|t=\u5929\u6c34\u570d\u57ce|labels=no}}) performed by [[Hacken Lee]] with harp played by Korean harpist [[Jung Kwak]] (Harpist K).\n\nThe harp is also used as a central instrument by many [[Alternative music|alternative]] popular musicians. A pedal harpist, [[Ricky Rasura]], is a member of the \"symphonic pop\" band, [[The Polyphonic Spree]]. Also, [[Bj\u00f6rk]] sometimes features acoustic and electric harp in her work, often played by [[Zeena Parkins]]. Philadelphia based Indie Pop Band [[Br'er]] uses a pedal harp as the foundation for their cinematic live sets. [[Art in America (band)|Art in America]] was the first known rock band featuring a pedal harp to appear on a major record label, released in 1983. The pedal harp was also present in the [[Michael Kamen]] and [[Metallica]] concert and album, [[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]], as part of the [[San Francisco Symphony]] orchestra. R&B singer [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]] featured harpist [[Gloria Agostini]] in 1997 on his cover of [[Kate Bush]]'s \"This Woman's Work\". On his 7th solo album [[Finding Forever]], [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] artist [[Common (rapper)|Common]] features harpist [[Brandee Younger]] on the introductory track, followed by a [[Dorothy Ashby]] [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from her 1969 recording of \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\".\n\nSome Celtic-pop crossover bands and artists such as [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and [[Loreena McKennitt]] include folk harps, following [[Alan Stivell]]'s work. Additionally [[Florence Welch]] of [[Florence and the Machine]] uses the harp frequently in both [[Lungs (album)|Lungs]] and [[Ceremonials (album)|Ceremonials]], notably on \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\". [[The Webb Sisters]] from UK use different size harps in almost all their material during live performances. Sierra Casady, of the [[freak-folk]] group [[CocoRosie]] plays harp on several of their songs. Another musician from the UK [[Patrick Wolf]] has used the [[Celtic harp]] throughout his career, often playing it himself while singing.\n\n==Electroacoustic harps==\n[[Lyon and Healy]], [[Camac Harps]], [[Salvi Harps]], and other manufacturers also make electroacoustic pedal harps.<ref>[http://www.salviharpsinc.com/HarpEchoSalvi.htm Salvi Echo]</ref><ref>[http://www.lyonhealy.com/pedal-style-2000-electroacoustic.htm Lyon and Healy electroacoustic]</ref><ref>[http://www.camac-harps.com/camac-harps-eng/littlebb.html Camac electroacoustic]</ref> The electroacoustic pedal harp is a modified concert harp, with piezoelectric pickups at the base of each string and an amplifier. Electroacoustic harps are a blend of electric and acoustic, with the option of using an amplifier or playing the harp just like a normal pedal harp. The '''[[electric harp]]''' is different from the electroacoustic harp, as it is entirely electric, lacking a soundbox and being nearly mute without an amplifier.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of compositions for harp]]\n* [[Claviharp]] (A harp combined with a keyboard)\n* [[Triple harp|Triple Harp]] (Baroque Harp)\n* [[Celtic harp|Celtic Harp]] (Medieval Harp)\n* [[Epigonion]]\n* [[Lyre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Harps}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pedal Harp}}\n[[Category:Frame harps]]\n[[Category:Pedals]]\n", "name_user": "Idonnelly", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copyedited, only for sentence structure and flow.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_harp"}

It is his first project since his 2017 studio album ''[[Luv Is Rage 2]]''. After being initially announced in 2018, the album was released on March 6, 2020, through Generation Now and [[Atlantic Records]] as a surprise release. The album was supported by the singles \"[[Futsal Shuffle 2020]]\" and \"[[That Way (Lil Uzi Vert song)|That Way]]\", which later appeared as the album's bonus tracks. The album features a guest appearance from American singer [[Syd (singer)|Syd]].\n\n''Eternal Atake'' received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], becoming Lil Uzi Vert's second US number-one album. The deluxe version of the album, titled ''[[Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2]]'', was released a week later on March 13.\n\n==Background==\nIn July 2018, Lil Uzi Vert published two messages to Twitter, \"Eternal Atake\" and \"Eternal means forever.

Mullin mentions that \"Uzi nimbly switches from relatedly lovelorn speak-singing on \"Bust Me\" to rugged, speedy punch line powerhouse on the very next track, \"Prices\".

He is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry, including ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', ''[[The Dunciad]]'', and ''[[An Essay on Criticism]],'' as well as for his translation of [[Homer]]. After [[Shakespeare]], Pope is the second-most quoted writer in the English language, as per ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'',<ref>''Dictionary of Quotations'' (1999)</ref> some of his verses having even become popular idioms in common parlance (e.g., [[Damning with faint praise]]). He is considered a master of the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nPope's poetic career testifies to his indomitable spirit in the face of disadvantages, of health and of circumstance. The poet and his family were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and thus fell subject to the [[Test Act]]s, prohibitive measures which severely hampered the prosperity of their co-religionists after the abdication of [[James II of England|James II]]; one of these banned them from living within ten miles of London, and another from attending public school or university. For this reason, except for a few spurious Catholic schools, Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a lover of books. He learned French, Italian, Latin, and Greek by himself, and discovered Homer at the age of six. As a child Pope survived being once trampled by a cow, but when he was 12 began struggling with tuberculosis of the spine ([[Pott disease]]), along with fits of crippling headaches which troubled him throughout his life. \n\nIn the year 1709, Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of ''Pastorals'', his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the time he was 23 he had written ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the essay was met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends, most notably [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]], who had recently started collaborating on the influential ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. The critic [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], having located an ironic and veiled portrait of himself, was outraged by what he considered the impudence of the younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life, and, save for a temporary reconciliation, dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print, to which Pope retaliated in kind, making Dennis the butt of much satire.\n\n''The Rape of the Lock'', perhaps the poet's most famous poem, appeared first in 1712, followed by a revised and enlarged version in 1714. When [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]] forcibly snipped off a lock from Miss [[Arabella Fermor]]'s head (the \"Belinda\" of the poem), the incident gave rise to a high-society quarrel between the families. With the idea of allaying this, Pope treated the subject in a playful and witty [[mock-heroic]] epic. The narrative poem brings into focus the onset of acquisitive individualism and conspicuous consumption, where purchased goods assume dominance over moral agency. \n\nA folio comprising a collection of his poems appeared in 1717, together with two new ones written about the passion of love. These were ''Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady'' and the famous proto-romantic poem ''[[Eloisa to Abelard]]''. Though Pope never married, about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu, whom he indirectly referenced in the popular poem ''Eloisa to Abelard'', and to Martha Blount, with whom his friendship continued throughout his life. \n\nIn his career as a satirist, Pope made his share of enemies as the critics, politicians, and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharpwitted satires. Some were so virulent, that Pope even carried pistols at one point while walking his dog. After 1738, Pope composed relatively little. He toyed with the idea of writing a patriotic epic called ''Brutus.'' He mainly revised and expanded his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, he replaced Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Colley Cibber]], as \"king of dunces\". However, his real target in the poem is the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician [[Robert Walpole]]. By now Pope's health was failing, and when told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms\".\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Portrait of Alexander Pope.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of Alexander Pope''.

His father (also Alexander, 1646\u20131717) was a successful linen merchant in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. The poet's mother, Edith (1643\u20131733), was the daughter of William Turner, Esquire, of [[York]]. Both parents were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> Edith's sister, Christiana, was the wife of famous miniature painter [[Samuel Cooper]].

Pope was taught to read by his aunt and went to [[Twyford School]] in about 1698/99.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> He then went on to two Roman Catholic schools in London.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> Such schools, while illegal, were tolerated in some areas.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\">'Alexander Pope', ''Literature Online biography'' (2000)</ref>\n\n[[File:AlexanderPope.jpg|thumb|left|A look-a-like of Pope derived from a portrait by [[William Hoare]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=ss&sText=Alexander+Pope&LinkID=mp03609&rNo=6&role=sit |title=National Portrait Gallery \u2013 Portrait  \u2013 NPG 299; Alexander Pope |work=npg.org.uk}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\nIn 1700, his family moved to a small estate at [[Popeswood]] in [[Binfield]], Berkshire, close to the royal [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing \"Papists\" from living within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of London or Westminster.<ref>\"An Act to prevent and avoid dangers which may grow by Popish Recusants\" (3.

Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).</ref> Pope's formal education ended at this time, and from then on, he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the [[Satire|satirists]] [[Horace]] and [[Juvenal]], the [[Epic poetry|epic poets]] [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], as well as English authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Dryden]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> He studied many languages and read works by English, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets. After five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as [[William Congreve]], [[Samuel Garth]] and [[William Trumbull]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /><ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nAt Binfield he made many important friends. One of them, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]] (the future dedicatee of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright [[William Wycherley]] and to [[William Walsh (poet)|William Walsh]], a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work, ''The Pastorals''. He also met the Blount sisters, Teresa and [[Martha Blount|Martha]], both of whom remained lifelong friends.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nFrom the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems, including [[Pott disease]] (a form of [[tuberculosis]] that affects the spine), which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes, and abdominal pain.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> He grew to a height of only {{convert|1.37|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Pope was already removed from society because he was Catholic, and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].

Livingstone, 1953, p.89</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n[[File:Alexander Pope's house wall plaque Twickenham.jpg|thumb|Plaque above [[Pope's Grotto]] at Twickenham]]\n\nIn May 1709, Pope's ''Pastorals'' was published in the sixth part of bookseller [[Jacob Tonson]]'s ''Poetical Miscellanies''. This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', published in May 1711, which was equally well received.\n\n[[File:Alexander Pope's house at Twickenham.png|thumb|left|[[Pope's villa]] at [[Twickenham]], showing the [[grotto]]; from a watercolour produced soon after his death]]\n\nAround 1711, Pope made friends with Tory writers [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Thomas Parnell]] and [[John Arbuthnot]], who together formed the satirical [[Scriblerus Club]]. The aim of the club was to satirise ignorance and pedantry in the form of the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with Whig writers [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]]. In March 1713, ''Windsor Forest''<ref name=\"WF\"/> was published to great acclaim.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nDuring Pope's friendship with Joseph Addison, he contributed to Addison's play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'', as well as writing for ''[[The Guardian (1713)|The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. Around this time, he began the work of translating the ''[[Iliad]]'', which was a painstaking process \u2013 publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nIn 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]] and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], leading to the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]. Though Pope, as a Catholic, might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations, according to Maynard Mack, \"where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known\". These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the Tories, and Pope's friend [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]], fled to France.\n\nPope lived in his parents' house in Mawson Row, [[Chiswick]], between 1716 and 1719; the red brick building is now the [[Mawson Arms]], commemorating him with a [[blue plaque]].<ref name=\"ChiswickHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://chiswickhistory.org.uk/html/110-people.html |title=Chiswick History |publisher=chiswickhistory.org.uk |work=People: Alexander Pope |accessdate=16 March 2012 |author=Clegg, Gillian}}</ref>\n\nThe money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to [[Pope's villa|a villa at Twickenham]], where he created his now famous [[Pope's Grotto|grotto]] and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water, which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked that: \"Were it to have nymphs as well \u2013 it would be complete in everything.\" Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished, much of the grotto survives. It now lies beneath Radnor House Independent Co-ed School and is occasionally opened to the public.<ref name=\"Gordon 2002\"/><ref>''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 2 November 2010</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\n[[File:Mawson Arms 01.JPG|thumb|[[Mawson Arms]], Chiswick Lane, with [[blue plaque]] to Pope]]\n\n===''Essay on Criticism''===\n{{main|An Essay on Criticism}}\n''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it.\n\nAt the time the poem was published, the [[heroic couplet]] style in which it was written was a moderately new poetic form, and Pope's work was an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. The poem was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural, or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past.<ref name=\"Rogers 2006\">Rogers (2006)</ref>\n\nThe 'essay' begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry by which a critic passes judgment. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority that he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while critiquing poetry, and points out that critics serve an important function in aiding poets with their works, as opposed to the practice of attacking them.<ref name=\"Baines 2001\">Baines (2001)</ref> The final section of ''An Essay on Criticism'' discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in the ideal critic, who, Pope claims, is also the ideal man.\n\n===''The Rape of the Lock''===\nPope's most famous poem is ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', first published in 1712, with a revised version published in 1714. A [[mock-epic]], it satirises a high-society quarrel between [[Arabella Fermor]] (the \"Belinda\" of the poem) and [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]], who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without her permission. The satirical style is tempered, however, by a genuine and almost voyeuristic interest in the \"beau-monde\" (fashionable world) of 18th-century English society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103412/http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-05-31 |title=from the London School of Journalism.}}</ref> The revised and extended version of the poem brought more clearly into focus its true subject \u2013 the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers.

Pope pilloried a host of other \"hacks\", \"scribblers\" and \"dunces\" in addition to Theobald, and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication \"in many ways the greatest act of folly in Pope's life.\" Though a masterpiece which would become \"one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry\", writes Mack, \"it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers, who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies.\"<ref>Maynard Mack. ''Alexander Pope: A Life'' (W.W. Norton & Company, and [[Yale University Press]], 1985), pp. 472-3.</ref>\n\nAccording to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett, some of Pope's targets were so enraged by ''The Dunciad'' that they threatened him. \"My brother does not seem to know what fear is,\" she told [[Joseph Spence (author)|Joseph Spence]], explaining that Pope loved to walk alone, so went accompanied by his [[Great Dane]], Bounce, and for some time carried pistols in his pocket.<ref>Joseph Spence.

Although he was a keen participant in the stock and money markets, Pope never missed an opportunity to satirise the personal, social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From ''The Rape of the Lock'' onwards, these satirical themes are a constant in his work.\n\nIn 1731, Pope published his \"Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]],\" on the subject of architecture, the first of four poems which would later be grouped under the title ''[[Moral Essays]]'' (1731\u201335). In the epistle, Pope ridiculed the bad taste of the aristocrat \"Timon.\" Pope's enemies claimed he was attacking the [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Duke of Chandos]] and his estate, [[Cannons (house)|Cannons]]. Though the charge was untrue, it did Pope a great deal of damage.\n\n===''An Essay on Man''===\n{{main|An Essay on Man}}\n\n''[[An Essay on Man]]'' is a philosophical poem, written in heroic couplets and published between 1732 and 1734. Pope intended this poem to be the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics that was to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece of work that Pope intended to make into a larger work; however, he did not live to complete it.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\">Nuttal (1984)</ref>\n\nThe poem is an attempt to \"vindicate the ways of God to Man\", a variation on Milton's attempt in ''Paradise Lost'' to \"justify the ways of God to Man\" (1.26). It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric world-view. The poem is not solely Christian, however; it makes an assumption that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\" />\n\n[[File:Alexander Pope.jpg|left|thumb|Alexander Pope circa 1742]]\n\nIt consists of four epistles that are addressed to [[Lord Bolingbroke]]. Pope presents an idea on his view of the Universe; he says that no matter how imperfect, complex, inscrutable and disturbing the Universe appears to be, it functions in a rational fashion according to the natural laws. The natural laws consider the Universe as a whole a perfect work of God. To humans, it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope points out that this is due to our limited mindset and limited intellectual capacity. Pope gets the message across that humans must accept their position in the \"Great Chain of Being\" which is at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. If we are able to accomplish this then we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\" />\n\nThe poem is an affirmative poem of faith: life seems to be chaotic and confusing to man when he is in the centre of it, but according to Pope it is really divinely ordered. In Pope's world, God exists and is what he centres the Universe around in order to have an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and can experience only partial truths, hence man must rely on hope which then leads into faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it, in terms of riches, power, and fame. It is man's duty to strive to be good regardless of other situations: this is the message Pope is trying to get across to the reader.<ref>Cassirer (1944)</ref>\n\n===Later life and works===\n[[File:Alexander Pope dying.png|thumb|The death of Alexander Pope from ''Museus'', a [[threnody]] by [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]]. [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] holds the dying Pope, and [[John Milton]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] prepare to welcome him to heaven.]]\n\nThe ''Imitations of Horace'' followed (1733\u201338). These were written in the popular Augustan form of the \"imitation\" of a classical poet, not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of [[Horace]] to satirise life under [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], especially what he regarded as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpole's influence and the poor quality of the court's artistic taste.\n\nPope also added a wholly original poem, ''[[Epistle to Doctor Arbuthnot]]'', as an introduction to the \"Imitations\". It reviews his own literary career and includes the famous portraits of Lord [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Hervey]] (\"[[Sporus]]\") and Addison (\"Atticus\"). In 1738 he wrote the ''Universal Prayer''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pope_a/prayer.html |title=Alexander Pope 'Universal Prayer' |author=Trevor W. McKeown |work=bcy.ca}} [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o3702-w0010.shtml Full-text] also at the Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).</ref>\n\nAfter 1738, Pope wrote little. He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called ''Brutus'', but only the opening lines survive. His major work in these years was revising and expanding his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, Pope replaced the \"hero\" Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Colley Cibber]], as \"king of dunces\". However, the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and all his works. By now Pope's health, which had never been good, was failing. When told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruffhead |first=Owen |title=The Life of Alexander Pope; With a Critical Essay on His Writings and Genius |url=https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog |year=1769 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog/page/n479 475]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |title=The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, with a Life, by A.

On the previous day, 29 May 1744, Pope had called for a priest and received the [[Last Rites]] of the Roman [[Catholic Church]]. He was buried in the nave of [[St Mary's Church, Twickenham]].\n\n==Translations and editions==\n\n===Translation of the ''Iliad''===\nPope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced his plans to publish a translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over the course of six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which earned him two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (\u00a3210) a volume, equivalent to about \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|210|1713|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}},{{Inflation-fn|UK}} a vast sum at the time.\n\nHis translation of the ''Iliad'' appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by [[Samuel Johnson]] as \"a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal\" (although the classical scholar [[Richard Bentley]] wrote: \"It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.\").{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Translation of the ''Odyssey''===\n[[File:OdysseyPopeTP1752.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and title page of a 1752 edition of Pope's '''''Odyssey'''''|alt=]]\nEncouraged by the success of the ''Iliad'', Bernard Lintot published Pope's five-volume translation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' in 1725 and 1726.<ref>{{cite book |author=Homer |last-author-amp=true |translator1=Alexander Pope |translator2=William Broome |translator3=Elijah Fenton |title=The Odyssey of Homer |edition=1st |date=1725\u20131726 |location=5 vols.

Pope also removed about 1,560 lines of Shakespearean material, arguing that some appealed to him more than others.<ref name=\"Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson\" /> In 1726, lawyer, poet and pantomime deviser [[Lewis Theobald]] published a scathing pamphlet called ''Shakespeare Restored'', which catalogued the errors in Pope's work and suggested a number of revisions to the text. This enraged Pope, and thus, Theobald was the main target of Pope's poem ''[[The Dunciad]]''.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lewis-Theobald#ref59272</ref><ref>[[The Dunciad]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe second edition of Pope's ''Shakespeare'' appeared in 1728.<ref name=\"Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson\" /> Aside from making some minor revisions to the preface, it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most, later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Pope's creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Pope's preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeare's texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors' interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century.\n\n==Reception==\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope's death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope's style of poetry was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent towards his work. Though [[Lord Byron]] identified Pope as one of his chief influences (believing his scathing satire of contemporary English literature ''English Bards and Scotch Reviewers'' to be a continuance of Pope's tradition), [[William Wordsworth]] found Pope's style fundamentally too decadent to be a representation of the human condition.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" /> George Gilfillan in his study of 1856 described Pope's talent as \"a rose peering into the summer air, fine, rather than powerful\".<ref>Gilfillan, George. ''The Genius and Poetry of Pope'', The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, Vol 11, 1856</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, Pope's reputation was revived. Pope's work was, of course, full of references to the people and places of his time, and these aided people's understanding of the past. The postwar period stressed the power of Pope's poetry, recognising that Pope's immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example, Maynard Mack, a Pope scholar of the mid-to-late 20th century, argued that Pope's moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope's poems was published in ten volumes, including an index volume.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\n==Works==\n===Major works===\n* 1709: ''Pastorals''\n* 1711: ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]''<ref name=cocel>Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-860634-6}}</ref>\n* 1712: ''[[Messiah (English poem)|Messiah]]'' (from the [[Book of Isaiah]], and later [[Messiah (Latin poem)|translated into Latin]] by [[Samuel Johnson]])\n* 1712: ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' (enlarged in 1714)<ref name=cocel/>\n* 1713: ''Windsor Forest''<ref name=\"WF\"/><ref name=cocel/>\n* 1715: ''[[The House of Fame#Adaptations|The Temple of Fame: A Vision]]''<ref>Pope, Alexander.

He is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry, including ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', ''[[The Dunciad]]'', and ''[[An Essay on Criticism]],'' as well as for his translation of [[Homer]]. After [[Shakespeare]], Pope is the second-most quoted writer in the English language, as per ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'',<ref>''Dictionary of Quotations'' (1999)</ref> some of his verses having even become popular idioms in common parlance (e.g., [[Damning with faint praise]]). He is considered a master of the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nPope's poetic career testifies to his indomitable spirit in the face of disadvantages, of health and of circumstance. The poet and his family were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and thus fell subject to the [[Test Act]]s, prohibitive measures which severely hampered the prosperity of their co-religionists after the abdication of [[James II of England|James II]]; one of these banned them from living within ten miles of London, and another from attending public school or university. For this reason, except for a few spurious Catholic schools, Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a lover of books. He learned French, Italian, Latin, and Greek by himself, and discovered Homer at the age of six. As a child Pope survived being once trampled by a cow, but when he was 12 began struggling with tuberculosis of the spine ([[Pott disease]]), along with fits of crippling headaches which troubled him throughout his life. \n\nIn the year 1709, Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of ''Pastorals'', his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the time he was 23 he had written ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the essay was met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends, most notably [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]], who had recently started collaborating on the influential ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. The critic [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], having located an ironic and veiled portrait of himself, was outraged by what he considered the impudence of the younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life, and, save for a temporary reconciliation, dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print, to which Pope retaliated in kind, making Dennis the butt of much satire.\n\n''The Rape of the Lock'', perhaps the poet's most famous poem, appeared first in 1712, followed by a revised and enlarged version in 1714. When [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]] forcibly snipped off a lock from Miss [[Arabella Fermor]]'s head (the \"Belinda\" of the poem), the incident gave rise to a high-society quarrel between the families. With the idea of allaying this, Pope treated the subject in a playful and witty [[mock-heroic]] epic. The narrative poem brings into focus the onset of acquisitive individualism and conspicuous consumption, where purchased goods assume dominance over moral agency. \n\nA folio comprising a collection of his poems appeared in 1717, together with two new ones written about the passion of love. These were ''Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady'' and the famous proto-romantic poem ''[[Eloisa to Abelard]]''. Though Pope never married, about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu, whom he indirectly referenced in the popular poem ''Eloisa to Abelard'', and to Martha Blount, with whom his friendship continued throughout his life. \n\nIn his career as a satirist, Pope made his share of enemies as the critics, politicians, and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharpwitted satires. Some were so virulent, that Pope even carried pistols at one point while walking his dog. After 1738, Pope composed relatively little. He toyed with the idea of writing a patriotic epic called ''Brutus.'' He mainly revised and expanded his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, he replaced Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Colley Cibber]], as \"king of dunces\". However, his real target in the poem is the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician [[Robert Walpole]]. By now Pope's health was failing, and when told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms\".\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Portrait of Alexander Pope.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of Alexander Pope''.

His father (also Alexander, 1646\u20131717) was a successful linen merchant in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. The poet's mother, Edith (1643\u20131733), was the daughter of William Turner, Esquire, of [[York]]. Both parents were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> Edith's sister, Christiana, was the wife of famous miniature painter [[Samuel Cooper]]. Pope's education was affected by the recently enacted [[Test Act]]s, which upheld the status of the [[state church|established]] [[Church of England]] and banned Catholics from teaching, attending a university, voting, and holding public office on penalty of perpetual imprisonment. Pope was taught to read by his aunt and went to [[Twyford School]] in about 1698/99.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> He then went on to two Roman Catholic schools in London.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> Such schools, while illegal, were tolerated in some areas.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\">'Alexander Pope', ''Literature Online biography'' (2000)</ref>\n\n[[File:AlexanderPope.jpg|thumb|left|A look-a-like of Pope derived from a portrait by [[William Hoare]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=ss&sText=Alexander+Pope&LinkID=mp03609&rNo=6&role=sit |title=National Portrait Gallery \u2013 Portrait  \u2013 NPG 299; Alexander Pope |work=npg.org.uk}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\nIn 1700, his family moved to a small estate at [[Popeswood]] in [[Binfield]], Berkshire, close to the royal [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing \"Papists\" from living within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of London or Westminster.<ref>\"An Act to prevent and avoid dangers which may grow by Popish Recusants\" (3.

Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).</ref> Pope's formal education ended at this time, and from then on, he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the [[Satire|satirists]] [[Horace]] and [[Juvenal]], the [[Epic poetry|epic poets]] [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], as well as English authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Dryden]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\">Erskine-Hill, ''DNB''</ref> He studied many languages and read works by English, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets. After five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as [[William Congreve]], [[Samuel Garth]] and [[William Trumbull]].<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /><ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nAt Binfield he made many important friends. One of them, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]] (the future dedicatee of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright [[William Wycherley]] and to [[William Walsh (poet)|William Walsh]], a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work, ''The Pastorals''. He also met the Blount sisters, Teresa and [[Martha Blount|Martha]], both of whom remained lifelong friends.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nFrom the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems, including [[Pott disease]] (a form of [[tuberculosis]] that affects the spine), which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes, and abdominal pain.<ref name=\"Erskine-Hill, DNB\" /> He grew to a height of only {{convert|1.37|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Pope was already removed from society because he was Catholic, and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].

Livingstone, 1953, p.89</ref>\n\n===Early career===\n[[File:Alexander Pope's house wall plaque Twickenham.jpg|thumb|Plaque above [[Pope's Grotto]] at Twickenham]]\n\nIn May 1709, Pope's ''Pastorals'' was published in the sixth part of bookseller [[Jacob Tonson]]'s ''Poetical Miscellanies''. This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', published in May 1711, which was equally well received.\n\n[[File:Alexander Pope's house at Twickenham.png|thumb|left|[[Pope's villa]] at [[Twickenham]], showing the [[grotto]]; from a watercolour produced soon after his death]]\n\nAround 1711, Pope made friends with Tory writers [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Thomas Parnell]] and [[John Arbuthnot]], who together formed the satirical [[Scriblerus Club]]. The aim of the club was to satirise ignorance and pedantry in the form of the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with Whig writers [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]]. In March 1713, ''Windsor Forest''<ref name=\"WF\"/> was published to great acclaim.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nDuring Pope's friendship with Joseph Addison, he contributed to Addison's play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'', as well as writing for ''[[The Guardian (1713)|The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. Around this time, he began the work of translating the ''[[Iliad]]'', which was a painstaking process \u2013 publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\nIn 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]] and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], leading to the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]. Though Pope, as a Catholic, might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations, according to Maynard Mack, \"where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known\". These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the Tories, and Pope's friend [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]], fled to France.\n\nPope lived in his parents' house in Mawson Row, [[Chiswick]], between 1716 and 1719; the red brick building is now the [[Mawson Arms]], commemorating him with a [[blue plaque]].<ref name=\"ChiswickHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://chiswickhistory.org.uk/html/110-people.html |title=Chiswick History |publisher=chiswickhistory.org.uk |work=People: Alexander Pope |accessdate=16 March 2012 |author=Clegg, Gillian}}</ref>\n\nThe money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to [[Pope's villa|a villa at Twickenham]], where he created his now famous [[Pope's Grotto|grotto]] and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water, which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked that: \"Were it to have nymphs as well \u2013 it would be complete in everything.\" Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished, much of the grotto survives. It now lies beneath Radnor House Independent Co-ed School and is occasionally opened to the public.<ref name=\"Gordon 2002\"/><ref>''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 2 November 2010</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\n[[File:Mawson Arms 01.JPG|thumb|[[Mawson Arms]], Chiswick Lane, with [[blue plaque]] to Pope]]\n\n===''Essay on Criticism''===\n{{main|An Essay on Criticism}}\n''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it.\n\nAt the time the poem was published, the [[heroic couplet]] style in which it was written was a moderately new poetic form, and Pope's work was an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. The poem was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural, or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past.<ref name=\"Rogers 2006\">Rogers (2006)</ref>\n\nThe 'essay' begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry by which a critic passes judgment. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority that he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while critiquing poetry, and points out that critics serve an important function in aiding poets with their works, as opposed to the practice of attacking them.<ref name=\"Baines 2001\">Baines (2001)</ref> The final section of ''An Essay on Criticism'' discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in the ideal critic, who, Pope claims, is also the ideal man.\n\n===''The Rape of the Lock''===\nPope's most famous poem is ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', first published in 1712, with a revised version published in 1714. A [[mock-epic]], it satirises a high-society quarrel between [[Arabella Fermor]] (the \"Belinda\" of the poem) and [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]], who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without her permission. The satirical style is tempered, however, by a genuine and almost voyeuristic interest in the \"beau-monde\" (fashionable world) of 18th-century English society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103412/http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-05-31 |title=from the London School of Journalism.}}</ref> The revised and extended version of the poem brought more clearly into focus its true subject \u2013 the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers.

Pope pilloried a host of other \"hacks\", \"scribblers\" and \"dunces\" in addition to Theobald, and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication \"in many ways the greatest act of folly in Pope's life.\" Though a masterpiece which would become \"one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry\", writes Mack, \"it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers, who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies.\"<ref>Maynard Mack. ''Alexander Pope: A Life'' (W.W. Norton & Company, and [[Yale University Press]], 1985), pp. 472-3.</ref>\n\nAccording to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett, some of Pope's targets were so enraged by ''The Dunciad'' that they threatened him. \"My brother does not seem to know what fear is,\" she told [[Joseph Spence (author)|Joseph Spence]], explaining that Pope loved to walk alone, so went accompanied by his [[Great Dane]], Bounce, and for some time carried pistols in his pocket.<ref>Joseph Spence.

Although he was a keen participant in the stock and money markets, Pope never missed an opportunity to satirise the personal, social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From ''The Rape of the Lock'' onwards, these satirical themes are a constant in his work.\n\nIn 1731, Pope published his \"Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]],\" on the subject of architecture, the first of four poems which would later be grouped under the title ''[[Moral Essays]]'' (1731\u201335). In the epistle, Pope ridiculed the bad taste of the aristocrat \"Timon.\" Pope's enemies claimed he was attacking the [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Duke of Chandos]] and his estate, [[Cannons (house)|Cannons]]. Though the charge was untrue, it did Pope a great deal of damage.\n\n===''An Essay on Man''===\n{{main|An Essay on Man}}\n\n''[[An Essay on Man]]'' is a philosophical poem, written in heroic couplets and published between 1732 and 1734. Pope intended this poem to be the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics that was to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece of work that Pope intended to make into a larger work; however, he did not live to complete it.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\">Nuttal (1984)</ref>\n\nThe poem is an attempt to \"vindicate the ways of God to Man\", a variation on Milton's attempt in ''Paradise Lost'' to \"justify the ways of God to Man\" (1.26). It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric world-view. The poem is not solely Christian, however; it makes an assumption that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\" />\n\n[[File:Alexander Pope.jpg|left|thumb|Alexander Pope circa 1742]]\n\nIt consists of four epistles that are addressed to [[Lord Bolingbroke]]. Pope presents an idea on his view of the Universe; he says that no matter how imperfect, complex, inscrutable and disturbing the Universe appears to be, it functions in a rational fashion according to the natural laws. The natural laws consider the Universe as a whole a perfect work of God. To humans, it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope points out that this is due to our limited mindset and limited intellectual capacity. Pope gets the message across that humans must accept their position in the \"Great Chain of Being\" which is at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. If we are able to accomplish this then we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives.<ref name=\"Nuttal 1984\" />\n\nThe poem is an affirmative poem of faith: life seems to be chaotic and confusing to man when he is in the centre of it, but according to Pope it is really divinely ordered. In Pope's world, God exists and is what he centres the Universe around in order to have an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and can experience only partial truths, hence man must rely on hope which then leads into faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it, in terms of riches, power, and fame. It is man's duty to strive to be good regardless of other situations: this is the message Pope is trying to get across to the reader.<ref>Cassirer (1944)</ref>\n\n===Later life and works===\n[[File:Alexander Pope dying.png|thumb|The death of Alexander Pope from ''Museus'', a [[threnody]] by [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]]. [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] holds the dying Pope, and [[John Milton]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] prepare to welcome him to heaven.]]\n\nThe ''Imitations of Horace'' followed (1733\u201338). These were written in the popular Augustan form of the \"imitation\" of a classical poet, not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of [[Horace]] to satirise life under [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], especially what he regarded as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpole's influence and the poor quality of the court's artistic taste.\n\nPope also added a wholly original poem, ''[[Epistle to Doctor Arbuthnot]]'', as an introduction to the \"Imitations\". It reviews his own literary career and includes the famous portraits of Lord [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Hervey]] (\"[[Sporus]]\") and Addison (\"Atticus\"). In 1738 he wrote the ''Universal Prayer''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pope_a/prayer.html |title=Alexander Pope 'Universal Prayer' |author=Trevor W. McKeown |work=bcy.ca}} [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o3702-w0010.shtml Full-text] also at the Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).</ref>\n\nAfter 1738, Pope wrote little. He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called ''Brutus'', but only the opening lines survive. His major work in these years was revising and expanding his masterpiece ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742, and a complete revision of the whole poem in the following year. In this version, Pope replaced the \"hero\" Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Colley Cibber]], as \"king of dunces\". However, the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and all his works. By now Pope's health, which had never been good, was failing. When told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruffhead |first=Owen |title=The Life of Alexander Pope; With a Critical Essay on His Writings and Genius |url=https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog |year=1769 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog/page/n479 475]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |title=The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, with a Life, by A.

On the previous day, 29 May 1744, Pope had called for a priest and received the [[Last Rites]] of the Roman [[Catholic Church]]. He was buried in the nave of [[St Mary's Church, Twickenham]].\n\n==Translations and editions==\n\n===Translation of the ''Iliad''===\nPope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced his plans to publish a translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over the course of six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which earned him two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (\u00a3210) a volume, equivalent to about \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|210|1713|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}},{{Inflation-fn|UK}} a vast sum at the time.\n\nHis translation of the ''Iliad'' appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by [[Samuel Johnson]] as \"a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal\" (although the classical scholar [[Richard Bentley]] wrote: \"It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.\").{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Translation of the ''Odyssey''===\n[[File:OdysseyPopeTP1752.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and title page of a 1752 edition of Pope's '''''Odyssey'''''|alt=]]\nEncouraged by the success of the ''Iliad'', Bernard Lintot published Pope's five-volume translation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' in 1725 and 1726.<ref>{{cite book |author=Homer |last-author-amp=true |translator1=Alexander Pope |translator2=William Broome |translator3=Elijah Fenton |title=The Odyssey of Homer |edition=1st |date=1725\u20131726 |location=5 vols.

Pope also removed about 1,560 lines of Shakespearean material, arguing that some appealed to him more than others.<ref name=\"Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson\" /> In 1726, lawyer, poet and pantomime deviser [[Lewis Theobald]] published a scathing pamphlet called ''Shakespeare Restored'', which catalogued the errors in Pope's work and suggested a number of revisions to the text. This enraged Pope, and thus, Theobald was the main target of Pope's poem ''[[The Dunciad]]''.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lewis-Theobald#ref59272</ref><ref>[[The Dunciad]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe second edition of Pope's ''Shakespeare'' appeared in 1728.<ref name=\"Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson\" /> Aside from making some minor revisions to the preface, it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Pope's creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Pope's preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeare's texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors' interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century.\n\n==Reception==\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope's death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope's style of poetry was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent towards his work. Though [[Lord Byron]] identified Pope as one of his chief influences (believing his scathing satire of contemporary English literature ''English Bards and Scotch Reviewers'' to be a continuance of Pope's tradition), [[William Wordsworth]] found Pope's style fundamentally too decadent to be a representation of the human condition.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" /> George Gilfillan in his study of 1856 described Pope's talent as \"a rose peering into the summer air, fine, rather than powerful\".<ref>Gilfillan, George. ''The Genius and Poetry of Pope'', The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, Vol 11, 1856</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, Pope's reputation was revived. Pope's work was, of course, full of references to the people and places of his time, and these aided people's understanding of the past. The postwar period stressed the power of Pope's poetry, recognising that Pope's immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example, Maynard Mack, a Pope scholar of the mid-to-late 20th century, argued that Pope's moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope's poems was published in ten volumes, including an index volume.<ref name=\"Alexander Pope' 2000\" />\n\n==Works==\n===Major works===\n* 1709: ''Pastorals''\n* 1711: ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]''<ref name=cocel>Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-860634-6}}</ref>\n* 1712: ''[[Messiah (English poem)|Messiah]]'' (from the [[Book of Isaiah]], and later [[Messiah (Latin poem)|translated into Latin]] by [[Samuel Johnson]])\n* 1712: ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' (enlarged in 1714)<ref name=cocel/>\n* 1713: ''Windsor Forest''<ref name=\"WF\"/><ref name=cocel/>\n* 1715: ''[[The House of Fame#Adaptations|The Temple of Fame: A Vision]]''<ref>Pope, Alexander.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

German identity and the problem of history. ''History and ethnicity'', p.146</ref>\n\nPan-Germanism's origins began in the early 19th century following the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states. The new German nationalists, mostly young reformers such as Johann Tillmann of [[East Prussia]], sought to unite all the German-speaking and ethnic-German (Volksdeutsche) people.\n\n===1871\u20131918===\n{{Further|Unification of Germany}}\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria\u2013Hungary, 1910]]\nBy the 1860s the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] were the two most powerful nations dominated by German-speaking elites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire. [[German nationalism in Austria]] grew among all social circles of the empire, many wanted to be unified with the German Reich to form a [[Greater Germany]] and wanted policies to be carried out to enforce their German ethnic identity rejecting any Austrian pan-ethnic identity.<ref name=\"DPSO\">{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in \u00d6sterreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423112116/http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | archive-date=23 April 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Many German Austrians felt annoyed that they were excluded from the German Empire since it included various non-German ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Kurt |last=Bauer |title=Nationalsozialismus: Urspr\u00fcnge, Anf\u00e4nge, Aufstieg und Fall |publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag |year=2008 |page=41 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9L1GyROMi0C&pg=PA41 |isbn=9783825230760 }}</ref> Prominent Austrian pan-Germans such as [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer]]  created pan-German movements which demanded the annexation of all ethnic German territories.

It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.\n\nUsed as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of \"a German\" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.<ref>\ne.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch'' (1872\u20131878), s.v. \"Diutsche\".\nThe Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for \"in the German realm, in Germany\".\nThe phrase ''in t\u00fctschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', s.v. \"Deutsch\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]].

The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nTheologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states.

Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire.

Nationalism and Pan-Germanism became almost taboo because they had been used so destructively by the Nazis. Indeed, the word \"Volksdeutscher\" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging \"[[Gastarbeiter]]\" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Further|German reunification}}\n\nHowever, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates.

The soundtrack was released on October 7, 2016, digitally and with a vinyl release by Mondo.\n\nYounge and Muhammad were asked to join the series by showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker, and strove to write a score inspired by hip hop. They were given a full orchestra to record the score with. In addition to their music, the soundtrack includes songs from various artists that gave onscreen performances during the season, including the original song \"[[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\" featuring [[Method Man]], which was also released before the album as a single.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nIn April 2016, ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'' showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the series' score, describing it as \"a '90s hip-hop vibe\" with \"a lot of different musical appearances\".<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Younge and Muhammad spotted each episode together with the episode's director, then went off and worked on certain cues each, though the two did work on some cues together.<ref name=\"LCVulture\" /> [[Marvel Television]], [[Netflix]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] were extremely supportive of Younge and Muhammad's artistic process after hearing their first work for the series (the duo started by composing the bookending music of the second episode), asking them to \"push\" the sound of the score as far as they could, and allowing them the use of a full, 30-piece orchestra for recording.<ref name=\"LCUrbanDaily\" /> The score was orchestrated and conducted by [[Miguel Atwood-Ferguson]],<ref name=\"LCUrbanDaily\" /> and recorded and mixed at [[Raphael Saadiq]]'s studio.<ref name=\"LCVulture\" />\n\nMarvel did criticize the initial theme music that Younge and Muhammad wrote for the series, which was inspired by the \"British library music\" of [[Alan Tew]]. Coker wanted to use the music, but the studio felt that it was too slow to play over the opening credits. They eventually agreed to use the music for the closing credits of each episode, and wrote a piece closer to \"classic\" theme music for the opening. They still made this \"more funky, and kind of crazy\" compared to traditional themes, and Marvel praised it. For Younge, it was important that the music for the series be recorded using analog technologies, comparing it to the music of [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] where \"you don\u2019t like it just because it\u2019s composed well. You don\u2019t like it just because they have great voices. You like it because of the way it makes you feel, sonically ... the deep, organic, soulful sound waves in it.\" He felt that music produced digitally could not replicate this quality and would be \"cutting corners\".<ref name=\"YoungeS2\" />\n\nThe series features onscreen performances by various artists, which Coker wanted to use to help capture the vibe of the neighborhood. Several of these songs are included on the soundtrack album,<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> including the single \"[[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\", featuring [[Method Man]], an original rap song featured in the episode \"[[Luke Cage (TV series)#ep12|Soliloquy of Chaos]]\". The track was arranged by Younge and Muhammad, and includes much of the socio-political commentary that showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker wished to convey throughout the series.<ref name=\"BulletproofLove\" /><ref name=\"LC112\" /> The track \"Requiem for Phife\", which is used in one of the biggest scenes of the series, was written by Muhammad as a tribute to his fellow [[A Tribe Called Quest]] member [[Phife Dawg|Malik \"Phife Dawg\" Taylor]], who died while Muhammad was working on the score.<ref name=\"LiveScoreRecap\" />\n\n==Track listing==\nAll music by Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, except where noted.\n\n{{tracklist\n|collapsed       = \n|headline        = Disc 1\n|title1          = Good Man\n|note1           = by [[Raphael Saadiq]]\n|length1         = 3:45\n|title2          = [[Mesmerized (song)|Mesmerized]]\n|note2           = by [[Faith Evans]]\n|length2         = 4:07\n|title3          = Ain't It a Sin\n|note3           = by [[Charles Bradley (singer)|Charles Bradley]]\n|length3         = 3:50\n|title4          = Stop And Look (And You Have Found Love)\n|note4           = by Adrian Younge and [[The Delfonics]]\n|length4         = 2:46\n|title5          = [[100 Days, 100 Nights]]\n|note5           = by [[Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings]]\n|length5         = 3:43\n|title6          = Diamondback Arrives\n|length6         = 2:52\n|title7          = Final Battle \u2013 Part 1\n|length7         = 1:44\n|title8          = In the Wind\n|length8         = 2:22\n|title9          = Diamondback's Trap\n|length9         = 1:42\n|title10         = Blue Fusion\n|length10        = 2:41\n|title11         = Final Battle \u2013 Part 2\n|length11        = 2:14\n|title12         = I'm Luke Cage\n|length12        = 1:17\n|title13         = Street Cleaning\n|length13        = 2:13\n|title14         = The Ambush\n|length14        = 2:05\n|title15         = End Theme\n|length15        = 1:41\n|title16         = Coffee at Midnight\n|length16        = 1:31\n|title17         = Red-Handedly Blameless\n|length17        = 2:57\n|title18         = Always Forward Pops\n|length18        = 1:19\n|title19         = Unveil the Bride\n|length19        = 1:46\n|title20         = Shameek's Death\n|length20        = 2:19\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n|collapsed       = \n|headline        = Disc 2\n|title21         = The Plan\n|length21        = 1:48\n|title22         = Requiem for Phife\n|length22        = 3:43\n|title23         = We Had Coffee\n|length23        = 0:55\n|title24         = Pops Is Gone\n|length24        = 2:48\n|title25         = Theme\n|length25        = 1:09\n|title26         = Greed Becomes Me\n|length26        = 0:35\n|title27         = [[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\n|note27          = featuring [[Method Man]]\n|length27        = 2:12\n|title28         = Microphone Check Five'O\n|length28        = 0:56\n|title29         = Luke's Freedom\n|length29        = 4:52\n|title30         = Uptown Claire\n|length30        = 0:43\n|title31         = Shades Beware\n|length31        = 0:44\n|title32         = Misty Resolute\n|length32        = 1:28\n|title33         = Fresh Air\n|length33        = 1:24\n|title34         = Kinda Strong\n|length34        = 0:37\n|title35         = Big Man Little Jacket\n|length35        = 1:06\n|title36         = Scarfe's Dying\n|length36        = 2:17\n|title37         = Claire's Wisdom\n|length37        = 1:13\n|title38         = Gun Threat\n|length38        = 2:40\n|title39         = Bad Love\n|length39        = 1:16\n|title40         = Finding Chico\n|length40        = 1:22\n|title41         = I Am Carl Lucas\n|length41        = 1:04\n|title42         = Crispus Attucks\n|length42        = 0:47\n|title43         = Hideout\n|length43        = 2:27\n|title44         = Cuban Coffee\n|length44        = 0:44\n|title45         = Like a Brother\n|length45        = 1:24\n|title46         = Cottonmouth's Clamp\n|length46        = 1:38\n|title47         = Survival\n|length47        = 1:01\n|title48         = Cottonmouth Theme\n|length48        = 0:19\n|title49         = Luke Cops\n|length49        = 1:12\n|title50         = Crushin' On Reva\n|length50        = 1:07\n|title51         = Beloved Reva\n|length51        = 1:24\n}}\n\n==Release==\nIn July 2016, Coker revealed plans for a vinyl soundtrack album for the series, to be produced by Younge and Muhammad.<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> On September 30, \"Bulletproof Love\" was released digitally as a single alongside the release of the television series on Netflix.<ref name=\"BulletproofLove\" /> On October 6, Younge and Muhammad held a concert at [[Ace Hotel Los Angeles|the Theatre at Ace Hotel, Los Angeles]], with a 40-piece orchestra conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson performing their score for the series.

The soundtrack was released on October 7, 2016, digitally and with a vinyl release by Mondo.\n\nYounge and Muhammad were asked to join the series by showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker, and strove to write a score inspired by hip hop. They were given a full orchestra to record the score with. In addition to their music, the soundtrack includes songs from various artists that gave onscreen performances during the season, including the original song \"[[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\" featuring [[Method Man]], which was also released before the album as a single.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nIn April 2016, ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'' showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the series' score, describing it as \"a '90s hip-hop vibe\" with \"a lot of different musical appearances\".<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Younge and Muhammad spotted each episode together with the episode's director, then went off and worked on certain cues each, though the two did work on some cues together.<ref name=\"LCVulture\" /> [[Marvel Television]], [[Netflix]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] were extremely supportive of Younge and Muhammad's artistic process after hearing their first work for the series (the duo started by composing the bookending music of the second episode), asking them to \"push\" the sound of the score as far as they could, and allowing them the use of a full, 30-piece orchestra for recording.<ref name=\"LCUrbanDaily\" /> The score was orchestrated and conducted by [[Miguel Atwood-Ferguson]],<ref name=\"LCUrbanDaily\" /> and recorded and mixed at [[Raphael Saadiq]]'s studio.<ref name=\"LCVulture\" />\n\nMarvel did criticize the initial theme music that Younge and Muhammad wrote for the series, which was inspired by the \"British library music\" of [[Alan Tew]]. Coker wanted to use the music, but the studio felt that it was too slow to play over the opening credits. They eventually agreed to use the music for the closing credits of each episode, and wrote a piece closer to \"classic\" theme music for the opening. They still made this \"more funky, and kind of crazy\" compared to traditional themes, and Marvel praised it. For Younge, it was important that the music for the series be recorded using analog technologies, comparing it to the music of [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] where \"you don\u2019t like it just because it\u2019s composed well. You don\u2019t like it just because they have great voices. You like it because of the way it makes you feel, sonically ... the deep, organic, soulful sound waves in it.\" He felt that music produced digitally could not replicate this quality and would be \"cutting corners\".<ref name=\"YoungeS2\" />\n\nThe series features onscreen performances by various artists, which Coker wanted to use to help capture the vibe of the neighborhood. Several of these songs are included on the soundtrack album,<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> including the single \"[[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\", featuring [[Method Man]], an original rap song featured in the episode \"[[Luke Cage (TV series)#ep12|Soliloquy of Chaos]]\". The track was arranged by Younge and Muhammad, and includes much of the socio-political commentary that showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker wished to convey throughout the series.<ref name=\"BulletproofLove\" /><ref name=\"LC112\" /> The track \"Requiem for Phife\", which is used in one of the biggest scenes of the series, was written by Muhammad as a tribute to his fellow [[A Tribe Called Quest]] member [[Phife Dawg|Malik \"Phife Dawg\" Taylor]], who died while Muhammad was working on the score.<ref name=\"LiveScoreRecap\" />\n\n==Track listing==\nAll music by Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, except where noted.\n\n{{tracklist\n|collapsed       = \n|headline        = Disc 1\n|title1          = Good Man\n|note1           = by [[Raphael Saadiq]]\n|length1         = 3:45\n|title2          = [[Mesmerized (song)|Mesmerized]]\n|note2           = by [[Faith Evans]]\n|length2         = 4:07\n|title3          = Ain't It a Sin\n|note3           = by [[Charles Bradley (singer)|Charles Bradley]]\n|length3         = 3:50\n|title4          = Stop And Look (And You Have Found Love)\n|note4           = by Adrian Younge and [[The Delfonics]]\n|length4         = 2:46\n|title5          = [[100 Days, 100 Nights]]\n|note5           = by [[Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings]]\n|length5         = 3:43\n|title6          = Diamondback Arrives\n|length6         = 2:52\n|title7          = Final Battle \u2013 Part 1\n|length7         = 1:44\n|title8          = In the Wind\n|length8         = 2:22\n|title9          = Diamondback's Trap\n|length9         = 1:42\n|title10         = Blue Fusion\n|length10        = 2:41\n|title11         = Final Battle \u2013 Part 2\n|length11        = 2:14\n|title12         = I'm Luke Cage\n|length12        = 1:17\n|title13         = Street Cleaning\n|length13        = 2:13\n|title14         = The Ambush\n|length14        = 2:05\n|title15         = End Theme\n|length15        = 1:41\n|title16         = Coffee at Midnight\n|length16        = 1:31\n|title17         = Red-Handedly Blameless\n|length17        = 2:57\n|title18         = Always Forward Pops\n|length18        = 1:19\n|title19         = Unveil the Bride\n|length19        = 1:46\n|title20         = Shameek's Death\n|length20        = 2:19\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n|collapsed       = \n|headline        = Disc 2\n|title21         = The Plan\n|length21        = 1:48\n|title22         = Requiem for Phife\n|length22        = 3:43\n|title23         = We Had Coffee\n|length23        = 0:55\n|title24         = Pops Is Gone\n|length24        = 2:48\n|title25         = Theme\n|length25        = 1:09\n|title26         = Greed Becomes Me\n|length26        = 0:35\n|title27         = [[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\n|note27          = featuring [[Method Man]]\n|length27        = 2:12\n|title28         = Microphone Check Five'O\n|length28        = 0:56\n|title29         = Luke's Freedom\n|length29        = 4:52\n|title30         = Uptown Claire\n|length30        = 0:43\n|title31         = Shades Beware\n|length31        = 0:44\n|title32         = Misty Resolute\n|length32        = 1:28\n|title33         = Fresh Air\n|length33        = 1:24\n|title34         = Kinda Strong\n|length34        = 0:37\n|title35         = Big Man Little Jacket\n|length35        = 1:06\n|title36         = Scarfe's Dying\n|length36        = 2:17\n|title37         = Claire's Wisdom\n|length37        = 1:13\n|title38         = Gun Threat\n|length38        = 2:40\n|title39         = Bad Love\n|length39        = 1:16\n|title40         = Finding Chico\n|length40        = 1:22\n|title41         = I Am Carl Lucas\n|length41        = 1:04\n|title42         = Crispus Attucks\n|length42        = 0:47\n|title43         = Hideout\n|length43        = 2:27\n|title44         = Cuban Coffee\n|length44        = 0:44\n|title45         = Like a Brother\n|length45        = 1:24\n|title46         = Cottonmouth's Clamp\n|length46        = 1:38\n|title47         = Survival\n|length47        = 1:01\n|title48         = Cottonmouth Theme\n|length48        = 0:19\n|title49         = Luke Cops\n|length49        = 1:12\n|title50         = Crushin' On Reva\n|length50        = 1:07\n|title51         = Beloved Reva\n|length51        = 1:24\n}}\n\n==Release==\nIn July 2016, Coker revealed plans for a vinyl soundtrack album for the series, to be produced by Younge and Muhammad.<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> On September 30, \"Bulletproof Love\" was released digitally as a single alongside the release of the television series on Netflix.<ref name=\"BulletproofLove\" /> On October 6, Younge and Muhammad held a concert at [[Ace Hotel Los Angeles|the Theatre at Ace Hotel, Los Angeles]], with a 40-piece orchestra conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson performing their score for the series.

The album is compiled of reworked tracks from the ''Purest Feeling'' demo, as well as songs composed after its original recording. Production of the record was handled by Flood and Trent Reznor, among other contributors.\n\nThe album bears little in resemblance to NIN's succeeding work, featuring a more synth-driven electronic sound blended with industrial and rock elements. Lyrically, it contains themes of angst and betrayal, in addition to the recurring theme of lovesickness. The record was promoted with three singles: \"[[Down in It]]\", \"[[Head Like a Hole|Head Like A Hole]]\", and \"[[Sin (nine inch nails song)|Sin]]\", as well as an accompanying tour, the ''[[Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series]].'' A remastered edition was also released in 2010.\n\nAlthough the record was commercially successful, reaching number 75 in the US, and received highly favorable reviews from critics, Reznor, the band's only constant member at the time, feuded with TVT over promotion of the album, which later led him to sign with [[Interscope Records]]. ''Pretty Hate Machine'' was later certified triple-platinum by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], becoming one of the first independently released albums to do so, and was included on several lists of the best releases of the 1980s.\n\n==Background==\nDuring working nights as a [[handyman]] and [[engineer]] at the Right Track Studio in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], Reznor used studio \"down-time\" to record and develop his own music.<ref name=\"Huey\">{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Nine Inch Nails|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5033|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref> Playing most of the [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[drum machine]]s, [[guitar]]s, and [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] himself, he recorded a demo.

Reznor received contract offers from many of the labels, but eventually signed with [[TVT Records]], who were known mainly for releasing [[Novelty record|novelty]] and television [[jingle]] records. ''Pretty Hate Machine'' was recorded in various studios with Reznor collaborating with some of his most idolized producers: [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], Keith LeBlanc, [[Adrian Sherwood]], and [[John Fryer (music)|John Fryer]]. Much like his recorded demo, Reznor refused to record the album with a conventional band, recording ''Pretty Hate Machine'' mostly by himself.\n\n\"A lot of it sounds immature to me now,\" he stated in 1991 of the recordings that were then two years old. \"At first it totally sucked. I became completely withdrawn. I couldn't function in society very well. And the LP became a product of that. It's quite small scale, introverted, claustrophobic \u2013 that's the feel I went for.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Neil|title=Hard as Nails|journal=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|location=London|issue=9|date=March 1991}}</ref>\n\nReznor discussed the recording and touring of ''Pretty Hate Machine'' in the April 1990 issue of [[Keyboard (magazine)|''Keyboard'']]. He used an [[E-mu Emax]] because it produced a high-end buzzing noise when transposing down sounds.<ref name=\":0\" /> Rough and first takes of vocals and guitar were used to contrast the quantized drums and bass.<ref name=\":0\" /> Reznor hated the factory sounds of the Emax but had not transferred anything from his old [[E-mu Emulator|Emulator]], and used samples from his record collection for all the drum sounds. He initially expected to use real drum sounds when recording the album, but in the end he and the producers merely equalized his drum samples.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the album was released, a recording known as ''Purest Feeling'' surfaced. The [[bootleg album]] contains the original demo recordings of most of the tracks featured on ''Pretty Hate Machine'', as well as a couple that were not used (\"Purest Feeling\", \"Maybe Just Once\" and an instrumental introduction to \"Sanctified\" called \"Slate\").{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nUnlike the [[industrial music]] of Nine Inch Nails' contemporaries, ''Pretty Hate Machine'' displays catchy [[riff (music)|riffs]] and [[verse-chorus form|verse-chorus]] song structures rather than repetitive electronic beats.<ref name=\"Huey1\" /> Reznor's lyrics express adolescent angst and feelings of betrayal by lovers, society, or God.<ref name=\"Huey1\" /> Themes of despair are collocated with lovesick sentiments.<ref name=\"Pareles\" /> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s Tom Breihan categorized it as a [[synth-pop]] album that was shaped by industrial music's \"nascent [[New wave music|new-wave]] period rather than its subsequent styles.\"<ref name=\"Breihan\" /> According to Breihan, the beats were muscular, but not in the vein of [[heavy metal music|metal]] or [[post-punk]], and that the most [[rock music|rock]]-inspired song on the album was \"[[Head Like a Hole]]\".<ref name=\"Breihan\" /> \n\nMusic journalist [[Jon Pareles]] described the album as \"[[Electronic rock|electro-rock]] or [[industrial rock]], using drum machines, computerized synthesizer riffs and obviously processed sounds to detail, and usually denounce, an artificial world.\"<ref name=\"Pareles\" /> Tom Popson of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called it a [[electronic dance music|dance]] album that is partly characterized by [[industrial dance music|industrial dance]]'s aggressive sound: \"Reznor's electronics-plus-guitar LP also carries a brighter techno-pop element that might remind some of Depeche Mode.

Segments of Prince's \"[[Alphabet St.]]\" and Jane's Addiction's \"[[Nothing's Shocking|Had a Dad]]\" can be heard in \"Ringfinger\", unlike the other samples which were edited or distorted in order to be unrecognizable, such as the introduction to \"Kinda I Want To\". \"Something I Can Never Have\" features unused backing tracks created by John Fryer for [[This Mortal Coil]].<ref name=\":0\" /> A speech from ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' was sampled at low volume during the pause in \"Sanctified\". On the album's 2010 reissue, this sample is not present, most likely due to clearance issues.\n\nReznor stated, \"I was tempted to lay in more of other people\u2018s stuff, but I thought that would lend a real dated quality to the record, seeing where that has gone the way it has in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]].\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Time constraints similarly prevented him from accumulating \"good sounds\" as he wanted.<ref name=\":0\" /> He obtained \"weird percussion tracks\" by sampling loops from artists like Public Enemy, playing them backwards and modulating them in Macintosh Turbosynth with an oscillator tuned to the pitch of the song, obtaining \"this weird flanging-type thing that\u2018s in key\".<ref name=\":0\" /> He said that \"every drum fill on 'Terrible Lie' is lifted intact from somewhere.

October 20, 1989 by [[TVT Records]]. The album is compiled of reworked tracks from the ''Purest Feeling'' demo, as well as songs composed after its original recording. Production of the record was handled by Flood and Trent Reznor, among other contributors.\n\nThe album bears little in resemblance to NIN's succeeding work, featuring a more synth-driven electronic sound blended with industrial and rock elements. Lyrically, it contains themes of angst and betrayal, in addition to the recurring theme of lovesickness. The record was promoted with three singles: \"[[Down in It]]\", \"[[Head Like a Hole|Head Like A Hole]]\", and \"[[Sin (nine inch nails song)|Sin]]\", as well as an accompanying tour, the ''[[Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series]].'' A remastered edition was also released in 2010.\n\nAlthough the record was commercially successful, reaching number 75 in the US, and received highly favorable reviews from critics, Reznor, the band's only constant member at the time, feuded with TVT over promotion of the album, which later led him to sign with [[Interscope Records]]. ''Pretty Hate Machine'' was later certified triple-platinum by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], becoming one of the first independently released albums to do so, and was included on several lists of the best releases of the 1980s.\n\n==Background==\nDuring working nights as a [[handyman]] and [[engineer]] at the Right Track Studio in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], Reznor used studio \"down-time\" to record and develop his own music.<ref name=\"Huey\">{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Nine Inch Nails|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5033|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref> Playing most of the [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[drum machine]]s, [[guitar]]s, and [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] himself, he recorded a demo. The [[music sequencer|sequencing]] was done on a [[Macintosh Plus]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Mathew|last=Honan|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1384/2002/02/reznor.html|title=Pro File: Nailing a New Look|work=[[Macworld]]|date=February 1, 2002|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}</ref> Reznor mainly used a [[Prophet VS]], [[Oberheim Xpander]], and [[Minimoog]] as synthesizers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Doerschuk|first=Robert L.|date=April 1990|title=Nine Inch Nails \u2013 Trent Reznor hits college radio on the head with a tough, sharp solo album|url=http://www.nin-pages.de/1990_Keyboard_April_english.htm|journal=[[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nWith the help of manager [[John Malm, Jr.]], he sent the demo to various [[record label]]s. Reznor received contract offers from many of the labels, but eventually signed with [[TVT Records]], who were known mainly for releasing [[Novelty record|novelty]] and television [[jingle]] records. ''Pretty Hate Machine'' was recorded in various studios with Reznor collaborating with some of his most idolized producers: [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], Keith LeBlanc, [[Adrian Sherwood]], and [[John Fryer (music)|John Fryer]]. Much like his recorded demo, Reznor refused to record the album with a conventional band, recording ''Pretty Hate Machine'' mostly by himself.\n\n\"A lot of it sounds immature to me now,\" he stated in 1991 of the recordings that were then two years old. \"At first it totally sucked. I became completely withdrawn. I couldn't function in society very well. And the LP became a product of that. It's quite small scale, introverted, claustrophobic \u2013 that's the feel I went for.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Neil|title=Hard as Nails|journal=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|location=London|issue=9|date=March 1991}}</ref>\n\nReznor discussed the recording and touring of ''Pretty Hate Machine'' in the April 1990 issue of [[Keyboard (magazine)|''Keyboard'']]. He used an [[E-mu Emax]] because it produced a high-end buzzing noise when transposing down sounds.<ref name=\":0\" /> Rough and first takes of vocals and guitar were used to contrast the quantized drums and bass.<ref name=\":0\" /> Reznor hated the factory sounds of the Emax but had not transferred anything from his old [[E-mu Emulator|Emulator]], and used samples from his record collection for all the drum sounds. He initially expected to use real drum sounds when recording the album, but in the end he and the producers merely equalized his drum samples.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the album was released, a recording known as ''Purest Feeling'' surfaced. The [[bootleg album]] contains the original demo recordings of most of the tracks featured on ''Pretty Hate Machine'', as well as a couple that were not used (\"Purest Feeling\", \"Maybe Just Once\" and an instrumental introduction to \"Sanctified\" called \"Slate\").{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nUnlike the [[industrial music]] of Nine Inch Nails' contemporaries, ''Pretty Hate Machine'' displays catchy [[riff (music)|riffs]] and [[verse-chorus form|verse-chorus]] song structures rather than repetitive electronic beats.<ref name=\"Huey1\" /> Reznor's lyrics express adolescent angst and feelings of betrayal by lovers, society, or God.<ref name=\"Huey1\" /> Themes of despair are collocated with lovesick sentiments.<ref name=\"Pareles\" /> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s Tom Breihan categorized it as a [[synth-pop]] album that was shaped by industrial music's \"nascent [[New wave music|new-wave]] period rather than its subsequent styles.\"<ref name=\"Breihan\" /> According to Breihan, the beats were muscular, but not in the vein of [[heavy metal music|metal]] or [[post-punk]], and that the most [[rock music|rock]]-inspired song on the album was \"[[Head Like a Hole]]\".<ref name=\"Breihan\" /> \n\nMusic journalist [[Jon Pareles]] described the album as \"[[Electronic rock|electro-rock]] or [[industrial rock]], using drum machines, computerized synthesizer riffs and obviously processed sounds to detail, and usually denounce, an artificial world.\"<ref name=\"Pareles\" /> Tom Popson of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called it a [[electronic dance music|dance]] album that is partly characterized by [[industrial dance music|industrial dance]]'s aggressive sound: \"Reznor's electronics-plus-guitar LP also carries a brighter techno-pop element that might remind some of Depeche Mode.

Segments of Prince's \"[[Alphabet St.]]\" and Jane's Addiction's \"[[Nothing's Shocking|Had a Dad]]\" can be heard in \"Ringfinger\", unlike the other samples which were edited or distorted in order to be unrecognizable, such as the introduction to \"Kinda I Want To\". \"Something I Can Never Have\" features unused backing tracks created by John Fryer for [[This Mortal Coil]].<ref name=\":0\" /> A speech from ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' was sampled at low volume during the pause in \"Sanctified\". On the album's 2010 reissue, this sample is not present, most likely due to clearance issues.\n\nReznor stated, \"I was tempted to lay in more of other people\u2018s stuff, but I thought that would lend a real dated quality to the record, seeing where that has gone the way it has in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]].\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Time constraints similarly prevented him from accumulating \"good sounds\" as he wanted.<ref name=\":0\" /> He obtained \"weird percussion tracks\" by sampling loops from artists like Public Enemy, playing them backwards and modulating them in Macintosh Turbosynth with an oscillator tuned to the pitch of the song, obtaining \"this weird flanging-type thing that\u2018s in key\".<ref name=\":0\" /> He said that \"every drum fill on 'Terrible Lie' is lifted intact from somewhere.

Mike becomes fearful that Hector may discover his role in removing Tuco from the family's operations.  He attempts to draw police attention to the Salamanca operation by hijacking one of the trucks used to smuggle drugs over the Mexican border, leaving the driver tied up at the side of the road and stealing the {{USD|250,000}} hidden in one of the tires.

Nacho objects, but fails to change Hector's mind.  To protect his father, Nacho reveals his involvement in the Salamanca organization. Manuel accepts Hector's initial payment after Nacho convinces him doing so is for his own safety. Nacho realizes Hector suffers from angina and decides to try to kill him by replacing his nitroglycerin with an ibuprofen [[placebo]] in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack.  Mike advises Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately take the placebos from Hector and replace them with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death will not be obvious.\n\nNacho succeeds in making the switch, but Hector does not die, so Nacho plans to shoot him.  Before he can act, Nacho is notified to attend a meeting with [[Gus Fring]], Juan Bolsa, and Hector. Bolsa informs Hector that cartel leader Don Eladio has decreed that since Hector's trucks are no longer viable for smuggling drugs, the cartel will make the transport of Hector's drugs via Gus's trucks a permanent arrangement. An outraged Hector has a stroke and falls to the ground unconscious.  Gus performs first aid while awaiting an ambulance, and succeeds in saving Hector's life, though he remains comatose. Nacho takes the placebos from Hector and replaces them with the real medication. Gus seems to realize that something is amiss, but says nothing.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nBolsa tells Nacho that he and Arturo should run the Salamanca family while Hector is hospitalized.  Gus pays for Hector's specialized care to the point where his mental faculties are recovered and he can move the index finger of his right hand.  Gus reviews Hector's medical records and realizes there is no nitroglycerin in his system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him.  When Nacho and Arturo arrive at Gus' chicken farm to pick up their next cocaine shipment, Arturo takes six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five, as Nacho did on a previous occasion.  As they leave, Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo with a plastic bag.  Gus reveals that he is aware of Nacho's attempt to kill Hector, and that if Nacho does not follow Gus' orders, Gus will inform the Salamancas.  Nacho, Victor, and Tyrus fake an ambush site on a remote road, shooting bullet holes in Nacho's car, setting the car on fire, and shooting Nacho.\n\nNacho is treated by veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving his life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho to the Espinosas, a rival gang. The Cousins arrive and Nacho falsely identifies the Espinosas as the ones who attacked him.  The Cousins attack the Espinosa compound, kill everyone inside, and recover the \"stolen\" drugs.  Nacho sees that by wiping out the Espinosas, Gus has secured more drug territory for himself, but does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.  Nacho goes to his father's house to recover, and Manuel takes him in despite being unhappy about Nacho's ties to the Salamancas.  After recovering, Nacho takes on a more prominent role in the Salamanca organization, but also keeps a safe with cash and fake Canadian IDs for himself and his father. Nacho is surprised when Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in running the business, and takes a stronger interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Coushatta|episode-link=Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|series=Better Call Saul|series-link=Better Call Saul|network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|date=September 24, 2018|season=4|number=8}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nUnder Gus' orders, Nacho replaces some of the Salamanca cocaine supply with inferior, locally produced methamphetamine.

When police identify a Salamanca drug house and arrest Domingo, Nacho sneaks over rooftops to recover the drug stash before police enter, which impresses Lalo, who begins to take Nacho into his confidence.  Lalo is concerned that Domingo will talk in jail, so he and Nacho arrange to secure Domingo's release by providing police information on Gus's dead drops. Nacho reports this plan to Gus.  Gus decides to keep the dead drops in place, despite the likely loss of $700,000 in cash, because removing them would reveal to Lalo that someone is providing inside information about the Salamancas.\n\nGus, Victor, and Mike meet with Nacho and Nacho pretends not to recognize Mike. He reports on Lalo's plan to give police the locations of Gus's street dealers and Gus tells Nacho to report to Mike from now on. Nacho attempts to warn Mike about Gus's ruthlessness, but Mike reminds Nacho that he warned Nacho about the risk Nacho was taking when he attempted to kill Hector Salamanca.{{efn|from \"[[Expenses (Better Call Saul)|Expenses]]\"}} Mike secretly points the police to Lalo's car and its connection to the murder of Fred, the money wire store clerk.{{efn|from \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\"}} Nacho calls Mike to report Lalo's location.

To preserve Nacho's role as his mole in the Salamanca organization, Gus and Nacho vandalize his flagship restaurant and set off an explosion that burns it down. Nacho enlists Jimmy to represent Lalo. Gus desires Lalo's release, so Mike provides Jimmy information on the investigation he did of Lalo under an assumed name. Jimmy uses the details to secure Lalo's release on US$7 million cash bail. Lalo has Jimmy pick up the cash funds for bail from The Cousins at a remote location in the desert. On his way back, Jimmy is attacked by gunmen, but Mike was tracking him for Gus and kills all but one attacker. The surviving gunman escapes in the only attacker's vehicle that is still drivable. Mike's truck was also damaged, so Mike and Jimmy begin the drive back to Albuquerque in Jimmy's car. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of he road and walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. After killing the surviving gunman and walking for two days in the desert, Jimmy and Mike make their way back to Albuquerque and Jimmy posts Lalo's bail. Jimmy says he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked cross-country so he would not risk losing the money. Lalo says he will return to Mexico to avoid police scrutiny. Mike reports on the attack to Gus, who realizes Juan Bolsa engineered the attack to protect Gus's business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho no longer wants to be his informant on the Salamanca organization, and express his unhappiness at Gus threatening Nacho's father to obtain Nacho's compliance. Gus refuses to part with a valuable asset, and Mike silently leaves his office.\n\nNacho informs Mike of Lalo's plan to return to Mexico. Lalo says goodbye to Hector and Nacho brings him to the same pickup site where Jimmy received the money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, he searches for Jimmy's car. After finding it, he tells Nacho they are returning to Albuquerque. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Nacho and Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. Nacho waits in his car while Lalo goes inside. Unseen by Nacho, Mike trains a sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby rooftop. Lalo asks Jimmy to repeat the story of his desert trek several times, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo appears satisfied with Kim's argument and departs. After Lalo gets back in Nacho's car, he tells Nacho they are going to Mexico, but not to the original pick up site.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Bad Choice Road |episode-link=Bad Choice Road |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 13, 2020 |season=5 |number=9}}</ref>\n\nNacho and Lalo arrive at Lalo's home in [[Chihuahua_(state)|Chihuahua]] where they are greeted by Lalo's family and friends. Mike informs Gus, who says he has sent gunmen to kill Lalo and that Nacho may be able to help. Nacho receives a call telling him to unlock Lalo's back gate at 3 a.m. and he asks the caller to spare Lalo's family. Lalo prepares Nacho for his first meeting with Don Eladio. At the meeting, Lalo presents an expensive sports car and stash of cash to Eladio, for which he gives Nacho credit. Lalo introduces Nacho as an associate of Tuco's and explains that he will manage the Salamanca drug business while Lalo stays in Mexico. Nacho favorably impresses Eladio, who gives his blessing to Nacho's plans for expansion of the Salamanca's territory. Lalo is awake at 3 a.m., so Nacho sets a kitchen fire as a distraction. While Lalo investigates, Nacho opens the back gate and flees. The gunmen enter, kill Lalo's family and guards and wound Lalo, but Lalo escapes through a tunnel that leads outside the security wall of his home. He sneaks back in and kills all but one of the gunmen, then forces the survivor to call the middleman who arranged the killing and report that Lalo is dead.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Something Unforgivable|episode-link=Something Unforgivable|series=Better Call Saul|series-link=Better Call Saul|network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|date=April 20, 2020|season=5|number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\nNacho did not appear in ''Breaking Bad'', but is named in the second-season episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", the same episode that introduced Saul Goodman.

Mike advises Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately take the placebos from Hector and replace them with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death won't be obvious.\n\nNacho succeeds in making the switch, but Hector does not die, so Nacho plans to shoot him.  Before he can act, Nacho is notified to attend a meeting with [[Gus Fring]], Juan Bolsa, and Hector. Bolsa informs Hector that cartel leader Don Eladio has decreed that since Hector's trucks are no longer viable for smuggling drugs, the cartel will make the transport of Hector's drugs via Gus's trucks a permanent arrangement. An outraged Hector has a stroke and falls to the ground unconscious.  Gus performs first aid while awaiting an ambulance, and succeeds in saving Hector's life, though he remains comatose. Nacho takes the placebos from Hector and replaces them with the real medication. Gus seems to realize that something is amiss, but says nothing.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nBolsa tells Nacho that he and Arturo should run the Salamanca family while Hector is hospitalized.  Gus pays for Hector's specialized care to the point where his mental faculties are recovered and he can move the index finger of his right hand.  Gus reviews Hector's medical records and realizes there is no nitroglycerin in his system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him.  When Nacho and Arturo arrive at Gus' chicken farm to pick up their next cocaine shipment, Arturo takes six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five, as Nacho did on a previous occasion.  As they leave, Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo with a plastic bag.  Gus reveals that he is aware of Nacho's attempt to kill Hector, and that if Nacho does not follow Gus' orders, Gus will inform the Salamancas.  Nacho, Victor, and Tyrus fake an ambush site on a remote road, shooting bullet holes in Nacho's car, setting the car on fire, and shooting Nacho.\n\nNacho is treated by veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving his life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho to the Espinosas, a rival gang. The Cousins arrive and Nacho falsely identifies the Espinosas as the ones who attacked him.  The Cousins attack the Espinosa compound, kill everyone inside, and recover the \"stolen\" drugs.  Nacho sees that by wiping out the Espinosas, Gus has secured more drug territory for himself, but does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.  Nacho goes to his father's house to recover, and Manuel takes him in despite being unhappy about Nacho's ties to the Salamancas.  After recovering, Nacho takes on a more prominent role in the Salamanca organization, but also keeps a safe with cash and fake Canadian IDs for himself and his father. Nacho is surprised when Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in running the business, and takes a stronger interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Coushatta|episode-link=Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|series=Better Call Saul|series-link=Better Call Saul|network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|date=September 24, 2018|season=4|number=8}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nUnder Gus' orders, Nacho replaces some of the Salamanca cocaine supply with inferior, locally produced methamphetamine.  Buyer complaints lead Lalo to meet with Gus and Juan Bolsa.  Gus presents a cover story about Werner Ziegler, of whose activities Lalo was partly aware.{{efn|from \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\"}}  Gus claims Werner was working on a legitimate construction project at the chicken farm and stole cocaine, which Gus then replaced with meth. The story explains the events of which Lalo is aware&nbsp;\u2013 Werner's work for Gus and escape, Mike's pursuit, and Werner's death.

When police identify a Salamanca drug house and arrest Domingo, Nacho sneaks over rooftops to recover the drug stash before police enter, which impresses Lalo, who begins to take Nacho into his confidence.  Lalo is concerned that Domingo will talk in jail, so he and Nacho arrange to secure Domingo's release by providing police information on Gus's dead drops. Nacho reports this plan to Gus.  Gus decides to keep the dead drops in place, despite the likely loss of $700,000 in cash, because removing them would reveal to Lalo that someone is providing inside information about the Salamancas.\n\nGus, Victor, and Mike meet with Nacho and Nacho pretends not to recognize Mike. He reports on Lalo's plan to give police the locations of Gus's street dealers and Gus tells Nacho to report to Mike from now on. Nacho attempts to warn Mike about Gus's ruthlessness, but Mike reminds Nacho that he warned Nacho about the risk Nacho was taking when he attempted to kill Hector Salamanca.{{efn|from \"[[Expenses (Better Call Saul)|Expenses]]\"}} Mike secretly points the police to Lalo's car and its connection to the murder of Fred, the money wire store clerk.{{efn|from \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\"}} Nacho calls Mike to report Lalo's location. Mike uses a police radio and pretends to be an officer requesting a check of Lalo's licence plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo while he is driving and detain him.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Wexler v.

To preserve Nacho's role as his mole in the Salamanca organization, Gus and Nacho vandalize his flagship restaurant and set off an explosion that burns it down. Nacho enlists Jimmy to represent Lalo. Gus desires Lalo's release, so Mike provides Jimmy information on the investigation he did of Lalo under an assumed name. Jimmy uses the details to secure Lalo's release on US$7 million cash bail. Lalo has Jimmy pick up the cash funds for bail from The Cousins at a remote location in the desert. On his way back, Jimmy is attacked by gunmen, but Mike was tracking him for Gus and kills all but one attacker. The surviving gunman escapes in the only attacker's vehicle that is still drivable. Mike's truck was also damaged, so Mike and Jimmy begin the drive back to Albuquerque in Jimmy's car. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of he road and walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. After killing the surviving gunman and walking for two days in the desert, Jimmy and Mike make their way back to Albuquerque and Jimmy posts Lalo's bail. Jimmy says he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked cross-country so he would not risk losing the money. Lalo says he will return to Mexico to avoid police scrutiny. Mike reports on the attack to Gus, who realizes Juan Bolsa engineered the attack to protect Gus's business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho no longer wants to be his informant on the Salamanca organization, and express his unhappiness at Gus threatening Nacho's father to obtain Nacho's compliance. Gus refuses to part with a valuable asset, and Mike silently leaves his office.\n\nNacho informs Mike of Lalo's plan to return to Mexico. Lalo says goodbye to Hector and Nacho brings him to the same pickup site where Jimmy received the money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, he searches for Jimmy's car. After finding it, he tells Nacho they are returning to Albuquerque. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Nacho and Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. Nacho waits in his car while Lalo goes inside. Unseen by Nacho, Mike trains a sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby rooftop. Lalo asks Jimmy to repeat the story of his desert trek several times, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo appears satisfied with Kim's argument and departs. After Lalo gets back in Nacho's car, he tells Nacho they are going to Mexico, but not to the original pick up site.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Bad Choice Road |episode-link=Bad Choice Road |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 13, 2020 |season=5 |number=9}}</ref>\n\nNacho and Lalo arrive at Lalo's home in [[Chihuahua_(state)|Chihuahua]] where they are greeted by Lalo's family and friends. Mike informs Gus, who says he has sent gunmen to kill Lalo and that Nacho may be able to help. Nacho receives a call telling him to unlock Lalo's back gate at 3 a.m. and he asks the caller to spare Lalo's family. Lalo prepares Nacho for his first meeting with Don Eladio. At the meeting, Lalo presents an expensive sports car and stash of cash to Eladio, for which he gives Nacho credit. Lalo introduces Nacho as an associate of Tuco's and explains that he will manage the Salamanca drug business while Lalo stays in Mexico. Nacho favorably impresses Eladio, who gives his blessing to Nacho's plans for expansion of the Salamanca's territory. Lalo is awake at 3 a.m., so Nacho sets a kitchen fire as a distraction. While Lalo investigates, Nacho opens the back gate and flees. The gunmen enter, kill Lalo's family and guards and wound Lalo, but Lalo escapes through a tunnel that leads outside the security wall of his home. He sneaks back in and kills all but one of the gunmen, then forces the survivor to call the middleman who arranged the killing and report that Lalo is dead.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Something Unforgivable|episode-link=Something Unforgivable|series=Better Call Saul|series-link=Better Call Saul|network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|date=April 20, 2020|season=5|number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\nNacho did not appear in ''Breaking Bad'', but is named in the second-season episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", the same episode that introduced Saul Goodman.
