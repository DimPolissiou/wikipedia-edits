Mr Hope left 15 months later, along with the girls, who were finally accommodated into the old building of the former [[Transvaal Republic]]'s ''Staatsmeischjeskool'' (State Girls' School), which was renamed [[Pretoria High School for Girls]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Pretoria College (1903-1909) ===\n\nUnder the new headmaster, Harold Atkinson, enrolment increased to 100 boys by 1903. The name of the school was also changed to ''Pretoria College''. Mr Atkinson left at the end of 1905 and was succeeded by J F Acheson who stayed with the school until it moved from Skinner Street to its current site in 1909. Formal devolution between primary and high school pupils only occurred in 1905.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== The new buildings and bilingualism (1910-1920) ===\n\nMilner's intention was to create a stable educational infrastructure in the new colony's capital and duly set aside {{convert|200|ha}} of ground to the south-east of central Pretoria for the construction of new academic institutions. The southern most {{convert|60|ha}}, which included the ''[[Waterkloof]] Kop'' (English: Waterkloof Hill), was chosen as the new site for Pretoria Boys High School. The architect, [[Patrick Eagle]], met the challenge by designing an edifice rivalling its larger contemporary, Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s [[Union Buildings]]. Eagle chose to site the main buildings on the ridge of the hill giving the school its well-known dramatic setting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\nOne year later, the four colonies of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], [[Orange Free State]], [[Natal Province|Natal]] and the [[Cape Colony|Cape]]  formed the [[Union of South Africa]]. Keen to forge unity between English and Dutch (Afrikaner) South Africans, Smuts' influence was evident when, on 6 April 1910, the school absorbed 100 boys and staff from the Dutch-medium Eendracht High School to form a dual-medium high school. The combined school was now named ''Pretoria High School for Boys - Pretoria Hogere school voor Jongens''. Smuts would later send his own sons to the school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Devolution and re-establishment (1920) ===\n\nThe dual-medium institution would last ten years. By 1920, the divide between English and Afrikaans speakers had become apparent nationwide; this was reflected in the need for a separate Afrikaans high school in Pretoria. Consequently, the [[Afrikaanse Ho\u00ebr Seunskool]] was formed immediately south of its parent, becoming the first Afrikaans-medium high school in the country, several years before [[Afrikaans]] attained official recognition as a language (and not a semi-[[Creole language|Creole]] of Dutch). The two schools enjoy close ties to this day, especially in an enthusiastic but friendly rivalry in sporting events, especially in the annual Rugby match, a highlight of the PBHS school year. PBHS would now be left in its present form, known as Pretoria Boys High School, an English-medium public school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Headmasters since 1909 ===\n\n* William Hofmeyr (1909-1935)\n* Daniel Matheson (1936-1949)\n* Noel Pollock (1950-1955)\n* Desmond Abernethy (1956-1973)\n* Malcolm Armstrong (1974-1989)\n* William E.

The shield component of the badge is divided into four quadrants, with the book representing learning, the tools the wealth of the Transvaal through gold mining, the tree growth and the ox wagon the Transvaal. The background colours of the four quadrants were the colours of the first four houses when given permanent names, i.e. Town red, Solomon gold, Sunnyside black and Rissik green.\n\n=== The school songs ===\n\nThe official school song, ''Tis Here We Learn To Live'', was written in the 1930s by two ''Old Boys''. The composer of the music, Dr George Findlay, was a prominent Pretoria [[dermatologist]]. However, the school later adopted [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]], originally the school song of [[Harrow School]] in [[London]]. It is this song that is sung at all school [[valedictions]]. The official school song was relegated to obscurity until it was revived as the school's rugby anthem.\n\n'Tis here we learn to live (Rugby Anthem)\n\nWe are ent'ring life together\n \nFree of sorrow and of care\n\nWith a youthful fire and vigour\n\nNought can e'er our hope impair\n\nThough we know indeed but little\n\nOf the life we have to dare\n\n'tis here we learn to live\n\n== Culture and activities ==\n\n=== Cultural activities ===\n\nCultural activities include a well-established musical tradition, with a formal [[symphony]] [[orchestra]], [[choir]], [[pipe band]], [[jazz]] ensemble and [[Folk music|folk]] group. Other activities include Photography, Fantasy and Historical war games, Aeronautical Society, Film, Wildlife, Drama, Debating, Chess, and many others.\n\n=== Athletics and leisure ===\n\nSporting facilities include soccer, [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standard athletics grounds, [[tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[basketball]] courts, a [[gym]]nasium, [[field hockey|hockey]] fields, two swimming pools including one for [[waterpolo]], an [[AstroTurf]] and a rock-climbing wall. There is also a man-made [[pine|pine forest]], an old [[shooting range]] which has been converted for the purpose of archery, an [[amphitheatre]] and an artificial lake, ''Loch Armstrong''. The grounds form a protected bird sanctuary and are home to several different species of birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.\n\n== School buildings ==\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\n=== Houses ===\n\nPretoria Boys High School is made up of ten constituent houses, each with its own unique culture and identity. House assemblies are held weekly, and house prefects are appointed annually. Annual inter-house sports meetings take place in which every pupil is strongly encouraged to participate. The inter-house swim meet (gala) is the most popular and well-attended of sport meetings.\n\n=== Boarding houses ===\n\n* Solomon\n* Rissik\n* School\n\n=== Day-boy houses ===\n\n* Abernethy\n* Arcadia\n* Armstrong\n* Hofmeyr\n* Matheson\n* Sunnyside\n* Town\n\n== The Old Boys Association ==\n\nPretoria Boys High School has a network of ''Old Boys'', forming one of the largest alumni organisations in South Africa. ''Pretoria Boys High School Old Boys Association'' publishes an annual journal and review, ''The Phobian'', which is distributed to ''Old Boys'' across the globe. Members of the association meet annually at the school for the annual dinner, and regular reunions of each matriculating group are organised 10, 20, 30 and 40 years on, echoing the refrain of the school song, [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]].\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n[[File:Max Theiler nobel.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Professor]] [[Max Theiler]] (1899\u20131972), 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] laureate, for developing a [[vaccine]] against [[yellow fever]]]]\n[[File:Nobel Prize 17 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Professor [[Michael Levitt]] (1947-), 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] laureate]]\n[[File:Edwin Cameron in robes.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Honourable]] [[Edwin Cameron]] (1953-), [[judge]] of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]]]]\n[[File:Elon Musk 2015.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Elon Musk]] (1971-), [[business magnate]] and founder of [[SpaceX]] and a co-founder of [[Zip2]], [[PayPal]], and [[Tesla Motors]]]]\nThe school has produced two [[List of South African Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize laureates]], eighteen [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholars]], eight [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] [[judge]]s, an [[archbishop]],{{clarify|date=June 2016}} two [[Premier League|English Premier League]] football players, seven national [[cricket]]ers and four [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] rugby players{{sfn|Illsley|2001}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Eddie Barlow]], South African cricketer\n* [[James Botten|Jackie Botten]], South African cricketer\n* [[Edwin Cameron]], Constitutional Court [[judge]] and AIDS activist\n* [[Billy Downer]], Advocate of the Supreme Court, National Prosecutor and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]]\n* [[David B.

At the time, the building served as a prison, where notably [[Winston Churchill]] was briefly imprisoned.<ref name=\"winstonchurchill.org\">The Churchill Centre: {{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/myths/churchill-trivia/540-war|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308071358/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/myths/churchill-trivia/540-war|archivedate=8 March 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=2013-02-16|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe school was part of the [[White South Africans|whites-only]] education system, until the abolition of [[apartheid]].\n\n=== Pretoria High School (1901-1903) ===\n\nWith Pretoria under British control, it became apparent to [[Lord Milner]], the [[Provincial Secretary|Colonial Secretary]] at the time, that the educational facilities in the city needed attention as there was no secondary school for English-speaking pupils. The [[Staats Model School]] was duly refurbished. It was renamed ''Pretoria High School'' and became the first of the so-called ''Milner schools'' in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], opening on 3 June 1901 with Charles Hope - who also founded [[Potchefstroom Boys High]] as [[headmaster]].  Initial enrolment was 32 pupils, both boys and girls, which increased to 132 by August of that year. Mr Hope left 15 months later, along with the girls, who were finally accommodated into the old building of the former [[Transvaal Republic]]'s ''Staatsmeischjeskool'' (State Girls' School), which was renamed [[Pretoria High School for Girls]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Pretoria College (1903-1909) ===\n\nUnder the new headmaster, Harold Atkinson, enrolment increased to 100 boys by 1903. The name of the school was also changed to ''Pretoria College''. Mr Atkinson left at the end of 1905 and was succeeded by J F Acheson who stayed with the school until it moved from Skinner Street to its current site in 1909. Formal devolution between primary and high school pupils only occurred in 1905.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== The new buildings and bilingualism (1910-1920) ===\n\nMilner's intention was to create a stable educational infrastructure in the new colony's capital and duly set aside {{convert|200|ha}} of ground to the south-east of central Pretoria for the construction of new academic institutions. The southern most {{convert|60|ha}}, which included the ''[[Waterkloof]] Kop'' (English: Waterkloof Hill), was chosen as the new site for Pretoria Boys High School. The architect, [[Patrick Eagle]], met the challenge by designing an edifice rivalling its larger contemporary, Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s [[Union Buildings]]. Eagle chose to site the main buildings on the ridge of the hill giving the school its well-known dramatic setting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\nOne year later, the four colonies of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], [[Orange Free State]], [[Natal Province|Natal]] and the [[Cape Colony|Cape]]  formed the [[Union of South Africa]]. Keen to forge unity between English and Dutch (Afrikaner) South Africans, Smuts' influence was evident when, on 6 April 1910, the school absorbed 100 boys and staff from the Dutch-medium Eendracht High School to form a dual-medium high school. The combined school was now named ''Pretoria High School for Boys - Pretoria Hogere school voor Jongens''. Smuts would later send his own sons to the school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Devolution and re-establishment (1920) ===\n\nThe dual-medium institution would last ten years. By 1920, the divide between English and Afrikaans speakers had become apparent nationwide; this was reflected in the need for a separate Afrikaans high school in Pretoria. Consequently, the [[Afrikaanse Ho\u00ebr Seunskool]] was formed immediately south of its parent, becoming the first Afrikaans-medium high school in the country, several years before [[Afrikaans]] attained official recognition as a language (and not a semi-[[Creole language|Creole]] of Dutch). The two schools enjoy close ties to this day, especially in an enthusiastic but friendly rivalry in sporting events. PBHS would now be left in its present form, known as Pretoria Boys High School, an English-medium public school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Headmasters since 1909 ===\n\n* William Hofmeyr (1909-1935)\n* Daniel Matheson (1936-1949)\n* Noel Pollock (1950-1955)\n* Desmond Abernethy (1956-1973)\n* Malcolm Armstrong (1974-1989)\n* William E.

The shield component of the badge is divided into four quadrants, with the book representing learning, the tools the wealth of the Transvaal through gold mining, the tree growth and the ox wagon the Transvaal. The background colours of the four quadrants were the colours of the first four houses when given permanent names, i.e. Town red, Solomon gold, Sunnyside black and Rissik green.\n\n=== The school songs ===\n\nThe official school song, ''Tis Here We Learn To Live'', was written in the 1930s by two ''Old Boys''. The composer of the music, Dr George Findlay, was a prominent Pretoria [[dermatologist]]. However, the school later adopted [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]], originally the school song of [[Harrow School]] in [[London]]. It is this song that is sung at all school [[valedictions]]. The official school song was relegated to obscurity until it was revived as the school's rugby anthem.\n\n== Culture and activities ==\n\n=== Cultural activities ===\n\nCultural activities include a well-established musical tradition, with a formal [[symphony]] [[orchestra]], [[choir]], [[pipe band]], [[jazz]] ensemble and [[Folk music|folk]] group. Other activities include Photography, Fantasy and Historical war games, Aeronautical Society, Film, Wildlife, Drama, Debating, Chess, and many others.\n\n=== Athletics and leisure ===\n\nSporting facilities include soccer, [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standard athletics grounds, [[tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[basketball]] courts, a [[gym]]nasium, [[field hockey|hockey]] fields, two swimming pools including one for [[waterpolo]], an [[AstroTurf]] and a rock-climbing wall. There is also a man-made [[pine|pine forest]], an old [[shooting range]] which has been converted for the purpose of archery, an [[amphitheatre]] and an artificial lake, ''Loch Armstrong''. The grounds form a protected bird sanctuary and are home to several different species of birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.\n\n== School buildings ==\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\n=== Houses ===\n\nPretoria Boys High School is made up of ten constituent houses, each with its own unique culture and identity. House assemblies are held weekly, and house prefects are appointed annually. Annual inter-house sports meetings take place in which every pupil is strongly encouraged to participate. The inter-house swim meet (gala) is the most popular and well-attended of sport meetings.\n\n=== Boarding houses ===\n\n* Solomon\n* Rissik\n* School\n\n=== Day-boy houses ===\n\n* Abernethy\n* Arcadia\n* Armstrong\n* Hofmeyr\n* Matheson\n* Sunnyside\n* Town\n\n== The Old Boys Association ==\n\nPretoria Boys High School has a network of ''Old Boys'', forming one of the largest alumni organisations in South Africa. ''Pretoria Boys High School Old Boys Association'' publishes an annual journal and review, ''The Phobian'', which is distributed to ''Old Boys'' across the globe. Members of the association meet annually at the school for the annual dinner, and regular reunions of each matriculating group are organised 10, 20, 30 and 40 years on, echoing the refrain of the school song, [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]].\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n[[File:Max Theiler nobel.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Professor]] [[Max Theiler]] (1899\u20131972), 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] laureate, for developing a [[vaccine]] against [[yellow fever]]]]\n[[File:Nobel Prize 17 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Professor [[Michael Levitt]] (1947-), 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] laureate]]\n[[File:Edwin Cameron in robes.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Honourable]] [[Edwin Cameron]] (1953-), [[judge]] of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]]]]\n[[File:Elon Musk 2015.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Elon Musk]] (1971-), [[business magnate]] and founder of [[SpaceX]] and a co-founder of [[Zip2]], [[PayPal]], and [[Tesla Motors]]]]\nThe school has produced two [[List of South African Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize laureates]], eighteen [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholars]], eight [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] [[judge]]s, an [[archbishop]],{{clarify|date=June 2016}} two [[Premier League|English Premier League]] football players, seven national [[cricket]]ers and four [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] rugby players{{sfn|Illsley|2001}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Eddie Barlow]], South African cricketer\n* [[James Botten|Jackie Botten]], South African cricketer\n* [[Edwin Cameron]], Constitutional Court [[judge]] and AIDS activist\n* [[Billy Downer]], Advocate of the Supreme Court, National Prosecutor and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]]\n* [[David B.

He is known for perfecting [[damascening]], a metalwork technique that involves inlaying gold, silver and other metals into a metal surface, creating an intricate decorative effect. He exhibited his art works at [[World's fair|international fairs]] and was recognised with multiple awards. Zuloaga came from a family of [[Basques|Basque]] metalworkers. He was the son of damascening pioneer [[Eusebio Zuloaga]], the half-brother of the painter and ceramic artist [[Daniel Zuloaga]],<ref name=\":0\" /> and the father of the painter [[Ignacio Zuloaga]]. He improved on the techniques introduced by his father, perfecting a process for inlaying gold and silver into iron.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=37}} For a long time he made art works for the English collector [[Alfred Morrison]]. Many of these items are now in the private collection of the British-Iranian scholar and philanthropist [[Nasser Khalili|Nasser D.

He is known for perfecting [[damascening]], a metalwork technique that involves inlaying gold, silver and other metals into a metal surface, creating an intricate decorative effect. He exhibited his art works at [[World's fair|international fairs]] and was recognised with multiple awards. Zuloaga came from a family of [[Basques|Basque]] metalworkers. He was the son of damascening pioneer [[Eusebio Zuloaga]], the half-brother of the painter and ceramic artist [[Daniel Zuloaga]],<ref name=\":0\" /> and the father of the painter [[Ignacio Zuloaga]]. He improved on the techniques introduced by his father, perfecting a process for inlaying gold and silver into iron.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=37}} For a long time he made art works for the English collector [[Alfred Morrison]]. Many of these items are now in the private collection of the British-Iranian scholar and philanthropist [[Nasser Khalili|Nasser D.

He is best known for playing the character [[Frank Spencer (Michael Crawford)|Frank Spencer]] in a popular 1970s sitcom titled ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]'', which first made him a household name, as well as for originating [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|the title role]] in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. His performance in the latter musical drama earned him both the [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical]] and [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical]].<ref name=\"Trust\"/>\n\nCrawford has also published the autobiographical work ''Parcel Arrived Safely: Tied With String'', which covers the changes in his career over the multiple decades. Since 1987, he has served as the leader of [[the Sick Children's Trust]] as well and acted as a public face for the British [[Nonprofit organization|social cause organization]].<ref name=\"Trust\">{{cite web|website=BroadwayWorld.com|title=Michael Crawford to Host Afternoon Tea in Cambridge for Sick Children's Trust|date=6 September 2015|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Michael-Crawford-to-Host-Afternoon-Tea-in-Cambridge-for-Sick-Childrens-Trust-20150906|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCrawford was brought up by his mother, Doris Agnes Mary Pike, and her parents, Montague Pike and his wife, Edith (n\u00e9e O'Keefe), in what Crawford described as a \"close-knit Roman Catholic family\".

Smith at CWGC website]</ref><ref>''Phantom: Michael Crawford Unmasked'', [[Anthony Hayward]] (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1991)</ref> Sixteen months after Smith's death, Crawford was born, the result of a short-lived relationship, and given his mother's surname, which was that of her first husband.\n\nDuring his early years, Crawford divided his time between the army camp in Wiltshire, where he and his mother lived during the war, and the [[Isle of Sheppey]] off the coast of [[Kent]]. The isle was where his mother had grown up and where Crawford would later live with his mother and maternal grandparents. He attended St Michael's, a Catholic school in [[Bexleyheath]] which was run by nuns who Crawford later described as not being shy in their use of corporal punishment. At the end of the [[Second World War]], his mother remarried, this time to a grocer, Lionel Dennis \"Den\" Ingram. The couple moved to London, where Crawford attended [[Oakfield Preparatory School]], Dulwich, where he was known as '''Michael Ingram'''. His mother's second marriage was abusive, according to Crawford.<ref>[http://www.mcifa.com/parcel2.cfm Crawford website, ibid.]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Beginning===\nHe made his first stage appearance in the role of Sammy the Little Sweep in his school production of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Let's Make an Opera]]'', conducted by [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]],<ref name=Mitchell28>{{cite book | last= Mitchell | first= Donald, Reed, Philip & Cooke, Mervyn (eds) | year=2004 | title= Letters from a Life: Selected Letters of Benjamin Britten, Vol 3, 1946\u20131951 | location=London | publisher=Faber and Faber | isbn=978-0571222827 }}: p. 28</ref> which was then transferred to [[Brixton]] Town Hall in London. He auditioned, unsuccessfully, for the role of Miles in Britten's ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' - the role being given to another boy soprano, [[David Hemmings]]; but it appears that Crawford's audition sufficiently impressed Britten as in 1955 he hired him to play Sammy, alternating with David Hemmings, in another production of ''Let's Make an Opera'', this time at the [[Scala Theatre]] in London.<ref name=mitchell27>Mitchell (2004): p. 27</ref> He also participated in the recording of that opera (as Michael Ingram, singing the role of Gay Brook) made that same year, conducted by the composer.<ref name=mitchell27/><ref>Booklet details from Decca 436 393\u20132</ref> Then in 1958 he was hired by the [[English Opera Group]] to create the role of Jaffet in another Britten opera, ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'', based on the story of Noah and the Great Flood.<ref name=Mitchell28/> Crawford remembers that it was while working in this production that he realised he seriously wanted to become an actor. It was in between performances of ''Let's Make an Opera'' and ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' that he was advised to change his name, \"to avoid confusion with a television newsman called Michael Ingram[s] who was registered with [[Equity (trade union)|British Equity]]\".<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nHe went on to perform in a wide repertoire. Among his stage work, he performed in [[Andr\u00e9 Birabeau]]'s French comedy ''[[Head of the Family]]'', [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Come Blow Your Horn]]'', [[Bernard Kops]]'s ''Change for the Angel'', [[Francis Swann]]'s ''Out of the Frying Pan'', [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'', and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', ''The Striplings'', ''The Move After Checkmate'' and others. At the same time, he appeared in hundreds of BBC radio broadcasts and early BBC soap-operas, such as ''[[Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (TV series)|Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School]]'', ''[[Emergency - Ward 10]]'', ''[[Probation Officer]]'', and ''[[Two Living, One Dead]]''. He appeared as the cabin boy John Drake in the television series ''[[Sir Francis Drake (television)|Sir Francis Drake]]'', a 26-part adventure series made by ITC starring [[Terence Morgan]] and [[Jean Kent]]. He made his film debut in 1958 with leading roles in two children's films, ''Blow Your Own Trumpet'' and ''Soapbox Derby'', for The [[Children's Film Foundation]] in Britain.<ref>{{cite news | last =Herincx | first =Gareth  | title =Entertainment: Crawford comes clean  | work= [[BBC News]]  | date =16 September 1999 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/448037.stm | accessdate =2 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Michael Crawford appeared in an episode of ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond|One Step Beyond]]'' called \"The Villa\" in which he played a character experimenting with strobe lights. Crawford appears in the only surviving episode of the 1960 British crime series ''[[Police Surgeon (UK TV series)|Police Surgeon]]'' alongside [[Ian Hendry]]. This series would spawn the much better-known ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.\n\n===Early adult career===\nAt age nineteen, he was approached to play an American, Junior Sailen, in the film ''[[The War Lover]]'' (1962), which starred [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]]. To prepare for the role, he would spend hours listening to [[Woody Woodbury]], a famous American comedian of the time, to try to perfect an American accent. After ''[[The War Lover]]'', Crawford briefly returned to the stage and, after playing the lead role in the 1963 British film ''[[Two Left Feet (film)|Two Left Feet]]'', was offered a role in the British television series, ''[[Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life]]'', as the Mod-style, tough-talking, motorbike-riding Byron. It was this character that attracted film director [[Richard Lester]] to hire him for the role of Colin in ''[[The Knack \u2026and How to Get It]]'' in 1965. The film was a huge success in the UK.\n\nLester also cast him in the [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', and ''[[How I Won the War]]'', which starred [[Roy Kinnear]] and [[John Lennon]] (during the filming of which he lived in London with Lennon and his first wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]], and Gabrielle Lewis).<ref>As told to [[Matt Baker (television personality)|Matt Baker]] and [[Alex Jones (Welsh presenter)|Alex Jones]] on the [[BBC]] show \"[[The One Show]]\" on 1 August 2011.</ref> Crawford starred in ''[[The Jokers]]'' (directed by [[Michael Winner]]) with [[Oliver Reed]] in 1967.\n\n===Broadway debut===\nIn 1967, he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] d\u00e9but in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Black Comedy (play)|Black Comedy]]'' with [[Lynn Redgrave]] (making her d\u00e9but as well) in which he demonstrated his aptitude and daring for extreme physical comedy, such as walking into walls and falling down staircases. While working in the show, he was noticed by [[Gene Kelly]] and was called to Hollywood to audition for him for a part in the [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|film adaptation]] of the musical ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''. He was cast and shared top billing with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. Despite becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1969, it failed to recoup its $25&nbsp;million budget at the box office. It went on to win three [[Academy Awards]], was nominated for a further four (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), and is now considered to be one of the greatest musical films ever.<ref>{{Cite web|title =100 Greatest Film Musicals|url = http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/movie-pages/movie_musicals.php|accessdate = 7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Best Movie Musicals of All Time |url=http://www.ranthollywood.com/2014/12/24/best-movie-musicals-of-all-time/ |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221130312/http://www.ranthollywood.com/2014/12/24/best-movie-musicals-of-all-time/ |archivedate=21 February 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top 100 Greatest Movie Musicals of All Time|url = http://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/8/9/the-top-100-greatest-movie-musicals-of-all-time/|accessdate = 7 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206232128/http://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/8/9/the-top-100-greatest-movie-musicals-of-all-time|archive-date = 6 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nHis later films fared less successfully, although ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1972 film)|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', in which he played the White Rabbit, enjoyed moderate success in the UK. After performing in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and with offers of work greatly reduced and much of his salary from ''Hello, Dolly!'' lost, reportedly due to underhanded investments by his agent,<ref name=\"parcel\">{{cite book|url=http://www.mcifa.com/parcel3.cfm|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Parcel Arrived Safely, Tied with String|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> Crawford faced a brief period of unemployment, in which he helped his wife stuff cushions (for their upholstery business) and took a job as an office clerk in an electric company to pass the time between. During this difficult time, his marriage fell apart and divorce followed in 1975.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em''===\nCrawford's acting career took off again after he appeared on the London stage in the farce ''[[No Sex Please, We're British]]'', in which he played the part of frantic chief cashier Brian Runnicles. His performance led to an invitation to star in a [[BBC]] television comedy series about a childlike and eternally haphazard man who causes disaster everywhere he goes. Crawford was not the first choice for the role of Frank Spencer in ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]''. Originally, the part had been offered to comedy actor [[Ronnie Barker]] but after he and [[Norman Wisdom]] had turned it down, Crawford took on the challenge, adopting a similar characterisation to that which he used when playing Brian Runnicles. Cast alongside him was actress [[Michele Dotrice]] in the role of Frank's long-suffering wife, Betty, and the series premiered in 1973.\n\n''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'' soon became one of the [[BBC]]'s most popular television series. Initially, only two series were produced, from 1973 to 1975, while the show's creators felt that it should stop while at its peak. There was a brief hiatus until popular demand saw it revived for a final series in 1978. The immense popularity that followed the sitcom was due perhaps to the unusual amount of physical comedy involved. Crawford said he had always been a fan of comedians such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]], as well as the great sight gags employed in the days of silent film, and saw ''Some Mothers'' as the ideal opportunity to use such humour himself. He performed all of his own stunts during the show's run, and never used a double.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nWhile he was playing in ''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'', Crawford was approached to star in the musical ''[[Billy (musical)|Billy]]'' (based on the novel ''[[Billy Liar]]''), which opened in 1974 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. This was his first leading man role on the West End stage and helped to cement his career as both a singer and showman. The part was demanding, requiring proficiency in both song and dance, and in preparation for the role, Crawford began taking both more seriously, studying singing under the tutelage of vocal coach Ian Adam and spending hours perfecting his dancing capabilities with choreographer [[Onna White]].<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n''Billy'' gave the many fans of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer an opportunity to see him in a broadly similar role on the stage, and was a considerable hit (904 West End performances). After the closing of ''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'', Crawford continued to perform in plays and musicals, starring in ''[[Charlie and Algernon|Flowers for Algernon]]'' (1979) in the role of Charley Gordon, based on the book of the same title. He pursued another role on a very short-lived ITV sitcom, ''[[Chalk and Cheese]]'', as the slovenly, uncouth Dave Finn. The show did not go over well with his fans: the popularity of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer, and the similar Billy Fisher character, had left him somewhat [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]], to the extent that they could not accept his very different role as Dave Finn. Crawford abandoned the show during its first series and returned to theatre work.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n\n====''Condorman''====\nCrawford starred in the 1981 Disney comedy/adventure film ''[[Condorman]]'', playing an eccentric American comic book writer and illustrator named Woody Wilkins who is asked by his friend at the [[CIA]] to help a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] woman to defect while acting out the fantasy of bringing his comic book creation, Condorman, to life.<ref>\n{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Condorman(1981)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082199|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref> Critics panned the film. On their television show, critics [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert]] featured the film in their round-up of the year's worst films pointing out the less-than-special effects such as the visible harness and cable used to suspend Condorman in the air and the obvious bluescreen effect. The film performed poorly at the box office but years later gained a [[cult following]] among Disney fans.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n====''Barnum''====\nAlso in 1981, Crawford starred in the original London production of [[Cy Coleman]]'s ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'' (1981) as the illustrious American showman [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]]. He trained at the ''Big Apple Circus School'' in New York City to prepare for the ambitious stunts, learning to walk the tight-rope, juggle and slide down a rope from the rafters of the theatre. After further training for the second opening of ''Barnum'', he was awarded a British Amateur Gymnastics Association badge and certificate as a qualified coach.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n''Barnum'' opened on 11 June 1981 at the [[London Palladium]], where it ran for 655 performances. Crawford and [[Deborah Grant]] headed the cast. It was well-received, becoming a favourite of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as well as the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]]. Crawford earned his first [[Olivier Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical on the London stage. After the initial production of the show, he worked extensively with [[Torvill and Dean]], and can be seen rinkside with them as they received their \"perfect six\" marks in the 1983 world championships for their 'Barnum' routine.<ref>{{YouTube|o2UkD0tGitI|Crawford with Torvill & Dean receiving marks at World championships 1983}}</ref><ref>Hennessey, John. ''Torvill & Dean; David & Charles'' (1983); {{ISBN|0-7153-8476-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 a revival of ''Barnum'' opened in [[Manchester]] at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]], ending the tour at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Palace]] in the West End. In 1986 this production, with a new cast, though still headed by Crawford, was recorded for television and broadcast by the BBC. Crawford's ''Barnum'' is one of the longest runs by a leading actor.\n\n====''The Phantom of the Opera''====\nIn 1984, at the final preview of ''[[Starlight Express]]'', Crawford happened to run into the show's creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Lloyd Webber had met Crawford socially several times and remembered him from his work in ''Flowers for Algernon''. He informed Crawford that he was working on a new project based on a [[Gaston Leroux]] novel and wanted to know whether he was interested. Crawford said he was, but the show was still in the early planning stages, and nothing had been decided. Several months passed, during which Lloyd Webber had already created a pitch video featuring his then-wife [[Sarah Brightman]] as the female lead Christine, and British rocker [[Steve Harley]] as the Phantom, singing the title song in the manner of a contemporary [[New wave music|new wave]] video. Crawford was turned off by that, supposing the songwriter had chosen to do a \"rock opera\"-inspired spectacle in lieu of a more traditional operatic musical.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nSince casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber had also begun to regret his artistic choices. As production continued on the show, the bulk of the score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley's rough, contemporary voice. Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search for the perfect actor to play his Phantom. Crawford's landing of the role was due in large part to the coincidence that Sarah Brightman had taken lessons with the same vocal coach as Crawford. She and her husband had arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced to hear Crawford practising the aria ''Care Selve'', from the opera ''Atalanta'' by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Intrigued, Lloyd Webber asked Ian Adam who his student was. Soon after, Crawford was called in for an audition and was hired virtually on the spot.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nMany critics were sceptical; Crawford was still largely pigeonholed as the hapless Frank Spencer, and questions were asked about Crawford's ability to manage such a vocally and dramatically demanding role. In 1986, he began his performance in London at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], continuing on to Broadway in 1988, and then Los Angeles in 1989. He played the role for two and a half years and over 1,300 performances, winning an [[Olivier Award]] (Best Actor in a Musical), a [[Tony Award]] (Best Performance by an Actor in a Lead Role, Musical), a New York [[Drama Desk Award]], and a [[Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award]] for Distinguished Achievement in Theatre (Lead Performance).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcifa.com/biography.cfm|title=biography, timeline|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring the run of ''Phantom'' in Los Angeles, Crawford was asked to perform \"[[The Music of the Night]]\" at the Inaugural Gala for President [[George H. W. Bush]] in Washington, D.C., on 19 January 1989. At the gala, Crawford was presented with a birthday cake (it was his 47th birthday). On 29 April 1990, after three and a half years and over 1,300 performances later, Crawford left the show. He admits to having been saddened at his departure, and, during the final Lair scene, altered the Phantom's line to \"Christine....I ''loved'' you...\", acknowledging that this was his final performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-30/local/me-82_1_michael-crawford|title='Phantom' Departs Amid Cheers, Tears|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=30 April 1990|last1=Braxton|first1=Greg}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nAt the request of Liz Kirschner, wife of film producer [[David Kirschner]], he obtained the role of Cornelius in [[20th Century Fox]]'s animated film ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'', which was produced by her husband. During his voice over sessions, Michael stated that he had a terrible time singing one of the musical numbers called \"Please Wake Up\". This was because he had to struggle not to cry when this was being completed, as the scenario was that his character Cornelius was singing to a child who was on the verge of death. The film was released in cinemas over the summer of 1993. 1993 also saw the release of his special, ''A Touch of Music in the Night'', to coincide with the release of his new album of the same name. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn 1995, Crawford created the high-profile starring role in ''[[EFX (show)|EFX]]'', the US$70&nbsp;million production which officially opened the 1,700-seat [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand Theatre]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The Atlantic Theater label released the companion album to EFX. Early into the run, Crawford suffered an accident during a performance (which involved him sliding from a wire hanger from the back of the theatre all the way to the stage and then jumping down {{convert|12|ft|m}} to the stage itself) and left the show to recover from his injury, which resulted in an early hip replacement operation.<ref>''Weekend Wogan'', 25 September 2011</ref>\n\n===2000s to present===\nCrawford had a short comeback to Broadway as the Count von Krolock in the short-lived musical ''[[Dance of the Vampires (musical)|Dance of the Vampires]]'' (2002\u201303). He originated the role of the morbidly obese Count Fosco in Lloyd Webber's ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]'', which opened at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], London in September 2004. However, he was forced to leave the show three months later because of ill health caused by dehydration resulting from the enormous fat-suit he wore during the performance.

his career, which has included many film and television performances as well as stagework on both [[West End theatre|London's West End]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City. He is best known for playing the character [[Frank Spencer (Michael Crawford)|Frank Spencer]] in a popular 1970s sitcom titled ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]'', which first made him a household name, as well as for originating [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|the title role]] in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. His performance in the latter musical drama earned him both the [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical]] and [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical]].<ref name=\"Trust\"/>\n\nCrawford has also published the autobiographical work ''Parcel Arrived Safely: Tied With String'', which covers the changes in his career over the multiple decades. Since 1987, he has served as the leader of [[the Sick Children's Trust]] as well and acted as a public face for the British [[Nonprofit organization|social cause organization]].<ref name=\"Trust\">{{cite web|website=BroadwayWorld.com|title=Michael Crawford to Host Afternoon Tea in Cambridge for Sick Children's Trust|date=6 September 2015|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Michael-Crawford-to-Host-Afternoon-Tea-in-Cambridge-for-Sick-Childrens-Trust-20150906|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCrawford was brought up by his mother, Doris Agnes Mary Pike, and her parents, Montague Pike and his wife, Edith (n\u00e9e O'Keefe), in what Crawford described as a \"close-knit Roman Catholic family\".

Smith at CWGC website]</ref><ref>''Phantom: Michael Crawford Unmasked'', [[Anthony Hayward]] (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1991)</ref> Sixteen months after Smith's death, Crawford was born, the result of a short-lived relationship, and given his mother's surname, which was that of her first husband.\n\nDuring his early years, Crawford divided his time between the army camp in Wiltshire, where he and his mother lived during the war, and the [[Isle of Sheppey]] off the coast of [[Kent]]. The isle was where his mother had grown up and where Crawford would later live with his mother and maternal grandparents. He attended St Michael's, a Catholic school in [[Bexleyheath]] which was run by nuns who Crawford later described as not being shy in their use of corporal punishment. At the end of the [[Second World War]], his mother remarried, this time to a grocer, Lionel Dennis \"Den\" Ingram. The couple moved to London, where Crawford attended [[Oakfield Preparatory School]], Dulwich, where he was known as '''Michael Ingram'''. His mother's second marriage was abusive, according to Crawford.<ref>[http://www.mcifa.com/parcel2.cfm Crawford website, ibid.]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Beginning===\nHe made his first stage appearance in the role of Sammy the Little Sweep in his school production of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Let's Make an Opera]]'', conducted by [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]],<ref name=Mitchell28>{{cite book | last= Mitchell | first= Donald, Reed, Philip & Cooke, Mervyn (eds) | year=2004 | title= Letters from a Life: Selected Letters of Benjamin Britten, Vol 3, 1946\u20131951 | location=London | publisher=Faber and Faber | isbn=978-0571222827 }}: p. 28</ref> which was then transferred to [[Brixton]] Town Hall in London. He auditioned, unsuccessfully, for the role of Miles in Britten's ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' - the role being given to another boy soprano, [[David Hemmings]]; but it appears that Crawford's audition sufficiently impressed Britten as in 1955 he hired him to play Sammy, alternating with David Hemmings, in another production of ''Let's Make an Opera'', this time at the [[Scala Theatre]] in London.<ref name=mitchell27>Mitchell (2004): p. 27</ref> He also participated in the recording of that opera (as Michael Ingram, singing the role of Gay Brook) made that same year, conducted by the composer.<ref name=mitchell27/><ref>Booklet details from Decca 436 393\u20132</ref> Then in 1958 he was hired by the [[English Opera Group]] to create the role of Jaffet in another Britten opera, ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'', based on the story of Noah and the Great Flood.<ref name=Mitchell28/> Crawford remembers that it was while working in this production that he realised he seriously wanted to become an actor. It was in between performances of ''Let's Make an Opera'' and ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' that he was advised to change his name, \"to avoid confusion with a television newsman called Michael Ingram[s] who was registered with [[Equity (trade union)|British Equity]]\".<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nHe went on to perform in a wide repertoire. Among his stage work, he performed in [[Andr\u00e9 Birabeau]]'s French comedy ''[[Head of the Family]]'', [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Come Blow Your Horn]]'', [[Bernard Kops]]'s ''Change for the Angel'', [[Francis Swann]]'s ''Out of the Frying Pan'', [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'', and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', ''The Striplings'', ''The Move After Checkmate'' and others. At the same time, he appeared in hundreds of BBC radio broadcasts and early BBC soap-operas, such as ''[[Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (TV series)|Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School]]'', ''[[Emergency - Ward 10]]'', ''[[Probation Officer]]'', and ''[[Two Living, One Dead]]''. He appeared as the cabin boy John Drake in the television series ''[[Sir Francis Drake (television)|Sir Francis Drake]]'', a 26-part adventure series made by ITC starring [[Terence Morgan]] and [[Jean Kent]]. He made his film debut in 1958 with leading roles in two children's films, ''Blow Your Own Trumpet'' and ''Soapbox Derby'', for The [[Children's Film Foundation]] in Britain.<ref>{{cite news | last =Herincx | first =Gareth  | title =Entertainment: Crawford comes clean  | work= [[BBC News]]  | date =16 September 1999 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/448037.stm | accessdate =2 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Michael Crawford appeared in an episode of ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond|One Step Beyond]]'' called \"The Villa\" in which he played a character experimenting with strobe lights.

To prepare for the role, he would spend hours listening to [[Woody Woodbury]], a famous American comedian of the time, to try to perfect an American accent. After ''[[The War Lover]]'', Crawford briefly returned to the stage and, after playing the lead role in the 1963 British film ''[[Two Left Feet (film)|Two Left Feet]]'', was offered a role in the British television series, ''[[Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life]]'', as the Mod-style, tough-talking, motorbike-riding Byron. It was this character that attracted film director [[Richard Lester]] to hire him for the role of Colin in ''[[The Knack \u2026and How to Get It]]'' in 1965. The film was a huge success in the UK.\n\nLester also cast him in the [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', and ''[[How I Won the War]]'', which starred [[Roy Kinnear]] and [[John Lennon]] (during the filming of which he lived in London with Lennon and his first wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]], and Gabrielle Lewis).<ref>As told to [[Matt Baker (television personality)|Matt Baker]] and [[Alex Jones (Welsh presenter)|Alex Jones]] on the [[BBC]] show \"[[The One Show]]\" on 1 August 2011.</ref> Crawford starred in ''[[The Jokers]]'' (directed by [[Michael Winner]]) with [[Oliver Reed]] in 1967.\n\n===Broadway debut===\nIn 1967, he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] d\u00e9but in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Black Comedy (play)|Black Comedy]]'' with [[Lynn Redgrave]] (making her d\u00e9but as well) in which he demonstrated his aptitude and daring for extreme physical comedy, such as walking into walls and falling down staircases. While working in the show, he was noticed by [[Gene Kelly]] and was called to Hollywood to audition for him for a part in the [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|film adaptation]] of the musical ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''. He was cast and shared top billing with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. Despite becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1969, it failed to recoup its $25&nbsp;million budget at the box office. It went on to win three [[Academy Awards]], was nominated for a further four (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), and is now considered to be one of the greatest musical films ever.<ref>{{Cite web|title =100 Greatest Film Musicals|url = http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/movie-pages/movie_musicals.php|accessdate = 7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Best Movie Musicals of All Time |url=http://www.ranthollywood.com/2014/12/24/best-movie-musicals-of-all-time/ |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221130312/http://www.ranthollywood.com/2014/12/24/best-movie-musicals-of-all-time/ |archivedate=21 February 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top 100 Greatest Movie Musicals of All Time|url = http://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/8/9/the-top-100-greatest-movie-musicals-of-all-time/|accessdate = 7 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206232128/http://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/8/9/the-top-100-greatest-movie-musicals-of-all-time|archive-date = 6 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nHis later films fared less successfully, although ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1972 film)|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', in which he played the White Rabbit, enjoyed moderate success in the UK. After performing in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and with offers of work greatly reduced and much of his salary from ''Hello, Dolly!'' lost, reportedly due to underhanded investments by his agent,<ref name=\"parcel\">{{cite book|url=http://www.mcifa.com/parcel3.cfm|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Parcel Arrived Safely, Tied with String|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> Crawford faced a brief period of unemployment, in which he helped his wife stuff cushions (for their upholstery business) and took a job as an office clerk in an electric company to pass the time between. During this difficult time, his marriage fell apart and divorce followed in 1975.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em''===\nCrawford's acting career took off again after he appeared on the London stage in the farce ''[[No Sex Please, We're British]]'', in which he played the part of frantic chief cashier Brian Runnicles. His performance led to an invitation to star in a [[BBC]] television comedy series about a childlike and eternally haphazard man who causes disaster everywhere he goes. Crawford was not the first choice for the role of Frank Spencer in ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]''. Originally, the part had been offered to comedy actor [[Ronnie Barker]] but after he and [[Norman Wisdom]] had turned it down, Crawford took on the challenge, adopting a similar characterisation to that which he used when playing Brian Runnicles. Cast alongside him was actress [[Michele Dotrice]] in the role of Frank's long-suffering wife, Betty, and the series premiered in 1973.\n\n''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'' soon became one of the [[BBC]]'s most popular television series. Initially, only two series were produced, from 1973 to 1975, while the show's creators felt that it should stop while at its peak. There was a brief hiatus until popular demand saw it revived for a final series in 1978. The immense popularity that followed the sitcom was due perhaps to the unusual amount of physical comedy involved. Crawford said he had always been a fan of comedians such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]], as well as the great sight gags employed in the days of silent film, and saw ''Some Mothers'' as the ideal opportunity to use such humour himself. He performed all of his own stunts during the show's run, and never used a double.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nWhile he was playing in ''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'', Crawford was approached to star in the musical ''[[Billy (musical)|Billy]]'' (based on the novel ''[[Billy Liar]]''), which opened in 1974 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. This was his first leading man role on the West End stage and helped to cement his career as both a singer and showman. The part was demanding, requiring proficiency in both song and dance, and in preparation for the role, Crawford began taking both more seriously, studying singing under the tutelage of vocal coach Ian Adam and spending hours perfecting his dancing capabilities with choreographer [[Onna White]].<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n''Billy'' gave the many fans of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer an opportunity to see him in a broadly similar role on the stage, and was a considerable hit (904 West End performances). After the closing of ''Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em'', Crawford continued to perform in plays and musicals, starring in ''[[Charlie and Algernon|Flowers for Algernon]]'' (1979) in the role of Charley Gordon, based on the book of the same title. He pursued another role on a very short-lived ITV sitcom, ''[[Chalk and Cheese]]'', as the slovenly, uncouth Dave Finn. The show did not go over well with his fans: the popularity of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer, and the similar Billy Fisher character, had left him somewhat [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]], to the extent that they could not accept his very different role as Dave Finn. Crawford abandoned the show during its first series and returned to theatre work.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n\n====''Condorman''====\nCrawford starred in the 1981 Disney comedy/adventure film ''[[Condorman]]'', playing an eccentric American comic book writer and illustrator named Woody Wilkins who is asked by his friend at the [[CIA]] to help a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] woman to defect while acting out the fantasy of bringing his comic book creation, Condorman, to life.<ref>\n{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Michael|title=Condorman(1981)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082199|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref> Critics panned the film. On their television show, critics [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert]] featured the film in their round-up of the year's worst films pointing out the less-than-special effects such as the visible harness and cable used to suspend Condorman in the air and the obvious bluescreen effect. The film performed poorly at the box office but years later gained a [[cult following]] among Disney fans.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n====''Barnum''====\nAlso in 1981, Crawford starred in the original London production of [[Cy Coleman]]'s ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'' (1981) as the illustrious American showman [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]]. He trained at the ''Big Apple Circus School'' in New York City to prepare for the ambitious stunts, learning to walk the tight-rope, juggle and slide down a rope from the rafters of the theatre. After further training for the second opening of ''Barnum'', he was awarded a British Amateur Gymnastics Association badge and certificate as a qualified coach.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\n''Barnum'' opened on 11 June 1981 at the [[London Palladium]], where it ran for 655 performances. Crawford and [[Deborah Grant]] headed the cast. It was well-received, becoming a favourite of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as well as the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]]. Crawford earned his first [[Olivier Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical on the London stage. After the initial production of the show, he worked extensively with [[Torvill and Dean]], and can be seen rinkside with them as they received their \"perfect six\" marks in the 1983 world championships for their 'Barnum' routine.<ref>{{YouTube|o2UkD0tGitI|Crawford with Torvill & Dean receiving marks at World championships 1983}}</ref><ref>Hennessey, John. ''Torvill & Dean; David & Charles'' (1983); {{ISBN|0-7153-8476-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 a revival of ''Barnum'' opened in [[Manchester]] at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]], ending the tour at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Palace]] in the West End. In 1986 this production, with a new cast, though still headed by Crawford, was recorded for television and broadcast by the BBC. Crawford's ''Barnum'' is one of the longest runs by a leading actor.\n\n====''The Phantom of the Opera''====\nIn 1984, at the final preview of ''[[Starlight Express]]'', Crawford happened to run into the show's creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Lloyd Webber had met Crawford socially several times and remembered him from his work in ''Flowers for Algernon''. He informed Crawford that he was working on a new project based on a [[Gaston Leroux]] novel and wanted to know whether he was interested. Crawford said he was, but the show was still in the early planning stages, and nothing had been decided. Several months passed, during which Lloyd Webber had already created a pitch video featuring his then-wife [[Sarah Brightman]] as the female lead Christine, and British rocker [[Steve Harley]] as the Phantom, singing the title song in the manner of a contemporary [[New wave music|new wave]] video. Crawford was turned off by that, supposing the songwriter had chosen to do a \"rock opera\"-inspired spectacle in lieu of a more traditional operatic musical.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nSince casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber had also begun to regret his artistic choices. As production continued on the show, the bulk of the score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley's rough, contemporary voice. Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search for the perfect actor to play his Phantom. Crawford's landing of the role was due in large part to the coincidence that Sarah Brightman had taken lessons with the same vocal coach as Crawford. She and her husband had arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced to hear Crawford practising the aria ''Care Selve'', from the opera ''Atalanta'' by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Intrigued, Lloyd Webber asked Ian Adam who his student was. Soon after, Crawford was called in for an audition and was hired virtually on the spot.<ref name=\"parcel\"/>\n\nMany critics were sceptical; Crawford was still largely pigeonholed as the hapless Frank Spencer, and questions were asked about Crawford's ability to manage such a vocally and dramatically demanding role. In 1986, he began his performance in London at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], continuing on to Broadway in 1988, and then Los Angeles in 1989. He played the role for two and a half years and over 1,300 performances, winning an [[Olivier Award]] (Best Actor in a Musical), a [[Tony Award]] (Best Performance by an Actor in a Lead Role, Musical), a New York [[Drama Desk Award]], and a [[Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award]] for Distinguished Achievement in Theatre (Lead Performance).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcifa.com/biography.cfm|title=biography, timeline|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring the run of ''Phantom'' in Los Angeles, Crawford was asked to perform \"[[The Music of the Night]]\" at the Inaugural Gala for President [[George H. W. Bush]] in Washington, D.C., on 19 January 1989. At the gala, Crawford was presented with a birthday cake (it was his 47th birthday). On 29 April 1990, after three and a half years and over 1,300 performances later, Crawford left the show. He admits to having been saddened at his departure, and, during the final Lair scene, altered the Phantom's line to \"Christine....I ''loved'' you...\", acknowledging that this was his final performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-30/local/me-82_1_michael-crawford|title='Phantom' Departs Amid Cheers, Tears|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=30 April 1990|last1=Braxton|first1=Greg}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nAt the request of Liz Kirschner, wife of film producer [[David Kirschner]], he obtained the role of Cornelius in [[20th Century Fox]]'s animated film ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'', which was produced by her husband. During his voice over sessions, Michael stated that he had a terrible time singing one of the musical numbers called \"Please Wake Up\". This was because he had to struggle not to cry when this was being completed, as the scenario was that his character Cornelius was singing to a child who was on the verge of death. The film was released in cinemas over the summer of 1993. 1993 also saw the release of his special, ''A Touch of Music in the Night'', to coincide with the release of his new album of the same name. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn 1995, Crawford created the high-profile starring role in ''[[EFX (show)|EFX]]'', the US$70&nbsp;million production which officially opened the 1,700-seat [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand Theatre]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The Atlantic Theater label released the companion album to EFX. Early into the run, Crawford suffered an accident during a performance (which involved him sliding from a wire hanger from the back of the theatre all the way to the stage and then jumping down {{convert|12|ft|m}} to the stage itself) and left the show to recover from his injury, which resulted in an early hip replacement operation.<ref>''Weekend Wogan'', 25 September 2011</ref>\n\n===2000s to present===\nCrawford had a short comeback to Broadway as the Count von Krolock in the short-lived musical ''[[Dance of the Vampires (musical)|Dance of the Vampires]]'' (2002\u201303). He originated the role of the morbidly obese Count Fosco in Lloyd Webber's ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]'', which opened at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], London in September 2004. However, he was forced to leave the show three months later because of ill health caused by dehydration resulting from the enormous fat-suit he wore during the performance. He spent several months recuperating and was thus unable to reprise the role on Broadway.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Interview with Michael Crawford|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/An_Interview_with_Michael_Crawford_20060106|accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> He learned he was suffering from the post-viral condition [[myalgic encephalopathy|myalgic encephalomyelitis]] (ME), which debilitated him for six years.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2002, in the television poll [[100 Greatest Britons]], he was voted the Greatest living Briton, and the seventeenth overall.\n\nHe moved to New Zealand, both to be near his daughter and her family in Australia<ref>{{cite web|last=Moran |first=Jonathon |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/the-secret-life-of-a-phantom-star/story-e6frfmqi-1226296026514 |title=The secret life of a Phantom star |publisher=News.com.au [accessed from [[archive.is]] web page] |date=11 March 2012 |accessdate=3 April 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20120310202157/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/the-secret-life-of-a-phantom-star/story-e6frfmqi-1226296026514 |archivedate=10 March 2012 }}</ref> and to convalesce from his illness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/lifestyle-news/nostalgia-history-midlands/2012/03/11/play-it-again-michael-crawford-on-the-day-he-ended-up-on-spaghetti-junction-in-his-pyjamas-66331-30500070|title=Play it Again: Michael Crawford on the day he ended up on Spaghetti Junction in his pyjamas.|newspaper=Sunday Mercury|accessdate=8 May 2012|date=11 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Crawford attended the Gala Performance of the stage version of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' on Broadway at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] to celebrate the show's becoming the longest-running musical in Broadway history (surpassing the run of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'').

Also listed are their original [[Nippon Television|NTV]] [[Voice acting in Japan|voice actors]] (1973), followed by their [[TV Asahi]] voice actors (1979~2005; 2005~). Part of the 22nd century characters are listed in [[The Doraemons]].\n\n'''Note''': In some translations of ''[[Doraemon]]'', the names of these characters are different from the original names.\n\n==Main characters==\nFujiko's friends say that every main character represents elementary school student archetypes Fujiko noticed in his own school days. Nobita appears in every episode of the anime, while Doraemon appears in most episodes, sometimes being substituted (for medical checkup or on leave) by his sister Dorami.\n\n===Doraemon===\n{{main|Doraemon (character)}}\n:\n:{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Ashish\n| colour       = Blue\n| series       =\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />[[K\u014dsei Tomita]] (1973, 1 to episode 26)<br>[[Masako Nozawa]] (1973, 27 to episode 52)<br>[[Nobuyo \u014cyama]] (1979 \u2013 2005)<br>[[Wasabi Mizuta]] (April 2005 \u2013 present)<br>'''English'''<br>[[Mona Marshall]] (2014\u20132017)\n| nickname     = Dora-chan\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Male\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Nobita (childcare)<br>Dorami (sister)<br/>[[List of Doraemon characters#Tamako Nobi|Tamako Nobi]] (adoptive mother)<br/> [[List of Doraemon characters#Nobisuke Nobi|Nobisuke Nobi]] (adoptive father)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 10 (First appearance)<br/>11 (Current)\n| paux2 name   = Birthday \n| paux2        = 3 September 2112\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n| paux4 name   = Type \n| paux4        = [[Manga]], [[Cartoon]]s\n| paux5 name   = Colour\n| paux5        = {{bulleted list|Beginning: Yellow|Afterward: Blue}}\n}}\n: Yellow {{Voiced by|[[Chisa Yokoyama]]}}\n{{nihongo|Doraemon|\u30c9\u30e9\u3048\u3082\u3093|Doraemon}} (born on 3 September 2112, Virgo) is the title character and main protagonist of the series. He is a cat-like [[robot]] created for Nobita from the future.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Xiao|title=Sassy and Subservient: Chinese Girls and Media in the Urbanizing Countryside|date=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109022964|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCptg4PDyK8C&pg=PA62}}</ref> But people often mistake him for a raccoon dog and he becomes angry as seen in many episodes. He is sent to the {{nihongo|Matsushiba Robot Factory|\u30de\u30c4\u30b7\u30d0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5de5\u5834}} as blueprint, and is sent back in time by Sewashi (Nobita's Great-great-grandson) to aid Nobita, since Sewashi learned from his parents that Nobita suffered much in his life and wanted to help him. Doraemon possesses a 4-dimensional pocket from which he can acquire various kinds of futuristic tools, gadgets, and playthings from a future department store. He also has the tendency to panic during emergencies, characterized by him frantically trying to pull out a very much-needed tool from his pocket, only to produce a huge assortment of household items and unwanted gadgets. Still, Doraemon is very friendly and intelligent, not to mention long-suffering because of Nobita's antics. Since Sewashi sent Doraemon to the past, Doraemon has been living as the unofficial fourth member of Nobita's family and acts like a second son to Nobita's parents, since despite being a robot, he requires basic needs for a person, such as eating, and also sleeps in the closet of Nobita's bedroom.\n\nDoraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly blue, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-coloured hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail \u2014 the appearance most identify him with today. In \"The Doraemons\" [[story arc]] (and the ''[[2112: The Birth of Doraemon]]'' short film), it is revealed that Doraemon's original paint color was yellow. After getting his ears gnawed off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into depression on top of a tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled \"sadness\". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and his voice changed due to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid [[fear of mice]] despite being a robotic cat, and he is now suffering from [[musophobia]].\n\nOne can turn Doraemon off by pulling his balloon tail. Doraemon is considered a substandard product because many of his robotic features (i.e. radar whiskers and cat-calling bell) malfunctioned after production due to an accident in the factory while he was being built. Due to this malfunction, Doraemon did not do well at the robot's school and during the final presentation show, he performed badly and nobody wanted to hire him, until baby Sewashi pushed the button. His parents were a bit reluctant, but since Sewashi liked him, they hired Doraemon, and he took care of him until Sewashi himself sent him to the past to take care of Nobita. Despite this, Doraemon shows a lot of intelligence and common sense. Whenever he hangs out with his friend Mii-Chan (a cute street cat), he calls it 'important and busy work' as excuses for not doing work when Nobita or his mother ask him to do something when he will be going out with Mii.\n\nDoraemon's favourite food is {{nihongo|''[[dorayaki]]''|\u3069\u3089\u713c\u304d}} (known as \"fudgy pudgy pie\" in the English version of the manga, \"yummy buns\" in the English, and \"dora-cakes/bean jam buns\" in other versions), a Japanese treat filled with red bean paste. While it might explain the origin of his name, it was revealed in one of the manga chapters that his name originates from the Japanese word {{nihongo|''nora neko''|\u306e\u3089\u732b}} for \"stray cat\", and the {{nihongo|''-emon''|\u885b\u9580}} ending which is part of traditional Japanese names, as seen also in, for example, Ishikawa Goemon. Doraemon is also appeared in ''[[Perman]]'' series and Mitsuo's friend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/keyword?dbname=mangag&keyword=doraemon |title=Online dictionary of manga and video games in Japan: doraemon |publisher=Docoja.com:8080 |date=2007-08-08 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elanso.com/ArticleModule/JXPzPpHGL9P0P0PpW6W6TgIi.html |title=elanso\u7f51\u7ad9\u8c03\u6574 |publisher=Elanso.com |accessdate=2012-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302010514/http://www.elanso.com/ArticleModule/JXPzPpHGL9P0P0PpW6W6TgIi.html |archive-date=2012-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-92990921.html|title=Just how many gadgets does comic cat Doraemon have?|date=2004-04-01|publisher=Kyodo World News Service|accessdate=2009-02-19|quote=Doraemon, whose name derives from \"doraneko,\" meaning \"stray cat\" and \"-aemon,\"}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n===Nobita Nobi===\n{{anchor|Noby Nobi}}\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Nobita Nobi\n| colour       = Yellow\n| series       =\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />Yoshiko \u014cta (1973), [[Noriko Ohara]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), Hiroko Maruyama (stand-in for Ohara), [[Megumi \u014chara]] (April 2005 \u2013 present)<br/>[[Makiko \u014cmoto]] (2000; Teen), [[Mai Kadowaki]] (2005\u20132007; Teen)<br/>[[K\u014dz\u014d Shioya]] (1984; Adult), Shingo Hiromori (1987\u20131990; Adult), Noriko Ohara (2000\u20132004; Adult), [[T\u014dru \u014ckawa]] (2005; Adult), [[Hideyuki Hori]] (2006; Adult), [[Satoshi Tsumabuki]] (Stand by Me Doraemon; Adult)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Johnny Yong Bosch]]\n| nickname     = Noby\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Male\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Shizuka Minamoto (wife/[[Friend]])<br />Nobisuke Nobi (father)<br />Tamako Nobi (mother)<br />Nobirou Nobi (paternal uncle)<br />Goro Nobi (cousin)<br />Nobie Nobi (cousin)<br />Tamao Kataoka (maternal uncle)<br />Nobiru Nobi (paternal grandfather)<br />Nobita's Grandmother (paternal grandmother)<br />Nobikichi Nobi (paternal great-grandfather)<br />Mr. Kataoka (maternal grandfather)<br />Mrs. Kataoka (maternal grandmother)<br />Nobizaemon Nobi (ancestor)<br />Nobisaku Nobi (ancestor)<br />Nobisuke Nobi (son)<br />Nobisuke's son (grandson)<br />Sewashi's father (great-grandson)<br />Sewashi Nobi (great-great-grandson)<br />Sewashi's cousin (great-great-grandniece)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 10 (First appearance)<br/>11 (Current)\n| paux2 name   = Birthday \n| paux2        = August 7, 1961 (1969)<br>August 7, 1964 (1973)<br>August 7, 1973 (1979)<br>August 7, 1999 (2005)<br>\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}} \n{{nihongo|Nobita Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u592a|Nobi Nobita|English dub: Noby Nobi,<ref>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-05-11/doraemon-anime-visual-and-script-changes-for-u.s-tv-detailed</ref>}} (born on 7 August, Leo) is a fifth grader, the only child of his parents and the co-protagonist. He wears glasses, a red or yellow polo shirt with a white collar, and blue or black shorts. Nobita is usually foolish, uncoordinated, lazy, dimwitted, weak, frail, childish and bad at sports. He dislikes books and possesses basic scientific knowledge, being unable to understand concepts such as the definition of an eclipse. He envies Dekisugi, who is good at everything and admired by Shizuka. He often takes any chance to get a nap and favors gadgets that give him extra time or do work for him, and is thus known as 'The Lazy King'. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's gadgets, he shows them off to Shizuka but not to Suneo and Gian.\n\nNobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring zero (0%) (F's in the English dub) on his tests, getting scolded by his teacher, being teased by his classmates Gian and Suneo, falling in the curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs after mistakenly stepping on their tails, getting grounded by his mother for not completing his homework, and being bullied by all his friends except [[Shizuka]] who remembers Nobita's kind heart and cares for him. He is scared by almost everything, particularly ghosts, and is a cry-baby (a running gag in the show is Nobita crying and asking for Doraemon to bring out his gadgets, mostly at the beginning of the episode). He dislikes going on outdoor activities with his interest being afternoon naps and reading comics, usually right after school. In fact, these are probably his only true hobbies; for example, one story features Nobita falling asleep in three seconds just by closing his eyes, while in others he chooses sleep over important events, such as watching the first sunrise on New Year's Day. The only things stopping him from staying at home all the time, other than experimenting with Doraemon's gadgets, are Gian and Suneo coercing him into participate in baseball games, and being forced by Doraemon or his parents to do so.\n\nEven though Nobita has many flaws, he is kind-hearted, emotional, honest, occasionally hard-working (such as when he gets into a wager with his friends) and sometimes courageous (for example, when Shizuka is in danger). He has often risked his life to help save others, or even entire civilizations in full-length stories. And despite being shown to be academically poor, the reason behind it is principally his laziness, and he has secured good marks when incited to do so in some episodes, proving his credentials. Nobita can be very serious and responsible at times, such as when he cares for pets. Though he is weak at most things, he does have some strengths. For example, he has excellent marksmanship which rivals (or even surpasses) Dora the Kid. He can also weave excellent string figures, and is a fairly good comic book critic, owing to the huge amount of time he spends reading them. Nobita is also very creative when it comes to utilizing Doraemon's gadgets. For example, in one episode, he finds a way to profitably use a gadget called ''the Broadcasting mirror'' for advertising, even when Doraemon himself couldn't think of any use for it.\n\n===Shizuka Nobi / Shizuka Minamoto===\n{{anchor|Sue|Sue Morris}}\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Shizuka Nobi\n| series\n| colour       = pink\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />Masako Ebisu (1973), [[Michiko Nomura]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Rei Sakuma]] (2000), [[Yumi Kakazu]] (2005\u2013present)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Cassandra Morris]]\n| oaux1 name   = Portrayed by\n| oaux1        = \n| nickname     = Shizuka-chan<br />Sue\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Female\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Nobita Nobi (husband)<br />Yoshio Minamoto  (father)<br />Mrs. Minamoto (mother)<br />Kazu (cousin)<br />Shizunadahime (ancestor)<br />Shizu (ancestor)<br />Nobisuke Nobi (son)<br />Nobisuke's son (grandson)<br />Sewashi's father (great-grandson)<br />Sewashi Nobi (great-great-grandson)<br />Sewashi's cousin (great-great-grandniece)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 9\u201310\n| paux2 name   = Birthday \n| paux2        = May 8, 1962 (1969)<br>May 8, 1965 (1973)<br>May 8, 1974 (1979)<br>May 8, 2000 (2005)\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}} \n{{nihongo|Shizuka Minamoto|\u6e90 \u9759\u9999|Minamoto Shizuka|English dub: Sue Morris}} (born on 8 May, Taurus), nicknamed {{nihongo|Shizuka-chan|\u3057\u305a\u304b\u3061\u3083\u3093}} is a smart, kind and pretty girl. The word 'Shizuka (\u3057\u305a\u304b)' means 'Quiet'. She is Nobita's best friend and he has a crush on her. She does not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy disposition or constant failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage him to do better, though she usually fails to convince him. Shizuka likes to take a bath several times a day; however, a [[running gag]] in the series is that she is sometimes interrupted by sudden appearance of Nobita, Gian, or Suneo, usually due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like the ''Anywhere Door'' (''Doko Demo Doa'' in Japanese) (the scene ends with Shizuka shouting, \"Go away!\" to them). Her true passions are [[sweet potato]]es, which she would rather keep to herself out of the knowledge of others, and the violin, in which her playing is even more horrendous than Gian's singing. She is also known for taking piano lessons unwillingly due to her mother's wishes (as she loves violin more), which is sometimes a reason for declining to hang out with friends (but she plays piano better than violin). Shizuka is an animal lover and keeps two pets at home: a dog, who is saved from succumbing to illness by Nobita and Doraemon in one story; and a canary which runs away on multiple occasions and causing Shizuka and Nobita to run around the city chasing her down.\n\nDue to Nobita's heartiest effort and Doraemon's assistance, Shizuka marries Nobita in the future. At present, she does not have any particular crush (but Shizuka secretly loves Nobita very much). Sometimes she fancies some handsome idols on TV. Besides Nobita, Shizuka is also close to her classmate and popular student Dekisugi which makes Nobita jealous. Though they consider each other only as friends, Nobita often tries to prevent them from going together.\n\n===Takeshi Goda \"Gian\"===\n\n\n\n{{anchor|Gian|Big G}}\n<br /> \n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Takeshi Goda \" Gian\"\n| series       =\n| image        = \n| colour       = orange\n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />[[Kaneta Kimotsuki]] (1973), [[Kazuya Tatekabe]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Subaru Kimura]] (2005\u2013present)<br/>[[Kujira]] (2000; Teen)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Kaiji Tang]]\n| oaux1 name   = Portrayed by\n| oaux1        = \n| nickname     = Gian<br>Big G\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Male\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Takeshi's wife (wife)<br />Jaiko Goda (sister)<br />Mr. Goda (father)<br />Sasuke Goda (mother)<br />Gian's uncle (maternal uncle)<br />Gian's aunt (maternal aunt)<br />Takezuchi (ancestor)<br />Jaizou (ancestor)<br />Yasashiku Gouda (son)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 12\u201313\n| paux2 name   = Birthday\n| paux2        = June 15, 1959 (1969)<br>June 15, 1962 (1973)<br>June 15, 1971 (1979)<br>June 15, 1997 (2005)\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|Takeshi Goda|\u525b\u7530 \u6b66|G\u014dda Takeshi}} (born on 15 June, Gemini), usually known by the nickname {{nihongo|\"Gian\"|\u300c\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u300d|\"Jaian\"|English: Big G}}, is a strong and quick-tempered local [[Bullying|bully]]. He also frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Suneo's) under the pretext of \"borrowing\" them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his horrible singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes \"invites\" others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible that, once, Nobita and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, his writings of the song lyrics in a board end up having the same effect as when they hear them. In some films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in 'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some episodes when his voice is recorded and he hears it, he instantly denies it being his voice and threatens to beat up the person who sang his songs in a very bad way (which is an irony). Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his hand-made food can be a nightmare for other people very easily.\n\nHowever, Gian does not hesitate to help his friends when they are in real trouble. Throughout the series, particularly the films, he is often the one who voices the most concern and refuses to look away when there is a problem, an opposite of Suneo's cowardice. While he is described by others as daunting and intimidating, he is very sensitive and prone to crying when something touching happens, and he actually values his friends highly, a feeling which his friends sometimes reciprocate.

A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy. He is often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He sometimes despises Nobita and often makes fun of him, most often resulting in Nobita getting into trouble. He also often pushes Nobita aside with silly excuses while he invites Gian and Shizuka to his parties or resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's closest friends, who would often ask for his and Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often the one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures, and he also tries to face as little trouble as possible and go home, unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward. He has an extensive knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer, besides being extremely cunning.\n\nIn some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that he is the most handsome guy in the world. His habit of bragging often lands him into trouble. Suneo is also very self-conscious about his height, being the shortest kid in his class. He likes [[steak]] and melon. There are many reasons why Suneo chooses Shizuka and Gian, except Nobita. It is because he tries to win Shizuka's favour and not to get harmed by Gian.\n\n===Dorami \"Doreme\"===\n\n\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Keiko Yokozawa]] (1980\u20132005), [[Chiaki (tarento)|Chiaki Fujimoto]] (2006\u2013present)|[[Wendee Lee]] (2014-2017)}}, [[Kim Seo-yeong]] (2016-2017, Korean)\n\n{{nihongo|Dorami|\u30c9\u30e9\u30df}} (born on 2 December 2114, Sagittarius) is Doraemon's younger sister. Who' s nickname is Doreme .Like Doraemon before he developed a fear of mice, she is yellow-skinned and has ears that resemble a large red bow. She and Doraemon are siblings due to the fact that they shared half of the oil from a can. Dorami lives in the 22nd-century Tokyo with Sewashi. She sometimes visits Nobita with a [[Time travel|time machine]] when Doraemon is \"off-duty\", to help Doraemon with something or to take care of Nobita when Doraemon has gone for his yearly health checkup. Dorami likes [[melonpan]] and is afraid of cockroaches like Nobita's mom. She is also shown to be a more advanced robot than Doraemon (Dorami is able to produce 10,000 horse power, in comparison to Doraemon's 129.3). Different from her malfunctioning brother, she is the smartest student during her school time, and has better skills in using gadgets. In a story, Nobita is intent on replacing Doraemon with Dorami due to her better skills; however, he quickly learns the fact that Dorami does not understand him as much as Doraemon does and will not tolerate his usual antics.\n\nDorami also has her own spin-off manga. In the manga series ''[[The Doraemons]]'', she is the love interest of Dora-the-Kid, Doraemon's friendly rival and the one most similar to him. Allegedly, she was originally pink, but turned yellow after drinking a potion labeled \"Jealousy\".\n\n===Mini-Doras===\n{{Voiced by|Chie Kitagawa (1990), [[Rei Sakuma]] (1994~March 2005), Tomato Akai (October 2005~)|[[Cristina Vee]] (2014)}}, [[Kim Seo-yeong]] (2016-2017, Korean)\n\n{{nihongo|Mini-Doras|\u30df\u30cb\u30c9\u30e9[\u305f\u3061]}} are one of the gadgets of Doraemon. They are mini versions of Doraemon with different color variation such as red, green and yellow variations. They can think and feel for themselves, and communicate with Doraemon through the \"Mini-Dora\" language (consisting of words like Dorara and speaking with gibberish accent). They act as helpers for all sorts of tasks, such as repairing the internal mechanism of Doraemon.\n\n==Nobi family==\n\n=== {{nihongo|Tamako Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u7389\u5b50|Nobi Tamako}} / Tammy Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Noriko Ohara]] (1973), [[Sachiko Chijimatsu]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] (April 2005 \u2013)|[[Mari Devon]] (2014)}}\n: Young {{voiced by|[[Tomoko Kawakami]]}}\n:: Tamako Nobi (born on 16 February, Aquarius) is Nobita's bespectacled, stay-at-home mother and one of the main [[protagonists]] in short stories, and the one Nobita inherits his appearance from. She can be very strict where she is often seen scolding Nobita for his actions, beating him, grounding him, or sending him out of the house (a typical Japanese household punishment used by parents). Several episodes involve Nobita trying to avoid his mother's scolding by using Doraemon's gadgets. Despite her disappointment with Nobita's lazy attitude and academic failures (even when her house is occasionally visited by Nobita's teacher for his progress in school), she is actually a good mother and cares about her son deeply. Her maiden last name is revealed to be {{nihongo|'''Kataoka'''|\u7247\u5ca1}}. She has a tendency of stopping Nobita from going out to play and forcing him to study. However on cold weather days, she always urges Nobita to go out and play to Nobita's intense displeasure. Her anxiety about the high household expenses is a recurring feature. In a couple of episodes where Nobita sees her in the past, it is revealed that she was rebellious even as a girl. She has an extreme dislike of animals and would always reject requests for any pet Nobita wants; this becomes a plot point in some of the films and stories where Nobita has to take in stray animals secretly. However in one story, her initial dislike of a cat turns her into adoring it so much that she becomes depressed when the cat's owner wants it back. In Mother vs. Rich Mother battle, she eats the Rival-making steak by accident; making her [[:wikt:rivalry|rivals]] with Suneo's mother. During the [[onion]]-cutting scene where she and Suneo's mother battle for who makes the tastiest [[curry]], her glasses help defend her eyes so that she will avoid crying from the onion's scent spreading into the eyes.\n\n'''Shizuka (\u3057\u305a\u304b)''' is also a member of Nobi family because she married Nobita.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobisuke Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u52a9|Nobi Nobisuke}} / Toby Nobi ===\n\n: Adult: {{Voiced by|[[Chichi Murasaki]] (1973), Masaryk Kate (1979~October 1992), Rukeyser Aka (October 1992~March 2005), [[Unoriginal Satsuma]] (April 2005~)|[[Tony Oliver]] (2014)}}\n: Young: {{voiced by|[[Norris Pharaoh]] (1979), [[Biko Yamada]] (1984~1985), Norris Ohara (1987), [[Mikoyan Himalayas]] (2005)}}\n:: Nobisuke (born on 12 March, Pisces), is Nobita's father and laid-back [[salaryman]]. He appears an easy-going father, often seen arriving home from work to soothe Tamako's anger towards Nobita. He has trouble quitting smoking and is self-conscious about his inability to pass the driving test. He also has a poor memory, is a borderline alcoholic, and sometimes arrives home drunk from nightly business meetings. Nobisuke often goes to [[golf]] which most Japanese businessmen and employees play. He had many similar personality traits with Nobita when he was young like getting bad grades, being poor at athletics, and getting scolded by his father. He has an impressive talent for painting, but did not choose to be an artist due to many reasons. Nobisuke is fond of Nobita and probably does not rebuke him like Tamako does because most of Nobita's inabilities and weaknesses remind him of his own childhood faults. Though he would makes comments or conversations that affect Nobita  considerably in one way or another. It was shown that he met Tamako on the day he had rejected an offer to be an artist from a wealthy gentleman, and feeling overjoyed, was running down the street at such speed that he barged straight into her, causing her to drop her ID card. This he latter returns and the acquaintance gradually turns into love and marriage.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobirou Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u90ce|Nobi Nobir\u014d}} / Chester Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yasuo Muramatsu]] (1980 \u2013 March 2005), [[K\u014dichi Hashimoto]] (November 2006)|[[Keith Silverstein]] (2013)}}\n:: Nobisuke's younger brother and an uncle of Nobita, with whom he is very friendly. He works overseas and only comes home during the Christmas-New Year holiday, which Nobita happily awaits every year since his uncle always gives him (and Doraemon) pocket money and presents on that time. He has a noticeably tanned skin due to his frequent stays in the tropics. In one chapter, he recounts on his many animal encounters, including an elephant which he thought had perished during [[World War II]]. The elephant is actually saved by Nobita and Doraemon due to a case of [[predestination paradox]].\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobie Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u6075|Nobi Nobie}} ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Megumi Hayashibara}}\n:: Nobirou's daughter and Nobita's younger cousin.

He is a timid [[Automobile salesperson|car salesman]], and this timidness prevented him from expressing his feelings to the woman he loves. Nobita and Doraemon, despite initially deteriorating matters, finally help him to propose to (and be accepted by) the lady.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobiru Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u308b|Nobi Nobiru}} ===\n\n:Voiced by: [[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n:: Nobisuke's father and Nobita's paternal grandfather who died before Nobita's birth. He was very strict and very rude to Nobisuke since he valued physical strength and athleticism which Nobisuke lacked, though after all he loved him very much. He did not apparently favour Nobisuke's artistic prowess, but he really treasured the portrait his son had made of him, and for which Nobisuke got first prize in school. His grandson only saw him when he traveled to the past. Despite being harsh to Nobisuke, he enjoys indulging Nobita when Nobita travels to the past.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobita's Grandmother|\u306e\u3073\u592a\u306e\u7956\u6bcd|Nobita no Sobo}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|Unknown (1973), Akiko Takamura (2000)}}\n:: Nobisuke's mother and Nobita's paternal grandmother who is only referred to as {{nihongo|Grandma|\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093|Ob\u0101chan}} by Nobita. She died when Nobita was in kindergarten before the main storyline. She is always seen as a kind woman, if a bit eccentric, and unlike her husband never scolded Nobisuke for his lack of interest in \"masculine activities\", such as getting in a fight. Nobita remembers her very fondly, with most of his better childhood memories being playing with her; many of his toys, including his old [[kendama]], which becomes a plot point in [[Doraemon: Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey|one film]], were given to him by his grandmother. When Nobita travels to the past, she always recognizes him as her grandson even if he has grown up. She appeared in a few episodes. She takes care of Nobita on his former days and in one of '''The Doraemons''' manga, she was proud to see Nobita grown up into a teenage boy.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Sewashi|\u30bb\u30ef\u30b7|Sewashi}} / Soby Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Seiko Minamoto]] (1973), Shikoku Ta (1980~March 2005), [[Saki Satsuma]] (August 2005)|[[Max Mittelman]] (2014)}}\n:: Nobita's great-great-grandson, he is the one who sends Doraemon back to the past to look after Nobita. Sewashi first bought Doraemon in 2112 when Doraemon still had ears and his original factory paint. He sent him because his pocket money was not much due to the debts the family inherited from Nobita, and he also wanted to help out his troubled great-grandfather. He seems to have more common sense and is smarter than Nobita, but is just as reluctant when it comes to studying. Sewashi is also the owner of Doraemon's sister, Dorami.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobisuke Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4\u30ce\u30d3\u30b9\u30b1|Nobi Nobisuke}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|[[Noriko Ohara]] (1979~March 2005), [[Yoshiko Kamei]] (April 2005~)}}\n:: Nobita and Shizuka's son, named after Nobita's father. Though being as stupid as his father, he is a strong child and a good athlete, and brave enough to bully Gian and Suneo's sons. The first time he met the present Nobita, he even beat up Nobita because he regarded him as an imposter. His real name is Nobita Nobi, Jr., but his parents often call him ''Nobisuke'' due to his grandfather's name.\n\n==Minamoto family==\n\n=== {{nihongo|Mrs. Minamoto|\u9759\u9999\u306e\u6bcd|Minamato no Haha}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|Unknown (1973), [[Keiko Yokozawa]] (1979~1981), Masako Matsubara (August 1981~March 2005), [[Ai Orikasa]] (April 2005~)|[[Wendee Lee]] (2015)}}\n:: Shizuka's mother.

His best-known appearance in the series is when Nobita and Doraemon eavesdrop on him talking to Shizuka the night before Nobita and her wedding, in which he trusts that Nobita will be able to take care of Shizuka. So he accepts Nobita as his daughter's spouse.

She loves Suneo very much and spoils him rotten. She is generous to Suneo's friends, but just like her son, she likes to show off her jewellery or branded handbags and sometimes makes Nobita's mother jealous. In the episode \"Mother Vs. Rich Mother Battle,\" she became Tamako's rival after eating the Rival-Making steak and competes Tamako of who makes the tastiest [[curry]]. In the 30 years special, she is seen as just as odd, and mischievous as her son. When she is introduced in the \"Saobody\" special, she is seen as someone who is very sexually active, and enticed. She has a thriving relationship with Suneo's father. She strives to be a spoiling, enticing grandmother to young Nala. When Nala is outside with her, she often laughs throwing her head back. She then smiles a cunning smile, calling Nala her \"best friend\", much like her son.

In the 1973 anime, Mrs. Goda was dead. In later anime projects, she is alive. Gian always tries to flee from her when she orders him to help in the matters of the store or do deliveries. Though being as strong as her son, she is a righteous person as she punishes her son whenever he bullies children as she doesn't want to let Gian hurt other children. Her harsh treatment towards Gian is driven by her love, and Gian too, though sometimes speaking ill of her, cares for his mother deeply. This is evident from the way Gian had painstakingly made a rice-cake, actually a gadget from Doraemon, which had healed his mother's health problem, despite being constantly mocked and annoyed during the process by Nobita and Suneo. Had he lost focus, the gadget would have lost effectiveness, but his love for his mother prevented him from losing concentration.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Sasuke Goda|\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u306e\u7236|Jaian no Chichi}} ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Unknown (1973), Masayuki Kat\u014d (1979~1980), [[Yu Shimaka]] (1987), [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] (November 1987), Y\u016b Shimaka (1993)|[[Kirk Thornton]] (2014)}}\n:: He mostly works outside to help his wife's store.

In earlier stories, she had bad tempers when something did not go as she pleases, though she mellows down in later stories. Had Doraemon not intervened, she would have been Nobita's wife in the future which is why her first appearance is earlier than Suneo and Gian in the series. However, Doraemon succeeds on his mission and Nobita eventually marries Shizuka. Her name ''Jaiko'' is usually considered a nickname in the same vein as her brother; her given name is never revealed in the series.\n\nAs an aspiring [[Mangaka|manga artist]], Jaiko goes by her pen name {{nihongo|'''Christine''' Goda|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30cd \u525b\u7530|Kurisuch\u012bne G\u014dda}}, and sometimes submits her manga to publishing companies for prizes. She usually fails because her storytelling is still rough, although she has received much attention from editors. Sometimes when she almost decides to give up writing comic books after failing to get good ideas, Gian and his friends, after being requested and sometimes forced, cheer her up.

Muku tries to be as brave as Gian, who praises his strength and courage, but in many emergencies he just runs away and enrages Gian. Initially Gian tried to get rid of him, but after he saved Gian, he has warmed up to him and become really friendly. Jaiko loves Muku very much and takes him on walks regularly.

His family is apparently wealthy, owning a house that is so large that one can lose one's way. His name literally means \"brilliant over-achiever\", and his last name is a pun on ''dekisugiru'' (\u51fa\u6765\u904e\u304e\u308b), which means \"over achieving\". Shizuka sometimes prefers the company of Dekisugi, who is more of her intellectual equal.

He is a cat-like [[robot]] created for Nobita from the future.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Xiao|title=Sassy and Subservient: Chinese Girls and Media in the Urbanizing Countryside|date=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109022964|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCptg4PDyK8C&pg=PA62}}</ref> But people often mistake him for a raccoon dog and he becomes angry as seen in many episodes. He is sent to the {{nihongo|Matsushiba Robot Factory|\u30de\u30c4\u30b7\u30d0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5de5\u5834}} as blueprint, and is sent back in time by Sewashi (Nobita's Great-great-grandson) to aid Nobita, since Sewashi learned from his parents that Nobita suffered much in his life and wanted to help him. Doraemon possesses a 4-dimensional pocket from which he can acquire various kinds of futuristic tools, gadgets, and playthings from a future department store. He also has the tendency to panic during emergencies, characterized by him frantically trying to pull out a very much-needed tool from his pocket, only to produce a huge assortment of household items and unwanted gadgets. Still, Doraemon is very friendly and intelligent, not to mention long-suffering because of Nobita's antics. Since Sewashi sent Doraemon to the past, Doraemon has been living as the unofficial fourth member of Nobita's family and acts like a second son to Nobita's parents, since despite being a robot, he requires basic needs for a person, such as eating, and also sleeps in the closet of Nobita's bedroom.\n\nDoraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly blue, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-coloured hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail \u2014 the appearance most identify him with today. In \"The Doraemons\" [[story arc]] (and the ''[[2112: The Birth of Doraemon]]'' short film), it is revealed that Doraemon's original paint color was yellow. After getting his ears gnawed off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into depression on top of a tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled \"sadness\". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and his voice changed due to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid [[fear of mice]] despite being a robotic cat, and he is now suffering from [[musophobia]].\n\nOne can turn Doraemon off by pulling his balloon tail. Doraemon is considered a substandard product because many of his robotic features (i.e. radar whiskers and cat-calling bell) malfunctioned after production due to an accident in the factory while he was being built. Due to this malfunction, Doraemon did not do well at the robot's school and during the final presentation show, he performed badly and nobody wanted to hire him, until baby Sewashi pushed the button. His parents were a bit reluctant, but since Sewashi liked him, they hired Doraemon, and he took care of him until Sewashi himself sent him to the past to take care of Nobita. Despite this, Doraemon shows a lot of intelligence and common sense. Whenever he hangs out with his friend Mii-Chan (a cute street cat), he calls it 'important and busy work' as excuses for not doing work when Nobita or his mother ask him to do something when he will be going out with Mii.\n\nDoraemon's favourite food is {{nihongo|''[[dorayaki]]''|\u3069\u3089\u713c\u304d}} (known as \"fudgy pudgy pie\" in the English version of the manga, \"yummy buns\" in the English, and \"dora-cakes/bean jam buns\" in other versions), a Japanese treat filled with red bean paste. While it might explain the origin of his name, it was revealed in one of the manga chapters that his name originates from the Japanese word {{nihongo|''nora neko''|\u306e\u3089\u732b}} for \"stray cat\", and the {{nihongo|''-emon''|\u885b\u9580}} ending which is part of traditional Japanese names, as seen also in, for example, Ishikawa Goemon.

He wears glasses, a red or yellow polo shirt with a white collar, and blue or black shorts. Nobita is usually foolish, uncoordinated, lazy, dimwitted, weak, frail, childish and bad at sports. He dislikes books and possesses basic scientific knowledge, being unable to understand concepts such as the definition of an eclipse. He envies Dekisugi, who is good at everything and admired by Shizuka. He often takes any chance to get a nap and favors gadgets that give him extra time or do work for him, and is thus known as 'The Lazy King'. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's gadgets, he shows them off to Shizuka but not to Suneo and Gian.\n\nNobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring zero (0%) (F's in the English dub) on his tests, getting scolded by his teacher, being teased by his classmates Gian and Suneo, falling in the curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs after mistakenly stepping on their tails, getting grounded by his mother for not completing his homework, and being bullied by all his friends except [[Shizuka]] who remembers Nobita's kind heart and cares for him. He is scared by almost everything, particularly ghosts, and is a cry-baby (a running gag in the show is Nobita crying and asking for Doraemon to bring out his gadgets, mostly at the beginning of the episode). He dislikes going on outdoor activities with his interest being afternoon naps and reading comics, usually right after school. In fact, these are probably his only true hobbies; for example, one story features Nobita falling asleep in three seconds just by closing his eyes, while in others he chooses sleep over important events, such as watching the first sunrise on New Year's Day. The only things stopping him from staying at home all the time, other than experimenting with Doraemon's gadgets, are Gian and Suneo coercing him into participate in baseball games, and being forced by Doraemon or his parents to do so.\n\nEven though Nobita has many flaws, he is kind-hearted, emotional, honest, occasionally hard-working (such as when he gets into a wager with his friends) and sometimes courageous (for example, when Shizuka is in danger). He has often risked his life to help save others, or even entire civilizations in full-length stories. And despite being shown to be academically poor, the reason behind it is principally his laziness, and he has secured good marks when incited to do so in some episodes, proving his credentials. Nobita can be very serious and responsible at times, such as when he cares for pets. Though he is weak at most things, he does have some strengths. For example, he has excellent marksmanship which rivals (or even surpasses) Dora the Kid. He can also weave excellent string figures, and is a fairly good comic book critic, owing to the huge amount of time he spends reading them. Nobita is also very creative when it comes to utilizing Doraemon's gadgets. For example, in one episode, he finds a way to profitably use a gadget called ''the Broadcasting mirror'' for advertising, even when Doraemon himself couldn't think of any use for it.\n\n===Shizuka Nobi / Shizuka Minamoto===\n{{anchor|Sue|Sue Morris}}\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Shizuka Nobi\n| series\n| colour       = pink\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />Masako Ebisu (1973), [[Michiko Nomura]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Rei Sakuma]] (2000), [[Yumi Kakazu]] (2005\u2013present)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Cassandra Morris]]\n| oaux1 name   = Portrayed by\n| oaux1        = \n| nickname     = Shizuka-chan<br />Sue\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Female\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Nobita Nobi (husband)<br />Yoshio Minamoto  (father)<br />Mrs. Minamoto (mother)<br />Kazu (cousin)<br />Shizunadahime (ancestor)<br />Shizu (ancestor)<br />Nobisuke Nobi (son)<br />Nobisuke's son (grandson)<br />Sewashi's father (great-grandson)<br />Sewashi Nobi (great-great-grandson)<br />Sewashi's cousin (great-great-grandniece)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 9\u201310\n| paux2 name   = Birthday \n| paux2        = May 8, 1962 (1969)<br>May 8, 1965 (1973)<br>May 8, 1974 (1979)<br>May 8, 2000 (2005)\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}} \n{{nihongo|Shizuka Minamoto|\u6e90 \u9759\u9999|Minamoto Shizuka|English dub: Sue Morris}} (born on 8 May, Taurus), nicknamed {{nihongo|Shizuka-chan|\u3057\u305a\u304b\u3061\u3083\u3093}} is a smart, kind and pretty girl. The word 'Shizuka (\u3057\u305a\u304b)' means 'Quiet'. She is Nobita's best friend and he has a crush on her. She does not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy disposition or constant failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage him to do better, though she usually fails to convince him. Shizuka likes to take a bath several times a day; however, a [[running gag]] in the series is that she is sometimes interrupted by sudden appearance of Nobita, Gian, or Suneo, usually due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like the ''Anywhere Door'' (''Doko Demo Doa'' in Japanese) (the scene ends with Shizuka shouting, \"Go away!\" to them). Her true passions are [[sweet potato]]es, which she would rather keep to herself out of the knowledge of others, and the violin, in which her playing is even more horrendous than Gian's singing. She is also known for taking piano lessons unwillingly due to her mother's wishes (as she loves violin more), which is sometimes a reason for declining to hang out with friends (but she plays piano better than violin). Shizuka is an animal lover and keeps two pets at home: a dog, who is saved from succumbing to illness by Nobita and Doraemon in one story; and a canary which runs away on multiple occasions and causing Shizuka and Nobita to run around the city chasing her down.\n\nDue to Nobita's heartiest effort and Doraemon's assistance, Shizuka marries Nobita in the future. At present, she does not have any particular crush (but Shizuka secretly loves Nobita very much). Sometimes she fancies some handsome idols on TV. Besides Nobita, Shizuka is also close to her classmate and popular student Dekisugi which makes Nobita jealous. Though they consider each other only as friends, Nobita often tries to prevent them from going together.\n\n===Takeshi Goda \"Gian\"===\n\n\n\n{{anchor|Gian|Big G}}\n<br /> \n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Takeshi Goda \" Gian\"\n| series       =\n| image        = \n| colour       = orange\n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />[[Kaneta Kimotsuki]] (1973), [[Kazuya Tatekabe]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Subaru Kimura]] (2005\u2013present)<br/>[[Kujira]] (2000; Teen)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Kaiji Tang]]\n| oaux1 name   = Portrayed by\n| oaux1        = \n| nickname     = Gian<br>Big G\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Male\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Takeshi's wife (wife)<br />Jaiko Goda (sister)<br />Mr. Goda (father)<br />Sasuke Goda (mother)<br />Gian's uncle (maternal uncle)<br />Gian's aunt (maternal aunt)<br />Takezuchi (ancestor)<br />Jaizou (ancestor)<br />Yasashiku Gouda (son)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 12\u201313\n| paux2 name   = Birthday\n| paux2        = June 15, 1959 (1969)<br>June 15, 1962 (1973)<br>June 15, 1971 (1979)<br>June 15, 1997 (2005)\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|Takeshi Goda|\u525b\u7530 \u6b66|G\u014dda Takeshi}} (born on 15 June, Gemini), usually known by the nickname {{nihongo|\"Gian\"|\u300c\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u300d|\"Jaian\"|English: Big G}}, is a strong and quick-tempered local [[Bullying|bully]]. He also frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Suneo's) under the pretext of \"borrowing\" them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his horrible singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes \"invites\" others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible that, once, Nobita and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, his writings of the song lyrics in a board end up having the same effect as when they hear them. In some films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in 'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some episodes when his voice is recorded and he hears it, he instantly denies it being his voice and threatens to beat up the person who sang his songs in a very bad way (which is an irony). Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his hand-made food can be a nightmare for other people very easily.\n\nHowever, Gian does not hesitate to help his friends when they are in real trouble. Throughout the series, particularly the films, he is often the one who voices the most concern and refuses to look away when there is a problem, an opposite of Suneo's cowardice. While he is described by others as daunting and intimidating, he is very sensitive and prone to crying when something touching happens, and he actually values his friends highly, a feeling which his friends sometimes reciprocate. Gian also has a soft spot for his younger sister, Jaiko, and usually tries to prevent her from trouble, even if she can perfectly handle her situation.\n\nHis catchphrase is {{nihongo|\"What's mine is mine.

A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy. He is often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He sometimes despises Nobita and often makes fun of him, most often resulting in Nobita getting into trouble. He also often pushes Nobita aside with silly excuses while he invites Gian and Shizuka to his parties or resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's closest friends, who would often ask for his and Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often the one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures, and he also tries to face as little trouble as possible and go home, unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward. He has an extensive knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer, besides being extremely cunning.\n\nIn some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that he is the most handsome guy in the world. His habit of bragging often lands him into trouble. Suneo is also very self-conscious about his height, being the shortest kid in his class. He likes [[steak]] and melon. There are many reasons why Suneo chooses Shizuka and Gian, except Nobita. It is because he tries to win Shizuka's favour and not to get harmed by Gian.\n\n===Dorami \"Doreme\"===\n\n\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Keiko Yokozawa]] (1980\u20132005), [[Chiaki (tarento)|Chiaki Fujimoto]] (2006\u2013present)|[[Wendee Lee]] (2014-2017)}}, [[Kim Seo-yeong]] (2016-2017, Korean)\n\n{{nihongo|Dorami|\u30c9\u30e9\u30df}} (born on 2 December 2114, Sagittarius) is Doraemon's younger sister.

She and Doraemon are siblings due to the fact that they shared half of the oil from a can. Dorami lives in the 22nd-century Tokyo with Sewashi. She sometimes visits Nobita with a [[Time travel|time machine]] when Doraemon is \"off-duty\", to help Doraemon with something or to take care of Nobita when Doraemon has gone for his yearly health checkup. Dorami likes [[melonpan]] and is afraid of cockroaches like Nobita's mom. She is also shown to be a more advanced robot than Doraemon (Dorami is able to produce 10,000 horse power, in comparison to Doraemon's 129.3). Different from her malfunctioning brother, she is the smartest student during her school time, and has better skills in using gadgets. In a story, Nobita is intent on replacing Doraemon with Dorami due to her better skills; however, he quickly learns the fact that Dorami does not understand him as much as Doraemon does and will not tolerate his usual antics.\n\nDorami also has her own spin-off manga. In the manga series ''[[The Doraemons]]'', she is the love interest of Dora-the-Kid, Doraemon's friendly rival and the one most similar to him. Allegedly, she was originally pink, but turned yellow after drinking a potion labeled \"Jealousy\".\n\n===Mini-Doras===\n{{Voiced by|Chie Kitagawa (1990), [[Rei Sakuma]] (1994~March 2005), Tomato Akai (October 2005~)|[[Cristina Vee]] (2014)}}, [[Kim Seo-yeong]] (2016-2017, Korean)\n\n{{nihongo|Mini-Doras|\u30df\u30cb\u30c9\u30e9[\u305f\u3061]}} are one of the gadgets of Doraemon. They are mini versions of Doraemon with different color variation such as red, green and yellow variations. They can think and feel for themselves, and communicate with Doraemon through the \"Mini-Dora\" language (consisting of words like Dorara and speaking with gibberish accent). They act as helpers for all sorts of tasks, such as repairing the internal mechanism of Doraemon.\n\n==Nobi family==\n\n=== {{nihongo|Tamako Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u7389\u5b50|Nobi Tamako}} / Tammy Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Noriko Ohara]] (1973), [[Sachiko Chijimatsu]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] (April 2005 \u2013)|[[Mari Devon]] (2014)}}\n: Young {{voiced by|[[Tomoko Kawakami]]}}\n:: Tamako Nobi (born on 16 February, Aquarius) is Nobita's bespectacled, stay-at-home mother and one of the main [[protagonists]] in short stories, and the one Nobita inherits his appearance from. She can be very strict where she is often seen scolding Nobita for his actions, beating him, grounding him, or sending him out of the house (a typical Japanese household punishment used by parents). Several episodes involve Nobita trying to avoid his mother's scolding by using Doraemon's gadgets. Despite her disappointment with Nobita's lazy attitude and academic failures (even when her house is occasionally visited by Nobita's teacher for his progress in school), she is actually a good mother and cares about her son deeply. Her maiden last name is revealed to be {{nihongo|'''Kataoka'''|\u7247\u5ca1}}. She has a tendency of stopping Nobita from going out to play and forcing him to study. However on cold weather days, she always urges Nobita to go out and play to Nobita's intense displeasure. Her anxiety about the high household expenses is a recurring feature. In a couple of episodes where Nobita sees her in the past, it is revealed that she was rebellious even as a girl. She has an extreme dislike of animals and would always reject requests for any pet Nobita wants; this becomes a plot point in some of the films and stories where Nobita has to take in stray animals secretly. However in one story, her initial dislike of a cat turns her into adoring it so much that she becomes depressed when the cat's owner wants it back. In Mother vs. Rich Mother battle, she eats the Rival-making steak by accident; making her [[:wikt:rivalry|rivals]] with Suneo's mother. During the [[onion]]-cutting scene where she and Suneo's mother battle for who makes the tastiest [[curry]], her glasses help defend her eyes so that she will avoid crying from the onion's scent spreading into the eyes.\n\n'''Shizuka (\u3057\u305a\u304b)''' is also a member of Nobi family because she married Nobita.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobisuke Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u52a9|Nobi Nobisuke}} / Toby Nobi ===\n\n: Adult: {{Voiced by|[[Chichi Murasaki]] (1973), Masaryk Kate (1979~October 1992), Rukeyser Aka (October 1992~March 2005), [[Unoriginal Satsuma]] (April 2005~)|[[Tony Oliver]] (2014)}}\n: Young: {{voiced by|[[Norris Pharaoh]] (1979), [[Biko Yamada]] (1984~1985), Norris Ohara (1987), [[Mikoyan Himalayas]] (2005)}}\n:: Nobisuke (born on 12 March, Pisces), is Nobita's father and laid-back [[salaryman]]. He appears an easy-going father, often seen arriving home from work to soothe Tamako's anger towards Nobita. He has trouble quitting smoking and is self-conscious about his inability to pass the driving test. He also has a poor memory, is a borderline alcoholic, and sometimes arrives home drunk from nightly business meetings. Nobisuke often goes to [[golf]] which most Japanese businessmen and employees play. He had many similar personality traits with Nobita when he was young like getting bad grades, being poor at athletics, and getting scolded by his father. He has an impressive talent for painting, but did not choose to be an artist due to many reasons. Nobisuke is fond of Nobita and probably does not rebuke him like Tamako does because most of Nobita's inabilities and weaknesses remind him of his own childhood faults. Though he would makes comments or conversations that affect Nobita  considerably in one way or another. It was shown that he met Tamako on the day he had rejected an offer to be an artist from a wealthy gentleman, and feeling overjoyed, was running down the street at such speed that he barged straight into her, causing her to drop her ID card. This he latter returns and the acquaintance gradually turns into love and marriage.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobirou Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u90ce|Nobi Nobir\u014d}} / Chester Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yasuo Muramatsu]] (1980 \u2013 March 2005), [[K\u014dichi Hashimoto]] (November 2006)|[[Keith Silverstein]] (2013)}}\n:: Nobisuke's younger brother and an uncle of Nobita, with whom he is very friendly. He works overseas and only comes home during the Christmas-New Year holiday, which Nobita happily awaits every year since his uncle always gives him (and Doraemon) pocket money and presents on that time. He has a noticeably tanned skin due to his frequent stays in the tropics. In one chapter, he recounts on his many animal encounters, including an elephant which he thought had perished during [[World War II]]. The elephant is actually saved by Nobita and Doraemon due to a case of [[predestination paradox]].\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobie Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u6075|Nobi Nobie}} ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Megumi Hayashibara}}\n:: Nobirou's daughter and Nobita's younger cousin.

He is a timid [[Automobile salesperson|car salesman]], and this timidness prevented him from expressing his feelings to the woman he loves. Nobita and Doraemon, despite initially deteriorating matters, finally help him to propose to (and be accepted by) the lady.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobiru Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u308b|Nobi Nobiru}} ===\n\n:Voiced by: [[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n:: Nobisuke's father and Nobita's paternal grandfather who died before Nobita's birth. He was very strict and very rude to Nobisuke since he valued physical strength and athleticism which Nobisuke lacked, though after all he loved him very much. He did not apparently favour Nobisuke's artistic prowess, but he really treasured the portrait his son had made of him, and for which Nobisuke got first prize in school. His grandson only saw him when he traveled to the past. Despite being harsh to Nobisuke, he enjoys indulging Nobita when Nobita travels to the past.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobita's Grandmother|\u306e\u3073\u592a\u306e\u7956\u6bcd|Nobita no Sobo}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|Unknown (1973), Akiko Takamura (2000)}}\n:: Nobisuke's mother and Nobita's paternal grandmother who is only referred to as {{nihongo|Grandma|\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093|Ob\u0101chan}} by Nobita. She died when Nobita was in kindergarten before the main storyline. She is always seen as a kind woman, if a bit eccentric, and unlike her husband never scolded Nobisuke for his lack of interest in \"masculine activities\", such as getting in a fight. Nobita remembers her very fondly, with most of his better childhood memories being playing with her; many of his toys, including his old [[kendama]], which becomes a plot point in [[Doraemon: Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey|one film]], were given to him by his grandmother. When Nobita travels to the past, she always recognizes him as her grandson even if he has grown up. She appeared in a few episodes. She takes care of Nobita on his former days and in one of '''The Doraemons''' manga, she was proud to see Nobita grown up into a teenage boy.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Sewashi|\u30bb\u30ef\u30b7|Sewashi}} / Soby Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Seiko Minamoto]] (1973), Shikoku Ta (1980~March 2005), [[Saki Satsuma]] (August 2005)|[[Max Mittelman]] (2014)}}\n:: Nobita's great-great-grandson, he is the one who sends Doraemon back to the past to look after Nobita. Sewashi first bought Doraemon in 2112 when Doraemon still had ears and his original factory paint. He sent him because his pocket money was not much due to the debts the family inherited from Nobita, and he also wanted to help out his troubled great-grandfather. He seems to have more common sense and is smarter than Nobita, but is just as reluctant when it comes to studying. Sewashi is also the owner of Doraemon's sister, Dorami.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobisuke Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4\u30ce\u30d3\u30b9\u30b1|Nobi Nobisuke}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|[[Noriko Ohara]] (1979~March 2005), [[Yoshiko Kamei]] (April 2005~)}}\n:: Nobita and Shizuka's son, named after Nobita's father. Though being as stupid as his father, he is a strong child and a good athlete, and brave enough to bully Gian and Suneo's sons. The first time he met the present Nobita, he even beat up Nobita because he regarded him as an imposter. His real name is Nobita Nobi, Jr., but his parents often call him ''Nobisuke'' due to his grandfather's name.\n\n==Minamoto family==\n\n=== {{nihongo|Mrs. Minamoto|\u9759\u9999\u306e\u6bcd|Minamato no Haha}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|Unknown (1973), [[Keiko Yokozawa]] (1979~1981), Masako Matsubara (August 1981~March 2005), [[Ai Orikasa]] (April 2005~)|[[Wendee Lee]] (2015)}}\n:: Shizuka's mother.

His best-known appearance in the series is when Nobita and Doraemon eavesdrop on him talking to Shizuka the night before Nobita and her wedding, in which he trusts that Nobita will be able to take care of Shizuka. So he accepts Nobita as his daughter's spouse. He is the only parent of Nobita's friends who is named.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Peeko|\u30d4\u30fc\u5b50|P\u012bko}} / Sunny ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Unknown}}\n:: Shizuka's lovely pet [[Domestic canary|canary]].

She loves Suneo very much and spoils him rotten. She is generous to Suneo's friends, but just like her son, she likes to show off her jewellery or branded handbags and sometimes makes Nobita's mother jealous. In the episode \"Mother Vs. Rich Mother Battle,\" she became Tamako's rival after eating the Rival-Making steak and competes Tamako of who makes the tastiest [[curry]]. In the 30 years special, she is seen as just as odd, and mischievous as her son. When she is introduced in the \"Saobody\" special, she is seen as someone who is very sexually active, and enticed. She has a thriving relationship with Suneo's father. She strives to be a spoiling, enticing grandmother to young Nala. When Nala is outside with her, she often laughs throwing her head back. She then smiles a cunning smile, calling Nala her \"best friend\", much like her son.

In the 1973 anime, Mrs. Goda was dead. In later anime projects, she is alive. Gian always tries to flee from her when she orders him to help in the matters of the store or do deliveries. Though being as strong as her son, she is a righteous person as she punishes her son whenever he bullies children as she doesn't want to let Gian hurt other children. Her harsh treatment towards Gian is driven by her love, and Gian too, though sometimes speaking ill of her, cares for his mother deeply. This is evident from the way Gian had painstakingly made a rice-cake, actually a gadget from Doraemon, which had healed his mother's health problem, despite being constantly mocked and annoyed during the process by Nobita and Suneo. Had he lost focus, the gadget would have lost effectiveness, but his love for his mother prevented him from losing concentration.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Sasuke Goda|\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u306e\u7236|Jaian no Chichi}} ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Unknown (1973), Masayuki Kat\u014d (1979~1980), [[Yu Shimaka]] (1987), [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] (November 1987), Y\u016b Shimaka (1993)|[[Kirk Thornton]] (2014)}}\n:: He mostly works outside to help his wife's store. Though being the parent who is the least recurring in Fujiko's story, he is known to be the strongest man in the town that he lives in.

In earlier stories, she had bad tempers when something did not go as she pleases, though she mellows down in later stories. Had Doraemon not intervened, she would have been Nobita's wife in the future which is why her first appearance is earlier than Suneo and Gian in the series. However, Doraemon succeeds on his mission and Nobita eventually marries Shizuka. Her name ''Jaiko'' is usually considered a nickname in the same vein as her brother; her given name is never revealed in the series.\n\nAs an aspiring [[Mangaka|manga artist]], Jaiko goes by her pen name {{nihongo|'''Christine''' Goda|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30cd \u525b\u7530|Kurisuch\u012bne G\u014dda}}, and sometimes submits her manga to publishing companies for prizes. She usually fails because her storytelling is still rough, although she has received much attention from editors. Sometimes when she almost decides to give up writing comic books after failing to get good ideas, Gian and his friends, after being requested and sometimes forced, cheer her up. Unlike Gian, she is kind, polite and good at studies. She and Moteo Mote are good friends.

Muku tries to be as brave as Gian, who praises his strength and courage, but in many emergencies he just runs away and enrages Gian. Initially Gian tried to get rid of him, but after he saved Gian, he has warmed up to him and become really friendly. Jaiko loves Muku very much and takes him on walks regularly.

He is very intelligent and has a photographic memory. Dekisugi is the perfect all-round student, consistently getting 100s in class (A+'s in English Dub) and also being highly capable in sports. His family is apparently wealthy, owning a house that is so large that one can lose one's way. His name literally means \"brilliant over-achiever\", and his last name is a pun on ''dekisugiru'' (\u51fa\u6765\u904e\u304e\u308b), which means \"over achieving\". Shizuka sometimes prefers the company of Dekisugi, who is more of her intellectual equal. Nobita often feels jealous and concocts bizarre schemes (helped by Doraemon's gadgets) to keep them apart or to win Shizuka's attention. However, Dekisugi never gets angry at Nobita and even willingly helps Nobita whenever he has philosophical or scientific questions. Dekisugi is polite, respectful, and will never argue with or fault anyone even in the most ridiculous of situations \u2013 instead he will always say something positive to lighten the mood.\n\nIn the future, it is shown that in spite of Shizuka's friendship with Dekisugi, she still marries Nobita while Dekisugi himself is wed to another woman.

He sometimes tries to encourage Nobita through kindness to study and get good marks, and sometimes resorts to punishments that range from making Nobita stand in the hallway or clean the classroom alone after school. While Teacher is impressed by Dekisugi's progress and occasionally scolds Gian, Suneo tends to fool Teacher with conning lies or superstitions. Teacher often pays unexpected visits to the Nobi's in order to inform Tamako Nobi about Nobita's recent exam results and his academic position. Nobita's feelings towards him are varied ranging from fear to respect and admiration depending on the situation.\n\nTeacher's real name is unknown.

The children always try not to anger Kaminari and play carefully. Recovering the ball without getting shouted at is difficult.
