football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932|4\u20134\u20131\u20131]] formation.\n|}\nCompared with the club's [[1997\u201398 Arsenal F.C. season|double-winning side of 1998]], only [[Patrick Vieira]] and [[Dennis Bergkamp]] remained as first team players throughout the unbeaten run; [[Martin Keown]] featured briefly, while [[Ray Parlour]] made 25 league appearances. Defenders [[Lee Dixon]] and [[Tony Adams]] had retired from professional football in 2002 and goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] joined Manchester City a year later. [[Kolo Tour\u00e9]], signed as a right-back and defensive midfielder, was chosen to play in central defence alongside [[Sol Campbell]] after impressing during pre-season. [[Lauren (footballer)|Lauren]] who played as a midfielder for [[Real Mallorca]] was shifted as a right-back when he joined Arsenal. Wenger initially replaced left-back [[Nigel Winterburn]] with [[Sylvinho]], but an injury to the defender allowed [[Ashley Cole]] to take his place as first pick by the [[2000\u201301 Arsenal F.C. season|2000\u201301]] season. In midfield [[Gilberto Silva]] partnered Vieira, and [[Freddie Ljungberg]] and [[Robert Pires]] each played either side of the wing. [[Thierry Henry]], signed as [[Nicolas Anelka]]'s replacement in 1999, was the team's focal point in attack; he was supported most often by Bergkamp.\n\nAlthough the team were interpreted as one which organised themselves as [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4\u20134\u20132]], the formation with the ball was akin to [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20131\u20131|4\u20134\u20131\u20131]]. Wenger's tactics emphasised attacking football and relied on movement and interchanging, with full-backs joining in attacks. Journalist [[Michael Cox (journalist)|Michael Cox]] noted Arsenal's strengths lay on the left side of the pitch and added because the opposition focused on containing Cole, Pires and Henry, it allowed Lauren and Ljungberg to find space and cross the ball. The team were also strong on the counter, exemplified in their away performances against Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite news |title=Henry torments poor Leeds

Bergkamp]] remained as first team players throughout the unbeaten run; [[Martin Keown]] featured briefly, while [[Ray Parlour]] made 25 league appearances. Defenders [[Lee Dixon]] and [[Tony Adams]] had retired from professional football in 2002 and goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] joined Manchester City a year later. [[Kolo Tour\u00e9]], signed as a right-back and defensive midfielder, was chosen to play in central defence alongside [[Sol Campbell]] after impressing during pre-season. [[Lauren (footballer)|Lauren]] who played as a midfielder for [[Real Mallorca]] was shifted as a right-back when he joined Arsenal. Wenger initially replaced left-back [[Nigel Winterburn]] with [[Sylvinho]], but an injury to the defender allowed [[Ashley Cole]] to take his place as first pick by the [[2000\u201301 Arsenal F.C. season|2000\u201301]] season. In midfield [[Gilberto Silva]] partnered Vieira, and [[Freddie Ljungberg]] and [[Robert Pires]] each played either side of the wing. [[Thierry Henry]], signed as [[Nicolas Anelka]]'s replacement in 1999, was the team's focal point in attack; he was supported most often by Bergkamp.\n\nAlthough the team were interpreted as one which organised themselves as [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4\u20134\u20132]], the formation with the ball was akin to [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20131\u20131|4\u20134\u20131\u20131]]. Wenger's tactics emphasised attacking football and relied on movement and interchanging, with full-backs joining in attacks. Journalist [[Michael Cox (journalist)|Michael Cox]] noted Arsenal's strengths lay on the left side of the pitch and added because the opposition focused on containing Cole, Pires and Henry, it allowed Lauren and Ljungberg to find space and cross the ball. The team were also strong on the counter, exemplified in their away performances against Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite news |title=Henry torments poor Leeds

{"title_page": "Curzon Wyllie", "text_new": "{{Use Indian English|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2011}}\n'''William Hutt Curzon Wyllie''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCIE|CVO}} (5 October 1848 \u2013 1 July 1909) was a [[British Indian Army|British Indian army officer]], and later an official of the British Indian Government. Over a career spanning three decades, Curzon Wyllie rose to be Lieutenant Colonel in the British Indian Army and occupied a number of administrative and diplomatic posts. He was the British resident to Nepal and the Princely state of Rajputana, and later, the political ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the Secretary of State for India, [[Lord George Hamilton]]. Curzon Wyllie was assassinated on 1 July 1909 in [[London]] by the Indian revolutionary [[Madan Lal Dhingra]] (who was a member of \"INDIA HOUSE\" at London).\n\n==Early life==\nCurzon Wyllie was born at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 October 1848 to General [[William Wyllie (British Army officer)|William Wyllie]] (1802\u20131891) and his wife, Amelia (1806\u20131891). Third and youngest son of five children, Wyllie was educated at [[Marlborough College]] (1863\u20134) and the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] (1865\u20136) before joining the army in October 1866 as ensign 106th foot ([[Durham Light Infantry]]), subsequently arriving in India in 1867. Both his elder brothers, John William Shaw Wyllie (1835\u20131870) and Francis Robert Shaw Wyllie (1837\u20131907) served in India. The latter Francis Shaw Wyllie joined the Bombay civil service, became under-secretary to the Bombay government, and died in London in February 1907.\n\n==Indian Service==\nArriving in India in February 1867, Wyllie was promoted to lieutenant in October 1868 and joined the Indian staff corps in 1869. He was posted to the 2nd Gurkha regiment (the Sirmoor Rifles, later the 2nd King Edward's Own Gurkhas) for a year. In 1870, Wyllie was selected for civil and political employment and appointed to the [[Oudh]] commission, serving under General Barrow and Sir George Couper.\n[[File:Richmond Cemetery, William Hutt Curzon Wyllie memorial.jpg|thumb|Grave of Curzon Wyllie, Richmond Cemetery]]\nWyllie was promoted to captain in October 1878 and transferred to the foreign department in January 1879, serving as cantonment magistrate of Nasirabad, assistant commissioner in Ajmer-Merwara, and subsequently as the assistant to Sir Robert Groves Sandeman, the governor-general's agent in Baluchistan. He was a part of Major-General Sir Robert Phayre's contingent in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] when his actions earned him mentions in the Viceroy's dispatches. After the war, Wyllie was appointed the military secretary to the governor of Madras, William Patrick Adam (later also his brother-in-law) from December 1880 until Adam's death in the following May. In December 1881, Wyllie married Katharine Georgiana Carmichael, second daughter of David Fremantle Carmichael of the Indian Civil Service. Made CIE in 1881, he was promoted major in October 1886 and lieutenant-colonel in 1892.\n\nWyllie served as the private secretary to the acting governor William Hudleston till November 1881, subsequently overseeing the affairs of Malhar Rao Gaekwar of Baroda before taking the post of the assistant resident at Hyderabad from December 1881 to November 1882.  Through the next 14 years, Wyllie served in political and government posts in a number of different places, mostly in [[Rajputana]] . During this time he oversaw the reliefs for [[Indian famine of 1899\u20131900|the famine of 1899-1900]]. In between 1893 and 1899, Wyllie was the officiating resident in Nepal when in February 1898 he was selected as the agent to the governor-general in central India.

Over a career spanning three decades, Curzon Wyllie rose to be Lieutenant Colonel in the British Indian Army and occupied a number of administrative and diplomatic posts. He was the British resident to Nepal and the Princely state of Rajputana, and later, the political ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the Secretary of State for India, [[Lord George Hamilton]]. Curzon Wyllie was assassinated on 1 July 1909 in [[London]] by the Indian revolutionary [[Madan Lal Dhingra]] (who was a member of \"INDIA HOUSE\" at London).\n\n==Early life==\nCurzon Wyllie was born at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 October 1848 to General [[William Wyllie (British Army officer)|William Wyllie]] (1802\u20131891) and his wife, Amelia (1806\u20131891). Third and youngest son of five children, Wyllie was educated at [[Marlborough College]] (1863\u20134) and the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] (1865\u20136) before joining the army in October 1866 as ensign 106th foot ([[Durham Light Infantry]]), subsequently arriving in India in 1867. Both his elder brothers, John William Shaw Wyllie (1835\u20131870) and Francis Robert Shaw Wyllie (1837\u20131907) served in India. The latter Francis Shaw Wyllie joined the Bombay civil service, became under-secretary to the Bombay government, and died in London in February 1907.\n\n==Indian Service==\nArriving in India in February 1867, Wyllie was promoted to lieutenant in October 1868 and joined the Indian staff corps in 1869. He was posted to the 2nd Gurkha regiment (the Sirmoor Rifles, later the 2nd King Edward's Own Gurkhas) for a year. In 1870, Wyllie was selected for civil and political employment and appointed to the [[Oudh]] commission, serving under General Barrow and Sir George Couper.\n[[File:Richmond Cemetery, William Hutt Curzon Wyllie memorial.jpg|thumb|Grave of Curzon Wyllie, Richmond Cemetery]]\nWyllie was promoted to captain in October 1878 and transferred to the foreign department in January 1879, serving as cantonment magistrate of Nasirabad, assistant commissioner in Ajmer-Merwara, and subsequently as the assistant to Sir Robert Groves Sandeman, the governor-general's agent in Baluchistan. He was a part of Major-General Sir Robert Phayre's contingent in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] when his actions earned him mentions in the Viceroy's dispatches. After the war, Wyllie was appointed the military secretary to the governor of Madras, William Patrick Adam (later also his brother-in-law) from December 1880 until Adam's death in the following May. In December 1881, Wyllie married Katharine Georgiana Carmichael, second daughter of David Fremantle Carmichael of the Indian Civil Service. Made CIE in 1881, he was promoted major in October 1886 and lieutenant-colonel in 1892.\n\nWyllie served as the private secretary to the acting governor William Hudleston till November 1881, subsequently overseeing the affairs of Malhar Rao Gaekwar of Baroda before taking the post of the assistant resident at Hyderabad from December 1881 to November 1882.  Through the next 14 years, Wyllie served in political and government posts in a number of different places, mostly in [[Rajputana]] . During this time he oversaw the reliefs for [[Indian famine of 1899\u20131900|the famine of 1899-1900]]. In between 1893 and 1899, Wyllie was the officiating resident in Nepal when in February 1898 he was selected as the agent to the governor-general in central India.
