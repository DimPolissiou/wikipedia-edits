In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often refered to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). Often the membranes are very close together making to see the distinction between them. This structure is often also refered to as the tri-layered structure.

Frederick Rentschler approached these men as he sought capital and assets for his new venture. Deeds and G. Rentschler persuaded the board of Niles Bement Pond that their [[Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems|Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool]] (P&WMT) subsidiary of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], should provide the funding and location to build a new aircraft engine being developed by Rentschler, [[George J. Mead]], and colleagues, all formerly of [[Wright Aeronautical]].<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> Conceived and designed by Mead,<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> the new engine would be a large, [[air-cooled engine|air-cooled]], [[radial engine|radial]] design. Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool was going through a period of self-revision at the time to prepare itself for the post-[[World War I|Great War]] era, discontinuing old product lines and incubating new ones.<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> The Great War had been profitable to P&WMT, but the peace brought a predictable glut to the machine tool market, as contracts with governments were canceled and the market in used, recently built tools competed against new ones. P&WMT's future growth would depend on innovation. Having idle factory space and capital available at this historical moment, to be invested wherever good [[rate of return|return]] seemed available,<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> P&WMT saw the [[postwar aviation]] industry, both [[military aviation|military]] and [[civil aviation|civil (commercial, private)]], as one with some of the greatest growth and development potential available anywhere for the next few decades. It lent Rentschler $250,000, the use of the Pratt & Whitney name, and space in their building. This was the beginning of the '''Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company'''.<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's first engine, the 425 horsepower (317&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340|R-1340 Wasp]], was completed on Christmas Eve 1925. On its third test run it easily passed the Navy qualification test in March 1926; by October, the Navy had ordered 200. The Wasp exhibited performance and reliability that revolutionized American aviation.<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> The R-1340 powered the aircraft of [[Wiley Post]], [[Amelia Earhart]], and many other record flights.\n\nThe R-1340 was followed by another very successful engine, the [[Pratt & Whitney R-985|R-985 Wasp Junior]].<ref>Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' p. 112, Cypress, CA, 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-9897906-0-4}}.</ref> Eventually a whole [[Pratt & Whitney Wasp series|Wasp series]] was developed. Both engines are still in use in agricultural aircraft around the world and produce more power than their original design criteria.\n\nGeorge Mead soon led the next step in the field of large, state-of-the-art, air-cooled, radial aircraft engines (which the Wasp dominated) when Pratt & Whitney released its [[Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet|R-1690 Hornet]]. It was basically \"a bigger Wasp\".\n\nIn 1929, Rentschler ended his association with Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool and merged Pratt & Whitney Aircraft with [[Boeing]] and other companies to form the [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]]. His agreement allowed him to carry the Pratt & Whitney name with him to his new corporation. Only five years later, the federal government banned common ownership of airplane manufacturers and airlines. Pratt & Whitney was merged with UATC's other manufacturing interests east of the [[Mississippi River]] as [[United Aircraft Corporation]], with Rentschler as president. United Aircraft became UTC in 1975.\n\n===Recent===\nIn October 2014, Pratt & Whitney was awarded a $592 million contract with US Defense Department to supply 36 [[F135]] engines for the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] fighter.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Reuters| date=14 October 2014 |title= Pratt & Whitney signs $592 million deal with Pentagon for next F-35 engines |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-pentagon-fighterplane-idUSKCN0I32N820141014 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2017, 10 employees reportedly left the company, including the head of the F135 engine program.

Frederick Rentschler approached these men as he sought capital and assets for his new venture. Deeds and G. Rentschler persuaded the board of Niles Bement Pond that their [[Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems|Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool]] (P&WMT) subsidiary of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], should provide the funding and location to build a new aircraft engine being developed by Rentschler, [[George J. Mead]], and colleagues, all formerly of [[Wright Aeronautical]].<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> Conceived and designed by Mead,<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> the new engine would be a large, [[air-cooled engine|air-cooled]], [[radial engine|radial]] design. Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool was going through a period of self-revision at the time to prepare itself for the post-[[World War I|Great War]] era, discontinuing old product lines and incubating new ones.<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> The Great War had been profitable to P&WMT, but the peace brought a predictable glut to the machine tool market, as contracts with governments were canceled and the market in used, recently built tools competed against new ones. P&WMT's future growth would depend on innovation. Having idle factory space and capital available at this historical moment, to be invested wherever good [[rate of return|return]] seemed available,<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> P&WMT saw the [[postwar aviation]] industry, both [[military aviation|military]] and [[civil aviation|civil (commercial, private)]], as one with some of the greatest growth and development potential available anywhere for the next few decades. It lent Rentschler $250,000, the use of the Pratt & Whitney name, and space in their building. This was the beginning of the '''Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company'''.<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's first engine, the 425 horsepower (317&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340|R-1340 Wasp]], was completed on Christmas Eve 1925. On its third test run it easily passed the Navy qualification test in March 1926; by October, the Navy had ordered 200. The Wasp exhibited performance and reliability that revolutionized American aviation.<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp23-53\"/> The R-1340 powered the aircraft of [[Wiley Post]], [[Amelia Earhart]], and many other record flights.\n\nThe R-1340 was followed by another very successful engine, the [[Pratt & Whitney R-985|R-985 Wasp Junior]].<ref>Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' p. 112, Cypress, CA, 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-9897906-0-4}}.</ref> Eventually a whole [[Pratt & Whitney Wasp series|Wasp series]] was developed. Both engines are still in use in agricultural aircraft around the world and produce more power than their original design criteria.\n\nGeorge Mead soon led the next step in the field of large, state-of-the-art, air-cooled, radial aircraft engines (which the Wasp dominated) when Pratt & Whitney released its [[Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet|R-1690 Hornet]]. It was basically \"a bigger Wasp\".\n\nIn 1929, Rentschler ended his association with Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool and merged Pratt & Whitney Aircraft with [[Boeing]] and other companies to form the [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]]. His agreement allowed him to carry the Pratt & Whitney name with him to his new corporation. Only five years later, the federal government banned common ownership of airplane manufacturers and airlines. Pratt & Whitney was merged with UATC's other manufacturing interests east of the [[Mississippi River]] as [[United Aircraft Corporation]], with Rentschler as president. United Aircraft became UTC in 1975.\n\n===Recent===\nIn October 2014, Pratt & Whitney was awarded a $592 million contract with US Defense Department to supply 36 [[F135]] engines for the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] fighter.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Reuters| date=14 October 2014 |title= Pratt & Whitney signs $592 million deal with Pentagon for next F-35 engines |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-pentagon-fighterplane-idUSKCN0I32N820141014 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2017, 10 employees reportedly left the company, including the head of the F135 engine program.

It was nominated for the 1999 [[National Book Award]] for Young People's Literature, won the [[Michael L. Printz Award]] in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklistsawards/bookawards/printzaward/previouswinners/2000michaell\n|title=2000 Printz Award|accessdate = {{date|14 apr 2013}}}}</ref> and was named a [[Coretta Scott King Award|Coretta Scott King Award Honor]] the same year.\n\nThe book uses a mixture of a [[third-person narrative|third-person]] [[screenplay]] and a first-person [[diary]] format to tell, through the perspective of Steve Harmon, an [[African American]] teenager, the story of his trial along with James King for [[felony  murder]] in the state of New York.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe novel begins with 16-year-old Joe Harmon writing in his diary awaiting for his trial for [[murder]]. Musing on his short time in prison so far, he decides to record this upcoming experience in the form of a movie screenplay. Kathy O'Brien, Steve's lawyer, informs him on what will happen during the trial. At this stage, only two of the four accused \u2013 James King and Steve \u2013 will be tried, since the other two accused \u2013 Richard \"Bobo\" Evans and Osvaldo Cruz \u2013 have entered into a [[plea bargain]]. When the trial first begins, Steve [[flashback (psychology)|flashes back]] to a movie he saw in his school's film club and the discussion he had with his teacher in which they discuss the idea of predictability.\n\nThe trial begins with the opening statements of the prosecutor Sandra Petrocelli, Miss O\u2019 Brien, and King's lawyer, Asa Briggs. Petrocelli labels the four accused men, including Steve, as \"monsters.\" The lawyers call on several witnesses, including Salvatore Zinzi and Wendell Bolden, [[illicit cigarette trade]]rs, who admit to buying cigarettes that came from a drugstore robbery that led to the murder. The story of the trial is often broken up by a variety of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, including ones showing that King is only acquainted with Steve, that King had accused Steve of pulling the trigger during the robbery. Petrocelli calls as a witness Osvaldo Cruz, who is affiliated with the Diablos, a violent street gang. Cruz admits to participating in the crime only due to coercion by Steve.\n\nSteve recounts a visit from his father, who wishes Steve would have gone on to attend his [[alma mater]], [[Morehouse College]]. After recounting various news reports covering the robbery and murder, Steve documents his arrest and his mother's panicked reaction. Before returning to the trial, Steve writes in his notes that he cannot psychologically handle writing down the tragic details of the robbery itself. The coroner, the city clerk, and a detective are questioned in a four-way split screen montage. Miss O'Brien warns Steve not to write down in his notebook anything he wants the prosecutor to see.\n\nAccording to Cruz, the original plan was that Steve would go into the drugstore and signal if the coast was clear. After King and Bobo robbed the store owner, Mr. Nesbitt, Cruz would slow down any potential pursuers. All sources indicate that Mr. Nesbitt drew a gun, which one of the robbers wrestled him for, causing the gun to discharge and kill Mr. Nesbitt. Bobo takes the witness stand to say that James King pulled the trigger and vaguely recalls that Steve, whom he hardly knows, was meant to give an [[wikt: all-clear|all-clear]] signal.\n\nBriggs argues that neither King nor Steve was ever involved in the crime since the only eyewitness to the robbery saw only two men involved, which can be accounted for by Bobo and Cruz alone. Though Miss O'Brien seems doubtful of Steve's innocence, she wisely has him distance himself from King. Steve appears to know King and Cruz only as remote acquaintances, and Bobo hardly at all. Steve testifies that he does not particularly remember where he was on the day of the robbery, but that he certainly was not a participant. The defense systematically casts the honesty of Petrocelli's witnesses in doubt. Although many of the testimonies contradict, even the most incriminating toward Steve claims only that he acted as a lookout in the first stage of the robbery.\n\nGeorge Sawicki, Steve's film club mentor, serves as a character witness, proudly defending Steve's moral character. Briggs, Miss O'Brien, and Petrocelli finally make their closing statements, before the jury decides on a verdict. James King is found guilty, while Steve is found not guilty. As Steve moves to hug O'Brien, she turns away, leaving Steve to question why. The end of the novel takes place five months after Steve has been cleared of all charges and released from prison. Steve has continued his film-making, but his father has moved away, creating a noticeable distance between the two. He is still confused as to Miss O'Brien's demeanor at the end of the trial, wondering whether she saw some real Steve or a \"monster.\"\n\n==Themes and format==\nThe novel depicts the themes of identity, race, peer pressure, dehumanization, crime, adult masculinity, and the [[factual relativism|relative]] or [[subjectivism|subjective nature of the truth]]. This idea comes up multiple times throughout the novel. There is the truth in relation to the law, but also the truth of a person's character. Steve, during the trial, writes about experiences he has had that directly contradict the thug persona he has been labeled with. The book reads like a formal screenplay, written by Steve Harmon, interspersed with seemingly handwritten fragments from his diary. The screenplay's verisimilitude is enhanced by such cues as \"fade in,\" \"voice over,\" and \u201cfade out.\" As one critic wrote, the novel is \"Presented alternately as the first{{nbhyph}}person, handwritten memoir... [and] a neatly typed screenplay.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1      = Staunton\n| first1     = John A\n| first2     = Francine\n| last2      = Gubuan\n| title      = Monster \n| journal     =[[Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy]]\n| volume     = 45\n|date=May 1997\n| series      = 45\n| issue       = 8\n| pages       = 791\u2013793\n| jstor       = 40012833\n}}</ref> Critics have commented on how the novel offers \"surface effects \u2013 marginalia, drawing, photographs, mugshots, and video stills \u2013 to offer an analysis of the complex identities that emerge in the context of such surfaces.\" Generally, the novel has been praised for remarkably sophisticated levels of thematic and formal complexity, considering its ostensible status as a young adult novel. As another critic wrote, \"''Monster'' is an experiment in form and structure,\" demonstrating Steve's \"vent[ing of] his passionate perplexity.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| url        = http://www.booklistonline.com/Carte-Blanche-The-Dream-Becomes-a-Reality-Michael-Cart/pid=1539688\n| last       = Cart\n| first      = Michael\n| title      = Carte Blanche: The Dream Becomes a Reality\n| publisher  = Booklist\n| year       = 2000\n| accessdate = {{date|14 mar 2013}}\n}}</ref>\n\nThe novel is interspersed with various photos depicting Steve. Many appear to be placed around the prison, possibly taken after he has been released as he is dressed in plain clothes although his oversized T-shirt is striped. Possibly indicating that he will never be free from this experience.  Myers had an affinity for addressing issues of race in many of his other novels as well as several articles he penned.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/books/walter-dean-myers-ambassador-for-young-peoples-literature.html\n| last       = Bosman\n| first      = Julie\n| title      = Children's Book Envoy Defines His Mission\n| work  = New York Times\n| year       = 2012\n| accessdate = {{date|28 april 2015}}\n}}</ref>\n\n==Autobiographical elements==\nAs a young man, Myers struggled with a speech impediment that caused many of his classmates and teachers to ridicule him and think him unintelligent.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Italie    | first =Hillel    | authorlink =    | title =At 73, Jersey City author Walter Dean Myers is a hero to young readers    | agency =Associated Press    | publisher =NJ.com    | date =4 March 2011    | url =http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2011/03/at_73_jersey_city_author_walte.html    | doi =    | accessdate =7 March 2011 }}</ref> He often got into trouble at school for selling drugs in school and on the streets.

It was nominated for the 1999 [[National Book Award]] for Young People's Literature, won the [[Michael L. Printz Award]] in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklistsawards/bookawards/printzaward/previouswinners/2000michaell\n|title=2000 Printz Award|accessdate = {{date|14 apr 2013}}}}</ref> and was named a [[Coretta Scott King Award|Coretta Scott King Award Honor]] the same year.\n\nThe book uses a mixture of a [[third-person narrative|third-person]] [[screenplay]] and a first-person [[diary]] format to tell, through the perspective of Steve Harmon, an [[African American]] teenager, the story of his trial along with James King for [[felony  murder]] in the state of New York.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe novel begins with 16-year-old Steve Harmon writing in his diary awaiting for his trial for [[murder]]. Musing on his short time in prison so far, he decides to record this upcoming experience in the form of a movie screenplay. Kathy O'Brien, Steve's lawyer, informs him on what will happen during the trial. At this stage, only two of the four accused \u2013 James King and Steve \u2013 will be tried, since the other two accused \u2013 Richard \"Bobo\" Evans and Osvaldo Cruz \u2013 have entered into a [[plea bargain]]. When the trial first begins, Steve [[flashback (psychology)|flashes back]] to a movie he saw in his school's film club and the discussion he had with his teacher in which they discuss the idea of predictability.\n\nThe trial begins with the opening statements of the prosecutor Sandra Petrocelli, Miss O\u2019 Brien, and King's lawyer, Asa Briggs. Petrocelli labels the four accused men, including Steve, as \"monsters.\" The lawyers call on several witnesses, including Salvatore Zinzi and Wendell Bolden, [[illicit cigarette trade]]rs, who admit to buying cigarettes that came from a drugstore robbery that led to the murder. The story of the trial is often broken up by a variety of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, including ones showing that King is only acquainted with Steve, that King had accused Steve of pulling the trigger during the robbery. Petrocelli calls as a witness Osvaldo Cruz, who is affiliated with the Diablos, a violent street gang. Cruz admits to participating in the crime only due to coercion by Bobo.\n\nSteve recounts a visit from his father, who wishes Steve would have gone on to attend his [[alma mater]], [[Morehouse College]]. After recounting various news reports covering the robbery and murder, Steve documents his arrest and his mother's panicked reaction. Before returning to the trial, Steve writes in his notes that he cannot psychologically handle writing down the tragic details of the robbery itself. The coroner, the city clerk, and a detective are questioned in a four-way split screen montage. Miss O'Brien warns Steve not to write down in his notebook anything he wants the prosecutor to see.\n\nAccording to Cruz, the original plan was that Steve would go into the drugstore and signal if the coast was clear. After King and Bobo robbed the store owner, Mr. Nesbitt, Cruz would slow down any potential pursuers. All sources indicate that Mr. Nesbitt drew a gun, which one of the robbers wrestled him for, causing the gun to discharge and kill Mr. Nesbitt. Bobo takes the witness stand to say that James King pulled the trigger and vaguely recalls that Steve, whom he hardly knows, was meant to give an [[wikt: all-clear|all-clear]] signal.\n\nBriggs argues that neither King nor Steve was ever involved in the crime since the only eyewitness to the robbery saw only two men involved, which can be accounted for by Bobo and Cruz alone. Though Miss O'Brien seems doubtful of Steve's innocence, she wisely has him distance himself from King. Steve appears to know King and Cruz only as remote acquaintances, and Bobo hardly at all. Steve testifies that he does not particularly remember where he was on the day of the robbery, but that he certainly was not a participant. The defense systematically casts the honesty of Petrocelli's witnesses in doubt. Although many of the testimonies contradict, even the most incriminating toward Steve claims only that he acted as a lookout in the first stage of the robbery.\n\nGeorge Sawicki, Steve's film club mentor, serves as a character witness, proudly defending Steve's moral character. Briggs, Miss O'Brien, and Petrocelli finally make their closing statements, before the jury decides on a verdict. James King is found guilty, while Steve is found not guilty. As Steve moves to hug O'Brien, she turns away, leaving Steve to question why. The end of the novel takes place five months after Steve has been cleared of all charges and released from prison. Steve has continued his film-making, but his father has moved away, creating a noticeable distance between the two. He is still confused as to Miss O'Brien's demeanor at the end of the trial, wondering whether she saw some real Steve or a \"monster.\"\n\n==Themes and format==\nThe novel depicts the themes of identity, race, peer pressure, dehumanization, crime, teenaged masculinity, and the [[factual relativism|relative]] or [[subjectivism|subjective nature of the truth]]. This idea comes up multiple times throughout the novel. There is the truth in relation to the law, but also the truth of a person's character. Steve, during the trial, writes about experiences he has had that directly contradict the thug persona he has been labeled with. The book reads like a formal screenplay, written by Steve Harmon, interspersed with seemingly handwritten fragments from his diary. The screenplay's verisimilitude is enhanced by such cues as \"fade in,\" \"voice over,\" and \u201cfade out.\" As one critic wrote, the novel is \"Presented alternately as the first{{nbhyph}}person, handwritten memoir... [and] a neatly typed screenplay.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1      = Staunton\n| first1     = John A\n| first2     = Francine\n| last2      = Gubuan\n| title      = Monster \n| journal     =[[Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy]]\n| volume     = 45\n|date=May 1997\n| series      = 45\n| issue       = 8\n| pages       = 791\u2013793\n| jstor       = 40012833\n}}</ref> Critics have commented on how the novel offers \"surface effects \u2013 marginalia, drawing, photographs, mugshots, and video stills \u2013 to offer an analysis of the complex identities that emerge in the context of such surfaces.\" Generally, the novel has been praised for remarkably sophisticated levels of thematic and formal complexity, considering its ostensible status as a young adult novel. As another critic wrote, \"''Monster'' is an experiment in form and structure,\" demonstrating Steve's \"vent[ing of] his passionate perplexity.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| url        = http://www.booklistonline.com/Carte-Blanche-The-Dream-Becomes-a-Reality-Michael-Cart/pid=1539688\n| last       = Cart\n| first      = Michael\n| title      = Carte Blanche: The Dream Becomes a Reality\n| publisher  = Booklist\n| year       = 2000\n| accessdate = {{date|14 mar 2013}}\n}}</ref>\n\nThe novel is interspersed with various photos depicting Steve. Many appear to be placed around the prison, possibly taken after he has been released as he is dressed in plain clothes although his oversized T-shirt is striped. Possibly indicating that he will never be free from this experience.

Simple [[commodity]] exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. [[Classical Islam|Arabs]] promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and banking. Their use of [[Indo-Arabic numerals]] facilitated [[bookkeeping]].  These innovations migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa.  The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] traveled the Mediterranean talking to Arab traders and returned to popularize the use of Indo-Arabic numerals in Europe.<ref name=\"Koehler, Benedikt\">Koehler, Benedikt.

That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their [[labor power]] for a living, a [[legal]] framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many [[Third World]] countries, although there is plenty of capital and labor. The obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are therefore less technical and more social, cultural and political.\n\n=== Agrarian ===\nThe economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England as the [[manorial system]] had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a [[serf]]-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive [[labor economics|labor market]]. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Robert|title=The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism|journal=Past & Present|date=1 January 1982|issue=97|pages=16\u2013113|jstor=650630}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://monthlyreview.org/1998/07/01/the-agrarian-origins-of-capitalism|title= The Agrarian Origins of Capitalism|accessdate= 17 December 2012|date= July 1998}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 17th century, England was a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away.

Moderate critics have recently challenged this, stating that the current influence lobbying groups have had on policy in the United States is a contradiction, given the approval of [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]]. This has led people to question the idea that competitive capitalism promotes political freedom. The ruling on Citizens United allows corporations to spend undisclosed and unregulated amounts of money on political campaigns, shifting outcomes to the interests and undermining true democracy. As explained in [[Robin Hahnel]]\u2019s writings, the centerpiece of the ideological defense of the free market system is the concept of economic freedom and that supporters equate economic democracy with economic freedom and claim that only the free market system can provide economic freedom. According to Hahnel, there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom. These objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected. Often, the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy. An argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people. In ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', [[Thomas Piketty]] of the [[Paris School of Economics]] asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built.<ref>[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

In mixed economies, which are almost universal today,<ref>James Fulcher, ''Capitalism A Very Short Introduction'', \"...in the wake of the 1970 crisis, the neoliberal model of capitalism became intellectually and ideologically dominant\", p. 58, Oxford, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-19-280218-7}}.</ref> markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by the state in order to correct [[market failure]]s, promote [[social welfare]], conserve [[natural resource]]s, fund [[military|defense]] and [[public safety]] or other rationale. In [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on [[state-owned enterprises]] or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.\n\nSupply is the amount of a good or service that is available for purchase or sale. Demand is the measure of value for a good that people are willing to buy at a given time. Prices tend to rise when demand for an available resource increases or its supply diminishes and fall with demand or when supply increases.{{According to whom|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nCompetition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. Adherents of the capitalist theory believe that competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. [[Monopoly|Monopolies]] or [[cartels]] can develop, especially if there is no competition. A monopoly occurs when a firm is granted exclusivity over a market. Hence, the firm can engage in [[rent seeking]] behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices.\n\nGovernments have implemented legislation for the purpose of preventing the creation of monopolies and cartels. In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp|title=Monopoly|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=24 November 2003|work=Investopedia|access-date=2 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Profit motive ===\n{{Main|Profit motive}}\nThe [[profit motive]], in the theory in capitalism, is the desire to earn income in the form of profit. Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit. The profit motive functions according to [[rational choice theory]], or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests. Accordingly, businesses seek to benefit themselves and/or their shareholders by maximizing profit.\n\nIn capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, [[Austrian economist]] [[Henry Hazlitt]] explains: \"If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself\".<ref>Hazlitt, Henry. \"The Function of Profits\". ''Economics in One Lesson''. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. Web. 22 April 2013.</ref> In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically{{according to whom|date=March 2020}}, in free and competitive markets maximising profit ensures that resources are not wasted.\n\n=== Private property ===\n{{Main|Private property}}\nThe relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary Peruvian economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England and similar legislation elsewhere were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1.

Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for profit and so on) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist mode of production proper based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the [[Industrial Revolution]], later extending to most of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe term capitalist mode of production is defined by [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], extraction of [[surplus value]] by the owning class for the purpose of [[capital accumulation]], [[Wage labour|wage-based labour]] and at least as far as [[Commodity|commodities]] are concerned being [[Market economy|market-based]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capitalism | title=Capitalism. | publisher=marxists.org | accessdate=8 July 2011 | author=Encyclopedia of Marxism at marxism.org}}</ref>\n\nCapitalism in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in [[simple commodity production]] (hence the reference to \"[[merchant capitalism]]\") since the beginnings of civilisation. What is specific about the \"capitalist mode of production\" is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode.<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\" /> For example, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.<ref name=ch32/> This has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re-organised to conform with economic [[bounded rationality|rationality as bounded]] by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labour factor costs, sales and profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall\u2014that is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to \"commercial logic\".

It posulates that in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], the [[unit price]] for a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an [[economic equilibrium]] for price and [[Output (economics)|quantity]].\n\nThe four basic \"laws\" of [[Supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]], as described by [[David Besanko]] and [[Ronald Braeutigam]], are:<ref name=\"besanko-and-braeutigam-2010\">{{Cite book | last = Besanko | first = David | last2 = Braeutigam | first2 = Ronald | year = 2010 | title = Microeconomics | publisher = Wiley | edition = 4th }}</ref>{{rp|37}}\n# If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n# If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n=== Graphical representation of supply and demand ===\nAlthough it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to [[Alfred Marshall]], has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function.\n\nSince determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as \"shifts\" in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.\n\n==== Supply schedule ====\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of [[perfect competition]], supply is determined by [[marginal cost]]. That is: firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.\n\nA hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply and shifting costs up while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question \"If this firm is ''faced with'' this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?\". If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not \"faced with\" any price and the question becomes less relevant.\n\nEconomists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the supply curve individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.\n\nEconomists also distinguish the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. In this context, two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically [[physical capital]]) and the number of firms in the industry. In the long-run, firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long-run potential competitors can [[Market entry strategy|enter]] or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.\n\nThe determinants of supply are:\n# Production costs: how much a goods costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production and/or technological advances. See [[productivity]].\n# Firms' expectations about future prices.\n# Number of suppliers.\n\n==== Demand schedule ====\nA demand schedule, depicted graphically as the [[demand curve]], represents the amount of some [[Good (economics)|goods]] that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of [[substitute good]]s and the price of [[complementary good]]s, remain the same. According to the [[law of demand]], the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.<ref name=\"axes\">Note that unlike most [[Graph of a function|graphs]], supply & demand curves are plotted with the independent variable (price) on the vertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity supplied or demanded) on the horizontal axis.</ref>\n\nJust like the supply curves reflect [[marginal cost]] curves, demand curves are determined by [[marginal utility]] curves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marginal Utility and Demand|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=marginal+utility+and+demand|accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the [[opportunity cost]] determined by the price\u2014that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.\n\nWhile the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are [[Giffen good]]s (an inferior, but [[Staple food|staple]] good) and [[Veblen good]]s (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor\u2014that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question \"If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase?\". If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not \"faced with\" any price and the question is meaningless.\n\nLike with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the demand curve individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.\n\nThe determinants of demand are:\n# Income.\n# Tastes and preferences.\n# Prices of related goods and services.\n# Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.\n# Number of potential consumers.\n\n=== Equilibrium ===\n{{Further|Economic equilibrium}}\nIn the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as [[supply and demand]] are balanced and in the absence of external influences the ([[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]) values of economic variables will not change. For example, in the standard text-book model of [[perfect competition]] equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Hal Varian |first=Hal R. |last=Varian |title=Microeconomic Analysis |edition=Third |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-393-95735-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/microeconomicana00vari_0 }}</ref> Market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by [[Law of supply and demand|buyers]] is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by [[Law of supply and demand|sellers]]. This price is often called the competitive price or [[market clearing]] price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called \"competitive quantity\" or market clearing quantity.\n\n=== Partial equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Partial equilibrium}}\nPartial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.\n\nJain proposes (attributed to [[George Stigler]]): \"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=T.R.|title=Microeconomics and Basic Mathematics|year=2006|publisher=VK Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-87140-89-4|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUUoFwco2Z8C}}</ref>\n\nThe supply and demand model is a partial equilibrium model of [[economic equilibrium]], where the clearance on the [[Market (economics)|market]] of some specific [[good (economics)|goods]] is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all [[substitute good|substitutes]] and [[complement good|complements]] as well as [[income]] levels of [[consumer]]s are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a [[general equilibrium]] model which includes an entire economy.\n\nHere the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[Pareto Efficiency|efficiency]] and [[comparative statics]]. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable, but it may produce results which while seemingly precise do not effectively model real world economic phenomena.\n\nPartial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.\n\nHence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Walras]] first formalised the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] and English political economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system.\n\n=== Empirical estimation ===\nDemand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity and other [[data]] with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with [[System of linear equations|simultaneous-equation]] methods of estimation in [[econometrics]]. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \"structural coefficients\", the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The [[Identification (parameter)|parameter identification problem]] is a common issue in \"structural estimation\". Typically, data on [[exogenous variable]]s (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are [[endogenous variable]]s) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \"structural estimation\" is [[Reduced form|reduced-form]] estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.\n\n=== Macroeconomic uses of demand and supply ===\nDemand and supply have also been generalised to explain [[macroeconomic]] variables in a [[market economy]], including the [[Real GDP|quantity of total output]] and the general [[price level]]. The [[AD-AS model|Aggregate Demand\u2013Aggregate Supply model]] may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to [[microeconomic]] uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such [[macroeconomic]] counterparts as [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate [[money supply]] and money demand to [[interest rate]]s and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.\n\n=== History ===\nAccording to Hamid S. Hosseini, the \"power of supply and demand\" was discussed to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century [[Mamluk]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], who wrote: \"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises.

In this description, demand is [[Economic rent|rent]]: \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent\".\n\nThe phrase \"supply and demand\" was first used by [[James Denham-Steuart]] in his ''Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767. [[Adam Smith]] used the phrase in his 1776 book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', and [[David Ricardo]] titled one chapter of his 1817 work ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' \"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\".<ref name=Humphrey>Thomas M.

In ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth'', including diagrams.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the marginalist school of thought emerged. This field mainly was started by [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]], [[Carl Menger]] and [[L\u00e9on Walras]]. The key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price\u2014that is, the price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.\n\nIn his 1870 essay \"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\", [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,<ref>A.D.

In most cases, the government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. However, many countries have [[minimum wage]] laws and minimum safety standards.\n\nUnder some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities, and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market and then raise them again once the threat of competition is reduced. In many countries, public utilities such as electricity, heating fuel and communications are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale.\n\nGovernment agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control such factors as inflation and unemployment.<ref>\"Capitalism.\" World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. p. 194.</ref>\n\n=== Relationship to political freedom ===\nIn his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] asserts that the free market understanding of [[economic freedom]] as present in capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. [[Milton Friedman]], [[Andrew Brennan (economist)|Andrew Brennan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminishes their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|journal=Nature|volume=154|issue=3911|pages=473\u201374|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8|bibcode=1944Natur.154..473C|doi=10.1038/154473a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-56354-3|page=60}}</ref> [[Freedom House]], an American think tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom [[Freedom in the World|as measured by Freedom House]] and economic freedom [[Index of Economic Freedom|as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey]]\".<ref>Adrian Karatnycky.

They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominantly market-based allocation of resources and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. They include advanced capitalism, corporate capitalism, finance capitalism, free-market capitalism, mercantilism, social capitalism, state capitalism and welfare capitalism. Other variants of capitalism include [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[community capitalism]], [[humanistic capitalism]], [[neo-capitalism]], [[state monopoly capitalism]], [[Supercapitalism (modern)|supercapitalism]] and [[technocapitalism]].\n\n=== Advanced ===\n{{Main|Advanced capitalism}}\nAdvanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the [[capitalist model]] has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period. Various writers identify [[Antonio Gramsci]] as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself. In his writings, Gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century. At the heart of his explanation was the decline of raw coercion as a tool of class power, replaced by use of [[civil society]] institutions to manipulate public ideology in the capitalists' favour.<ref>Lears, T.J.

Habermas observed four general features that characterise advanced capitalism:\n# Concentration of industrial activity in a few large firms.\n# Constant reliance on the state to stabilise the economic system.\n# A formally democratic government that legitimises the activities of the state and dissipates opposition to the system.\n# The use of nominal wage increases to pacify the most restless segments of the work force.<ref>Habermas, 1988: 37, 75.</ref>\n\n=== Corporate ===\n{{Main|Corporate capitalism}}\n{{See also|Crony capitalism|State monopoly capitalism}}\nCorporate capitalism is a free or mixed-market capitalist economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.\n\n=== Finance ===\n{{Main|Finance capitalism}}\n{{See also|Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)}}\nFinance capitalism is the subordination of processes of [[Production (economics)|production]] to the accumulation of [[money]] profits in a [[financial system]]. In their critique of capitalism, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] both emphasise the role of [[Financial capital|finance capital]] as the determining and [[ruling-class]] interest in capitalist society, particularly in the [[Crisis of capitalism|latter stages]].<ref>[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch03.htm ibid.

It typically entails support for highly [[Competition (economics)|competitive markets]] and [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. ''Laissez-faire'' capitalism is a more extensive form of this free-market economy, but one in which the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]]. In [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] theory, property rights are protected by private firms and market-generated law. According to anarcho-capitalists, this entails property rights without statutory law through market-generated tort, contract and property law as well as the self-sustaining private industry.\n\n=== Mercantile ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n{{See also|Protectionism}}\n[[File:Lloyds Subscription Room edited.jpg|thumb|The subscription room at [[Lloyd's of London]] in the early 19th century]]\nMercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century. It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism; and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e.g. Britain, France and Portugal). Mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations\u2014it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the [[primitive accumulation of capital]].\n\n=== Social ===\n{{Main|Social market economy}}\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\nA social market economy is a free-market or mixed-market capitalist system, sometimes classified as a [[coordinated market economy]], where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum, but the state provides significant services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of [[labor rights]] through national [[collective bargaining]] arrangements. This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries as well as Japan, albeit in slightly different configurations. The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.\n\n[[Rhine capitalism]] is the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\n\n=== State ===\n{{Main|State capitalism}}\nState capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. In his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors. Contemporary state capitalism is associated with the [[East Asian model of capitalism]], [[dirigisme]] and the economy of Norway.<ref>{{cite news |last=Musacchio |first=Aldo |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/802 |title=Economist Debates: State capitalism: Statements |work=The Economist}}</ref> Alternatively, [[Merriam-Webster]] defines state capitalism as \"an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/state%20capitalism State capitalism].

Today, welfare capitalism is most often associated with the models of capitalism found in Central Mainland and Northern Europe such as the [[Nordic model]], [[social market economy]] and [[Rhine capitalism]]. In some cases, welfare capitalism exists within a mixed economy, but welfare states can and do exist independently of policies common to mixed economies such as [[state interventionism]] and extensive regulation.\n\nA mixed economy is a largely market-based capitalist economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and [[economic interventionism]] through macroeconomic policies intended to correct [[market failure]]s, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low. The degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries. Some mixed economies such as France under [[dirigisme]] also featured a degree of [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] over a largely capitalist-based economy.\n\nMost modern capitalist economies are defined as mixed economies to some degree.\n\n== Capital accumulation ==\n{{Main|Capital accumulation}}\n{{Further|Money}}\nThe [[accumulation of capital]] is the process of \"making money\", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production. Capitalism is based on the accumulation of capital, whereby [[financial capital]] is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the [[law of value]]. Capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit.<ref name=\"Economist definition\">{{cite news | title = Economics A\u2013Z: ''Capital'' | url = http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/c#node-21529870 | website = [[economist.com|The Economist]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> In this context, \"capital\" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).<ref name=\"MIA definition\">{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Marxism \u2013 Glossary of terms: ''Capital'' | url = http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital | website = [[Marxists Internet Archive]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn mainstream [[economics]], [[accounting]] and [[Marxian economics]], capital accumulation is often equated with [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] of profit income or saving, especially in [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation. In modern [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]], the phrase \"[[capital formation]]\" is often used in preference to \"accumulation\", though the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to \"accumulation\". The term \u201caccumulation\u201d is occasionally used in [[national accounts]].\n\n=== Background ===\nAccumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company [[balance sheet]]s, [[tax]] data and direct [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of [[national accounts]], national [[balance of payments]] and [[flow of funds]] statistics. The [[Federal Reserve|Reserve Banks]] and the [[Treasury]] usually provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include [[capital formation]], [[gross fixed capital formation]], [[fixed capital]], household asset wealth and [[foreign direct investment]].\n\nOrganisations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the UNCTAD, the [[World Bank Group]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] used national investment data to estimate world trends. The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Eurostat]] and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the United States, Europe and Japan respectively. Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], [[Forbes]], [[The Economist]], [[Business Week]]'' and so on as well as various corporate \"[[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]]\" organisations and [[non-governmental organisation]] publications. A reputable scientific journal is the ''Review of Income & Wealth''. In the case of the United States, the \"Analytical Perspectives\" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country.\n\nIn [[Karl Marx]]' economic theory, capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset [[Value (economics)|value]] in search of additional value or [[surplus-value]]. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in [[Confiscation|expropriation]], both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or \"trading up\", but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] calls this [[accumulation by dispossession]].\n\nThe continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. However, capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a [[Strike action|strike]] by investors or workers, or [[consumer resistance]]).\n\n=== Concentration and centralisation ===\nAccording to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains: \"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. [...] Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. [...] The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, ''caeteris paribus'', on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages [...] It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm|title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter Twenty-Five|first=Karl|last=Marx}}</ref>\n\n=== Rate of accumulation ===\nIn [[Marxian economics]], the rate of accumulation is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the [[stock and flow|stock]] of capital in an accounting period; and (2) the proportion of realised [[surplus-value]] or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realised turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestments (e.g. the writings of the economist [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]]).\n\nOther things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about \"how much to spend, and how much to save\".\n\nIn a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding [[labor force]] and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation and luxury consumption. In that case, income from [[value added|value-adding]] production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow. The inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between \"[[necessary product]]\" and \"[[surplus product]]\"; and (2) the division of the surplus product between [[investment]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of [[competition]] among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors as it also involved social factors and [[economic power|power]] relationships.\n\n=== Circuit of capital accumulation from production ===\nStrictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realised [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] income has been reinvested in capital assets. As suggested in the first volume of Marx' ''[[Das Kapital]]'', the process of capital accumulation in production has at least seven distinct but linked moments:\n* The initial investment of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (which could be borrowed capital) in [[means of production]] and [[labor power]].\n* The command over [[surplus-labour]] and its appropriation.\n* The [[valorisation]] (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.\n* The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.\n* The realisation of [[surplus-value]] through output sales.\n* The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.\n* The reinvestment of profit income in production.\n\nAll of these moments do not refer simply to an \"economic\" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.\n\n=== Simple and expanded reproduction ===\nIn the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank [[credit (finance)|credit]] capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities and so on), commodity capital (tradable products, real estate and the like), or production capital ([[means of production]] and labor power).\n\nHis discussion of the simple and expanded [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]] of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given [[living standard]]; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, more product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a [[surplus product]]); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.\n\nThe bourgeois claim there is no [[economic law]] according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1\u2014producers of means of production\u2014exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (p.&nbsp;524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced, but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (p.&nbsp;514).\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de[[valorisation]].\n\nBalanced [[economic growth]] requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. However, markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance and in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between [[supply and demand]]: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long-time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and [[protectionism]].\n\n=== Capital accumulation as social relation ===\n\"Accumulation of capital\" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist [[social relations]] (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e. the expansion of the size of the [[proletariat]] and of the wealth owned by the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\nThis interpretation emphasises that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the [[working class]] (a \"[[law of accumulation]]\"). In the first volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theory of colonisation: {{Quotation|Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative\u2014the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of \u00a350,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, 'Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.' Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 33}}\n\nIn the [[Capital, Volume III|third volume]] of ''Das Kapital'', Marx refers to the \"fetishism of capital\" reaching its highest point with interest-bearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything: {{Quotation|The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in interest-bearing capital. We have here <math>M - M'</math>, money creating more money, self-expanding value, without the process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, <math>M - C - M'</math>, there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. [...] This is obliterated in <math>M - M'</math>, the form of interest-bearing capital. [...] The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The [[Social relations|social relation]] is consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself. Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form without content.|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 24|source=}}\n\n== Wage labour ==\n{{Main|Wage labour}}\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel [[semi-product]]s (Kinex Bearings, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n[[Wage labour]] refers to the sale of [[Labour economics|labour]] under a formal or informal [[employment contract]] to an [[employer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinfeld|2009|p=3}}: \"All labor contracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to fulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken. That is one of the principal purposes of labor contracts.\"</ref> These transactions usually occur in a [[labour market]] where [[wage]]s are market determined.<ref>{{Harvnb|Deakin|Wilkinson|2005}}.<br />{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1005}}, defines wage labour succinctly as \"the labour of the worker who sells his own labour-power.\"</ref> Individuals who possess and supply financial capital or labor to productive ventures often become owners, either jointly (as [[shareholder]]s) or individually.{{Fact|date=March 2020}} In Marxist economics, these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called capitalists. The description of the role of the capitalist has shifted, first referring to a useless intermediary between producers to an employer of producers and eventually came to refer to owners of the means of production.<ref name=\"Williams 1983 51\" /> [[Labor (economics)|Labor]] includes all physical and mental human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are needed to produce products and services. [[Production (economics)|Production]] is the act of making goods or services by applying [[labor power]].<ref>Christopher T.S. Ragan and Richard G. Lipsey. ''Microeconomics''. Twelfth Canadian Edition ed. Toronto, Pearson Education Canada, 2008. Print.</ref><ref>Robbins, Richard H. ''Global problems and the culture of capitalism''. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 2007. Print.</ref>\n\nCritics of the capitalist mode of production see wage labour as a major, if not defining, aspect of hierarchical industrial systems. Most opponents of the institution support [[worker self-management]] and [[economic democracy]] as alternatives to both wage labour and to capitalism. While most opponents of the wage system<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence, most [[anarchists]] and other [[libertarian socialists]] also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of [[privatism|private ownership of the means of production]]. As some opponents of wage labour take influence from Marxist propositions, many are opposed to [[private property]], but maintain respect for [[personal property]].\n\n=== Types ===\nThe most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or \"full-time\", employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker) in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:\n* Employment status: a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].\n* Civil (legal) status: the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.\n* Method of payment (remuneration or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]): the work done could be paid \"in cash\" (a money-wage) or \"in kind\" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of \"[[Piecework|piece rates]]\" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[Employee stock option|stock options]] or [[Share (finance)|shares]] in an enterprise.\n* Method of hiring: the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. However, he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[Subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with the [[means of production]].\n\n== Effects of war ==\n[[File:Alfred T. Palmer - Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at Kansas City, Kansas (USA).jpg|thumb|The common view among economic historians is that the [[Great Depression]] ended with the advent of World War II (assembling the North American [[B-25 Mitchell]] at [[Kansas City]], 1942)]]\nWar typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real [[war profiteering]].\n\nThe total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ellen R. |last=Grattan |first2=Lee E. |last2=Ohanian |title=The macroeconomic effects of big fiscal shocks: the case of world war II |journal=Minneapolis Federal Reserve, Working Paper 599 |date=December 1999 |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp599.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWar destruction can be illustrated by looking at [[World War II]]. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant and equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks and so on were built and then lost or destroyed.\n\nGermany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the [[Berlin]] area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2,395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7,500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.\n\nHowever, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by Western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.\n\nInitially, in May 1945 newly installed United States president [[Harry S. Truman]]'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant and equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the Soviet Union. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.\n\nThe first big strike-wave in the [[Ruhr]] occurred in early 1947\u2014it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. However, the United States appointed military governor (Newman) stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was \"no work, no eat\". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with [[Marshall Plan]] aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The Marshall Aid funds were important, but after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the United States to rebuilding German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average [[real wages]] remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools. This was called the [[German economic miracle]] or ''Wirtschaftswunder''.<ref>Armstrong, Glyn & Harrison, ''Capitalism since world war 2''. Fontana, 1984.

However, damage to [[human capital]] has been much more devastating in terms of fatalities (in the case of World War II, about 55 million deaths), permanent physical disability, enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations.\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main|Criticism of capitalism}}\n[[File:Anti-capitalism color\u2014 Restored.png|thumb|The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster \"[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]\" (1911)]]\nCritics of capitalism associate the economic system with [[social inequality]]; unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; [[Economic materialism|materialism]]; repression of workers and [[trade union]]ists; [[social alienation]]; [[economic inequality]]; [[unemployment]]; and economic instability.

According to Marx, capital is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism and the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.\n\nThis difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers\u2014all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital.

Simple [[commodity]] exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. [[Classical Islam|Arabs]] promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and banking. Their use of [[Indo-Arabic numerals]] facilitated [[bookkeeping]].  These innovations migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa.

That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their [[labor power]] for a living, a [[legal]] framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many [[Third World]] countries, although there is plenty of capital and labor. The obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are therefore less technical and more social, cultural and political.\n\n=== Agrarian ===\nThe economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England as the [[manorial system]] had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a [[serf]]-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive [[labor economics|labor market]]. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Robert|title=The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism|journal=Past & Present|date=1 January 1982|issue=97|pages=16\u2013113|jstor=650630}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://monthlyreview.org/1998/07/01/the-agrarian-origins-of-capitalism|title= The Agrarian Origins of Capitalism|accessdate= 17 December 2012|date= July 1998}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 17th century, England was a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away.

Moderate critics have recently challenged this, stating that the current influence lobbying groups have had on policy in the United States is a contradiction, given the approval of [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]]. This has led people to question the idea that competitive capitalism promotes political freedom. The ruling on Citizens United allows corporations to spend undisclosed and unregulated amounts of money on political campaigns, shifting outcomes to the interests and undermining true democracy. As explained in [[Robin Hahnel]]\u2019s writings, the centerpiece of the ideological defense of the free market system is the concept of economic freedom and that supporters equate economic democracy with economic freedom and claim that only the free market system can provide economic freedom. According to Hahnel, there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom. These objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected. Often, the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy. An argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people. In ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', [[Thomas Piketty]] of the [[Paris School of Economics]] asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built.<ref>[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

In mixed economies, which are almost universal today,<ref>James Fulcher, ''Capitalism A Very Short Introduction'', \"...in the wake of the 1970 crisis, the neoliberal model of capitalism became intellectually and ideologically dominant\", p. 58, Oxford, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-19-280218-7}}.</ref> markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by the state in order to correct [[market failure]]s, promote [[social welfare]], conserve [[natural resource]]s, fund [[military|defense]] and [[public safety]] or other rationale. In [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on [[state-owned enterprises]] or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.\n\nSupply is the amount of a good or service that is available for purchase or sale. Demand is the measure of value for a good that people are willing to buy at a given time. Prices tend to rise when demand for an available resource increases or its supply diminishes and fall with demand or when supply increases.{{According to whom|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nCompetition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. Adherents of the capitalist theory believe that competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. [[Monopoly|Monopolies]] or [[cartels]] can develop, especially if there is no competition. A monopoly occurs when a firm is granted exclusivity over a market. Hence, the firm can engage in [[rent seeking]] behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices.\n\nGovernments have implemented legislation for the purpose of preventing the creation of monopolies and cartels. In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp|title=Monopoly|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=24 November 2003|work=Investopedia|access-date=2 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Profit motive ===\n{{Main|Profit motive}}\nThe [[profit motive]], in the theory in capitalism, is the desire to earn income in the form of profit. Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit. The profit motive functions according to [[rational choice theory]], or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests. Accordingly, businesses seek to benefit themselves and/or their shareholders by maximizing profit.\n\nIn capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, [[Austrian economist]] [[Henry Hazlitt]] explains: \"If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself\".<ref>Hazlitt, Henry. \"The Function of Profits\". ''Economics in One Lesson''. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. Web. 22 April 2013.</ref> In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically{{according to whom|date=March 2020}}, in free and competitive markets maximising profit ensures that resources are not wasted.\n\n=== Private property ===\n{{Main|Private property}}\nThe relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary Peruvian economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England and similar legislation elsewhere were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1.

Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for profit and so on) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist mode of production proper based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the [[Industrial Revolution]], later extending to most of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe term capitalist mode of production is defined by [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], extraction of [[surplus value]] by the owning class for the purpose of [[capital accumulation]], [[Wage labour|wage-based labour]] and at least as far as [[Commodity|commodities]] are concerned being [[Market economy|market-based]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capitalism | title=Capitalism. | publisher=marxists.org | accessdate=8 July 2011 | author=Encyclopedia of Marxism at marxism.org}}</ref>\n\nCapitalism in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in [[simple commodity production]] (hence the reference to \"[[merchant capitalism]]\") since the beginnings of civilisation. What is specific about the \"capitalist mode of production\" is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode.<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\" /> For example, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.<ref name=ch32/> This has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re-organised to conform with economic [[bounded rationality|rationality as bounded]] by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labour factor costs, sales and profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall\u2014that is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to \"commercial logic\".

It posulates that in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], the [[unit price]] for a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an [[economic equilibrium]] for price and [[Output (economics)|quantity]].\n\nThe four basic \"laws\" of [[Supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]], as described by [[David Besanko]] and [[Ronald Braeutigam]], are:<ref name=\"besanko-and-braeutigam-2010\">{{Cite book | last = Besanko | first = David | last2 = Braeutigam | first2 = Ronald | year = 2010 | title = Microeconomics | publisher = Wiley | edition = 4th }}</ref>{{rp|37}}\n# If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n# If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n=== Graphical representation of supply and demand ===\nAlthough it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to [[Alfred Marshall]], has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function.\n\nSince determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as \"shifts\" in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.\n\n==== Supply schedule ====\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of [[perfect competition]], supply is determined by [[marginal cost]]. That is: firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.\n\nA hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply and shifting costs up while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question \"If this firm is ''faced with'' this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?\". If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not \"faced with\" any price and the question becomes less relevant.\n\nEconomists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the supply curve individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.\n\nEconomists also distinguish the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. In this context, two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically [[physical capital]]) and the number of firms in the industry. In the long-run, firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long-run potential competitors can [[Market entry strategy|enter]] or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.\n\nThe determinants of supply are:\n# Production costs: how much a goods costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production and/or technological advances. See [[productivity]].\n# Firms' expectations about future prices.\n# Number of suppliers.\n\n==== Demand schedule ====\nA demand schedule, depicted graphically as the [[demand curve]], represents the amount of some [[Good (economics)|goods]] that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of [[substitute good]]s and the price of [[complementary good]]s, remain the same. According to the [[law of demand]], the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.<ref name=\"axes\">Note that unlike most [[Graph of a function|graphs]], supply & demand curves are plotted with the independent variable (price) on the vertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity supplied or demanded) on the horizontal axis.</ref>\n\nJust like the supply curves reflect [[marginal cost]] curves, demand curves are determined by [[marginal utility]] curves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marginal Utility and Demand|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=marginal+utility+and+demand|accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the [[opportunity cost]] determined by the price\u2014that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.\n\nWhile the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are [[Giffen good]]s (an inferior, but [[Staple food|staple]] good) and [[Veblen good]]s (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor\u2014that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question \"If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase?\". If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not \"faced with\" any price and the question is meaningless.\n\nLike with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the demand curve individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.\n\nThe determinants of demand are:\n# Income.\n# Tastes and preferences.\n# Prices of related goods and services.\n# Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.\n# Number of potential consumers.\n\n=== Equilibrium ===\n{{Further|Economic equilibrium}}\nIn the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as [[supply and demand]] are balanced and in the absence of external influences the ([[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]) values of economic variables will not change. For example, in the standard text-book model of [[perfect competition]] equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Hal Varian |first=Hal R. |last=Varian |title=Microeconomic Analysis |edition=Third |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-393-95735-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/microeconomicana00vari_0 }}</ref> Market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by [[Law of supply and demand|buyers]] is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by [[Law of supply and demand|sellers]]. This price is often called the competitive price or [[market clearing]] price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called \"competitive quantity\" or market clearing quantity.\n\n=== Partial equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Partial equilibrium}}\nPartial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.\n\nJain proposes (attributed to [[George Stigler]]): \"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=T.R.|title=Microeconomics and Basic Mathematics|year=2006|publisher=VK Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-87140-89-4|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUUoFwco2Z8C}}</ref>\n\nThe supply and demand model is a partial equilibrium model of [[economic equilibrium]], where the clearance on the [[Market (economics)|market]] of some specific [[good (economics)|goods]] is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all [[substitute good|substitutes]] and [[complement good|complements]] as well as [[income]] levels of [[consumer]]s are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a [[general equilibrium]] model which includes an entire economy.\n\nHere the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[Pareto Efficiency|efficiency]] and [[comparative statics]]. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable, but it may produce results which while seemingly precise do not effectively model real world economic phenomena.\n\nPartial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.\n\nHence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Walras]] first formalised the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] and English political economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system.\n\n=== Empirical estimation ===\nDemand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity and other [[data]] with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with [[System of linear equations|simultaneous-equation]] methods of estimation in [[econometrics]]. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \"structural coefficients\", the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The [[Identification (parameter)|parameter identification problem]] is a common issue in \"structural estimation\". Typically, data on [[exogenous variable]]s (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are [[endogenous variable]]s) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \"structural estimation\" is [[Reduced form|reduced-form]] estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.\n\n=== Macroeconomic uses of demand and supply ===\nDemand and supply have also been generalised to explain [[macroeconomic]] variables in a [[market economy]], including the [[Real GDP|quantity of total output]] and the general [[price level]]. The [[AD-AS model|Aggregate Demand\u2013Aggregate Supply model]] may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to [[microeconomic]] uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such [[macroeconomic]] counterparts as [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate [[money supply]] and money demand to [[interest rate]]s and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.\n\n=== History ===\nAccording to Hamid S. Hosseini, the \"power of supply and demand\" was discussed to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century [[Mamluk]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], who wrote: \"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down\".<ref name=Hosseini>{{cite book |title=A Companion to the History of Economic Thought |chapter=Contributions of Medieval Muslim Scholars to the History of Economics and their Impact: A Refutation of the Schumpeterian Great Gap |last=Hosseini |first=Hamid S. |editor=Biddle, Jeff E. |editor2=Davis, Jon B. |editor3=Samuels, Warren J. |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-631-22573-7 |doi=10.1002/9780470999059.ch3 |pages=28\u201345 [28 & 38]}} (citing Hamid S.

In this description, demand is [[Economic rent|rent]]: \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent\".\n\nThe phrase \"supply and demand\" was first used by [[James Denham-Steuart]] in his ''Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767. [[Adam Smith]] used the phrase in his 1776 book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', and [[David Ricardo]] titled one chapter of his 1817 work ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' \"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\".<ref name=Humphrey>Thomas M.

In ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth'', including diagrams.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the marginalist school of thought emerged. This field mainly was started by [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]], [[Carl Menger]] and [[L\u00e9on Walras]]. The key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price\u2014that is, the price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.\n\nIn his 1870 essay \"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\", [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,<ref>A.D.

In most cases, the government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. However, many countries have [[minimum wage]] laws and minimum safety standards.\n\nUnder some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities, and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market and then raise them again once the threat of competition is reduced. In many countries, public utilities such as electricity, heating fuel and communications are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale.\n\nGovernment agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control such factors as inflation and unemployment.<ref>\"Capitalism.\" World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. p. 194.</ref>\n\n=== Relationship to political freedom ===\nIn his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] asserts that the free market understanding of [[economic freedom]] as present in capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. [[Milton Friedman]], [[Andrew Brennan (economist)|Andrew Brennan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminishes their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|journal=Nature|volume=154|issue=3911|pages=473\u201374|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8|bibcode=1944Natur.154..473C|doi=10.1038/154473a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-56354-3|page=60}}</ref> [[Freedom House]], an American think tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom [[Freedom in the World|as measured by Freedom House]] and economic freedom [[Index of Economic Freedom|as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey]]\".<ref>Adrian Karatnycky.

They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominantly market-based allocation of resources and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. They include advanced capitalism, corporate capitalism, finance capitalism, free-market capitalism, mercantilism, social capitalism, state capitalism and welfare capitalism. Other variants of capitalism include [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[community capitalism]], [[humanistic capitalism]], [[neo-capitalism]], [[state monopoly capitalism]], [[Supercapitalism (modern)|supercapitalism]] and [[technocapitalism]].\n\n=== Advanced ===\n{{Main|Advanced capitalism}}\nAdvanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the [[capitalist model]] has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period. Various writers identify [[Antonio Gramsci]] as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself. In his writings, Gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century. At the heart of his explanation was the decline of raw coercion as a tool of class power, replaced by use of [[civil society]] institutions to manipulate public ideology in the capitalists' favour.<ref>Lears, T.J. Jackson (1985) \"The Concept of Cultural Hegemony\"</ref><ref>Holub, Renate (2005) ''Antonio Gramsci: Beyond Marxism and Postmodernism''</ref><ref>Boggs, Carl (2012) ''Ecology and Revolution: Global Crisis and the Political Challenge''</ref>\n\n[[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] has been a major contributor to the analysis of advanced-capitalistic societies. Habermas observed four general features that characterise advanced capitalism:\n# Concentration of industrial activity in a few large firms.\n# Constant reliance on the state to stabilise the economic system.\n# A formally democratic government that legitimises the activities of the state and dissipates opposition to the system.\n# The use of nominal wage increases to pacify the most restless segments of the work force.<ref>Habermas, 1988: 37, 75.</ref>\n\n=== Corporate ===\n{{Main|Corporate capitalism}}\n{{See also|Crony capitalism|State monopoly capitalism}}\nCorporate capitalism is a free or mixed-market capitalist economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.\n\n=== Finance ===\n{{Main|Finance capitalism}}\n{{See also|Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)}}\nFinance capitalism is the subordination of processes of [[Production (economics)|production]] to the accumulation of [[money]] profits in a [[financial system]]. In their critique of capitalism, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] both emphasise the role of [[Financial capital|finance capital]] as the determining and [[ruling-class]] interest in capitalist society, particularly in the [[Crisis of capitalism|latter stages]].<ref>[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch03.htm ibid.

It typically entails support for highly [[Competition (economics)|competitive markets]] and [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. ''Laissez-faire'' capitalism is a more extensive form of this free-market economy, but one in which the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]]. In [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] theory, property rights are protected by private firms and market-generated law. According to anarcho-capitalists, this entails property rights without statutory law through market-generated tort, contract and property law as well as the self-sustaining private industry.\n\n=== Mercantile ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n{{See also|Protectionism}}\n[[File:Lloyds Subscription Room edited.jpg|thumb|The subscription room at [[Lloyd's of London]] in the early 19th century]]\nMercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century. It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism; and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e.g. Britain, France and Portugal). Mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations\u2014it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the [[primitive accumulation of capital]].\n\n=== Social ===\n{{Main|Social market economy}}\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\nA social market economy is a free-market or mixed-market capitalist system, sometimes classified as a [[coordinated market economy]], where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum, but the state provides significant services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of [[labor rights]] through national [[collective bargaining]] arrangements. This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries as well as Japan, albeit in slightly different configurations. The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.\n\n[[Rhine capitalism]] is the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\n\n=== State ===\n{{Main|State capitalism}}\nState capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. In his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors. Contemporary state capitalism is associated with the [[East Asian model of capitalism]], [[dirigisme]] and the economy of Norway.<ref>{{cite news |last=Musacchio |first=Aldo |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/802 |title=Economist Debates: State capitalism: Statements |work=The Economist}}</ref> Alternatively, [[Merriam-Webster]] defines state capitalism as \"an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/state%20capitalism State capitalism].

Today, welfare capitalism is most often associated with the models of capitalism found in Central Mainland and Northern Europe such as the [[Nordic model]], [[social market economy]] and [[Rhine capitalism]]. In some cases, welfare capitalism exists within a mixed economy, but welfare states can and do exist independently of policies common to mixed economies such as [[state interventionism]] and extensive regulation.\n\nA mixed economy is a largely market-based capitalist economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and [[economic interventionism]] through macroeconomic policies intended to correct [[market failure]]s, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low. The degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries. Some mixed economies such as France under [[dirigisme]] also featured a degree of [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] over a largely capitalist-based economy.\n\nMost modern capitalist economies are defined as mixed economies to some degree.\n\n== Capital accumulation ==\n{{Main|Capital accumulation}}\n{{Further|Money}}\nThe [[accumulation of capital]] is the process of \"making money\", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production. Capitalism is based on the accumulation of capital, whereby [[financial capital]] is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the [[law of value]]. Capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit.<ref name=\"Economist definition\">{{cite news | title = Economics A\u2013Z: ''Capital'' | url = http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/c#node-21529870 | website = [[economist.com|The Economist]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> In this context, \"capital\" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).<ref name=\"MIA definition\">{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Marxism \u2013 Glossary of terms: ''Capital'' | url = http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital | website = [[Marxists Internet Archive]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn mainstream [[economics]], [[accounting]] and [[Marxian economics]], capital accumulation is often equated with [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] of profit income or saving, especially in [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation. In modern [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]], the phrase \"[[capital formation]]\" is often used in preference to \"accumulation\", though the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to \"accumulation\". The term \u201caccumulation\u201d is occasionally used in [[national accounts]].\n\n=== Background ===\nAccumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company [[balance sheet]]s, [[tax]] data and direct [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of [[national accounts]], national [[balance of payments]] and [[flow of funds]] statistics. The [[Federal Reserve|Reserve Banks]] and the [[Treasury]] usually provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include [[capital formation]], [[gross fixed capital formation]], [[fixed capital]], household asset wealth and [[foreign direct investment]].\n\nOrganisations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the UNCTAD, the [[World Bank Group]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] used national investment data to estimate world trends. The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Eurostat]] and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the United States, Europe and Japan respectively. Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], [[Forbes]], [[The Economist]], [[Business Week]]'' and so on as well as various corporate \"[[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]]\" organisations and [[non-governmental organisation]] publications. A reputable scientific journal is the ''Review of Income & Wealth''. In the case of the United States, the \"Analytical Perspectives\" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country.\n\nIn [[Karl Marx]]' economic theory, capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset [[Value (economics)|value]] in search of additional value or [[surplus-value]]. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in [[Confiscation|expropriation]], both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or \"trading up\", but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] calls this [[accumulation by dispossession]].\n\nThe continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. However, capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a [[Strike action|strike]] by investors or workers, or [[consumer resistance]]).\n\n=== Concentration and centralisation ===\nAccording to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains: \"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. [...] Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. [...] The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, ''caeteris paribus'', on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages [...] It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm|title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter Twenty-Five|first=Karl|last=Marx}}</ref>\n\n=== Rate of accumulation ===\nIn [[Marxian economics]], the rate of accumulation is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the [[stock and flow|stock]] of capital in an accounting period; and (2) the proportion of realised [[surplus-value]] or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realised turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestments (e.g. the writings of the economist [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]]).\n\nOther things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about \"how much to spend, and how much to save\".\n\nIn a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding [[labor force]] and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation and luxury consumption. In that case, income from [[value added|value-adding]] production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow. The inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between \"[[necessary product]]\" and \"[[surplus product]]\"; and (2) the division of the surplus product between [[investment]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of [[competition]] among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors as it also involved social factors and [[economic power|power]] relationships.\n\n=== Circuit of capital accumulation from production ===\nStrictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realised [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] income has been reinvested in capital assets. As suggested in the first volume of Marx' ''[[Das Kapital]]'', the process of capital accumulation in production has at least seven distinct but linked moments:\n* The initial investment of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (which could be borrowed capital) in [[means of production]] and [[labor power]].\n* The command over [[surplus-labour]] and its appropriation.\n* The [[valorisation]] (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.\n* The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.\n* The realisation of [[surplus-value]] through output sales.\n* The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.\n* The reinvestment of profit income in production.\n\nAll of these moments do not refer simply to an \"economic\" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.\n\n=== Simple and expanded reproduction ===\nIn the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank [[credit (finance)|credit]] capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities and so on), commodity capital (tradable products, real estate and the like), or production capital ([[means of production]] and labor power).\n\nHis discussion of the simple and expanded [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]] of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given [[living standard]]; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, more product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a [[surplus product]]); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.\n\nThe bourgeois claim there is no [[economic law]] according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1\u2014producers of means of production\u2014exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (p.&nbsp;524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced, but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (p.&nbsp;514).\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de[[valorisation]].\n\nBalanced [[economic growth]] requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. However, markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance and in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between [[supply and demand]]: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long-time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and [[protectionism]].\n\n=== Capital accumulation as social relation ===\n\"Accumulation of capital\" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist [[social relations]] (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e. the expansion of the size of the [[proletariat]] and of the wealth owned by the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\nThis interpretation emphasises that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the [[working class]] (a \"[[law of accumulation]]\"). In the first volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theory of colonisation: {{Quotation|Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative\u2014the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of \u00a350,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, 'Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.' Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 33}}\n\nIn the [[Capital, Volume III|third volume]] of ''Das Kapital'', Marx refers to the \"fetishism of capital\" reaching its highest point with interest-bearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything: {{Quotation|The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in interest-bearing capital. We have here <math>M - M'</math>, money creating more money, self-expanding value, without the process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, <math>M - C - M'</math>, there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. [...] This is obliterated in <math>M - M'</math>, the form of interest-bearing capital. [...] The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The [[Social relations|social relation]] is consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself. Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form without content.|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 24|source=}}\n\n== Wage labour ==\n{{Main|Wage labour}}\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel [[semi-product]]s (Kinex Bearings, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n[[Wage labour]] refers to the sale of [[Labour economics|labour]] under a formal or informal [[employment contract]] to an [[employer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinfeld|2009|p=3}}: \"All labor contracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to fulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken.

The description of the role of the capitalist has shifted, first referring to a useless intermediary between producers to an employer of producers and eventually came to refer to owners of the means of production.<ref name=\"Williams 1983 51\" /> [[Labor (economics)|Labor]] includes all physical and mental human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are needed to produce products and services.

Twelfth Canadian Edition ed. Toronto, Pearson Education Canada, 2008. Print.</ref><ref>Robbins, Richard H. ''Global problems and the culture of capitalism''. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 2007. Print.</ref>\n\nCritics of the capitalist mode of production see wage labour as a major, if not defining, aspect of hierarchical industrial systems. Most opponents of the institution support [[worker self-management]] and [[economic democracy]] as alternatives to both wage labour and to capitalism. While most opponents of the wage system<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence, most [[anarchists]] and other [[libertarian socialists]] also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of [[privatism|private ownership of the means of production]]. As some opponents of wage labour take influence from Marxist propositions, many are opposed to [[private property]], but maintain respect for [[personal property]].\n\n=== Types ===\nThe most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or \"full-time\", employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker) in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:\n* Employment status: a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].\n* Civil (legal) status: the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.\n* Method of payment (remuneration or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]): the work done could be paid \"in cash\" (a money-wage) or \"in kind\" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of \"[[Piecework|piece rates]]\" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[Employee stock option|stock options]] or [[Share (finance)|shares]] in an enterprise.\n* Method of hiring: the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. However, he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[Subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with the [[means of production]].\n\n== Effects of war ==\n[[File:Alfred T. Palmer - Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at Kansas City, Kansas (USA).jpg|thumb|The common view among economic historians is that the [[Great Depression]] ended with the advent of World War II (assembling the North American [[B-25 Mitchell]] at [[Kansas City]], 1942)]]\nWar typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real [[war profiteering]].\n\nThe total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ellen R. |last=Grattan |first2=Lee E. |last2=Ohanian |title=The macroeconomic effects of big fiscal shocks: the case of world war II |journal=Minneapolis Federal Reserve, Working Paper 599 |date=December 1999 |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp599.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWar destruction can be illustrated by looking at [[World War II]]. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant and equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks and so on were built and then lost or destroyed.\n\nGermany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the [[Berlin]] area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2,395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7,500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.\n\nHowever, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by Western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.\n\nInitially, in May 1945 newly installed United States president [[Harry S. Truman]]'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant and equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the Soviet Union. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.\n\nThe first big strike-wave in the [[Ruhr]] occurred in early 1947\u2014it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. However, the United States appointed military governor (Newman) stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was \"no work, no eat\". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with [[Marshall Plan]] aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The Marshall Aid funds were important, but after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the United States to rebuilding German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average [[real wages]] remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools. This was called the [[German economic miracle]] or ''Wirtschaftswunder''.<ref>Armstrong, Glyn & Harrison, ''Capitalism since world war 2''. Fontana, 1984.

In the 20th century, defenders of the capitalist system often replaced the term capitalism with phrases such as free enterprise and private enterprise and replaced capitalist with [[Rentier capitalism|rentier]] and [[investor]] in reaction to the negative connotations associated with capitalism.<ref name=\"Williams 1983 51\">{{cite book|last= Williams|first= Raymond|title= Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society, revised edition|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1983|isbn= 978-0-19-520469-8|page= [https://archive.org/details/keywordsvocabula00willrich/page/51 51]|chapter= Capitalism|chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/keywordsvocabula00willrich/page/51}}</ref>\n\n=== Profit motive ===\nThe majority of criticisms against the profit motive centre on the idea that the profit motive encourages selfishness and greed, rather than serve the public good or necessarily creating an increase in net wealth.

If these conditions do not hold, then the [[Marshallian surplus|Marshallian]] model cannot be sustained. [[Piero Sraffa|Sraffa's]] critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good.<ref>Avi J. Cohen, \"'The Laws of Returns Under Competitive Conditions': Progress in Microeconomics Since Sraffa (1926)?\", ''Eastern Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 9, no. 3 (Jul.\u2013Sep.): 1983)</ref> The notability of Sraffa's critique is also demonstrated by [[Paul A. Samuelson]]'s comments and engagements with it over many years, for example:\n:What a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how nearly empty are all of Marshall's partial equilibrium boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the Marshallian partial equilibrium box of constant cost is even more empty than the box of increasing cost.<ref>Paul A. Samuelson, \"Reply\" in ''Critical Essays on Piero Sraffa's Legacy in Economics'' (edited by H.D. Kurz), Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref>\n\nAggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price. In the model with an upward-sloping supply curve and downward-sloping demand curve, the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point, namely at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The [[Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu theorem]] shows that the standard model cannot be rigorously derived in general from [[general equilibrium theory]].<ref>Alan Kirman, \"The Intrinsic Limits of Modern Economic Theory: The Emperor has No Clothes\", ''The Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 99, no. 395, Supplement: Conference Papers (1989): pp. 126\u201339</ref>\n\nThe model of prices being determined by supply and demand assumes [[perfect competition]]. However, \"economists have no adequate model of how individuals and firms adjust prices in a competitive model. If all participants are price-takers by definition, then the actor who adjusts prices to eliminate excess demand is not specified\".<ref>Alan P. Kirman, \"Whom or What Does the Representative Individual Represent?\" ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 6, no.  2 (Spring 1992): pp. 117\u201336</ref> Goodwin, Nelson, Ackerman and Weisskopf write:\n:If we mistakenly confuse [[Accuracy and precision|precision with accuracy]], then we might be misled into thinking that an explanation expressed in precise mathematical or graphical terms is somehow more rigorous or useful than one that takes into account particulars of history, institutions or business strategy. This is not the case. Therefore, it is important not to put too much confidence in the apparent precision of supply and demand graphs. Supply and demand analysis is a useful precisely formulated conceptual tool that clever people have devised to help us gain an abstract understanding of a complex world. It does not\u2014nor should it be expected to\u2014give us in addition an accurate and complete description of any particular real world market.<ref>Goodwin, N, Nelson, J; Ackerman, F; & Weisskopf, T: Microeconomics in Context 2d {{abbr|ed.|edition}} Sharpe 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-7656-2301-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Externalities ===\n{{Main|Externality|Commons}}\nMarket failure occurs when an [[externality]] is present and a market will often either under-produce a product with a positive externalisation or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalisation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Air pollution, for instance, is a negative externalisation that cannot be easily incorporated into markets as the world's air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} So too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Critics of market failure theory, like [[Ronald Coase]], [[Harold Demsetz]] and [[James M. Buchanan]], argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} While all nations currently have some kind of market regulations, the desirable degree of regulation is disputed.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Counter-criticism ===\n==== Austrian School ====\n[[Austrian School]] economists have argued that capitalism can organize itself into a complex system without an external guidance or central planning mechanism. [[Friedrich Hayek]] considered the phenomenon of [[self-organisation]] as underpinning capitalism. Prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people and the opportunity to earn profits if successful, or absorb losses if resources are used poorly or left idle, gives entrepreneurs [[incentive]] to use their [[Dispersed knowledge|knowledge]] and resources to satisfy those wants. Thus the activities of millions of people, each seeking his own interest, are coordinated.<ref name=walberg2003>{{cite book |author=Walberg, Herbert |title=Education and Capitalism |chapter-url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/books/8328 |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |year=2003 |chapter=4, What is Capitalism? |pages=87\u201389 |isbn=978-0-8179-3972-4}}</ref>\n\n==== Ayn Rand ====\nThe novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] made positive moral defenses of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, most notably in her 1957 novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' and in her 1966 collection of essays ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]''.

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million. Of these, I would suggest that between 6-million and 8-million were ethnic Chinese, regardless of where they were resident.<ref name=sterling/>}}\n\nAccording to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' pp&nbsp;2\u20133</ref> The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher because\u2014under a directive ratified on August 5, 1937, by Emperor [[Hirohito]]\u2014the constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.<ref>Akira Fujiwara, ''Nitch\u00fb Sens\u00f4 ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu'', Kikan Sens\u00f4 Sekinin Kenky\u00fb 9, 1995, p. 22</ref> Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the [[surrender of Japan]].<ref>Tanaka, ibid., Herbert Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2001, p. 360</ref> After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-491548/Alive-safe-brutal-Japanese-soldiers-butchered-20-000-Allied-seamen-cold-blood.html|author=Blundell, Nigel|title=Alive and safe, the brutal Japanese soldiers who butchered 20,000 Allied seamen in cold blood|publisher=Mail Online (Associated Newspapers Ltd.)|date=November 3, 2007|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Attacks on neutral powers===\n[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|The [[USS Arizona (BB-39)]] burning during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]\nArticle 1 of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''III \u2013 The Opening of Hostilities'' prohibited the initiation of hostilities against neutral powers \"without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned [[declaration of war]] or of an [[ultimatum]] with conditional declaration of war\" and Article 2 further stated that \"[t]he existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph.\" Japanese diplomats intended to deliver the notice to the United States thirty minutes before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, but it was delivered to the U.S. government an hour after the attack was over.

In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials very distracted when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:\n\n{{quote|The concept of aggressive war may not be expressed with the precision of a scientific formula, or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter. It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&nbsp;... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907&nbsp;... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace.

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''.

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

Hashimoto Kingor\u014d, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jir\u014d, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido K\u014dichi, \u014cshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetar\u014d, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Sat\u014d Kenry\u014d, whom many, including Judge [[Bert R\u00f6ling|B.V.A. R\u00f6ling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

During the 1990s, the [[South Korea]]n government started investigating some people who had allegedly become wealthy while collaborating with the Japanese military.<ref>[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004181952/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\">[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004182014/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref> In South Korea, it is also alleged that, during the political climate of the [[Cold War]], many such people or their associates or relatives were able to acquire influence with the wealth they had acquired collaborating with the Japanese and assisted in the covering-up, or non-investigation, of war crimes in order not to incriminate themselves. With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs these investigations continue more evidence is discovered each day. It has been claimed that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Horsley |first=William |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4749467.stm |title=World &#124; Asia-Pacific &#124; Korean WWII sex slaves fight on |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=1846 |title=''Ex-sex slave narrates: \"Japan Boiled Comfort Woman to Make Soup\".

For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200501/200501110028.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea.

For example, in 2011 it was alleged in an article published in the ''Japan Times'' newspaper that the British government were involved in the covering-up of Japanese war crimes as they wanted to end the warcrime trials early in order to re-establish good relations with Japan post-war to prevent the spread of communism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coskrey |first=Jason |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |title=Britain covered up Japan massacre of POWs |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151927/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}</ref> Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes.

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million.

In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials very distracted when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:\n\n{{quote|The concept of aggressive war may not be expressed with the precision of a scientific formula, or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter.

The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&nbsp;...

But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace.

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: \"cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers\".<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' p. 127</ref> This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an [[British Raj|Indian]] POW, ''[[Havildar]]'' Changdi Ram, testified that: \"[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters&nbsp;...

The remainder of us were taken to another spot 50 miles [80&nbsp;km] away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat.

[[Yoshio Tachibana]] (\u7acb\u82b1\u82b3\u592b,''Tachibana Yoshio''), who with 11 other Japanese personnel was tried in August 1946 in relation to the execution of U.S. Navy airmen, and the cannibalism of at least one of them, during August 1944, on [[Chichijima incident|Chichi Jima]], in the [[Bonin Islands]]. The airmen were beheaded on Tachibana's orders. Because military and international law did not specifically deal with cannibalism, they were tried for murder and \"prevention of honorable burial\". Tachibana was sentenced to death, and hanged.<ref>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/yamashita6.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208093731/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/yamashita6.htm |date=2006-12-08 }} ''''Case No. 21 Trial Of General Tomoyuki Yamashita[,&#93; United States Military Commission, Manila, (8 October-7 December 1945), and the Supreme Court Of The United States (Judgments Delivered On 4 February 1946).

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''. Columbia University Press</ref>\n\nThe controversy was re-ignited on 1 March 2007, when Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] mentioned suggestions that a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] committee would call on the Japanese Government to \"apologise for and acknowledge\" the role of the Japanese Imperial military in wartime sex slavery.

The case set a precedent regarding the responsibility of commanders for war crimes, and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].]]\nSoon after the war, the Allied powers indicted 25 persons as [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Class-A war criminals]], and 5,700 persons were indicted as Class-B or Class-C war criminals by Allied criminal trials. Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received some prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial. These numbers included 178 ethnic Taiwanese and 148 ethnic Koreans.<ref>Dower, John (2000). ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'', p. 447</ref> The Class-A charges were all tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], also known as \"the Tokyo Trials\". Other courts were formed in many different places in Asia and the Pacific.\n\n===Tokyo Trials===\n{{Main|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East was formed to try accused people in Japan itself.\n\nHigh-ranking officers who were tried included [[K\u014dichi Kido]] and [[Sadao Araki]]. Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as Class-A war criminals later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.\n* [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] served as foreign minister both during the war and in the post-war [[Ichir\u014d Hatoyama|Hatoyama government]].\n* [[Okinori Kaya]] was finance minister during the war and later served as justice minister in the government of [[Hayato Ikeda]]. These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.\n\n[[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Higashikuni]] were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of [[Bonner Fellers]] who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.<ref>Kumao Toyoda, ''Senso saiban yoroku'', 1986, p.170\u2013172, H. Bix, ''Hirohito and the making of modern Japan'', 2000, p.583, 584</ref> Some historians criticize this decision. According to John Dower, \"with the full support of [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]]'s headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor\"<ref>Dower,''Embracing defeat'', 1999, p.326</ref> and even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Showa regime \"cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of the [[Cold War]], release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]].\"<ref>Dower, ''Hirohito'', p.562.</ref> For Herbert Bix, \"MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.\"<ref>Bix, ''Hirohito'', p.585, 583</ref>\n\n===Other trials===\n{{Main|Khabarovsk War Crime Trials|Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal}}\n\n[[File:AWM 121782 sandakan.jpg|thumb|26 October 1945, [[Sandakan]], [[North Borneo]].

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

Hashimoto Kingor\u014d, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jir\u014d, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido K\u014dichi, \u014cshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetar\u014d, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Sat\u014d Kenry\u014d, whom many, including Judge [[Bert R\u00f6ling|B.V.A. R\u00f6ling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

Though the organisation was established by the government, legally, it has been created such that it is an independent charity. The activities of the fund have been controversial in Japan, as well as with international organisations supporting the women concerned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\nSome argue that such a fund is part of an ongoing refusal by the Japanese government to face up to its responsibilities, while others say that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims' own governments. [[California]] [[Congressman]] [[Mike Honda]], speaking before U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the women, said that \"without a sincere and unequivocal apology from the government of Japan, the majority of surviving Comfort Women refused to accept these funds.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

During the 1990s, the [[South Korea]]n government started investigating some people who had allegedly become wealthy while collaborating with the Japanese military.<ref>[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004181952/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\">[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004182014/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref> In South Korea, it is also alleged that, during the political climate of the [[Cold War]], many such people or their associates or relatives were able to acquire influence with the wealth they had acquired collaborating with the Japanese and assisted in the covering-up, or non-investigation, of war crimes in order not to incriminate themselves. With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs these investigations continue more evidence is discovered each day. It has been claimed that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Horsley |first=William |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4749467.stm |title=World &#124; Asia-Pacific &#124; Korean WWII sex slaves fight on |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=1846 |title=''Ex-sex slave narrates: \"Japan Boiled Comfort Woman to Make Soup\".

For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200501/200501110028.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea.

For example, in 2011 it was alleged in an article published in the ''Japan Times'' newspaper that the British government were involved in the covering-up of Japanese war crimes as they wanted to end the warcrime trials early in order to re-establish good relations with Japan post-war to prevent the spread of communism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coskrey |first=Jason |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |title=Britain covered up Japan massacre of POWs |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151927/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}</ref> Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes.
