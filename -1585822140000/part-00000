The program is currently ABS-CBN's longest-running daily noontime variety show after surpassing the original run of ''[[MTB (TV program)|MTB]]'' (1998\u20132005) by 2016.\n\n==History==\n===As ''Showtime!''===\n''Showtime'' premiered on October 24, 2009 at 10:30{{nbsp}}AM, as a competition program, airing before the network's noontime shows, and served as the replacement of ''[[Pilipinas, Game Ka Na Ba?]]'' following its successful 8-year morning run. The original hosts include [[Vhong Navarro]], [[Anne Curtis]], [[Kim Atienza|Kuya Kim Atienza]], Jugs Jugueta, [[Teddy Corpuz]], and [[Vice Ganda]] as the resident \"''hurado''\" (judge). During the third season, the show added former ''hurados'' [[Billy Crawford]] and [[Karylle]] as hosts.\n\nIn the first four seasons, ''Showtime''{{'}}s original competition format was that three groups, each made up of two to twenty-five members (with no age limit), perform a single performance, either a dance and/or song number. Before the performance, one group member is given twenty seconds to make an introduction before ending with the phrase \"It's Showtime!\". After the group's performance, the ''hurados'' and the studio audiences will rate the group from 1 to 10. The group with the highest average scores from the ''hurados'' wins the competition. All the winners from Daily will perform to the Weekly Finals; all the winning weekly finalists will advance to the Monthly Finals; and last, the winning monthly finalists will get the chance to compete in the Grand Finals. In the Wildcard Week, the best groups who lost in the weekly and monthly finals will get another chance to compete again in order to win a slot for the Grand Finals. Aside from the talent competition, ''Showtime'' also aired quick, short-term segments that offer cash prizes to the studio audiences.\n\nThe very first Grand Finals of ''Showtime'' was held in July 2010 at the [[Ynares Center]] in [[Antipolo|Antipolo City]], [[Rizal]]. Forty ''hurados'' (including Vice Ganda and Jhong Hilario) were assembled to judge the eleven grand finalists. At the end of the competition, the dance group XB Gensan (from the Wildcard week) emerged as the very first Grand Champion with a final average score of 9.875 pts.\n\nIn October 2010, the show was temporarily moved to noontime slot occupying the 11:00 am PHT time slot, while the succeeding program ''Pilipinas Win na Win'' followed at 13:30 pm PHT until the latter show was cancelled on December 31, 2010. \n\n''Showtime'' continued to air on the noontime slot on January 2011 until it later returned to its original timeslot on February 12, 2011 to give way for ''Happy Yipee Yehey!''.\n\nOn January 28, 2012, ''Showtime'' aired a special episode to end its two-year morning competition format with an impartial farewell.<ref>[http://www.pep.ph/news/32770/-Showtimebids-farewell-to-madlang-pipol Showtime bids farewell to madlang pipol?] retrieved via www.pep.ph January 28, 2012</ref> It was revealed that the program was preparing for a reformat to become a noontime variety show.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGHinrVoG_w&feature=relmfu It's Showtime: Official Teaser] retrieved via youtube.com via abscbnonline user January 30, 2012</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlpR9aSCU7o&feature=channel_video_title It's Showtime Station ID] retrieved via youtube.com via abscbnonline user January 30, 2012</ref>\n\n===As ''Magpasikat''===\n''Magpasikat'' is the placeholder show of ''Showtime'' during the suspension of the latter.

The show is taped in the [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBN Studios]] at the [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]] in [[Quezon City]]. The show currently airs every Mondays to Fridays from 12:00{{nbsp}}PM to 2:30{{nbsp}}PM, and Saturdays from 11:30{{nbsp}}AM to 3:15{{nbsp}}PM. It also airs worldwide via [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]], and live-streaming online on [[YouTube]] via its channel ''Showtime Online Universe''.

The program is currently ABS-CBN's longest-running daily noontime variety show after surpassing the original run of ''[[MTB (TV program)|MTB]]'' (1998\u20132005) by 2016.\n\n==History==\n===As ''Showtime!''===\n''Showtime'' premiered on October 24, 2009 at 10:30{{nbsp}}AM, as a competition program, airing before the network's noontime shows, and served as the replacement of ''[[Pilipinas, Game Ka Na Ba?]]'' following its successful 8-year morning run. The original hosts include [[Vhong Navarro]], [[Anne Curtis]], [[Kim Atienza|Kuya Kim Atienza]], Jugs Jugueta, [[Teddy Corpuz]], and [[Vice Ganda]] as the resident \"''hurado''\" (judge). During the third season, the show added former ''hurados'' [[Billy Crawford]] and [[Karylle]] as hosts.\n\nIn the first four seasons, ''Showtime''{{'}}s original competition format was that three groups, each made up of two to twenty-five members (with no age limit), perform a single performance, either a dance and/or song number. Before the performance, one group member is given twenty seconds to make an introduction before ending with the phrase \"It's Showtime!\". After the group's performance, the ''hurados'' and the studio audiences will rate the group from 1 to 10. The group with the highest average scores from the ''hurados'' wins the competition. All the winners from Daily will perform to the Weekly Finals; all the winning weekly finalists will advance to the Monthly Finals; and last, the winning monthly finalists will get the chance to compete in the Grand Finals. In the Wildcard Week, the best groups who lost in the weekly and monthly finals will get another chance to compete again in order to win a slot for the Grand Finals. Aside from the talent competition, ''Showtime'' also aired quick, short-term segments that offer cash prizes to the studio audiences.\n\nThe very first Grand Finals of ''Showtime'' was held in July 2010 at the [[Ynares Center]] in [[Antipolo|Antipolo City]], [[Rizal]]. Forty ''hurados'' (including Vice Ganda and Jhong Hilario) were assembled to judge the eleven grand finalists. At the end of the competition, the dance group XB Gensan (from the Wildcard week) emerged as the very first Grand Champion with a final average score of 9.875 pts.\n\nIn October 2010, the show was temporarily moved to noontime slot occupying the 11:00 am PHT time slot, while the succeeding program ''Pilipinas Win na Win'' followed at 13:30 pm PHT until the latter show was cancelled on December 31, 2010. \n\n''Showtime'' continued to air on the noontime slot on January 2011 until it later returned to its original timeslot on February 12, 2011 to give way for ''Happy Yipee Yehey!''.\n\nOn January 28, 2012, ''Showtime'' aired a special episode to end its two-year morning competition format with an impartial farewell.<ref>[http://www.pep.ph/news/32770/-Showtimebids-farewell-to-madlang-pipol Showtime bids farewell to madlang pipol?] retrieved via www.pep.ph January 28, 2012</ref> It was revealed that the program was preparing for a reformat to become a noontime variety show.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGHinrVoG_w&feature=relmfu It's Showtime: Official Teaser] retrieved via youtube.com via abscbnonline user January 30, 2012</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlpR9aSCU7o&feature=channel_video_title It's Showtime Station ID] retrieved via youtube.com via abscbnonline user January 30, 2012</ref>\n\n===As ''Magpasikat''===\n''Magpasikat'' is the placeholder show of ''Showtime'' during the suspension of the latter. The show had essentially the same format as with ''Showtime'', except that the competing groups were composed of celebrities. ''Magpasikat'' aired from January 11, 2010 to January 16, 2010.\n\n===As ''It's Showtime''===\n''It's Showtime'' premiered on February 6, 2012 on its new timeslot at 11:30{{nbsp}}AM, replacing the defunct noontime program ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]''. During the first months of relaunch, the show was also simulcast previously on [[Studio 23]] (now [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]]) and [[CgeTV]]'s website. ''It's Showtime'' retains all of the main hosts, including [[Anne Curtis]], [[Vice Ganda]] and [[Vhong Navarro]], while adding former ''hurados'' [[Jhong Hilario]], [[Ryan Bang]] and [[Coleen Garcia]]. [[Eric Tai|Eric \"Eruption\" Tai]] was also added as one of the new hosts during the pilot episode.\n\n''It's Showtime'' launched new long-term segments, while the original competition format returned once again as one of its special segments. The competitive format was used for one final season, season five. To cater to the entire family audience, a sixth season called the ''Bida Kapamilya'' competition was introduced on April 30, 2012. Throughout the run of ''Bida Kapamilya'', ''It's Showtime'' added Joy Rendon and Rhed Bustamante as part of the hosts.\n\nIn 2014, the show celebrated their 5th anniversary with brand new segments as well as returning segments alike.\n\nIn December 2015, Coleen Garcia left the show due to her acting career and other commitments. Eric \"Eruption\" Tai also left the show to focus on his sports career and married life.\n\nOn January 2, 2016, ''It's Showtime'' adds [[Amy Perez]] (a former ''Showtime hurado'' in 2009) and [[Mariel Rodriguez]] after serving their stints as guest co-hosts in late 2015.\n\nOn March 23, 2016, [[Jhong Hilario]] temporarily left the show to run for councilor in Makati City; he reprised his hosting duties on May 10, 2016.\n\nOn May 13, 2017, [[James Reid (entertainer)|James Reid]] and [[Nadine Lustre]] were featured as co-hosts for a brief period of time; they also participated in the ''Magpasikat Week'' of the show's seventh anniversary special.\n\nIn January 2018 the show is extended from 3:30 pm, from Mondays-Fridays and 3:30 pm, from Saturdays after the ratings got affected due to rival network GMA Network's decision since 2017 to air extensively its afternoon drama series on Saturdays right after ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]''.\n\nOn June 18, 2018, [[Mariel Rodriguez]] reprised her hosting duties after a two-year-long break.\n\nIn October 2018, ''It's Showtime'' launched its own YouTube channel ''Showtime Online Universe''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/itsshowtime/show-updates/2018/10/11/53101218-its-showtime-launches-3-new-digital-shows-on-youtube|title=\"It\u2019s Showtime\" launches 3 new digital shows on YouTube|website=entertainment.abs-cbn.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lionheartv.net/2018/10/online-universe-its-showtime-launches-3-new-digital-shows-on-youtube/|title=Online Universe: \"It\u2019s Showtime\" launches 3 new digital shows on YouTube|last=Kim|first=Irone|date=2018-10-14|website=LionhearTV|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> Three digital programs premiered on the channel: \"''And I Thank You''\" with ''Miss Q and A'' segment grand winner Juliana Parizcova Segovia; \"''Hashtag Roadtrip''\" with the Hashtag members; and \"''Donna What To Do''\" with ''Funny One'' segment season two grand winner Donna Cariaga.

However, it went live via work from home in later episodes.\n\n'''Showtime's \"Sampu-Sample\"'''\n\nOn October 1, 2019, ''It's Showtime'' started to celebrate their 10th anniversary by introducing its new anniversary tagline, \"Sampu-Sample\" (derived from the word ''\"Sampu\"'' (lit.

There are many theories on the origin of the name. One widely accepted theory claims that the name \"Kalimpong\" means \"Assembly (or Stockade) of the King's Ministers\" in [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], derived from ''kalon'' (\"King's ministers\") and ''pong'' (\"[[stockade]]\"). It may be derived from the translation \"ridge where we play\" from [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]], as it was known to be the place for traditional tribal gatherings for summer sporting events.

With [[People's Republic of China|China's]] annexation of [[Tibet]] in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled Tibet and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelep Pass after the [[Sino-Indian War]] disrupted trade between Tibet and India, and led to a slowdown in Kalimpong's economy. In 1976, the visiting [[Dalai Lama]] consecrated the [[Zang Dhok Palri Phodang]] monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.<ref name=\"tribunekalim\" />\n\n[[File:Kalimpongkanchenjanga.jpg|thumb|Most large houses in Kalimpong were built during the British era.

It may be derived from the translation \"ridge where we play\" from [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]], as it was known to be the place for traditional tribal gatherings for summer sporting events.

With [[People's Republic of China|China's]] annexation of [[Tibet]] in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled Tibet and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelep Pass after the [[Sino-Indian War]] disrupted trade between Tibet and India, and led to a slowdown in Kalimpong's economy.

It was designed by [[Percy Allan]] and built in 1896 by W. J. Lansdown. The bridge is also known as the '''Wee Jasper Bridge over Goodradigbee River'''. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]].

Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works]] Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1485/>\n\n[[Truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan trusses]] were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time.
