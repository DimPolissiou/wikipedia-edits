Unlike Ivan, Stella has a long memory and can remember living in other places, like the circus where she was taught many of her tricks.

Ivan has spent most of his life in captivity, either living in a human home or at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade. He remembers only a little about his life before captivity and has grown content with his life at the mall. As the story progresses, Ivan determines that his life is not satisfactory and he works to save Ruby and himself by having them both brought to a zoo, where they will spend the rest of their life.\n*'''Stella''': a senior elephant who used to live in a traveling circus before she suffered an injury and was sold to Mack. Stella has a long memory, and would much prefer to live in a zoo. She extracts ajiujijiijij promise from Ivan to take care of Ruby if she cannot.\n*'''Bob''': a stray dog who lives with Ivan in his domain. Bob is satisfied to be a stray dog and has no desire to be adopted into a human home.\n*'''Mack''': the owner of the small circus and part-time circus clown; he purchased Ivan from poachers who captured him in his home in Africa. Mack is not seen often in the book. He appears to be a generally good man. However, his business is failing and he cannot afford to keep up the mall the way he used to. His actions regarding Stella and Ruby are what finally spur Ivan to try to have Ruby moved to a zoo.\n*'''George''': The mall custodian. George is a good man who cares for the animals and the mall.

Julia works to help Ivan in his quest to move Ruby and the other animals to a zoo.\n*'''Ruby''': a baby elephant who is new to the mall.

He made some recordings under his own name in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn 1941, Stone became musical director for the [[All-female band|all-female jazz band]], the [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]].

An early success was \"Idaho\", recorded by several artists, with the Benny Goodman version peaking at number 4 (pop) in 1942.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>  The recording by [[Guy Lombardo]] sold three million copies.  Jimmy Dorsey recorded his composition \"Sorghum Switch\", later retitled \"Cole Slaw\" by [[Louis Jordan]].<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>  Stone also recorded novelty blues records for [[RCA Records]], and wrote the standard \"Smack Dab in the Middle\".<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\n===Atlantic Records===\nIn 1945, with his friend [[Herb Abramson]], he went to work for [[Al Green (record producer)|Al Green]] at [[National Records]], and two years later the pair joined the staff at [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> At the time, Stone was the only black person on the Atlantic payroll.\n\nStone worked for Atlantic as a producer, songwriter, and arranger.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> During a trip to the South in 1949 with Ahmet Ertegun and [[Herb Abramson]], Stone discovered that Atlantic's records were not selling in the southern states because they lacked a certain danceable quality. Stone later said: \"I listened to the stuff that was being done by those thrown-together bands in the joints down there, and I concluded that the only thing that was missing from the stuff we were recording was the rhythm.  All we needed was a bass line.  So I designed a bass pattern, and it sort of became identified with rock'n'roll - doo, da-DOO, DUM; doo, da-DOO, DUM - that thing.

The following year, he arranged \"[[Sh-Boom]]\" by [[The Chords (U.S.)|The Chords]].<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\n===As Charles Calhoun===\nOn Ertegun's advice, Stone used the pseudonym of Charles E. Calhoun, a name appropriated from an unknowing local builder, on his [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] tunes to avoid conflict with his membership in the other music licensing society, [[ASCAP]].  His best-known composition as Calhoun was \"[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]\".  The song was first recorded by [[Big Joe Turner]] in 1954 for Atlantic and was a major hit for the [[rhythm and blues]] artist,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> often cited as one of the [[first rock and roll record]]s. An even bigger success was a [[cover version]] of the song recorded later in 1954 for [[Decca Records]] by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]]. This version became one of the first rock and roll recordings to sell a million copies and be an international success. It predated Haley's better-known \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" by nearly a year.\n\nStone also co-wrote \"[[Flip, Flop and Fly]]\" with Big Joe Turner, which was another hit. Haley was also fond of the song, and recorded it three times during his career. Stone also had additional Haley connections. Haley's hit, 1955's \"Razzle-Dazzle\", was another written by Stone under the Calhoun pseudonym. Stone was also credited as co-writer (along with [[James E. Myers]] aka Jimmy DeKnight, co-writer of \"Rock Around the Clock\") of \"Rattle My Bones\", a song recorded in 1956 by the Comets spin-off group, [[The Jodimars]].\n\nAs a bandleader, Stone recorded several singles in the late 1940s and mid 1950s, on [[RCA Victor]], Atlantic and other labels, either under his own name or as \"Chuck\", \"Charles\" or \"Charlie\" Calhoun.\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1960, he served as arranger and orchestra director for a session for [[LaVern Baker]] which produced four songs including the hit \"Bumble Bee\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jazzdisco.org/atlantic-records/discography-1960/|title= Atlantic Records Discography: 1960|work= Jazz Discography Project|location= |page= |accessdate= Dec 3, 2009}}</ref> In 1961, after a brief and temporary retirement, Stone was recruited to run Randy Records in Chicago.

Calhoun, a name appropriated from an unknowing local builder, on his [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] tunes to avoid conflict with his membership in the other music licensing society, [[ASCAP]].  His best-known composition as Calhoun was \"[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]\".  The song was first recorded by [[Big Joe Turner]] in 1954 for Atlantic and was a major hit for the [[rhythm and blues]] artist,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> often cited as one of the [[first rock and roll record]]s. An even bigger success was a [[cover version]] of the song recorded later in 1954 for [[Decca Records]] by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]]. This version became one of the first rock and roll recordings to sell a million copies and be an international success. It predated Haley's better-known \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" by nearly a year.\n\nStone also co-wrote \"[[Flip, Flop and Fly]]\" with Big Joe Turner, which was another hit. Haley was also fond of the song, and recorded it three times during his career. Stone also had additional Haley connections. Haley's hit, 1955's \"Razzle-Dazzle\", was another written by Stone under the Calhoun pseudonym. Stone was also credited as co-writer (along with [[James E. Myers]] aka Jimmy DeKnight, co-writer of \"Rock Around the Clock\") of \"Rattle My Bones\", a song recorded in 1956 by the Comets spin-off group, [[The Jodimars]].\n\nAs a bandleader, Stone recorded several singles in the late 1940s and mid 1950s, on [[RCA Victor]], Atlantic and other labels, either under his own name or as \"Chuck\", \"Charles\" or \"Charlie\" Calhoun.\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1960, he served as arranger and orchestra director for a session for [[LaVern Baker]] which produced four songs including the hit \"Bumble Bee\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jazzdisco.org/atlantic-records/discography-1960/|title= Atlantic Records Discography: 1960|work= Jazz Discography Project|location= |page= |accessdate= Dec 3, 2009}}</ref> In 1961, after a brief and temporary retirement, Stone was recruited to run Randy Records in Chicago.  However, he left after a few years.\n\n==Honors and awards==\nStone was honored by the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]] in 1992 with a Pioneer Award. He was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame in 1992.
