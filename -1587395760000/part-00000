The city of [[Malappuram]], the district headquarters, gives the district its name.\n\nIt is the most populous district in [[Kerala]], which is home to about 12.3% of the total population of the state.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://spb.kerala.gov.in/ER2017/web_e/ch11.php?id=1&ch=11 | website = spb.kerala.gov.in | title = Population profile of Kerala | accessdate = 28 November 2019}}</ref> The district was formed on 16 June 1969 spanning an area of about {{convert|3554|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. Today it is the third-largest district in [[Kerala]] in terms of area.\n\nMalappuram district was carved out by combining some portions of the former Palakkad and Kozhikode districts- [[Eranad taluk]] and portions of [[Tirur taluk]] in the former [[Kozhikode district]], and portions of [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] and [[Ponnani taluk]] in the former [[Palakkad district]] (before 1969). Now the district comprises seven Taluks- [[Ponnani taluk|Ponnani]], [[Perinthalmanna taluk|Perinthalmanna]], [[Tirur Taluk|Tirur]], [[Eranad Taluk|Eranad]], [[Tirurangadi Taluk Office|Tirurangadi]], [[Kondotty Taluk|Kondotty]], and [[Nilambur]].  [[Malayalam]] is the most widely spoken language of the district. Though the headquarters of the district is in [[Malappuram]], it's economy is mainly centred in the city of [[Manjeri]].\n\nThe district has contributed well to the cultural traditions of [[Kerala]]. It was the birthplace of many poets like [[Thunchath Ezhuthachan]], [[Poonthanam Nambudiri]], [[Uroob]], [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]], and [[Moyinkutty Vaidyar]]. Besides the poets, the district has also contributed many writers, and religious and political leaders. The first Chief Minister of Kerala, [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]], was born in the district. The rulers of two of the three main kingdoms of [[Kerala]] during the late medieval period had their earlier headquarters in the district- [[Perumpadappu, Malappuram|Perumpadappu]] in [[Ponnani Taluk]] was the hometown of the [[Kingdom of Cochin]], which is also known as ''Perumbadappu Swaroopam'', and [[Nediyiruppu]] in [[Kondotty Taluk]] was the earlier headquarters of the [[Zamorin of Calicut]], which is also known as ''Nediyiruppu Swaroopam''.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term, ''Malappuram'', which means \"terraced place atop the hills\", is derived from the geography of [[Malappuram|Malappuram city]], the district headquarters.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malappuram}}\nBefore the district's formation, the region was known as [[Eranad]], [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Vettathunad]] etc.\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n[[File:Ruins of old jain style temple@arimbra3.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Ruins of an ancient Jain temple in [[Arimbra Hills, Malappuram|Arimbra]]|Ruins of an ancient [[Jain temple]] at [[Arimbra Hills, Malappuram|Arimbra]]]]\nThe district has a rich cultural and political heritage. The Stone Age history of the district is not well-known. However, the remains of some pre-historic symbols like [[Dolmen|Dolmens]], [[Menhir|Menhirs]], and [[Rock-cut architecture|Rock-cut caves]] have been found from various places of the district like [[Nilambur]], [[Manjeri]], etc. [[Rock-cut architecture|Rock-cut caves]] are also seen in the places like Puliyakkode,  [[Chemmad|Thrikkulam]],  [[Oorakam]],  [[Melmuri]],  [[Ponmala]],  [[Vallikunnu]], and  [[Vengara, Malappuram District|Vengara]].<ref name=History_of_Malappuram>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/3205_PART_A_MALAPPURAM.pdf |website=censusindia.gov.in |title= History of Malappuram |accessdate= 17 April 2020}}</ref> The port of [[Ponnani]] (known as [[Tyndis]] in the ancient period) was a center of trade with [[Ancient Rome]]. During [[Sangam period]], the region was included in the Kudanadu, a province in the [[Tamilakam|Ancient Tamilakam]].\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n[[File:Thirunavaya (5).jpg|left|thumb|alt=Thirunavaya Navamukunda temple|[[Thirunavaya Navamukunda Temple]], where the [[Mamankam festival]] was held during the [[Zamorin of Calicut|Zamorin's rule]]]]\nAfter the Chera Dynasty, a number of dynasties controlled the area, and by the ninth century the region was ruled by the [[Chera dynasty|Kulasekharas]] of [[Mahodayapuram]]. A piece of inscriptional evidence found at the [[Triprangode Siva Temple]] indicates that [[Goda Ravi]] of [[Chera Dynasty]] controlled the present-day district in the early 10th century. Descriptions about the rulers of [[Eranad|Eranad region]] can be seen in the [[Jewish copper plates of Cochin|Jewish copper plates]] of Bhaskara Ravi Varman (1000 CE) and in the [[Viraraghava copper plates]] of  Veera Raghava Chakravarthy (1225 CE). <ref name=History_of_Malappuram></ref> After the disintegration of the Kulasekhara kingdom, a number of [[Nair]] city-states emerged, including [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Kingdom of Tanur|Vettattunadu (Tanur)]], [[Parappanad]] and [[Nediyiruppu]] (ruled by the [[Zamorin]]s). \n\nDuring the 14th century, the [[Samoothiri]] of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] expanded their territories to many parts of the district. [[Thirunavaya]], the seat of [[Mamankam]], is located at the present-day [[Tirur Taluk]] in Malappuram district.Thrikkavil Kovilakam in [[Ponnani]] served as a second home for the Samoothiris of Kozhikode. The Samoothiri of Kozhikode earned a greater part of his revenues by taxing the spice trade through his ports. Smaller ports in the kingdom included Puthuppattanam ([[Kottakkal]]), [[Parappanangadi]], [[Tanur, Malappuram|Tanur]], and [[Ponnani]].<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\">K. V.

Among them, [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] is known as the father of modern [[Malayalam]] language. Today the district includes [[Tirunavaya]], the classic medieval centre of [[Vedas|Vedic]] learning and [[Kottakkal]], home of [[Ayurveda]] medicine.\n[[File:Thunchath Smarakam (2).jpg|left|thumb|The Thunchan Smarakam in [[Tirur]], in memory of [[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan]], who is known as the father of modern [[Malayalam]] language]][[File:Portrait of Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan,the father of the Malayalam language.jpg|right|thumb|[[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]], 16th-century poet]]In the field of astronomy and mathematics also, Malappuram has dedicated its talented persons during the medieval period. The ancient [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] though mainly centered in [[Thrissur]] also had [[Namboodiri]] and [[Nair]] scholars coming from [[Malappuram]]. The [[Parameshvara]], the [[Nilakantha Somayaji]], the [[Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva]], the [[Achyutha Pisharadi]], and the [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]], who were the main members of the [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] hailed from [[Tirur]] area in the district.\n\n=== Colonial-era ===\n[[Colonial India|European colonial powers]] first landed in Malabar during the 15th century, and the [[Samoothiri]]s often allied with foreign powers. During the 18th century, the ''de facto'' [[Mysore kingdom]] rulers [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] marched into the Samoothiris\u2019 districts.\n\nThis district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram has been part of movements such as [[Khilafat Movement]] and [[Malabar Rebellion]] in the early 20th century. Before [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] in 1947, Malappuram was part of [[Malabar District]] in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. The present district was administered as parts of [[Kozhikode|Kozhikode taluk]], [[Eranad taluk]], [[Valluvanad Taluk]] and [[Ponnani Taluk|Ponnani taluk]]. \n[[File:South Malabar 1921.png|left|thumb|alt=Map of South Malabar in 1921|South Malabar during the [[Malabar rebellion]] in 1921 (today a major part lies in the Malappuram district)]]\n[[File:Ali Musliyar.jpg|130px|right|thumb|alt=Older man in traditional dress, looking left|[[Ali Musliyar]], one of the chief Mappila rebels]]\n\n=== After Independence ===\nThe [[Malabar District]] remained as a part of [[Madras state]] for a few years after independence, but on 1 November 1956 it merged with [[Travancore-Cochin]] to form the state of [[Kerala]]. The newly merged [[Malabar District]] was divided into [[Kannur district|Kannur]], [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] and [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] in 1957 soon after the formation of [[Kerala]]. Large-scale changes in the territorial jurisdiction of the region took place in between 1957 and 1969. On 1 January 1957, [[Tirur taluk]] was formed by adjoining the major portions of Eranad taluk and Ponnani taluk. Another portion of Ponnani taluk was transferred to the new [[Chavakkad]] [[taluk]] in [[Thrissur district]], and the remainder is present-day Ponnani taluk. [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] was formed from the former Valluvanad Taluk.

Today it is the third-largest district in [[Kerala]] in terms of area.\n\nMalappuram district was carved out by combining some portions of the former Palakkad and Kozhikode districts- [[Eranad taluk]] and portions of [[Tirur taluk]] in the former [[Kozhikode district]], and portions of [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] and [[Ponnani taluk]] in the former [[Palakkad district]] (before 1969). Now the district comprises seven Taluks- [[Ponnani taluk|Ponnani]], [[Perinthalmanna taluk|Perinthalmanna]], [[Tirur Taluk|Tirur]], [[Eranad Taluk|Eranad]], [[Tirurangadi Taluk Office|Tirurangadi]], [[Kondotty Taluk|Kondotty]], and [[Nilambur]].  [[Malayalam]] is the most widely spoken language of the district. Though the headquarters of the district is in [[Malappuram]], it's economy is mainly centred in the city of [[Manjeri]].\n\nThe district has contributed well to the cultural traditions of [[Kerala]]. It was the birthplace of many poets like [[Thunchath Ezhuthachan]], [[Poonthanam Nambudiri]], [[Uroob]], [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]], and [[Moyinkutty Vaidyar]]. Besides the poets, the district has also contributed many writers, and religious and political leaders. The first Chief Minister of Kerala, [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]], was born in the district. The rulers of two of the three main kingdoms of [[Kerala]] during the late medieval period had their earlier headquarters in the district- [[Perumpadappu, Malappuram|Perumpadappu]] in [[Ponnani Taluk]] was the hometown of the [[Kingdom of Cochin]], which is also known as ''Perumbadappu Swaroopam'', and [[Nediyiruppu]] in [[Kondotty Taluk]] was the earlier headquarters of the [[Zamorin of Calicut]], which is also known as ''Nediyiruppu Swaroopam''.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term, ''Malappuram'', which means \"terraced place atop the hills\", is derived from the geography of [[Malappuram|Malappuram city]], the district headquarters.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malappuram}}\nBefore the district's formation, the region was known as [[Eranad]], [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Vettathunad]] etc.\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n[[File:Ruins of old jain style temple@arimbra3.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Ruins of an ancient Jain temple in [[Arimbra Hills, Malappuram|Arimbra]]|Ruins of an ancient [[Jain temple]] at [[Arimbra Hills, Malappuram|Arimbra]]]]\nThe district has a rich cultural and political heritage.

A piece of inscriptional evidence found at the [[Triprangode Siva Temple]] indicates that [[Goda Ravi]] of [[Chera Dynasty]] controlled the present-day district in the early 10th century. Descriptions about the rulers of [[Eranad|Eranad region]] can be seen in the [[Jewish copper plates of Cochin|Jewish copper plates]] of Bhaskara Ravi Varman (1000 CE) and in the [[Viraraghava copper plates]] of  Veera Raghava Chakravarthy (1225 CE). <ref name=History_of_Malappuram></ref> After the disintegration of the Kulasekhara kingdom, a number of [[Nair]] city-states emerged, including [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Kingdom of Tanur|Vettattunadu (Tanur)]], [[Parappanad]] and [[Nediyiruppu]] (ruled by the [[Zamorin]]s). \n\nDuring the 14th century, the [[Samoothiri]] of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] expanded their territories to many parts of the district.

The ancient [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] though mainly centered in [[Thrissur]] also had [[Namboodiri]] and [[Nair]] scholars coming from [[Malappuram]]. The [[Parameshvara]], the [[Nilakantha Somayaji]], the [[Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva]], the [[Achyutha Pisharadi]], and the [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]], who were the main members of the [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] hailed from [[Tirur]] area in the district.\n\n=== Colonial-era ===\n[[Colonial India|European colonial powers]] first landed in Malabar during the 15th century, and the [[Samoothiri]]s often allied with foreign powers. During the 18th century, the ''de facto'' [[Mysore kingdom]] rulers [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] marched into the Samoothiris\u2019 districts.\n\nThis district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram has been part of movements such as [[Khilafat Movement]] and [[Malabar Rebellion]] in the early 20th century. Before [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] in 1947, Malappuram was part of [[Malabar District]] in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. The present district was administered as parts of [[Kozhikode|Kozhikode taluk]], [[Eranad taluk]], [[Valluvanad Taluk]] and [[Ponnani Taluk|Ponnani taluk]]. \n[[File:South Malabar 1921.png|left|thumb|alt=Map of South Malabar in 1921|South Malabar during the [[Malabar rebellion]] in 1921 (today a major part lies in the Malappuram district)]]\n[[File:Ali Musliyar.jpg|130px|right|thumb|alt=Older man in traditional dress, looking left|[[Ali Musliyar]], one of the chief Mappila rebels]]\n\n=== After Independence ===\nThe [[Malabar District]] remained as a part of [[Madras state]] for a few years after independence, but on 1 November 1956 it merged with [[Travancore-Cochin]] to form the state of [[Kerala]]. The newly merged [[Malabar District]] was divided into [[Kannur district|Kannur]], [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] and [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] in 1957 soon after the formation of [[Kerala]]. Large-scale changes in the territorial jurisdiction of the region took place in between 1957 and 1969. On 1 January 1957, [[Tirur taluk]] was formed by adjoining the major portions of Eranad taluk and Ponnani taluk. Another portion of Ponnani taluk was transferred to the new [[Chavakkad]] [[taluk]] in [[Thrissur district]], and the remainder is present-day Ponnani taluk. [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] was formed from the former Valluvanad Taluk. Of these, [[Eranad taluk|Eranad Taluk]] and [[Tirur]] remained in [[Kozhikode District]] and Perinthalmanna Taluk and Ponnani taluk remained in [[Palakkad District]]. The new district of Malappuram was formed with four taluks (Eranad, Perinthalmanna, Tirur, and Ponnani), four towns, fourteen developmental blocks and 100 [[panchayat]]s. Later, three more taluks, [[Tirurangadi taluk|Tirurangadi]], [[Nilambur taluk|Nilambur]] and [[Kondotty Taluk|Kondotty]] were formed from Tirur Taluk and Eranad taluk.\n\nIn the early years of [[Communist]] rule in Kerala, Malappuram experienced land reform under the [[Land reform in Kerala|Land Reform Ordinance]]. During the 1970s [[Persian Gulf]] [[oil]] reserves were opened to commercial extraction and thousands of unskilled workers [[Kerala Gulf diaspora|migrated]] to the Gulf. They sent money home, supporting the rural economy, and by the late 20th century the region had [[First World]] health standards and near-universal literacy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2084273_2084272_2084259,00.html | work=Time | title=Summer Journey 2011 | date=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cherumb eco tourism village, Karuvarakundu India (2).JPG|right|thumb|alt= The Cherumb eco-tourism village at Karuvarakundu|The Cherumb eco-tourism village in [[Karuvarakundu]]]]\nBounded by the [[Nilgiri Mountains|Nilgiri hills]] on the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west, the [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]] and [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] districts on the north, and the [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] and [[Thrissur district|Thrissur]] districts on the south, Malappuram district possesses a total geographical area of 3,554 sq.km, which ranks third in the state in terms of area.

For decades, only a few major cities, such as  [[Moscow]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Madrid]], [[Warsaw]] and the transcontinental city of [[Istanbul]] contained skyscrapers. In recent years, however, construction has spread to many other cities on the continent, including [[Barcelona]], [[Benidorm]], [[Berlin]], [[Kiev]], [[Manchester]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Vienna]]. \n\nAs of 2020, seventeen European cities have more than 10 skyscrapers above {{convert|100|m|ft}}: [[Moscow]] (106), [[Istanbul]] (101), [[London]] (80), [[Paris]] (75), [[Frankfurt]] (36), [[Benidorm]] (26), [[Warsaw]] (26), [[Rotterdam]] (21), [[Milan]] (20), [[Kiev]] (18), [[Barcelona]] (16), [[Madrid]] (15), [[Manchester]] (15), [[Vienna]] (15), [[Berlin]] (12).\n\n==Tallest buildings==\n[[File:Third Ring Road near Moscow-City.png|alt=|thumb|The [[Moscow International Business Center]].]]\n[[File:London Skyline (125508655).jpeg|thumb|The [[City of London]].]]\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 01.jpg|thumb|[[Canary Wharf]], [[London]].]]\n[[File:Levent, Istanbul at night.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Levent]], [[Istanbul]].]]\n[[File:FrankfurtSkyline2014.jpg|thumb|Skyline of [[Frankfurt]].]]\n[[File:La D\u00e9fense from the Arc de Triomphe, Paris 6 March 2015 003.jpg|thumb|[[La D\u00e9fense]], [[Paris]].|222x222px]]\n[[File:Full Milan skyline from Duomo roof.jpg|thumb|[[Porta Nuova (Milan)|Porta Nuova]], [[Milan]].|222x222px]]\n[[File:2020-01-14-Urbanfile-Milano-Porta-Vigentina-Tre-Torri-CityLife-Cantieri-Curvo-1.jpg|thumb|222x222px|[[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]], [[Milan]].]]\n[[File:Warsaw panorama.png|alt=|thumb|[[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].]]\n[[File:Madrid-Azca-Castellana-170913.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\nThis lists ranks skyscrapers in Europe that stand at least {{convert|150|m|ft|0}} tall, based on standard height measurement. Architectural details does not include [[Radio masts and towers|antenna masts]]. The height data is subject to fluctuations due to simple changing of mast extensions. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height. Many non-architectural extensions (such as radio antennas) are easily added and removed from tall buildings without significantly changing the style and design of the building, which is seen as a significant part of the value of these buildings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

For decades, only a few major cities, such as  [[Moscow]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Madrid]], [[Warsaw]] and the transcontinental city of [[Istanbul]] contained skyscrapers. In recent years, however, construction has spread to many other cities on the continent, including [[Barcelona]], [[Benidorm]], [[Berlin]], [[Kiev]], [[Manchester]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Vienna]]. \n\nAs of 2020, seventeen European cities have more than 10 skyscrapers above {{convert|100|m|ft}}: [[Moscow]] (106), [[Istanbul]] (101), [[London]] (80), [[Paris]] (75), [[Frankfurt]] (36), [[Benidorm]] (26), [[Warsaw]] (26), [[Rotterdam]] (21), [[Milan]] (20), [[Kiev]] (18), [[Barcelona]] (16), [[Madrid]] (15), [[Manchester]] (15), [[Vienna]] (15), [[Berlin]] (12).\n\n==Tallest buildings==\n[[File:Third Ring Road near Moscow-City.png|alt=|thumb|The [[Moscow International Business Center]].]]\n[[File:London Skyline (125508655).jpeg|thumb|The [[City of London]].]]\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 01.jpg|thumb|[[Canary Wharf]], [[London]].]]\n[[File:Levent, Istanbul at night.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Levent]], [[Istanbul]].]]\n[[File:FrankfurtSkyline2014.jpg|thumb|Skyline of [[Frankfurt]].]]\n[[File:La D\u00e9fense from the Arc de Triomphe, Paris 6 March 2015 003.jpg|thumb|[[La D\u00e9fense]], [[Paris]].|222x222px]]\n[[File:Full Milan skyline from Duomo roof.jpg|thumb|[[Porta Nuova (Milan)|Porta Nuova]], [[Milan]].|222x222px]]\n[[File:2020-01-14-Urbanfile-Milano-Porta-Vigentina-Tre-Torri-CityLife-Cantieri-Curvo-1.jpg|thumb|222x222px|[[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]], [[Milan]].]]\n[[File:Warsaw panorama.png|alt=|thumb|[[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].]]\n[[File:Madrid-Azca-Castellana-170913.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\nThis lists ranks skyscrapers in Europe that stand at least {{convert|150|m|ft|0}} tall, based on standard height measurement. Architectural details does not include [[Radio masts and towers|antenna masts]]. The height data is subject to fluctuations due to simple changing of mast extensions. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height. Many non-architectural extensions (such as radio antennas) are easily added and removed from tall buildings without significantly changing the style and design of the building, which is seen as a significant part of the value of these buildings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

It effectively ended, for a brief time, the economic war between France and the British and set up a system to reduce tariffs on goods from either country. It was spurred on in Britain by the [[American Revolution|secession of the thirteen American colonies]], and the publication of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]''. British Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] was heavily influenced by the ideas of Smith, and was one of the key motivators of the treaty. Obstinancy in negotiations on the part of the British made the commercial agreement almost wholly beneficial to the British, and the unequal protection on certain industries ended up hurting the French economy. This treaty is often considered to be one of the grievances of the French people that sparked the [[French Revolution]]. The treaty collapsed in 1793, following claims in the [[National Convention]] that the [[Aliens Act 1793]] breached the terms of the treaty and the outbreak of war in early February between Great Britain and France ended any chance of a compromise.\n\n==Historical Background==\n\n===Mercantilism===\n\nThe series of events leading up to the Eden Agreement of 1786 began in the 16th century when [[Mercantilism]], as it would only become known as in the 18th century when Adam Smith coined the term, became the leading economic policy in Western Europe. Above all other nations, the two leading Mercantilist countries were Britain and France, who followed the guidance of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]. Colbert enforced the policy in 17th century France based on his understanding that \"natural resources are limited, and the power of the nation depends on what portion of the world\u2019s resources it acquires.\"<ref>Tomas, Evan. \"From Mercantilism to Liberalism.\" Introduction to European Economics. : , . . Print. (p. 1)</ref> As a result, Mercantilist policies went hand-in-hand with [[Colonialism]]; colonies provided the mother country with access to resources and raw materials, and, in return, would act as a market for industrial products made in the mother country. Both Britain and France would enact a mercantilist commercial policy that aimed at negating foreign imports (at least through legitimate channels) \"so as to give native manufacturers and farmers a virtual monopoly of the home market.\" <ref>Henderson, W.O. \"The Anglo-French Commercial Treaty of 1786.\" The Economic History Review 10 (1957): 104-112. Print. (p.105)</ref>  Already known as traditional rivals, these stringent mercantilist policies (specifically the high tariffs, and the race to colonize Africa and East Asia) created tense diplomatic relationships between England and France.\n\n===Treaties Prior to 1786===\nThe [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713) had regulated Anglo-French commercial relations prior to the Eden Treaty. The reciprocal trading rights stipulated in the treaty never became operative however, because Great Britain refused to ratify the crucial Articles 8 and 9 of the agreement, and in the wake of the British refusal the French quickly returned to their historic prohibitive policies.\n\nThe policies of mercantilism in Europe were eased slightly by a series of agreements between several nations leading up to the Eden Treaty of 1786. Besides the [[House of Bourbon]] renewing their [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]] in 1761, the French also opened a few colonial ports to foreign trade in the same year. Twelve years later the French government negotiated the [[Franco-Portuguese Agreement of 1773]]. In 1778 France signed the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the fledgling United States, on a reciprocal trading basis, which broke Britain's mercantile [[Navigation Acts]]; they also signed the [[Franco-American Alliance]] for mutual defense to protect it, if war erupted as a result, which it did.\n\nAdditionally, in the years leading up to 1786, vocal economic leaders like Adam Smith and the [[Physiocrats]] promoted a more liberal trade policy in 18th century Britain. Their publications and discussions garnered popularity and created a culture within the country that called for relaxed trade barriers. Although the influence of the people probably had little to no effect on policy-makers, the British government, similarly to its French counterpart, was highly concerned with the lack of national revenue being produced. Both countries urgently sought a remedy; and, out of their urgency, the Eden Agreement of 1786 was agreed upon, effectively softening the stringent mercantile policies of France and Britain.\n\n===Forces Leading to the Agreement===\n\nIn the decade leading up to 1786 the French had lost both their Canadian and Indian colonies, national debt had risen to excessively high levels, and many feared national bankruptcy was imminent. The French therefore believed that if prohibitions were abolished and import duties were reduced then legitimate trade would expand\u2026If French import duties were reduced as the result of a commercial treaty with Britain, a twofold advantage might be secured\u2014more revenue from import duties, and greater opportunities for manufacturers and wine-merchants to sell their products to Britain.<ref>Henderson, (p.106)</ref> Similarly, the British economy was highly inefficient. With a national debt of \u00a3250 million, an extreme black market (only 42% of the tea and 14% of the brandy imported paid the government-issued 119% duties imposed),<ref>Henderson, (p.106)</ref> and the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], William Pitt and the British government were eager to find common ground with their historic rivals in order to secure these \"greater opportunities.\"\n\nThe first discussions took place at the Anglo-French peace conference in January, 1783. Article 18 of these talks stipulated that each country would delegate a commission \u2018to discuss new commercial arrangements of reciprocity.\u2019 Hopeful that the commercial agreement would be the first step towards the process of reconciliation, the French lowered their tariffs in 1784 to levels that were laid out in Articles 8 and 9 of the Utrecht Treaty. Consequently, British exports to France rose drastically, or were at least being traded through legitimate channels as opposed to being smuggled through the black market. In Britain, however, there was no reciprocal reaction to the French liberal policy. At the end of 1784, after the British had refused to meet the new standard of the French, France had no choice but to reinstall their prohibitory pre-1784 tariffs. It was these failures that led William Pitt to appoint William Eden as the lead negotiator of commercial talks with the French in the end of 1785.\n\n==The Eden Agreement==\n\n=== William Eden===\n[[File:William Eden 1. baron Auckland.jpg|right|thumb|[[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was the lead negotiator for the British during the deliberations. The agreement is named after him.]]\n\nPitt selected William Eden because of his work on the board of Trade and Plantations, and because Eden had vast experience dealing with economic grievances in both Ireland and America, which Pitt believed would furnish Eden with exceptional insight into the Anglo-Franco deliberations. Eden went to work immediately, hammering out an agreement with [[Joseph Matthias G\u00e9rard de Rayneval|G\u00e9rard de Rayneval]], his French counterpart, in April 1786. But, in spite of Eden\u2019s optimism, the British, and more specifically Pitt, did not favour Eden and Rayneval\u2019s original agreement because of its vagueness. Pitt sought to enforce higher duties on what he deemed as the most important goods entering the Anglo-Franco trade market.\n\n===The Terms of the Treaty===\n\nDuring the talks, Rayneval demanded three concessions to be made by the British: that the British admit French silks into their markets; that the British reduce English duties on French wine and spirits; and, that the British abolish their preference of Portuguese wines to French. Although the French were not afforded all of their demands, they did receive the following concessions when the treaty was agreed upon on 26 September 1786:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''''Ad Valorem''''' '''Fixed Duties'''\n|-\n| BEER 30%\n|-\n| LEATHER GOODS 15%\n|-\n| GLASS, COTTONS, WOOLENS 12%\n|-\n| HARDWARE, CUTLERY, GAUGES 10%\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''''Specific''''' '''Fixed Duties'''\n|-\n| BRANDY 7<sup>s</sup>  per gallon\n|-\n| CAMBRICS 5<sup>s</sup> per demi-pi\u00e8ce of 7 3/4 yards\n|}\n\nIncluding the significantly reduced duties mentioned above, the treaty also gave each state [[Most-favored nation|most-favoured nation status]] with respect to certain specified goods\u2014French olive oil and British and French millinery\u2014as well as to those commodities not specified in the agreement. Moreover, \"the duties on some products were fixed in relation to certain existing duties. Thus, French wines were to pay no more than Portuguese wines were paying in 1786, while French import duties on Irish linens and British import duties on French linens were not to exceed existing duties on Dutch and Flemish linens.\" <ref>Henderson, (p.109)</ref>\n\n===Response to the Treaty===\n\nThe new treaty was mostly received with support by the British government, and William Eden was rewarded accordingly. British industrialists and merchants of Britain believed that it would create a new age of mutually-advantageous trading between themselves and their French counterparts. For example, the [[Committee of Fustian Manufacturers]] wrote in a resolution passed in Manchester shortly after Eden and Reyneval agreed upon terms, \"We are unanimously of opinion that the commercial treaty will be highly beneficial to the cotton manufacturers of this town.\" <ref>Henderson, (note 5, p.109)</ref>\n\nAlthough the treaty was met cordially by the newer, larger-scale industries, the older, guild-like industries vehemently opposed the treaty. Sometimes, within an industry there were disputed interests regarding the treaty. For instance, the iron industry was divided into two sects: one in support of the treaty, and the other opposed to it. Pig and bar iron manufacturers favoured it because it offered them an opportunity to expand into the French markets. Hardware manufacturers, conversely, feared the treaty would put their expert craftsmanship in jeopardy of being replaced by cheaper, more industrial French goods.\n\nJoint leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]] that governed the House of Commons, [[Charles James Fox]] attacked the treaty during the ratification proceedings. He argued against allying with the French, a traditional enemy that, at that time, continued to strengthen their navy in the Channel. Fox passionately opposed the treaty insinuating that, as long as France was the most powerful country in Europe, Britain must challenge the French in order to maintain balance. And, based on that notion, in no way was strengthening the French economy beneficial for British merchants.<ref>Henderson, (p.109)</ref>\n\nDespite Fox\u2019s impassioned opposition, the treaty was ratified in both Houses largely due to William Pitt\u2019s support for it. Pitt denounced the belief that Britain and France were bound to \"eternal enmity\" and argued that the treaty would alleviate the tensions that had precipitated between the two countries throughout history. The treaty was submitted to the King with a recommendation for approval on 8 March.\n\nThe treaty was not looked upon as favourably in France as it was in England. The French refuted the agreement because of two central complaints; similarly to the English craft industries, the French craft industries feared being replaced by cheaper English-machine made factory goods. Moreover, the French Craft industries had more traction in France than their English counterparts because of the known triumph of British industrial goods over French industrial goods. Second, the French believed their wines were still too highly taxed in comparison to the Portuguese wines. Shortly after the treaty was enforced those French critics were proven right. The opening of the French ports allowed for cheap English textiles and hardware companies to dump their goods into France. The French became skeptical of the British, and it was widely believed that the British were depreciating their imports in order to flood the French markets.<ref>Henderson, (p.110)</ref>\n\n===Effects of the Treaty===\n\nIn 1787, shortly after the treaty was enforced, there were reports of incendiary, violent actions taken in Abbeville, Normandy, and Bordeaux by cotton and wool manufacturers. Contemporary French critics of the Eden Treaty accredit the agreement with providing two detriments to the French economy. First, it led to an unprecedented expansion of British manufactured goods consumed in France, and \"this flooding of the French market caused a commercial crisis which aggravated commercial distress and helped to bring about the Revolution.\" <ref>Henderson, (p. 110)</ref>  Whether this is true is still often disputed; although it is true that British exports increased by nearly 100% from 1787-1792, it is impossible to know what percentage of that increase should be accounted to the transfer of goods traded in the black market to legitimate channels. Secondly, the French commercial crisis is known to have started prior to 1786. And, though it is plausible that the treaty (via a dramatic influx of British goods) impeded improving economic circumstances in 1787 France, it is objectionable to hold the Eden Treaty responsible for the economic downturn which led to the French Revolution. Furthermore, the French criticisms regarding the insatiably high duties on French wine are less grounded because of the clarity with which the treaty laid out the policy towards wine imported into Britain\u2014that they were to pay no more than the existing duty on Portuguese wine, and Britain reserved the right to continue to give a preference to Portuguese.<ref>Henderson, (p. 111)</ref>\n\nA memorandum issued by the [[Normandy Chamber of Commerce]], which gained popularity throughout France, was highly critical of the treaty citing several advantages the British enjoyed over the French as an industrial economy \u2018\u2019because of the treaty\u2019\u2019. The memorandum argued that Britain\u2019s availability of capital and credit, large supplies of cheap coal, high quality native wools, large-scale methods of production, and abundance of efficient, power-driven machinery, were all provided by the treaty.<ref>S\u00e9e, Henri. \"The Normandy Chamber Of Commerce And The Commercial Treaty Of 1786.\" The Economic History Review 2 (1930): 308-313. Print (p.308)</ref>  Though not entirely wrong, the memorandum fails to recognize that the British also had the advantages of having the highest wages relative to the price of coal, high wages relative to capital prices, high silver wages which created higher living standards, and an advantageous exchange rate<ref>Allen, R. C.. \"Why The Industrial Revolution Was British: Commerce, Induced Invention, And The Scientific Revolution.\" The Economic History Review 2 (): 357-384. Print. (p. 357)</ref> \u2014none of which were granted by the treaty nor at the expense of the French economy.\n\nAlso, some contemporary French critics consider the effects of the Treaty as one of the main causes of the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e]]. For example, the production of the textile industry in [[Cholet]] collapsed between 1789 and 1791 apparently because of the import in France of little expensive British textile products.

It effectively ended, for a brief time, the economic war between France and the British and set up a system to reduce tariffs on goods from either country. It was spurred on in Britain by the [[American Revolution|secession of the thirteen American colonies]], and the publication of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]''. British Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] was heavily influenced by the ideas of Smith, and was one of the key motivators of the treaty. Obstinancy in negotiations on the part of the British made the commercial agreement almost wholly beneficial to the British, and the unequal protection on certain industries ended up hurting the French economy. This treaty is often considered to be one of the grievances of the French people that sparked the [[French Revolution]]. The treaty collapsed in 1793, following claims in the [[National Convention]] that the [[Aliens Act 1793]] breached the terms of the treaty and the outbreak of war in early February between Great Britain and France ended any chance of a compromise.\n\n==Historical Background==\n\n===Mercantilism===\n\nThe series of events leading up to the Eden Agreement of 1786 began in the 16th century when [[Mercantilism]], as it would only become known as in the 18th century when Adam Smith coined the term, became the leading economic policy in Western Europe. Above all other nations, the two leading Mercantilist countries were Britain and France, who followed the guidance of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]. Colbert enforced the policy in 17th century France based on his understanding that \"natural resources are limited, and the power of the nation depends on what portion of the world\u2019s resources it acquires.\"<ref>Tomas, Evan. \"From Mercantilism to Liberalism.\" Introduction to European Economics. : , . . Print. (p. 1)</ref> As a result, Mercantilist policies went hand-in-hand with [[Colonialism]]; colonies provided the mother country with access to resources and raw materials, and, in return, would act as a market for industrial products made in the mother country. Both Britain and France would enact a mercantilist commercial policy that aimed at negating foreign imports (at least through legitimate channels) \"so as to give native manufacturers and farmers a virtual monopoly of the home market.\" <ref>Henderson, W.O. \"The Anglo-French Commercial Treaty of 1786.\" The Economic History Review 10 (1957): 104-112. Print. (p.105)</ref>  Already known as traditional rivals, these stringent mercantilist policies (specifically the high tariffs, and the race to colonize Africa and East Asia) created tense diplomatic relationships between England and France.\n\n===Treaties Prior to 1786===\nThe [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713) had regulated Anglo-French commercial relations prior to the Eden Treaty. The reciprocal trading rights stipulated in the treaty never became operative however, because Great Britain refused to ratify the crucial Articles 8 and 9 of the agreement, and in the wake of the British refusal the French quickly returned to their historic prohibitive policies.\n\nThe policies of mercantilism in Europe were eased slightly by a series of agreements between several nations leading up to the Eden Treaty of 1786. Besides the [[House of Bourbon]] renewing their [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]] in 1761, the French also opened a few colonial ports to foreign trade in the same year. Twelve years later the French government negotiated the [[Franco-Portuguese Agreement of 1773]]. In 1778 France signed the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the fledgling United States, on a reciprocal trading basis, which broke Britain's mercantile [[Navigation Acts]]; they also signed the [[Franco-American Alliance]] for mutual defense to protect it, if war erupted as a result, which it did.\n\nAdditionally, in the years leading up to 1786, vocal economic leaders like Adam Smith and the [[Physiocrats]] promoted a more liberal trade policy in 18th century Britain. Their publications and discussions garnered popularity and created a culture within the country that called for relaxed trade barriers. Although the influence of the people probably had little to no effect on policy-makers, the British government, similarly to its French counterpart, was highly concerned with the lack of national revenue being produced. Both countries urgently sought a remedy; and, out of their urgency, the Eden Agreement of 1786 was agreed upon, effectively softening the stringent mercantile policies of France and Britain.\n\n===Forces Leading to the Agreement===\n\nIn the decade leading up to 1786 the French had lost both their Canadian and Indian colonies, national debt had risen to excessively high levels, and many feared national bankruptcy was imminent. The French therefore believed that if prohibitions were abolished and import duties were reduced then legitimate trade would expand\u2026If French import duties were reduced as the result of a commercial treaty with Britain, a twofold advantage might be secured\u2014more revenue from import duties, and greater opportunities for manufacturers and wine-merchants to sell their products to Britain.<ref>Henderson, (p.106)</ref> Similarly, the British economy was highly inefficient. With a national debt of \u00a3250 million, an extreme black market (only 42% of the tea and 14% of the brandy imported paid the government-issued 119% duties imposed),<ref>Henderson, (p.106)</ref> and the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], William Pitt and the British government were eager to find common ground with their historic rivals in order to secure these \"greater opportunities.\"\n\nThe first discussions took place at the Anglo-French peace conference in January, 1783. Article 18 of these talks stipulated that each country would delegate a commission \u2018to discuss new commercial arrangements of reciprocity.\u2019 Hopeful that the commercial agreement would be the first step towards the process of reconciliation, the French lowered their tariffs in 1784 to levels that were laid out in Articles 8 and 9 of the Utrecht Treaty. Consequently, British exports to France rose drastically, or were at least being traded through legitimate channels as opposed to being smuggled through the black market. In Britain, however, there was no reciprocal reaction to the French liberal policy. At the end of 1784, after the British had refused to meet the new standard of the French, France had no choice but to reinstall their prohibitory pre-1784 tariffs. It was these failures that led William Pitt to appoint William Eden as the lead negotiator of commercial talks with the French in the end of 1785.\n\n==The Eden Agreement==\n\n=== William Eden===\n[[File:William Eden 1. baron Auckland.jpg|right|thumb|[[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was the lead negotiator for the British during the deliberations. The agreement is named after him.]]\n\nPitt selected William Eden because of his work on the board of Trade and Plantations, and because Eden had vast experience dealing with economic grievances in both Ireland and America, which Pitt believed would furnish Eden with exceptional insight into the Anglo-Franco deliberations. Eden went to work immediately, hammering out an agreement with [[Joseph Matthias G\u00e9rard de Rayneval|G\u00e9rard de Rayneval]], his French counterpart, in April 1786. But, in spite of Eden\u2019s optimism, the British, and more specifically Pitt, did not favor Eden and Rayneval\u2019s original agreement because of its vagueness. Pitt sought to enforce higher duties on what he deemed as the most important goods entering the Anglo-Franco trade market.\n\n===The Terms of the Treaty===\n\nDuring the talks, Rayneval demanded three concessions to be made by the British: that the British admit French silks into their markets; that the British reduce English duties on French wine and spirits; and, that the British abolish their preference of Portuguese wines to French. Although the French were not afforded all of their demands, they did receive the following concessions when the treaty was agreed upon on 26 September 1786:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''''Ad Valorem''''' '''Fixed Duties'''\n|-\n| BEER 30%\n|-\n| LEATHER GOODS 15%\n|-\n| GLASS, COTTONS, WOOLENS 12%\n|-\n| HARDWARE, CUTLERY, GAUGES 10%\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''''Specific''''' '''Fixed Duties'''\n|-\n| BRANDY 7<sup>s</sup>  per gallon\n|-\n| CAMBRICS 5<sup>s</sup> per demi-pi\u00e8ce of 7 3/4 yards\n|}\n\nIncluding the significantly reduced duties mentioned above, the treaty also gave each state [[Most-favored nation|most-favored nation status]] with respect to certain specified goods\u2014French olive oil and British and French millinery\u2014as well as to those commodities not specified in the agreement. Moreover, \"the duties on some products were fixed in relation to certain existing duties. Thus, French wines were to pay no more than Portuguese wines were paying in 1786, while French import duties on Irish linens and British import duties on French linens were not to exceed existing duties on Dutch and Flemish linens.\" <ref>Henderson, (p.109)</ref>\n\n===Response to the Treaty===\n\nThe new treaty was mostly received with support by the British government, and William Eden was rewarded accordingly. British industrialists and merchants of Britain believed that it would create a new age of mutually-advantageous trading between themselves and their French counterparts. For example, the [[Committee of Fustian Manufacturers]] wrote in a resolution passed in Manchester shortly after Eden and Reyneval agreed upon terms, \"We are unanimously of opinion that the commercial treaty will be highly beneficial to the cotton manufacturers of this town.\" <ref>Henderson, (note 5, p.109)</ref>\n\nAlthough the treaty was met cordially by the newer, larger-scale industries, the older, guild-like industries vehemently opposed the treaty. Sometimes, within an industry there were disputed interests regarding the treaty. For instance, the iron industry was divided into two sects: one in support of the treaty, and the other opposed to it. Pig and bar iron manufacturers favored it because it offered them an opportunity to expand into the French markets. Hardware manufacturers, conversely, feared the treaty would put their expert craftsmanship in jeopardy of being replaced by cheaper, more industrial French goods.\n\nJoint leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]] that governed the House of Commons, [[Charles James Fox]] attacked the treaty during the ratification proceedings. He argued against allying with the French, a traditional enemy that, at that time, continued to strengthen their navy in the Channel. Fox passionately opposed the treaty insinuating that, as long as France was the most powerful country in Europe, Britain must challenge the French in order to maintain balance. And, based on that notion, in no way was strengthening the French economy beneficial for British merchants.<ref>Henderson, (p.109)</ref>\n\nDespite Fox\u2019s impassioned opposition, the treaty was ratified in both Houses largely due to William Pitt\u2019s support for it. Pitt denounced the belief that Britain and France were bound to \"eternal enmity\" and argued that the treaty would alleviate the tensions that had precipitated between the two countries throughout history. The treaty was submitted to the King with a recommendation for approval on 8 March.\n\nThe treaty was not looked upon as favorably in France as it was in England. The French refuted the agreement because of two central complaints; similarly to the English craft industries, the French craft industries feared being replaced by cheaper English-machine made factory goods. Moreover, the French Craft industries had more traction in France than their English counterparts because of the known triumph of British industrial goods over French industrial goods. Second, the French believed their wines were still too highly taxed in comparison to the Portuguese wines. Shortly after the treaty was enforced those French critics were proven right. The opening of the French ports allowed for cheap English textiles and hardware companies to dump their goods into France. The French became skeptical of the British, and it was widely believed that the British were depreciating their imports in order to flood the French markets.<ref>Henderson, (p.110)</ref>\n\n===Effects of the Treaty===\n\nIn 1787, shortly after the treaty was enforced, there were reports of incendiary, violent actions taken in Abbeville, Normandy, and Bordeaux by cotton and wool manufacturers. Contemporary French critics of the Eden Treaty accredit the agreement with providing two detriments to the French economy. First, it led to an unprecedented expansion of British manufactured goods consumed in France, and \"this flooding of the French market caused a commercial crisis which aggravated commercial distress and helped to bring about the Revolution.\" <ref>Henderson, (p. 110)</ref>  Whether this is true is still often disputed; although it is true that British exports increased by nearly 100% from 1787-1792, it is impossible to know what percentage of that increase should be accounted to the transfer of goods traded in the black market to legitimate channels. Secondly, the French commercial crisis is known to have started prior to 1786. And, though it is plausible that the treaty (via a dramatic influx of British goods) impeded improving economic circumstances in 1787 France, it is objectionable to hold the Eden Treaty responsible for the economic downturn which led to the French Revolution. Furthermore, the French criticisms regarding the insatiably high duties on French wine are less grounded because of the clarity with which the treaty laid out the policy towards wine imported into Britain\u2014that they were to pay no more than the existing duty on Portuguese wine, and Britain reserved the right to continue to give a preference to Portuguese.<ref>Henderson, (p. 111)</ref>\n\nA memorandum issued by the [[Normandy Chamber of Commerce]], which gained popularity throughout France, was highly critical of the treaty citing several advantages the British enjoyed over the French as an industrial economy \u2018\u2019because of the treaty\u2019\u2019. The memorandum argued that Britain\u2019s availability of capital and credit, large supplies of cheap coal, high quality native wools, large-scale methods of production, and abundance of efficient, power-driven machinery, were all provided by the treaty.<ref>S\u00e9e, Henri. \"The Normandy Chamber Of Commerce And The Commercial Treaty Of 1786.\" The Economic History Review 2 (1930): 308-313. Print (p.308)</ref>  Though not entirely wrong, the memorandum fails to recognize that the British also had the advantages of having the highest wages relative to the price of coal, high wages relative to capital prices, high silver wages which created higher living standards, and an advantageous exchange rate<ref>Allen, R. C.. \"Why The Industrial Revolution Was British: Commerce, Induced Invention, And The Scientific Revolution.\" The Economic History Review 2 (): 357-384. Print. (p. 357)</ref> \u2014none of which were granted by the treaty nor at the expense of the French economy.\n\nAlso, some contemporary French critics consider the effects of the Treaty as one of the main causes of the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e]]. For example, the production of the textile industry in [[Cholet]] collapsed between 1789 and 1791 apparently because of the import in France of little expensive British textile products. As a consequence, poverty and unemployment increased much in the Cholet district. Thus, the dissatisfied weavers apparently became a political threat for the french government.<ref>Chambiron, Christian. \"Cholet et ses habitants \u2018\u2019Au temps de la Grand'Guerre\u2019\u2019 1793-1795.\"(p.20-21)</ref>\n\n===Decline of the Treaty===\n\nThe commercial treaty between France and Britain merely lasted five and a half years. The French harvest failed in 1788-89 and following the outbreak of the French Revolution, the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' collapsed and with it the Eden Treaty.\n\nAlthough the treaty was short-lived, it still has significance in economic history as it marks the end of an important phase of commercial relations between England and France, and, moreover, Europe.<ref>Rose, J.

The B.E. degree course was introduced during 1935\u201336 with the first batch obtaining the degree from Calcutta University in 1936. The inception of the Mechanical Engineering Department may be traced back to 1921 when a diploma course in Mechanical Engineering was started in this Institute. The first-degree course in Mechanical Engineering started in July 1930. The Department of Metallurgy started its journey at the Bengal Engineering College in the year 1939 with the introduction of a three-year degree course in Metallurgy under Calcutta University. The department is the second oldest metallurgy department in the country.\n\n=== Post-independence period ===\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the Department of Architecture, Town and Regional Planning was started on the recommendation of a committee appointed by Government of West Bengal. Two new courses were started at the same time \u2013 one with a five-year degree programme in Architecture another with a two-year part-time diploma programme in Town & Regional Planning. The Department of Architecture, Town and Regional Planning (established in 1949) that offered the First Degree in Architecture and the First Diploma in Town Planning in INDIA. This department has produced more than 800 graduates in Architecture and more than 300 postgraduates in Town Planning in the last fifty years. Its students also founded the [[National Association of Students of Architecture]], briefly designated as NASA India, a non-political, non-profit Student Body Association for the Undergraduate Students of Architecture in India in 1957, with six other colleges.\n\nWith the end of the Second World War, a 'Committee for the Development of Higher Engineering and Technical Education in Bengal' under the Chairmanship of the Director of Public Instruction recommended two plans \u2013 one 'Immediate' and the other 'Five Year Plan' for the college. The college celebrated its gala centenary function inaugurated by Dr B.C. Roy on 25 December 1956, and the concluding session was attended by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 14 January 1957. The Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering started functioning as a separate discipline of engineering in July 1968.\n\nThe college started its first Computer Centre in 1976 and a Microprocessor Laboratory in 1979. The 125th Anniversary of the college was celebrated on 11 December 1981, with the inauguration by Sri N. Sanjiva Reddy, the then President of India. The Department of Computer Science and Technology was established in 1982. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate engineering courses.

After independence, [[Bidhan Chandra Roy|Dr. B. C. Roy]], the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, revamped the department to satisfy the demand for mining professionals, and the Department of Mining & Geology was reborn in 1956. On 12 February 1920, the name was changed to '''Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur'''. The word Shibpur was deleted on 24 March 1921 and it became '''Bengal Engineering College'''.<ref name=\"TheUniversity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.becs.ac.in/ |title=Bengal Engineering And Science University, Shibpur \u2013 The University |work=becs.ac.in |accessdate=20 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207114639/http://www.becs.ac.in/ |archivedate=7 February 2012  }}</ref> The Department of Electrical Engineering came into existence as a separate department from 1912. The B.E. degree course was introduced during 1935\u201336 with the first batch obtaining the degree from Calcutta University in 1936. The inception of the Mechanical Engineering Department may be traced back to 1921 when a diploma course in Mechanical Engineering was started in this Institute. The first-degree course in Mechanical Engineering started in July 1930. The Department of Metallurgy started its journey at the Bengal Engineering College in the year 1939 with the introduction of a three-year degree course in Metallurgy under Calcutta University. The department is the second oldest metallurgy department in the country.\n\n=== Post-independence period ===\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the Department of Architecture, Town and Regional Planning was started on the recommendation of a committee appointed by Government of West Bengal. Two new courses were started at the same time \u2013 one with a five-year degree programme in Architecture another with a two-year part-time diploma programme in Town & Regional Planning. The Department of Architecture, Town and Regional Planning (established in 1949) that offered the First Degree in Architecture and the First Diploma in Town Planning in INDIA. This department has produced more than 800 graduates in Architecture and more than 300 postgraduates in Town Planning in the last fifty years. Its students also founded the [[National Association of Students of Architecture]], briefly designated as NASA India, a non-political, non-profit Student Body Association for the Undergraduate Students of Architecture in India in 1957, with six other colleges.\n\nWith the end of the Second World War, a 'Committee for the Development of Higher Engineering and Technical Education in Bengal' under the Chairmanship of the Director of Public Instruction recommended two plans \u2013 one 'Immediate' and the other 'Five Year Plan' for the college. The college celebrated its gala centenary function inaugurated by Dr B.C. Roy on 25 December 1956, and the concluding session was attended by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 14 January 1957. The Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering started functioning as a separate discipline of engineering in July 1968.\n\nThe college started its first Computer Centre in 1976 and a Microprocessor Laboratory in 1979. The 125th Anniversary of the college was celebrated on 11 December 1981, with the inauguration by Sri N. Sanjiva Reddy, the then President of India. The Department of Computer Science and Technology was established in 1982. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate engineering courses. The formal inauguration was done on 13 March 1993, by the then [[President of India]], [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]].\n<ref name=TheUniversity/> School of Management Sciences (SMOS) and School of Information Technology were established in 1998 and 2000 respectively. It is the second youngest of the ten engineering departments in BESU. The School of Material Science and Engineering (2001), School of Community Science and Technology (2002) were introduced.

{"title_page": "Camera obscura", "text_new": "]]\", although this more often refers to simple (home-made) lens-less cameras in which photographic film or photographic paper is used.\n\n==Physical explanation==\nRays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lit objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a screen only lets through rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, and these rays form an image of that scene when they are collected on a surface opposite from the opening.\n\nThe [[human eye]] (as well as those of other animals including birds, fish, reptiles etc.) works much like a camera obscura with an opening ([[pupil]]), a biconvex [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and a surface where the image is formed ([[retina]]).\n\n==Technology==\n[[Image:Camera obscura box.jpg|left|thumb|A diagram of a camera obscura with an upright projected image at the top.]]\nA camera obscura device consists of a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted, (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] preserved.\n\nIn order to produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less.\n\nAs the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the projected image becomes dimmer. With too small a pinhole, however, the sharpness worsens, due to [[diffraction]].\n\nIn practice, camera obscuras use a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] rather than a pinhole (as in a [[pinhole camera]]) because it allows a larger [[F-number|aperture]], giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.\n\nIf the image is caught on a semi-transparent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down).\n\nUsing mirrors it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be diverted onto a horizontal surface (e.g., a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent .\n\nThe box-type camera obscura often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto [[tracing paper]] placed on the glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is now reversed by the mirror.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory to 500 BCE: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomons===\nThere are theories that occurrences of camera obscura effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/paleolithic/ |title=Paleolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\nIt is also suggested that camera obscura projections could have played a role in [[Neolithic]] structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/neolithic/ |title=Neolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jennifer Ouellette |url=https://gizmodo.com/did-prehistoric-people-watch-the-stars-through-this-6-0-1782759791 |title=deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 |website=Gizmodo |date=29 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Osservazione del solstizio 21.06.12, fi, 20.JPG|thumb|The gnomon projection on the floor of [[Florence Cathedral]] during the solstice on 21 June 2012]]\nPerforated [[gnomon]]s projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] writings (1046 BCE\u2013256 BCE with material added until circa 220 CE).<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CyssAQAAIAAJ&q=%22pierced+gnomon%22&dq=%22pierced+gnomon%22|title=The Asiatic Review|year=1969|last1=Boulger|first1=Demetrius Charles}}</ref> The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year.

These writings explain how the image in a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\"<ref group=\"note\">In the ''Mozi'' passage, a camera obscura is described as a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\" ([[wikt:\u5eab|\u5eab]]); the 18th-century scholar Bi Yuan ([[:zh:\u7562\u6c85|\u7562\u6c85]]) suggested this was a misprint for \"screen\" ([[wikt:\u3893|\u3893]]).</ref> is inverted by an intersecting point (a pinhole) that collects the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person would partly be hidden below (i.e., strike below the pinhole) and partly form the top part of the image. Rays from the head would partly be hidden above (i.e., strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image.

Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?\"}}\n\nMany philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder this question before it became accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in this \"problem\" were actually pinhole image projections of the sun. Although a projected image will have the shape of the aperture when the light source, aperture and projection plane are close together, the projected image will have the shape of the light source when they are further apart.\n\nIn his book ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' (circa 300 BCE, surviving in later manuscripts from around 1000 CE), Euclid proposed mathematical descriptions of vision with \"lines drawn directly from the eye pass through a space of great extent\" and \"the form of the space included in our vision is a cone, with its apex in the eye and its base at the limits of our vision.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf|title=Optics of Euclid}}</ref> Later versions of the text, like [[Ignazio Danti]]'s 1573 annotated translation, would add a description of the camera obscura principle to demonstrate Euclid's ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnerweb.de/bilder/pinhole/sonnentaler/sonnentaler.htm|language=german|title=Kleine Geschichte der Lochkamera oder Camera Obscura}}</ref>\n\n===500 to 1000: Earliest experiments, study of light===\n[[File:555 anthemius of tralles - light-diagram.jpg|thumb|Anthemius of Tralles' diagram of light-rays reflected with plane mirror through hole (B)]]\nIn the 6th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-Greek]] mathematician and architect [[Anthemius of Tralles]] (most famous as a co-architect of the [[Hagia Sophia]]), experimented with effects related to the camera obscura.<ref name=\"Crombie1990\">G.

A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet [[Jean Loret]]. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. The performance was silent and Loret was surprised that all the movements made no sound. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this was a camera obscura show, rather than a very early magic lantern show, especially in the upside-down image and the energetic movements.<ref>http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/new-magic-lantern-journal/pdfs/4008787a.pdf</ref>\n\nGerman Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]] heard from a traveler about a small camera obscura device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box camera obscura, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 ''Magia universalis natur\u00e6 et artis'' (volume 1 \u2013 book 4 \"Magia Optica\" pages 199\u2013201).\n\nBy 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was introduced and partly replaced the camera obscura as a projection device, while the camera obscura mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be seen as a development of the (box-type) camera obscura device.\n\nThe 17th century [[Dutch Masters]], such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], were known for their magnificent attention to detail.

The surroundings of the projected image have to be relatively dark for the image to be clear, so many historical camera obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms.\n\nThe term \"camera obscura\" also refers to constructions or devices that make use of the principle within a box, tent, or room. Camera obscuras with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as an aid for drawing and painting. The camera obscura box was developed further into the [[Camera|photographic camera]] in the first half of the 19th century when camera obscura boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.\n\nThe camera obscura was used as a means to study eclipses without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking into the sun directly. As a drawing aid, the camera obscura allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve a proper [[graphical perspective]].\n\nBefore the term \"camera obscura\" was first used in 1604, many others are attested: \"cubiculum obscurum\", \"cubiculum tenebricosum\", \"conclave obscurum\" and \"locus obscurus\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Optic projection, principles, installation, and use of the magic lantern, projection microscope, reflecting lantern, moving picture machine|publisher=Comstock Publishing Company|year=1914|last=Phelps Gage|first=Henry|url=https://archive.org/details/opticprojection01gagegoog|quote=obscurum cubiculum.}}</ref>\n\nA camera obscura device without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a \"[[pinhole camera]]\", although this more often refers to simple (home-made) lens-less cameras in which photographic film or photographic paper is used.\n\n==Physical explanation==\nRays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lit objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a screen only lets through rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, and these rays form an image of that scene when they are collected on a surface opposite from the opening.\n\nThe [[human eye]] (as well as those of other animals including birds, fish, reptiles etc.) works much like a camera obscura with an opening ([[pupil]]), a biconvex [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and a surface where the image is formed ([[retina]]).\n\n==Technology==\n[[Image:Camera obscura box.jpg|left|thumb|A diagram of a camera obscura with an upright projected image at the top.]]\nA camera obscura device consists of a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted, (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] preserved.\n\nIn order to produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less.\n\nAs the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the projected image becomes dimmer. With too small a pinhole, however, the sharpness worsens, due to [[diffraction]].\n\nIn practice, camera obscuras use a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] rather than a pinhole (as in a [[pinhole camera]]) because it allows a larger [[F-number|aperture]], giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.\n\nIf the image is caught on a semi-transparent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down).\n\nUsing mirrors it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be diverted onto a horizontal surface (e.g., a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent .\n\nThe box-type camera obscura often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto [[tracing paper]] placed on the glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is now reversed by the mirror.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory to 500 BCE: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomons===\nThere are theories that occurrences of camera obscura effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/paleolithic/ |title=Paleolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\nIt is also suggested that camera obscura projections could have played a role in [[Neolithic]] structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/neolithic/ |title=Neolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jennifer Ouellette |url=https://gizmodo.com/did-prehistoric-people-watch-the-stars-through-this-6-0-1782759791 |title=deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 |website=Gizmodo |date=29 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Osservazione del solstizio 21.06.12, fi, 20.JPG|thumb|The gnomon projection on the floor of [[Florence Cathedral]] during the solstice on 21 June 2012]]\nPerforated [[gnomon]]s projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] writings (1046 BCE\u2013256 BCE with material added until circa 220 CE).<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CyssAQAAIAAJ&q=%22pierced+gnomon%22&dq=%22pierced+gnomon%22|title=The Asiatic Review|year=1969|last1=Boulger|first1=Demetrius Charles}}</ref> The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year.

These writings explain how the image in a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\"<ref group=\"note\">In the ''Mozi'' passage, a camera obscura is described as a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\" ([[wikt:\u5eab|\u5eab]]); the 18th-century scholar Bi Yuan ([[:zh:\u7562\u6c85|\u7562\u6c85]]) suggested this was a misprint for \"screen\" ([[wikt:\u3893|\u3893]]).</ref> is inverted by an intersecting point (a pinhole) that collects the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person would partly be hidden below (i.e., strike below the pinhole) and partly form the top part of the image. Rays from the head would partly be hidden above (i.e., strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image. This is a remarkably early correct description of the camera obscura; there are no other examples known that are dated before the 11th century.<ref name=needham4/>\n\nThe Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BCE), or possibly a follower of his ideas, touched upon the subject in the work ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]] \u2013 Book XV'', asking: {{quote|Why is it that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular?|sign=|source=}} and further on: {{quote|\"Why is it that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?\"}}\n\nMany philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder this question before it became accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in this \"problem\" were actually pinhole image projections of the sun. Although a projected image will have the shape of the aperture when the light source, aperture and projection plane are close together, the projected image will have the shape of the light source when they are further apart.\n\nIn his book ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' (circa 300 BCE, surviving in later manuscripts from around 1000 CE), Euclid proposed mathematical descriptions of vision with \"lines drawn directly from the eye pass through a space of great extent\" and \"the form of the space included in our vision is a cone, with its apex in the eye and its base at the limits of our vision.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf|title=Optics of Euclid}}</ref> Later versions of the text, like [[Ignazio Danti]]'s 1573 annotated translation, would add a description of the camera obscura principle to demonstrate Euclid's ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnerweb.de/bilder/pinhole/sonnentaler/sonnentaler.htm|language=german|title=Kleine Geschichte der Lochkamera oder Camera Obscura}}</ref>\n\n===500 to 1000: Earliest experiments, study of light===\n[[File:555 anthemius of tralles - light-diagram.jpg|thumb|Anthemius of Tralles' diagram of light-rays reflected with plane mirror through hole (B)]]\nIn the 6th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-Greek]] mathematician and architect [[Anthemius of Tralles]] (most famous as a co-architect of the [[Hagia Sophia]]), experimented with effects related to the camera obscura.<ref name=\"Crombie1990\">G.

Such a mirror has a concave surface, and reflects a finger to give an upright image if the object is very near, but if the finger moves farther and farther away it reaches a point where the image disappears and after that the image appears inverted. Thus the point where the image disappears is like the pinhole of the window. So also the oar is fixed at the rowlock somewhere at its middle part, constituting, when it is moved, a sort of 'waist' and the handle of the oar is always in the position inverse to the end (which is in the water).\"}}\n\nShen Kuo also responded to a statement of [[Duan Chengshi]] in ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' written in about 840 that the inverted image of a [[Chinese pagoda]] tower beside a seashore, was inverted because it was reflected by the sea: \"This is nonsense.

This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF).<ref>{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Schwenter|year=1636|page=255|language=German|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EWM_AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en_GB&pg=GBS.PA255|title=Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae}}</ref> This [[universal joint]] mechanism was later called a [[scioptric ball]].\n\nIn his 1637 book ''Dioptrique'' French philosopher, mathematician and scientist [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] suggested placing an eye of a recently dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the eye of an ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSUUONfamiEC&pg=PA36|title=Theatre and Performance Design: A Reader in Scenographyy|last=Collins|first=Jane|year=2012|first2=Andrew|last2=Nisbet|isbn=9781136344527}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1642 Mario Bettini - Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematica.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a twelve-hole camera obscura from Bettini's ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae\" (1642)]]\nItalian Jesuit philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer [[Mario Bettinus|Mario Bettini]] wrote about making a camera obscura with twelve holes in his ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae'' (1642). When a foot soldier would stand in front of the camera, a twelve-person army of soldiers making the same movements would be projected.\n\nFrench mathematician, [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], and painter of [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic art]] [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Niceron|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Nic\u00e9ron]] (1613\u20131646) wrote about the camera obscura with convex lenses. He explained how the camera obscura could be used by painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the camera obscura to fool witless spectators and make them believe that the projections were magic or occult science. These writings were published in a posthumous version of ''La Perspective Curieuse'' (1652).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7xMOAAAAQAAJ|title=La Perspective curieuse|publisher=Chez la veufue F.

A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet [[Jean Loret]]. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. The performance was silent and Loret was surprised that all the movements made no sound. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this was a camera obscura show, rather than a very early magic lantern show, especially in the upside-down image and the energetic movements.<ref>http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/new-magic-lantern-journal/pdfs/4008787a.pdf</ref>\n\nGerman Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]] heard from a traveler about a small camera obscura device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box camera obscura, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 ''Magia universalis natur\u00e6 et artis'' (volume 1 \u2013 book 4 \"Magia Optica\" pages 199\u2013201).\n\nBy 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was introduced and partly replaced the camera obscura as a projection device, while the camera obscura mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be seen as a development of the (box-type) camera obscura device.\n\nThe 17th century [[Dutch Masters]], such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], were known for their magnificent attention to detail. It has been widely speculated that they made use of the camera obscura,<ref name=\":0\" /> but the extent of their use by artists at this period remains a matter of fierce contention, recently revived by the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]].<ref name=Snyder/>\n\n[[File:1676 Johann Sturm - Camerae Obscurae Portatilis.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a portable camera obscura device from Johann Sturm's ''Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum'' (1676)]]\nGerman philosopher [[Johann Sturm]] published an illustrated article about the construction of a portable camera obscura box with a 45\u00b0 mirror and an oiled paper screen in his book ''Collegium experimentale: sive curiosum'' (1676).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbMWAAAAQAAJ|title=Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum|first=Johann|last=Sturm|year=1676|language=Latin|pages=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n\n[[Johann Zahn]]'s ''Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium'', published in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches of both the camera obscura and the [[magic lantern]].

It was a cone-shaped box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user.<ref>Wenczel, pg. 15</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the 18th century, craftsmen and opticians would make camera obscura devices in the shape of books, which were much appreciated by lovers of optical devices.<ref name=Mannoni1 />\n\nOne chapter in the Conte [[Francesco Algarotti|Algarotti's]] ''Saggio sopra Pittura'' (1764) is dedicated to the use of a camera ottica (\"optic chamber\") in painting.<ref>{{cite book | first= Francesco| last= Algarotti | year=1764 | title= ''Saggio sopra la pittura'' | editor= Presso Marco Coltellini, Livorno| pages= 59\u201363 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=SNY9AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, following developments by [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Robert Hooke]], more easily portable models in boxes became available. These were extensively used by amateur artists while on their travels, but they were also employed by professionals, including [[Paul Sandby]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], whose camera (disguised as a book) is now in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum in London]]. Such cameras were later adapted by [[Joseph Nicephore Niepce]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] for creating the first photographs.\n{{Clear}}\n\n[[Image:Camera obscura.jpg|upright|thumb|Camera obscura in [[Encyclop\u00e9die|''Encyclop\u00e9die, ou dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers'']]. 18th century]]\n\n==Role in the modern age==\n[[File:Camerae-obscurae.jpg|thumb|1840\u20131841 Camera obscura|Cameras obscura for [[Daguerreotype]] called \"Grand Photographe\" produced by [[Charles Chevalier]] ([[Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]]).]]\nWhile the technical principles of the camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of the technical concept in producing images with a [[linear perspective]] in paintings, maps, theatre setups, and architectural, and, later, photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution.
