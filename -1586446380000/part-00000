It covers an area about 2.6 [[arcminute]]s on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in [[Angular diameter|angular size]] to a [[tennis ball]] at a distance of 100&nbsp;meters.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Big Questions The Universe |first1=Stuart |last1=Clark |publisher=Hachette UK |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84916-609-6 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVhBQAAQBAJ}}</ref> The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] over ten consecutive days between December 18 and 28, 1995.<ref name=\"Ferguson1998\" /><ref name=\"Hubble_image\" />\n\nThe field is so small that only a few foreground [[star]]s in the [[Milky Way]] lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are [[galaxy|galaxies]], some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the [[physical cosmology|study of the early universe]].\n\nThree years after the HDF observations were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the [[Hubble Deep Field South]]. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the [[universe]] is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the [[cosmological principle]]). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]]. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]] (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive [[astronomy|astronomical]] image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the [[Hubble eXtreme Deep Field]] (XDF) was released in 2012.\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:Improvement in Hubble images after SMM1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The dramatic improvement in Hubble's imaging capabilities after corrective [[optics]] were installed encouraged attempts to obtain very deep images of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]].]]\n\nOne of the key aims of the astronomers who designed the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high [[optical resolution]] to study distant galaxies to a level of detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the [[atmosphere]], Hubble avoids atmospheric [[airglow]] allowing it to take more sensitive [[Visible light|visible]] and [[ultraviolet light]] images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good [[adaptive optics]] correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10&nbsp;m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from [[spherical aberration]] when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because [[Speed of light|light takes billions of years]] to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows a better understanding of how they evolve.<ref name=Ferguson1998>Ferguson et al. (1999), p.84</ref>\n\nAfter the spherical aberration was corrected during [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-61]] in 1993,<ref name=\"Trauger1994\">Trauger et al. (1994)</ref> the improved imaging capabilities of the telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The [[Hubble Medium Deep Survey|Medium Deep Survey]] (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.<ref>Abraham et al. (1996)</ref>\n\nUp to 10% of the HST's observation time is designated as Director's Discretionary (DD) Time, and is typically awarded to astronomers who wish to study unexpected transient phenomena, such as [[supernova]]e. Once Hubble's corrective optics were shown to be performing well, [[Robert Williams (astronomer)|Robert Williams]], the then-director of the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]], decided to devote a substantial fraction of his DD time during 1995 to the study of distant galaxies. A special Institute Advisory Committee recommended that the WFPC2 be used to image a \"typical\" patch of sky at a high [[galactic latitude]], using several [[optical filter]]s. A [[working group]] was set up to develop and implement the project.<ref name=\"Williams1996\">Williams et al. (1996)</ref>\n\n==Target selection==\n[[File:Hubble Deep Field location.gif|thumb|300px|The HDF is at the centre of this image of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] of sky. The Moon as seen from Earth would fill roughly one quarter of this image.]]\n\nThe field selected for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It had to be at a high galactic latitude, because [[interstellar dust|dust]] and obscuring matter in the plane of the [[Milky Way]]'s disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of [[visible light]] (such as foreground stars), and [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] and [[X-ray]] emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background [[infrared cirrus|infrared 'cirrus']], the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of [[hydrogen]] gas ([[H I region]]s).<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nThese criteria restricted the field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's 'continuous viewing zones' (CVZs)\u2014the areas of sky which are not [[occultation|occulted]] by the Earth or the [[moon]] during Hubble's orbit.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" /> The working group decided to concentrate on the northern CVZ, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the [[Keck telescopes]], the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] telescopes and the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.<ref name=\"north_cvz\">{{cite web |author=Ferguson, H. |date=1996 |url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/project/field.html |title=The Hubble Deep Field{{snd}}field selection |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nTwenty fields satisfying these criteria were initially identified, from which three optimal candidate fields were selected, all within the constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. [[Radio]] snapshot observations with the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] ruled out one of these fields because it contained a bright radio source, and the final decision between the other two was made on the basis of the availability of guide stars near the field: Hubble observations normally require a pair of nearby stars on which the telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors can lock during an exposure, but given the importance of the HDF observations, the working group required a second set of back-up guide stars. The field that was eventually selected is located at a [[right ascension]] of {{RA|12|36|49.4}} and a [[declination]] of {{DEC|+62|12|58}};<ref name=\"Williams1996\" /><ref name=\"north_cvz\" /> it is approximately 2.6 [[arcminute]]s in width,<ref name=\"Ferguson1998\" /><ref name=\"Ferguson2000a\">Ferguson (2000a)</ref> or 1/12 the width of the Moon. The area is approximately 1/24,000,000 of the total area of the sky.\n\n==Observations==\n[[File:Hubble Deep Field observing geometry.svg|thumb|left|The HDF was in Hubble's northern Continuous Viewing Zone, as shown by this diagram.]]\n[[File:Hubble Ultra Deep Field diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating comparative sampling distance of the HDF and the 2004 Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]]\n\nOnce a field had been selected, an observing strategy had to be developed. An important decision was to determine which [[filter (optics)|filter]]s the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including [[narrowband]] filters isolating particular [[emission line]]s of [[astrophysical]] interest, and [[broadband]] filters useful for the study of the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the '[[throughput]]' of each filter\u2014the total proportion of light that it allows through\u2014and the spectral coverage available. Filters with [[bandpass]]es overlapping as little as possible were desirable.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nIn the end, four broadband filters were chosen, centred at [[wavelength]]s of 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (near-[[ultraviolet]]), 450&nbsp;nm (blue light), 606&nbsp;nm (red light) and 814&nbsp;nm (near-[[infrared]]). Because the [[quantum efficiency]] of Hubble's detectors at 300&nbsp;nm wavelength is quite low, the noise in observations at this wavelength is primarily due to [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nBetween December 18 and 28, 1995\u2014during which time Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times\u2014342 images of the target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total exposure times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300&nbsp;nm), 33.5 hours (450&nbsp;nm), 30.3 hours (606&nbsp;nm) and 34.3 hours (814&nbsp;nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by [[cosmic ray]]s, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\n==Data processing==\n[[File:Galaxy in each of the four wavelengths comprising the HDF.jpg|thumb|300px|A section of the HDF about 14 [[arcseconds]] across in each of the four [[wavelength]]s used to construct the final version: 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (top left), 450 nm (top right), 606 nm (bottom left) and 814 nm (bottom right)]]\nThe production of a final combined image at each [[wavelength]] was a complex process. Bright [[pixel]]s caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by [[cosmic ray]]s in one exposure but not the other. Trails of [[space debris]] and [[artificial satellite]]s were present in the original images, and were carefully removed.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nScattered light from the Earth was evident in about a quarter of the data frames, creating a visible \"X\" pattern on the images. This was removed by taking an image affected by scattered light, aligning it with an unaffected image, and subtracting the unaffected image from the affected one. The resulting image was smoothed, and could then be subtracted from the bright frame. This procedure removed almost all of the scattered light from the affected images.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nOnce the 342 individual images were cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, they had to be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called '[[Drizzle (image processing)|drizzling]]', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 [[arcsecond]]s across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nThe data processing yielded four [[monochrome]] images (at 300&nbsp;nm, 450&nbsp;nm, 606&nbsp;nm and 814&nbsp;nm), one at each wavelength.<ref name=Ferguson1/> One image was designated as red (814&nbsp;nm), the second as green (606&nbsp;nm) and the third as blue (450&nbsp;nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image.<ref name=Hubble_image>{{cite web |publisher=NASA |date=1995 |title=Hubble's Deepest View of the Universe Unveils Bewildering Galaxies across Billions of Years |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01/image/a/ |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}</ref> Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the [[human eye]] would actually perceive.<ref name=Ferguson1>Ferguson et al.

Many seem to be associated with nearby galaxies, which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense [[star formation]]. Others may be distant [[quasar]]s. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are [[white dwarf]]s, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.<ref name=\"Hansen1998\">Hansen (1998)</ref>\n\n==Scientific results==\n[[File:HDF extracts showing many galaxies.jpg|thumb|left|Details from the HDF illustrate the wide variety of galaxy shapes, sizes and colours found in the distant universe.]]\n[[File:ALMA probes the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.jpg|thumb|Deep field image taken by [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] and Hubble.<ref>{{cite web |title=ALMA Explores the Hubble Ultra Deep Field - Deepest ever millimetre observations of early Universe |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1633/ |website=www.eso.org |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nThe HDF data provided extremely rich material for cosmologists to analyse and by late 2014 the associated scientific paper for the image had received over 900 citations.<ref name=\"nasa_ads\"><!-- Referencing the _citation count_, not the article -->{{cite journal |title=NASA ADS entry for Williams et al.

The light from very distant galaxies is significantly affected by the [[Redshift#Expansion of space|cosmological redshift]]. While [[quasar]]s with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced.<ref name=\"key_findings\" /> The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion [[light-year]]s. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF ([[Lyman-break galaxy|Lyman-break galaxies]]) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.<ref name=Ferguson2>Ferguson et al. (1999), p.105</ref>\n\nThe HDF galaxies contained a considerably larger proportion of disturbed and irregular galaxies than the local universe;<ref name=\"key_findings\" /> galaxy collisions and mergers were more common in the young universe as it was much smaller than today. It is believed that giant [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] form when spirals and irregular galaxies collide.\n\nThe wealth of galaxies at different stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of [[star formation]] over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8\u201310 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.<ref name=\"Connolly1997\">Connolly et al. (1997)</ref>\n\nAnother important result from the HDF was the very small number of foreground stars present.  For years astronomers had been puzzling over the nature of [[dark matter]], mass which seems to be undetectable but which observations implied made up about 85% of all matter in the Universe by mass.<ref name=\"Trimble1987\">Trimble (1987)</ref> One theory was that dark matter might consist of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects ([[MACHO]]s)\u2014faint but massive objects such as [[red dwarf]]s and [[planet]]s in the outer regions of galaxies.<ref name=\"Alcock1992\">Alcock et al.

It covers an area about 2.6 [[arcminute]]s on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in [[Angular diameter|angular size]] to a [[tennis ball]] at a distance of 100&nbsp;metres.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Big Questions The Universe |first1=Stuart |last1=Clark |publisher=Hachette UK |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84916-609-6 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVhBQAAQBAJ}}</ref> The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] over ten consecutive days between December 18 and 28, 1995.<ref name=\"Ferguson1998\" /><ref name=\"Hubble_image\" />\n\nThe field is so small that only a few foreground [[star]]s in the [[Milky Way]] lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are [[galaxy|galaxies]], some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the [[physical cosmology|study of the early universe]].\n\nThree years after the HDF observations were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the [[Hubble Deep Field South]]. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the [[universe]] is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the [[cosmological principle]]). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]]. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]] (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive [[astronomy|astronomical]] image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the [[Hubble eXtreme Deep Field]] (XDF) was released in 2012.\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:Improvement in Hubble images after SMM1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The dramatic improvement in Hubble's imaging capabilities after corrective [[optics]] were installed encouraged attempts to obtain very deep images of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]].]]\n\nOne of the key aims of the astronomers who designed the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high [[optical resolution]] to study distant galaxies to a level of detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the [[atmosphere]], Hubble avoids atmospheric [[airglow]] allowing it to take more sensitive [[Visible light|visible]] and [[ultraviolet light]] images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good [[adaptive optics]] correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10&nbsp;m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from [[spherical aberration]] when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because [[Speed of light|light takes billions of years]] to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows a better understanding of how they evolve.<ref name=Ferguson1998>Ferguson et al. (1999), p.84</ref>\n\nAfter the spherical aberration was corrected during [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-61]] in 1993,<ref name=\"Trauger1994\">Trauger et al. (1994)</ref> the improved imaging capabilities of the telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The [[Hubble Medium Deep Survey|Medium Deep Survey]] (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.<ref>Abraham et al. (1996)</ref>\n\nUp to 10% of the HST's observation time is designated as Director's Discretionary (DD) Time, and is typically awarded to astronomers who wish to study unexpected transient phenomena, such as [[supernova]]e. Once Hubble's corrective optics were shown to be performing well, [[Robert Williams (astronomer)|Robert Williams]], the then-director of the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]], decided to devote a substantial fraction of his DD time during 1995 to the study of distant galaxies. A special Institute Advisory Committee recommended that the WFPC2 be used to image a \"typical\" patch of sky at a high [[galactic latitude]], using several [[optical filter]]s. A [[working group]] was set up to develop and implement the project.<ref name=\"Williams1996\">Williams et al. (1996)</ref>\n\n==Target selection==\n[[File:Hubble Deep Field location.gif|thumb|300px|The HDF is at the centre of this image of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] of sky. The Moon as seen from Earth would fill roughly one quarter of this image.]]\n\nThe field selected for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It had to be at a high galactic latitude, because [[interstellar dust|dust]] and obscuring matter in the plane of the [[Milky Way]]'s disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of [[visible light]] (such as foreground stars), and [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] and [[X-ray]] emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background [[infrared cirrus|infrared 'cirrus']], the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of [[hydrogen]] gas ([[H I region]]s).<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nThese criteria restricted the field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's 'continuous viewing zones' (CVZs)\u2014the areas of sky which are not [[occultation|occulted]] by the Earth or the [[moon]] during Hubble's orbit.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" /> The working group decided to concentrate on the northern CVZ, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the [[Keck telescopes]], the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] telescopes and the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.<ref name=\"north_cvz\">{{cite web |author=Ferguson, H. |date=1996 |url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/project/field.html |title=The Hubble Deep Field{{snd}}field selection |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nTwenty fields satisfying these criteria were initially identified, from which three optimal candidate fields were selected, all within the constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. [[Radio]] snapshot observations with the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] ruled out one of these fields because it contained a bright radio source, and the final decision between the other two was made on the basis of the availability of guide stars near the field: Hubble observations normally require a pair of nearby stars on which the telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors can lock during an exposure, but given the importance of the HDF observations, the working group required a second set of back-up guide stars. The field that was eventually selected is located at a [[right ascension]] of {{RA|12|36|49.4}} and a [[declination]] of {{DEC|+62|12|58}};<ref name=\"Williams1996\" /><ref name=\"north_cvz\" /> it is approximately 2.6 [[arcminute]]s in width,<ref name=\"Ferguson1998\" /><ref name=\"Ferguson2000a\">Ferguson (2000a)</ref> or 1/12 the width of the Moon. The area is approximately 1/24,000,000 of the total area of the sky.\n\n==Observations==\n[[File:Hubble Deep Field observing geometry.svg|thumb|left|The HDF was in Hubble's northern Continuous Viewing Zone, as shown by this diagram.]]\n[[File:Hubble Ultra Deep Field diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating comparative sampling distance of the HDF and the 2004 Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]]\n\nOnce a field had been selected, an observing strategy had to be developed. An important decision was to determine which [[filter (optics)|filter]]s the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including [[narrowband]] filters isolating particular [[emission line]]s of [[astrophysical]] interest, and [[broadband]] filters useful for the study of the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the '[[throughput]]' of each filter\u2014the total proportion of light that it allows through\u2014and the spectral coverage available. Filters with [[bandpass]]es overlapping as little as possible were desirable.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nIn the end, four broadband filters were chosen, centred at [[wavelength]]s of 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (near-[[ultraviolet]]), 450&nbsp;nm (blue light), 606&nbsp;nm (red light) and 814&nbsp;nm (near-[[infrared]]). Because the [[quantum efficiency]] of Hubble's detectors at 300&nbsp;nm wavelength is quite low, the noise in observations at this wavelength is primarily due to [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nBetween December 18 and 28, 1995\u2014during which time Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times\u2014342 images of the target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total exposure times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300&nbsp;nm), 33.5 hours (450&nbsp;nm), 30.3 hours (606&nbsp;nm) and 34.3 hours (814&nbsp;nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by [[cosmic ray]]s, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\n==Data processing==\n[[File:Galaxy in each of the four wavelengths comprising the HDF.jpg|thumb|300px|A section of the HDF about 14 [[arcseconds]] across in each of the four [[wavelength]]s used to construct the final version: 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (top left), 450 nm (top right), 606 nm (bottom left) and 814 nm (bottom right)]]\nThe production of a final combined image at each [[wavelength]] was a complex process. Bright [[pixel]]s caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by [[cosmic ray]]s in one exposure but not the other. Trails of [[space debris]] and [[artificial satellite]]s were present in the original images, and were carefully removed.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nScattered light from the Earth was evident in about a quarter of the data frames, creating a visible \"X\" pattern on the images. This was removed by taking an image affected by scattered light, aligning it with an unaffected image, and subtracting the unaffected image from the affected one. The resulting image was smoothed, and could then be subtracted from the bright frame. This procedure removed almost all of the scattered light from the affected images.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nOnce the 342 individual images were cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, they had to be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called '[[Drizzle (image processing)|drizzling]]', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 [[arcsecond]]s across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.<ref name=\"Williams1996\" />\n\nThe data processing yielded four [[monochrome]] images (at 300&nbsp;nm, 450&nbsp;nm, 606&nbsp;nm and 814&nbsp;nm), one at each wavelength.<ref name=Ferguson1/> One image was designated as red (814&nbsp;nm), the second as green (606&nbsp;nm) and the third as blue (450&nbsp;nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image.<ref name=Hubble_image>{{cite web |publisher=NASA |date=1995 |title=Hubble's Deepest View of the Universe Unveils Bewildering Galaxies across Billions of Years |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01/image/a/ |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}</ref> Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the [[human eye]] would actually perceive.<ref name=Ferguson1>Ferguson et al.

Many seem to be associated with nearby galaxies, which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense [[star formation]]. Others may be distant [[quasar]]s. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are [[white dwarf]]s, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.<ref name=\"Hansen1998\">Hansen (1998)</ref>\n\n==Scientific results==\n[[File:HDF extracts showing many galaxies.jpg|thumb|left|Details from the HDF illustrate the wide variety of galaxy shapes, sizes and colours found in the distant universe.]]\n[[File:ALMA probes the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.jpg|thumb|Deep field image taken by [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] and Hubble.<ref>{{cite web |title=ALMA Explores the Hubble Ultra Deep Field - Deepest ever millimetre observations of early Universe |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1633/ |website=www.eso.org |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nThe HDF data provided extremely rich material for cosmologists to analyse and by late 2014 the associated scientific paper for the image had received over 900 citations.<ref name=\"nasa_ads\"><!-- Referencing the _citation count_, not the article -->{{cite journal |title=NASA ADS entry for Williams et al.

The light from very distant galaxies is significantly affected by the [[Redshift#Expansion of space|cosmological redshift]]. While [[quasar]]s with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced.<ref name=\"key_findings\" /> The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion [[light-year]]s. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF ([[Lyman-break galaxy|Lyman-break galaxies]]) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.<ref name=Ferguson2>Ferguson et al. (1999), p.105</ref>\n\nThe HDF galaxies contained a considerably larger proportion of disturbed and irregular galaxies than the local universe;<ref name=\"key_findings\" /> galaxy collisions and mergers were more common in the young universe as it was much smaller than today. It is believed that giant [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] form when spirals and irregular galaxies collide.\n\nThe wealth of galaxies at different stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of [[star formation]] over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8\u201310 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.<ref name=\"Connolly1997\">Connolly et al. (1997)</ref>\n\nAnother important result from the HDF was the very small number of foreground stars present.  For years astronomers had been puzzling over the nature of [[dark matter]], mass which seems to be undetectable but which observations implied made up about 85% of all matter in the Universe by mass.<ref name=\"Trimble1987\">Trimble (1987)</ref> One theory was that dark matter might consist of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects ([[MACHO]]s)\u2014faint but massive objects such as [[red dwarf]]s and [[planet]]s in the outer regions of galaxies.<ref name=\"Alcock1992\">Alcock et al.

Jerry Van Amerongen\u2019s single panel cartoon ''The Neighborhood'' ran in newspapers throughout the United States from 1980-1990.

''Ballard Street'' ran as a multi-panel strip until 1993, when Van Amerongen reverted to the single panel format employed by ''The Neighborhood''.\n\nVan Amerongen's cartoon ideas come from scribbles and drawings as often as they do from preconceived ideas. The drawings themselves rely on facial expressions and body postures to give readers additional information beyond the caption, providing the motivation behind the action. Boyhood memories shaped by the ethnic influences of his Dutch and Polish heritage, images of roly-poly women in print dresses and rotund men in baggy trousers, shape the look of his characters. \u201cRegardless of our physical appearance, we see ourselves as having wrinkles and rumples on the inside.

He moved on to [[Lyngby BK]], where he played for more than a decade, including the entire decade of the 1980s. He was called up for the Danish national team in July 1980, by national manager [[Sepp Piontek]]. In his three years in the national team, Sch\u00e4fer was a bit-part player and played three national team matches.\n\nHe was a part of the Lyngby team that won the first major trophy in club history; the 1983 [[Danish football champions|Danish championship]]. He also won the 1984 and 1985 [[Danish Cup]] trophies with the club. As Lyngby team captain, he captained the team to the 1990 Danish Cup title as well. Having played 482 matches for Lyngby BK, he retired in the fall 1990, 32 years old.\n\nHe then went on to be a manager. He started as an assistant coach for Lyngby BK in January 1991, but was promoted to head coach in September 1992, following the departure of [[Sweden|Swedish]] coach [[Kent Karlsson]]. In 1995, he became the new manager of [[F.C. Copenhagen]], but he was fired after only one season because of poor results. Since then he has been the manager of several clubs in the lower divisions, among them his former club [[BK Avarta]].\n\nHe is also a football commentator for Danish [[TV3 (Viasat)|TV3]].\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Danish football champions|Danish championship]]: 1983\n*[[Danish Cup]]: 1984, 1985 and 1990\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/PlayerInfo/3789 Danish national team profile]\n\n{{Lyngby BK managers}}\n{{F.C.

It commanded [[Army Ground Forces]], [[United States Army Air Forces]], and [[Army Service Forces]] operations north of Italy<!-- what about the Balkans ETO or MTO? --> and the [[Mediterranean]] coast, in the [[European theatre of World War II|European Theater of World War II]]. It was bordered to the south by the North African Theater of Operations, US Army (NATOUSA), which later became the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTOUSA).\n\nThe term \"theater of operations\" was defined in the US Army field manuals as \"the land and sea areas to be invaded or defended, including areas necessary for administrative activities incident to the military operations\". In accordance with the experience of World War I, it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas-the [[combat]] zone, or the area of active fighting, and the [[Communications Zone]], or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/orgadmin/org_admin_wwii_chpt7.htm |title=Medical department United States Army in World War II: Chapter VII: Prewar Army Doctrine for Theater |author=Blanche B.

General George Patton was redesignated on 10 July 1943. The Seventh Army landed on several beaches in southern [[Sicily]] and captured the city of [[Palermo]] on 22 July and along with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth British Army]] captured Messina on 16 August. During the fighting, the elements of the Seventh Army killed or captured over 113,000 enemy soldiers. The Headquarters elements of the Seventh Army remained relatively inactive at Palermo, Sicily, and [[Algiers]], [[North Africa]], until January 1944 when Lt. General [[Alexander Patch]] was assigned as commander and the Army began planning for the invasion of southern [[France]].\n\nThe invasion was originally given the code name of Operation ANVIL but was changed to [[Operation Dragoon]] before the landing. In March 1944, Lt. General Alexander Patch was assigned to command the Army which moved to [[Naples]], Italy, the following July. On 15 August 1944, Seventh Army units assaulted the beaches of southern France in the [[St. Tropez]] and [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|Saint-Rapha\u00ebl]] area. Within one month, the Army employing three American Divisions, five French Divisions, and the First Airborne Task Force had advanced 400 miles and had joined with the Normandy forces. In the process, the Seventh Army had liberated Marseilles, Lyon, Toulon, and all of Southern France.\n\nSeventh Army then assaulted the German forces in the Vosges Mountains, broke into the Alsatian Plain, and reached the Rhine River after capturing the city of Strasbourg. During the Battle of the Bulge, the Seventh Army extended its flanks to take over much of the Third Army area which allowed the Third to relieve surrounded U.S. forces at Bastogne. Along with the [[First Army (France)|First French Army]], the Seventh went on the offensive in February 1945 and eliminated the enemy pocket in the Colmar area. The Seventh then went into the [[Saar (river)|Saar River valley]], crossed the [[Rhine]], captured [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]], crossed the Brenner Pass, and made contact with the Fifth Army \u2013 once again on Italian soil. In less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 American and Allied Divisions, including the 36th, 42nd, 44th, 45th, 63rd,70th, 103rd, and 105th.\n\nWhen the war ended in Europe on 8 May 1945, the ETOUSA headquarters was located in Versailles, France, just outside Paris. As Eisenhower and his staff began to prepare for the occupation of Germany, the ETOUSA headquarters staff moved to Frankfurt, Germany, and co-located with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces and the Office of Military Government, United States. ETOUSA was redesignated Headquarters, United States Forces European Theater (HQ USFET) on 1 July 1945, with its headquarters remaining at Frankfurt. At the end of the war, the total U.S. Army strength in Europe was 2.4&nbsp;million: two Army groups (6th and 12th), five field armies (First, Third, Seventh, Sixth and Ninth), 13 corps headquarters, and 62 combat divisions (43 infantry, 16 armor, and 3 airborne) as well as 11,000 tanks and armored fighting vehicles. Within a year rapid redeployments had brought the occupation forces down to fewer than 290,000 personnel, and many of the larger formations had departed or been inactivated. Seventh Army headquarters remained in control of the western portion of the American zone, and Third Army controlled the eastern portion. In November 1945, the two field army commanders organized district \"constabularies\" based on cavalry groups, and on 1 May 1946, the zone-wide U.S. Constabulary headquarters was activated at Bamberg. From then until the early 1950s, the structure of the American occupation forces consisted of the 1st Infantry Division, a separate infantry regiment, and the U.S. Constabulary of 10 cavalry regiments. Seventh Army was inactivated in March 1946, in Germany, reactivated for a short time at Atlanta, Georgia, and assigned to the Regular Army with headquarters at Vaihingen, Germany, in November 1950.\n\n===Cold War===\n{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:7th US Army 1957.PNG|thumb|left|Major Unit Headquarters of 7th US Army, 1957.]]\n[[File:V & VII Corps Garrison Footprint.001.tiff|thumb|left| V & VII Corps USAREUR Garrisons in the 1980s]]\n\n{{See also|CENTAG wartime structure in 1989}}\nOn 15 March 1947, HQ USFET was formally redesignated Headquarters, European Command (HQ EUCOM) (not to be confused with the present joint command, \"USEUCOM\", which was formed on 1 August 1952), and between February and June 1948 the headquarters relocated to Campbell Barracks in Heidelberg, where it remained until June 2013. The Army element of the joint European Command headquarters was initially called Headquarters, U.S. Ground and Service Forces, Europe; on 15 November 1947 that designation was changed to Headquarters, United States Army, Europe (USAREUR). On 24 November 1950 EUCOM activated [[Seventh United States Army|HHC Seventh Army]] at Stuttgart to take over the command of the ground and service forces from USAREUR, while other USAREUR functions revert to EUCOM. General Eddy became CG of Seventh Army. HQ USAREUR continued to exist, without troops, to fulfilled certain legal requirements in connection with court-martial and other responsibilities.\n\nAs noted, on 15 November 1947, U.S. Ground and Service Forces, Europe, was renamed Headquarters, United States Army Europe (HQ USAREUR) to accord with the new Department of the Army nomenclature for such commands. USAREUR was a nonoperational organization that provides the ground and service commander with the command functions required for administrative and logistical support. To it were assigned all ground and service units in the command except those assigned to the [[Office of Military Government, United States]]; to the Office of the Commander in Chief of European Command; to [[U.S. Air Forces Europe]]; to the U.S. Navy, Germany; and to a few exempted War Department agencies.  The offices and personnel of the general and special staff divisions of EUCOM headquarters performed USAREUR's general and special staff duties. The principal function of the commanding general of USAREUR became the establishment and maintenance of high standards of discipline. General Huebner also became Commanding General, USAREUR.<ref name=\"eur.army.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eur.army.mil/organization/history.htm|title=History|publisher=U.S. Army}} and \"The American Military Occupation of Germany 1945 \u2013 1953\" by Oliver J.

Handy was redesignated Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Army Europe. Also on 1 August 1952, Headquarters, USEUCOM was established in Frankfurt with Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway as commander and Gen. Handy as deputy commander (Gen. Handy wore two hats for a while). The [[Berlin Blockade]] began 24 June 1948 when the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies' railway and road access to the sectors of Berlin under Allied control. Even though Allied forces in the city were outnumbered 50\u20131, General Lucius D. Clay, in charge of the US Occupation Zone in Germany, gave the order for the [[Berlin Airlift]]. Headquartered out of [[Wiesbaden Army Airfield]], the Allies supplied almost 9,000 tons per day of supplies to the beleaguered city until the blockade was lifted on 12 May 1949.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1950, the Cold War began to warm, and the outbreak of hostilities in Korea heightened East-West tensions in Europe. Seventh Army was reactivated at Stuttgart in late November 1950. The two U.S. Army division sized units in the U.S. Occupation Zone of Germany, the First Infantry Division and the U.S. Constabulary, were assigned to the Seventh Army. Within a few weeks other assignments to Seventh Army included the [[V Corps (United States)|V]] and [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]]. Due to President Truman's 10 December 1950 Declaration of a National Emergency as a result of circumstances in the Korean War (the war began in June 1950), four CONUS based U.S. Army divisions were alerted to move to the U.S. Occupation Zone of Germany (these divisions were known as the augmentation force to the U.S. Army in Europe). A main concern was possible Soviet attempts to \"take advantage\" due to their numerical superiority in Germany during the Korean War. The first augmentation division to arrive overseas in Germany was the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] in May 1951, followed by the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] and the [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43rd]] and [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Divisions]] during summer and fall of 1951.\n\nA new joint [[United States European Command]] (USEUCOM) was established in Frankfurt, Germany on 1 August 1952. On that day, the Army headquarters at Heidelberg, formerly known as EUCOM, became Headquarters, United States Army, Europe. As Cold War tensions continued to escalate in 1952, General [[Williston B.

About 13,500 soldiers manned each of the USAREUR divisions. New equipment fielded at the time included the [[M48 Patton tank|M48 tank]], the [[M59 armored personnel carrier]], and tactical nuclear weapons. On 15 July 1958 USAREUR forces were ordered to assist the Lebanese government. Task Force 201, the Army component of [[Operation Blue Bat]] rapidly deployed more than 8,000 Soldiers from Europe to Beirut by air and sea. As the situation quickly stabilized, all U.S. forces redeployed from the country within 4 months.\n\nAlthough the Korean War \u2013 open East\u2013West conflict \u2013 had ended, political tensions remained high in Europe. Particularly troublesome was the impasse over the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany, the former British, French and U.S. zones of occupation) and the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany, the former Soviet zone of occupation). East Germany [the DDR] was considered by many countries over the years to be nothing more than the Soviet Zone of Occupation; this changed in 1973 with the UN recognition of both Germanies. Berlin posed an additional problem; it was surrounded by East Germany, but Great Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union all occupied sectors in the city. In the early years, travel between the sectors was unrestricted. At the time Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev announced in June 1961 that the Soviet Union was planning to conclude a peace treaty with the East German government, 3,000 East German refugees flowed daily into Berlin.\n\nSuddenly on the night of 12 August 1961, the Soviets closed the border crossing points and began to construct the [[Berlin Wall]], isolating the three western sectors of the city both from East Germany and the Soviet sector, or East Berlin. In response, the United States deployed an additional armored cavalry regiment to Europe, along with additional support units. USAREUR strength reached a post-[[World War II]] high of 277,342 in June 1962 as the crisis deepened. That 1946\u20131991 Cold War maximum USAREUR troop record gradually reduced over time. The command dispatched a reinforced infantry battle group to Berlin to strengthen the existing garrison. The nuclear armed USAREUR did not go to DEFCON 3 during 22 Oct to 20 November 1962 Cuban Crisis due to political reasons. All other US Forces worldwide were at DEFCON 3 per JFK's 22 October speech and direction to the Pentagon; SAC went to DEFCON 2.\n\nThe crisis cooled in Berlin from 1962 to 1963, and augmenting forces returned to the United States. Equipment modernization programs during this period included the [[M113 armored personnel carrier]], the [[M14 rifle]], the [[M60 machine gun]], the [[OV-1 Mohawk|OV-1 fixed wing observation aircraft]], the [[UH-1B|UH-1B Huey helicopter]], the [[M151 MUTT]] truck, and the [[M60 Patton]] tank. In late 1963 Operation BIG LIFT tested the use of prepositioned equipment through redeployment of the 2nd Armored Division to Europe via a single airlift.\n\nOn 1 December 1966, the separate Seventh Army headquarters was eliminated, and HQ USAREUR became Headquarters and Headquarters Company, U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army. At the same time, France withdrew from the military structure of NATO, and U.S. forces were withdrawn from France. The communications zone headquarters moved from Orleans, France, to Worms, Germany, (and later to Kaiserslautern, where as 21st Theater Support Command it remains today). USEUCOM moved to Stuttgart.\n\n[[file:M-60A3 near Giessen in Germany 1985.JPEG|thumb|M-60A3 near [[Giessen]] in West Germany, 1985.]]\n\nThe first Redeployment of Forces from Germany took place in 1968, with the removal of about 28,000 military personnel from Germany. The units and personnel withdrawn remained committed to NATO and during [[REFORGER]] I \u2013 Return of Forces to Germany \u2013 conducted in January 1969, more than 12,000 soldiers returned to Germany for an exercise using pre-positioned equipment.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the needs of the war in Vietnam reduced USAREUR's assigned strength, sometimes drastically. As the war began to wane, forces began to return to Europe, and USAREUR adopted a new system based upon the community commander concept. In 1974, efforts to streamline the headquarters resulted in the termination of the U.S. Theater Army Support Command, and its replacement by a smaller organization, the 21st Theater Army Area Command, now known as 21st TSC.\n\nIn the 1970s, USAREUR continued to improve its firepower when it received the new [[M16 rifle|M16A1 rifle]], the [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW anti-tank weapon]], the [[OH-58 Kiowa]] observation helicopter, and the [[AH-1 Cobra|AH-1G Cobra helicopter]].\n\nDuring the 1970s, force protection concerns grew as Palestinian groups brazenly conducted terror operations in Europe, such as the kidnapping of Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympics, and the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigades targeted U.S. facilities and personnel with bombings, kidnapping and assassinations. In May 1972 bombs exploded at V Corps headquarters in Frankfurt, killing an Army lieutenant colonel, and in Heidelberg at [[Campbell Barracks]], killing three Soldiers. U.S. installations were attacked sporadically throughout the remainder of the decade, including a failed 1977 attack on a U.S. Army post in Giessen. On 15 September 1982, an assassination attempt was made on USAREUR commander Gen. [[Frederick J. Kroesen]] and his wife as they were driving through Heidelberg\u2014the automobile trunk lid deflected the RPG-7 anti-tank projectile. In 1985 Army [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] [[Edward Pimental]] was lured out of a Wiesbaden nightclub and killed for his ID card which was then used to enter Rhein-Main Air Base the next day to plant a bomb that killed two. And in 1986 a bombing at a Berlin disco frequented by service members killed two Soldiers.\n\nWith increased combat and support components in place, the command undertook a wide-ranging modernization in the decade of the 1980s. More than 400 new systems were introduced, including individual weapons, field rations, the [[M1A1 Abrams tank]], the M2 and M3 [[Bradley]] series of infantry and cavalry fighting vehicles, the [[MLRS M270]] multiple launch rocket system, the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] air defense system, the [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopter and the [[AH-64A Apache]] helicopter.\n\nIn January 1967, in accordance with Headquarters [[Department of the Army]] Msg NR DA796059 dated 9 January 1967, the USAREUR and Seventh Army staffs were merged to become Headquarters and Headquarters Company, United States Army Europe and Seventh Army (HHC USAREUR 7A).\n\n===Changes of the 1990s===\n{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2014}}\nThe dramatic events of the late 1980s \u2013 the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], [[German reunification]], and the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] \u2013 combined to change USAREUR again. Intermediate nuclear weapons of the [[56th Field Artillery Command]] were withdrawn, chemical weapons were moved out of Europe, and units began to depart the European continent while others were inactivated.\n\nWhen Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, USAREUR began deploying units to the region. The first deployments from USAREUR to Saudi Arabia in August 1990 included the 45th Medical Company, an element of the 421st Medical Battalion (AA), and advance elements of [[12th Aviation Brigade]], which by September had deployed two Apache attack helicopter battalions, a Kiowa scout helicopter company, a Black Hawk utility helicopter company, a Chinook platoon, and associated support and maintenance units. These were quickly followed by intelligence specialists, chemical warfare experts, logistical personnel, many individual replacements, and finally almost the entire [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]].\n\nThe command eventually deployed more than 75,000 personnel plus 1,200 tanks, 1,700 armored combat vehicles, more than 650 pieces of artillery, and more than 325 aircraft. When the war ended, many USAREUR soldiers remained to complete the logistical cleanup; others were deployed to northern Iraq or Turkey as part of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] to aid refugees. Upon their return to Europe, many also found that their units were in the process of either relocating to the Continental United States or inactivating. In 1992 alone, about 70,000 soldiers redeployed to CONUS with about 90,000 family members. The command shrank from 213,000 soldiers in 1990 to 122,000 in 1992. [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] was inactivated. From 858 installations in 1990, USAREUR went down to only 415 in 1993 with more scheduled to close in the years ahead.\n\nAfter the [[Gulf War]] and the subsequent drawdowns, USAREUR faced a wholly different challenge in Europe. The command was engaged in humanitarian support operations, to include disaster relief and rescue and recovery, peacekeeping and non-combatant evacuations. Between 1990 and 1993 the command supported 42 deployments, which involved a total of 95,579 personnel.\n\nConflict in the Balkans quickly became one of the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s primary areas of focus, and peace enforcement in Bosnia was a harbinger of future military operations. From 1990 to 1995 USAREUR conducted mostly humanitarian operations in the area. In October 1992, USAREUR sent the [[212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]] and personnel from the 7th Medical Command to Zagreb, Croatia to provide medical support for [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) casualties.  Throughout 1993\u20131995, USAREUR's 5th Quartermaster Company, in conjunction with U.S. Air Forces in Europe, delivered humanitarian aid to the region.\n\nIn June 1993, the command formed Task Force Able Sentry in the Former Yugoslav [[Republic of Macedonia]] with the headquarters at Camp Able Sentry near the capital [[Skopje]].  These forces, along with personnel from 26 other countries, were originally part of the UNPROFOR which in 1995 became the U.N. Preventative Deployment force (UNPREDEP) deterring the spread of armed conflict. Upon expiration of the initial UN mandate in February 1999, USAREUR renamed the U.S. Army organization Task Force Sabre, with the task to protect U.S. facilities and equipment. They were relieved in June 1999 by the U.S. national support element to [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]-Task Force Falcon (Rear). U.S. Soldiers left Camp Able Sentry in 2002, but it remained as a contractor operated logistics base until Aug. 2004 when all U.S. personnel departed and NATO assumed control of the camp.\n\nIn Bosnia-Herzegovina, after the [[Dayton Peace Accords]] were reached in Nov. 1995, USAREUR's [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] began deploying there in December, with the first C-130 landing in Tuzla, Bosnia, 2 Dec, and the first trains departing Germany 8 Dec..  One major barrier to the deployment of the 1st Armored Division was the bridge over the Sava River, which was destroyed during the four-year civil war. Construction of the longest assault float bridge in military history, 620 meters long, ribbon float (pontoon) bridge between [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] began on 22 Dec.. Despite melting snow that flooded the river and later, freezing temperatures, the bridge was completed on 31 Dec and the first M1A1 Abrams tank crossed the bridge at 10&nbsp;am. The division, along with many reserve component support troops, formed Task Force Eagle as part of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) (also known as [[Operation Joint Endeavor]]) with the mission to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement, enforce the cease-fire, supervise the marking of boundaries and the zone of separation between the former warring factions, and enforce the withdrawal of the combatants to their barracks and the movement of heavy weapons to storage sites. It was the first time a NATO sponsored force had deployed operationally outside the NATO boundaries. IFOR was succeeded in Dec. 1996 by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) (Operation Joint Guard) whose mission was to deter renewed hostilities. On 20 June 1998 the mission was renamed Operation Joint Forge, and USAREUR continued to serve as the ASCC providing oversight for the mission. On 24 November 2004, Task Force Eagle officially disestablished and closed its base in Tuzla, with European Union forces assuming responsibility for the Bosnia mission.\n\nIn early 1999, in response to growing ethnic tensions in Kosovo and military and paramilitary forces in daily conflict resulting in the more than 1,500 Kosovar Albanian deaths and 400,000 refugees, USAREUR formed Task Force Falcon, with the 1st Infantry Division as the core element.  On 9 June 1999, after an inconclusive air campaign, Task Force Falcon deployed forces in the largest combined air-rail-sea-road movement since Operation Desert Storm, entering Kosovo on 12 June 1999, as part of Operation Joint Guardian, a NATO-led peacekeeping force with a UN mandate to separate warring factions, oversee the withdrawal of Serb forces and interdict the flow of arms to insurgents. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Currently, the U.S. Army, with approx. 800 Soldiers, has the lead for Multinational Battle Group East (MNBG-E) in the eastern region, headquartered near Uro\u0161evac at [[Camp Bondsteel]] as part of KFOR. Contributing nations include Greece, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine. The majority of U.S. Soldiers come from U.S. [[Army National Guard]] units, with a different state taking over the lead for each rotation of approximately nine months.\n\n===War on Terror===\nThe [[11 September 2001 attacks]] did not directly affect the Seventh Army. However, the [[Iraq War|campaign in Iraq]] in 2003 did. The headquarters of [[U.S. V Corps|V Corps]] was deployed to [[Iraq]], as did [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]], and after the campaign, [[US 1st Armored Division|1st Armored Division]] followed for occupation duties. With parts of [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]] also deployed in Iraq, and others on peacekeeping duties in the [[Balkans]], Seventh Army was virtually stripped of combat formations. The return of 173rd Brigade, V Corps and 1st Armored Division in early 2004 was followed by the deployment of the rest of 1st Infantry Division for occupation duties. V Corps began a rotational deployment in 2009 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nThe U.S. Army's reorganization plans from 2005 called for the formation's major subordinate units \u2013 [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] and [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]] \u2013 to be relocated to the continental United States \u2013 [[Fort Bliss]], Texas, and [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], respectively. The [[2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment]], converted to a [[Stryker]] Brigade, and the 12th Aviation Brigade, replaced them. Seventh Army, having been merged with US Army Europe since 1967, remained merged, as was confirmed with the release of unit designations for the modular force in mid 1996. HQ USAREUR and V Corps were slated to merge and the process started until the decision was made to retain a Corps Headquarters within USAREUR, and V Corps was once again separated from HQ USAREUR. Since that time it was decided that V Corps would deactivate after a final deployment to Afghanistan which is ongoing.\n\nIn September 2005, it was expected that the finalised force in Europe would consist of USAREUR HQ, V Corps, aviation and combat service support, and two maneuver brigades: the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Cavalry Regiment]] in [[Vilseck]], Germany, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which will eventually expand to three airborne battalions, in Italy.<ref>See Michael Knights, 'US regional commands diversify across the 'arc of instability,' [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], September 2005, 23</ref> [[Joint Task Force East]] provided from forces rotating from continental United States though bases in Bulgaria and Romania, was initially intended to be provided by a rotating US-based brigade. Two bases at [[Constan\u021ba]], Romania were developed, apparently with the main facility at [[Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport|Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airfield]]. Initially however, [[Joint Task Force East]] was to have been provided by a rotational 2nd Cavalry Regiment Stryker squadron. The Task Force was originally planned to be called the Eastern Europe Task Force. However, since the stresses of the Iraq and Afghan deployments, the army provision of Joint Task Force East has been replaced by a Marine force known as the [[Black Sea Rotational Force]].\n\nFrom 2008 to 2012\u201313, the two to three brigades listed above were augmented by the [[170th Infantry Brigade (United States)|170th Infantry Brigade]] and the [[172nd Infantry Brigade (United States)|172nd Infantry Brigade]], 'reflagged' former V Corps/1st Armored Division formations.<ref>*Mark St.Clair, and John Vandiver, [http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=53123 Name changes set for 2 Germany-based units], [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]], Friday, 7 March 2008</ref> Thus from 2008 to 2013, the force will consist of two heavy brigades combat teams, the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.\n\nNearly forty years later, Army Campaign Plan DP 58 (circa 2006) effectively dropped the Seventh Army title. Decisions that took effect in 2006 stated that the official designation would be Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, United States Army Europe.<ref>http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/go0618.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.tradoc.army.mil/g357/cp32/forms/DP_58_EXSUM.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/ar10-87.pdf|title=Army REgulation 10\u201387|author=|date=|website=fas.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> The organization perpetuates the lineage and honors of the Seventh Army and authorized the display and wear of appropriate Seventh Army heraldic items.\n\nOn 25 October 2009, in a ceremony at the Parade Field on Daenner Kaserne, the 7th US Army Reserve Command, [[United States Army Reserve]], was inactivated and redesignated the 7th Civil Support Command.

In accordance with the experience of World War I, it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas-the [[combat]] zone, or the area of active fighting, and the [[Communications Zone]], or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/orgadmin/org_admin_wwii_chpt7.htm |title=Medical department United States Army in World War II: Chapter VII: Prewar Army Doctrine for Theater |author=Blanche B.

General George Patton was redesignated on 10 July 1943. The Seventh Army landed on several beaches in southern [[Sicily]] and captured the city of [[Palermo]] on 22 July and along with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth British Army]] captured Messina on 16 August. During the fighting, the elements of the Seventh Army killed or captured over 113,000 enemy soldiers. The Headquarters elements of the Seventh Army remained relatively inactive at Palermo, Sicily, and [[Algiers]], [[North Africa]], until January 1944 when Lt. General [[Alexander Patch]] was assigned as commander and the Army began planning for the invasion of southern [[France]].\n\nThe invasion was originally given the code name of Operation ANVIL but was changed to [[Operation Dragoon]] before the landing. In March 1944, Lt. General Alexander Patch was assigned to command the Army which moved to [[Naples]], Italy, the following July. On 15 August 1944, Seventh Army units assaulted the beaches of southern France in the [[St. Tropez]] and [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|Saint-Rapha\u00ebl]] area. Within one month, the Army employing three American Divisions, five French Divisions, and the First Airborne Task Force had advanced 400 miles and had joined with the Normandy forces. In the process, the Seventh Army had liberated Marseilles, Lyon, Toulon, and all of Southern France.\n\nSeventh Army then assaulted the German forces in the Vosges Mountains, broke into the Alsatian Plain, and reached the Rhine River after capturing the city of Strasbourg. During the Battle of the Bulge, the Seventh Army extended its flanks to take over much of the Third Army area which allowed the Third to relieve surrounded U.S. forces at Bastogne. Along with the [[First Army (France)|First French Army]], the Seventh went on the offensive in February 1945 and eliminated the enemy pocket in the Colmar area. The Seventh then went into the [[Saar (river)|Saar River valley]], crossed the [[Rhine]], captured [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]], crossed the Brenner Pass, and made contact with the Fifth Army \u2013 once again on Italian soil. In less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 American and Allied Divisions, including the 36th, 42nd, 44th, 45th, 63rd,70th, 103rd, and 105th.\n\nWhen the war ended in Europe on 8 May 1945, the ETOUSA headquarters was located in Versailles, France, just outside Paris. As Eisenhower and his staff began to prepare for the occupation of Germany, the ETOUSA headquarters staff moved to Frankfurt, Germany, and co-located with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces and the Office of Military Government, United States. ETOUSA was redesignated Headquarters, United States Forces European Theater (HQ USFET) on 1 July 1945, with its headquarters remaining at Frankfurt. At the end of the war, the total U.S. Army strength in Europe was 2.4&nbsp;million: two Army groups (6th and 12th), five field armies (First, Third, Seventh, Sixth and Ninth), 13 corps headquarters, and 62 combat divisions (43 infantry, 16 armor, and 3 airborne) as well as 11,000 tanks and armored fighting vehicles. Within a year rapid redeployments had brought the occupation forces down to fewer than 290,000 personnel, and many of the larger formations had departed or been inactivated. Seventh Army headquarters remained in control of the western portion of the American zone, and Third Army controlled the eastern portion. In November 1945, the two field army commanders organized district \"constabularies\" based on cavalry groups, and on 1 May 1946, the zone-wide U.S. Constabulary headquarters was activated at Bamberg. From then until the early 1950s, the structure of the American occupation forces consisted of the 1st Infantry Division, a separate infantry regiment, and the U.S. Constabulary of 10 cavalry regiments. Seventh Army was inactivated in March 1946, in Germany, reactivated for a short time at Atlanta, Georgia, and assigned to the Regular Army with headquarters at Vaihingen, Germany, in November 1950.\n\n===Cold War===\n{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:7th US Army 1957.PNG|thumb|left|Major Unit Headquarters of 7th US Army, 1957.]]\n[[File:V & VII Corps Garrison Footprint.001.tiff|thumb|left| V & VII Corps USAREUR Garrisons in the 1980s]]\n\n{{See also|CENTAG wartime structure in 1989}}\nOn 15 March 1947, HQ USFET was formally redesignated Headquarters, European Command (HQ EUCOM) (not to be confused with the present joint command, \"USEUCOM\", which was formed on 1 August 1952), and between February and June 1948 the headquarters relocated to Campbell Barracks in Heidelberg, where it remained until June 2013. The Army element of the joint European Command headquarters was initially called Headquarters, U.S. Ground and Service Forces, Europe; on 15 November 1947 that designation was changed to Headquarters, United States Army, Europe (USAREUR). On 24 November 1950 EUCOM activated [[Seventh United States Army|HHC Seventh Army]] at Stuttgart to take over the command of the ground and service forces from USAREUR, while other USAREUR functions revert to EUCOM. General Eddy became CG of Seventh Army. HQ USAREUR continued to exist, without troops, to fulfilled certain legal requirements in connection with court-martial and other responsibilities.\n\nAs noted, on 15 November 1947, U.S. Ground and Service Forces, Europe, was renamed Headquarters, United States Army Europe (HQ USAREUR) to accord with the new Department of the Army nomenclature for such commands. USAREUR was a nonoperational organization that provides the ground and service commander with the command functions required for administrative and logistical support. To it were assigned all ground and service units in the command except those assigned to the [[Office of Military Government, United States]]; to the Office of the Commander in Chief of European Command; to [[U.S. Air Forces Europe]]; to the U.S. Navy, Germany; and to a few exempted War Department agencies.  The offices and personnel of the general and special staff divisions of EUCOM headquarters performed USAREUR's general and special staff duties. The principal function of the commanding general of USAREUR became the establishment and maintenance of high standards of discipline. General Huebner also became Commanding General, USAREUR.<ref name=\"eur.army.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eur.army.mil/organization/history.htm|title=History|publisher=U.S. Army}} and \"The American Military Occupation of Germany 1945 \u2013 1953\" by Oliver J.

Handy was redesignated Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Army Europe. Also on 1 August 1952, Headquarters, USEUCOM was established in Frankfurt with Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway as commander and Gen. Handy as deputy commander (Gen. Handy wore two hats for a while). The [[Berlin Blockade]] began 24 June 1948 when the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies' railway and road access to the sectors of Berlin under Allied control. Even though Allied forces in the city were outnumbered 50\u20131, General Lucius D. Clay, in charge of the US Occupation Zone in Germany, gave the order for the [[Berlin Airlift]]. Headquartered out of [[Wiesbaden Army Airfield]], the Allies supplied almost 9,000 tons per day of supplies to the beleaguered city until the blockade was lifted on 12 May 1949.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1950, the Cold War began to warm, and the outbreak of hostilities in Korea heightened East-West tensions in Europe. Seventh Army was reactivated at Stuttgart in late November 1950. The two U.S. Army division sized units in the U.S. Occupation Zone of Germany, the First Infantry Division and the U.S. Constabulary, were assigned to the Seventh Army. Within a few weeks other assignments to Seventh Army included the [[V Corps (United States)|V]] and [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]]. Due to President Truman's 10 December 1950 Declaration of a National Emergency as a result of circumstances in the Korean War (the war began in June 1950), four CONUS based U.S. Army divisions were alerted to move to the U.S. Occupation Zone of Germany (these divisions were known as the augmentation force to the U.S. Army in Europe). A main concern was possible Soviet attempts to \"take advantage\" due to their numerical superiority in Germany during the Korean War. The first augmentation division to arrive overseas in Germany was the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] in May 1951, followed by the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] and the [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43rd]] and [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Divisions]] during summer and fall of 1951.\n\nA new joint [[United States European Command]] (USEUCOM) was established in Frankfurt, Germany on 1 August 1952. On that day, the Army headquarters at Heidelberg, formerly known as EUCOM, became Headquarters, United States Army, Europe. As Cold War tensions continued to escalate in 1952, General [[Williston B.

About 13,500 soldiers manned each of the USAREUR divisions. New equipment fielded at the time included the [[M48 Patton tank|M48 tank]], the [[M59 armored personnel carrier]], and tactical nuclear weapons. On 15 July 1958 USAREUR forces were ordered to assist the Lebanese government. Task Force 201, the Army component of [[Operation Blue Bat]] rapidly deployed more than 8,000 Soldiers from Europe to Beirut by air and sea. As the situation quickly stabilized, all U.S. forces redeployed from the country within 4 months.\n\nAlthough the Korean War \u2013 open East\u2013West conflict \u2013 had ended, political tensions remained high in Europe. Particularly troublesome was the impasse over the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany, the former British, French and U.S. zones of occupation) and the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany, the former Soviet zone of occupation). East Germany [the DDR] was considered by many countries over the years to be nothing more than the Soviet Zone of Occupation; this changed in 1973 with the UN recognition of both Germanies. Berlin posed an additional problem; it was surrounded by East Germany, but Great Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union all occupied sectors in the city. In the early years, travel between the sectors was unrestricted. At the time Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev announced in June 1961 that the Soviet Union was planning to conclude a peace treaty with the East German government, 3,000 East German refugees flowed daily into Berlin.\n\nSuddenly on the night of 12 August 1961, the Soviets closed the border crossing points and began to construct the [[Berlin Wall]], isolating the three western sectors of the city both from East Germany and the Soviet sector, or East Berlin. In response, the United States deployed an additional armored cavalry regiment to Europe, along with additional support units. USAREUR strength reached a post-[[World War II]] high of 277,342 in June 1962 as the crisis deepened. That 1946\u20131991 Cold War maximum USAREUR troop record gradually reduced over time. The command dispatched a reinforced infantry battle group to Berlin to strengthen the existing garrison. The nuclear armed USAREUR did not go to DEFCON 3 during 22 Oct to 20 November 1962 Cuban Crisis due to political reasons. All other US Forces worldwide were at DEFCON 3 per JFK's 22 October speech and direction to the Pentagon; SAC went to DEFCON 2.\n\nThe crisis cooled in Berlin from 1962 to 1963, and augmenting forces returned to the United States. Equipment modernization programs during this period included the [[M113 armored personnel carrier]], the [[M14 rifle]], the [[M60 machine gun]], the [[OV-1 Mohawk|OV-1 fixed wing observation aircraft]], the [[UH-1B|UH-1B Huey helicopter]], the [[M151 MUTT]] truck, and the [[M60 Patton]] tank. In late 1963 Operation BIG LIFT tested the use of prepositioned equipment through redeployment of the 2nd Armored Division to Europe via a single airlift.\n\nOn 1 December 1966, the separate Seventh Army headquarters was eliminated, and HQ USAREUR became Headquarters and Headquarters Company, U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army. At the same time, France withdrew from the military structure of NATO, and U.S. forces were withdrawn from France. The communications zone headquarters moved from Orleans, France, to Worms, Germany, (and later to Kaiserslautern, where as 21st Theater Support Command it remains today). USEUCOM moved to Stuttgart.\n\n[[file:M-60A3 near Giessen in Germany 1985.JPEG|thumb|M-60A3 near [[Giessen]] in West Germany, 1985.]]\n\nThe first Redeployment of Forces from Germany took place in 1968, with the removal of about 28,000 military personnel from Germany. The units and personnel withdrawn remained committed to NATO and during [[REFORGER]] I \u2013 Return of Forces to Germany \u2013 conducted in January 1969, more than 12,000 soldiers returned to Germany for an exercise using pre-positioned equipment.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the needs of the war in Vietnam reduced USAREUR's assigned strength, sometimes drastically. As the war began to wane, forces began to return to Europe, and USAREUR adopted a new system based upon the community commander concept. In 1974, efforts to streamline the headquarters resulted in the termination of the U.S. Theater Army Support Command, and its replacement by a smaller organization, the 21st Theater Army Area Command, now known as 21st TSC.\n\nIn the 1970s, USAREUR continued to improve its firepower when it received the new [[M16 rifle|M16A1 rifle]], the [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW anti-tank weapon]], the [[OH-58 Kiowa]] observation helicopter, and the [[AH-1 Cobra|AH-1G Cobra helicopter]].\n\nDuring the 1970s, force protection concerns grew as Palestinian groups brazenly conducted terror operations in Europe, such as the kidnapping of Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympics, and the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigades targeted U.S. facilities and personnel with bombings, kidnapping and assassinations. In May 1972 bombs exploded at V Corps headquarters in Frankfurt, killing an Army lieutenant colonel, and in Heidelberg at [[Campbell Barracks]], killing three Soldiers. U.S. installations were attacked sporadically throughout the remainder of the decade, including a failed 1977 attack on a U.S. Army post in Giessen. On 15 September 1982, an assassination attempt was made on USAREUR commander Gen. [[Frederick J. Kroesen]] and his wife as they were driving through Heidelberg\u2014the automobile trunk lid deflected the RPG-7 anti-tank projectile. In 1985 Army [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] [[Edward Pimental]] was lured out of a Wiesbaden nightclub and killed for his ID card which was then used to enter Rhein-Main Air Base the next day to plant a bomb that killed two. And in 1986 a bombing at a Berlin disco frequented by service members killed two Soldiers.\n\nWith increased combat and support components in place, the command undertook a wide-ranging modernization in the decade of the 1980s. More than 400 new systems were introduced, including individual weapons, field rations, the [[M1A1 Abrams tank]], the M2 and M3 [[Bradley]] series of infantry and cavalry fighting vehicles, the [[MLRS M270]] multiple launch rocket system, the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] air defense system, the [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopter and the [[AH-64A Apache]] helicopter.\n\nIn January 1967, in accordance with Headquarters [[Department of the Army]] Msg NR DA796059 dated 9 January 1967, the USAREUR and Seventh Army staffs were merged to become Headquarters and Headquarters Company, United States Army Europe and Seventh Army (HHC USAREUR 7A).\n\n===Changes of the 1990s===\n{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2014}}\nThe dramatic events of the late 1980s \u2013 the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], [[German reunification]], and the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] \u2013 combined to change USAREUR again. Intermediate nuclear weapons of the [[56th Field Artillery Command]] were withdrawn, chemical weapons were moved out of Europe, and units began to depart the European continent while others were inactivated.\n\nWhen Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, USAREUR began deploying units to the region. The first deployments from USAREUR to Saudi Arabia in August 1990 included the 45th Medical Company, an element of the 421st Medical Battalion (AA), and advance elements of [[12th Aviation Brigade]], which by September had deployed two Apache attack helicopter battalions, a Kiowa scout helicopter company, a Black Hawk utility helicopter company, a Chinook platoon, and associated support and maintenance units. These were quickly followed by intelligence specialists, chemical warfare experts, logistical personnel, many individual replacements, and finally almost the entire [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]].\n\nThe command eventually deployed more than 75,000 personnel plus 1,200 tanks, 1,700 armored combat vehicles, more than 650 pieces of artillery, and more than 325 aircraft. When the war ended, many USAREUR soldiers remained to complete the logistical cleanup; others were deployed to northern Iraq or Turkey as part of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] to aid refugees. Upon their return to Europe, many also found that their units were in the process of either relocating to the Continental United States or inactivating. In 1992 alone, about 70,000 soldiers redeployed to CONUS with about 90,000 family members. The command shrank from 213,000 soldiers in 1990 to 122,000 in 1992. [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] was inactivated. From 858 installations in 1990, USAREUR went down to only 415 in 1993 with more scheduled to close in the years ahead.\n\nAfter the [[Gulf War]] and the subsequent drawdowns, USAREUR faced a wholly different challenge in Europe. The command was engaged in humanitarian support operations, to include disaster relief and rescue and recovery, peacekeeping and non-combatant evacuations. Between 1990 and 1993 the command supported 42 deployments, which involved a total of 95,579 personnel.\n\nConflict in the Balkans quickly became one of the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s primary areas of focus, and peace enforcement in Bosnia was a harbinger of future military operations. From 1990 to 1995 USAREUR conducted mostly humanitarian operations in the area. In October 1992, USAREUR sent the [[212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]] and personnel from the 7th Medical Command to Zagreb, Croatia to provide medical support for [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) casualties.  Throughout 1993\u20131995, USAREUR's 5th Quartermaster Company, in conjunction with U.S. Air Forces in Europe, delivered humanitarian aid to the region.\n\nIn June 1993, the command formed Task Force Able Sentry in the Former Yugoslav [[Republic of Macedonia]] with the headquarters at Camp Able Sentry near the capital [[Skopje]].  These forces, along with personnel from 26 other countries, were originally part of the UNPROFOR which in 1995 became the U.N. Preventative Deployment force (UNPREDEP) deterring the spread of armed conflict. Upon expiration of the initial UN mandate in February 1999, USAREUR renamed the U.S. Army organization Task Force Sabre, with the task to protect U.S. facilities and equipment. They were relieved in June 1999 by the U.S. national support element to [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]-Task Force Falcon (Rear). U.S. Soldiers left Camp Able Sentry in 2002, but it remained as a contractor operated logistics base until Aug. 2004 when all U.S. personnel departed and NATO assumed control of the camp.\n\nIn Bosnia-Herzegovina, after the [[Dayton Peace Accords]] were reached in Nov. 1995, USAREUR's [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] began deploying there in December, with the first C-130 landing in Tuzla, Bosnia, 2 Dec, and the first trains departing Germany 8 Dec..  One major barrier to the deployment of the 1st Armored Division was the bridge over the Sava River, which was destroyed during the four-year civil war. Construction of the longest assault float bridge in military history, 620 meters long, ribbon float (pontoon) bridge between [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] began on 22 Dec.. Despite melting snow that flooded the river and later, freezing temperatures, the bridge was completed on 31 Dec and the first M1A1 Abrams tank crossed the bridge at 10&nbsp;am. The division, along with many reserve component support troops, formed Task Force Eagle as part of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) (also known as [[Operation Joint Endeavor]]) with the mission to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement, enforce the cease-fire, supervise the marking of boundaries and the zone of separation between the former warring factions, and enforce the withdrawal of the combatants to their barracks and the movement of heavy weapons to storage sites. It was the first time a NATO sponsored force had deployed operationally outside the NATO boundaries. IFOR was succeeded in Dec. 1996 by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) (Operation Joint Guard) whose mission was to deter renewed hostilities. On 20 June 1998 the mission was renamed Operation Joint Forge, and USAREUR continued to serve as the ASCC providing oversight for the mission. On 24 November 2004, Task Force Eagle officially disestablished and closed its base in Tuzla, with European Union forces assuming responsibility for the Bosnia mission.\n\nIn early 1999, in response to growing ethnic tensions in Kosovo and military and paramilitary forces in daily conflict resulting in the more than 1,500 Kosovar Albanian deaths and 400,000 refugees, USAREUR formed Task Force Falcon, with the 1st Infantry Division as the core element.  On 9 June 1999, after an inconclusive air campaign, Task Force Falcon deployed forces in the largest combined air-rail-sea-road movement since Operation Desert Storm, entering Kosovo on 12 June 1999, as part of Operation Joint Guardian, a NATO-led peacekeeping force with a UN mandate to separate warring factions, oversee the withdrawal of Serb forces and interdict the flow of arms to insurgents. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Currently, the U.S. Army, with approx. 800 Soldiers, has the lead for Multinational Battle Group East (MNBG-E) in the eastern region, headquartered near Uro\u0161evac at [[Camp Bondsteel]] as part of KFOR. Contributing nations include Greece, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine. The majority of U.S. Soldiers come from U.S. [[Army National Guard]] units, with a different state taking over the lead for each rotation of approximately nine months.\n\n===War on Terror===\nThe [[11 September 2001 attacks]] did not directly affect the Seventh Army. However, the [[Iraq War|campaign in Iraq]] in 2003 did. The headquarters of [[U.S. V Corps|V Corps]] was deployed to [[Iraq]], as did [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]], and after the campaign, [[US 1st Armored Division|1st Armored Division]] followed for occupation duties. With parts of [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]] also deployed in Iraq, and others on peacekeeping duties in the [[Balkans]], Seventh Army was virtually stripped of combat formations. The return of 173rd Brigade, V Corps and 1st Armored Division in early 2004 was followed by the deployment of the rest of 1st Infantry Division for occupation duties. V Corps began a rotational deployment in 2009 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nThe U.S. Army's reorganization plans from 2005 called for the formation's major subordinate units \u2013 [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] and [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]] \u2013 to be relocated to the continental United States \u2013 [[Fort Bliss]], Texas, and [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], respectively. The [[2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment]], converted to a [[Stryker]] Brigade, and the 12th Aviation Brigade, replaced them. Seventh Army, having been merged with US Army Europe since 1967, remained merged, as was confirmed with the release of unit designations for the modular force in mid 1996. HQ USAREUR and V Corps were slated to merge and the process started until the decision was made to retain a Corps Headquarters within USAREUR, and V Corps was once again separated from HQ USAREUR. Since that time it was decided that V Corps would deactivate after a final deployment to Afghanistan which is ongoing.\n\nIn September 2005, it was expected that the finalised force in Europe would consist of USAREUR HQ, V Corps, aviation and combat service support, and two maneuver brigades: the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Cavalry Regiment]] in [[Vilseck]], Germany, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which will eventually expand to three airborne battalions, in Italy.<ref>See Michael Knights, 'US regional commands diversify across the 'arc of instability,' [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], September 2005, 23</ref> [[Joint Task Force East]] provided from forces rotating from continental United States though bases in Bulgaria and Romania, was initially intended to be provided by a rotating US-based brigade. Two bases at [[Constan\u021ba]], Romania were developed, apparently with the main facility at [[Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport|Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airfield]]. Initially however, [[Joint Task Force East]] was to have been provided by a rotational 2nd Cavalry Regiment Stryker squadron. The Task Force was originally planned to be called the Eastern Europe Task Force. However, since the stresses of the Iraq and Afghan deployments, the army provision of Joint Task Force East has been replaced by a Marine force known as the [[Black Sea Rotational Force]].\n\nFrom 2008 to 2012\u201313, the two to three brigades listed above were augmented by the [[170th Infantry Brigade (United States)|170th Infantry Brigade]] and the [[172nd Infantry Brigade (United States)|172nd Infantry Brigade]], 'reflagged' former V Corps/1st Armored Division formations.<ref>*Mark St.Clair, and John Vandiver, [http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=53123 Name changes set for 2 Germany-based units], [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]], Friday, 7 March 2008</ref> Thus from 2008 to 2013, the force will consist of two heavy brigades combat teams, the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.\n\nNearly forty years later, Army Campaign Plan DP 58 (circa 2006) effectively dropped the Seventh Army title.
