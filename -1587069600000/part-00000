In that era, the university provided two-year pre-clinical education certificates, and graduates went out of state to complete doctor of medicine degrees. In 1950, the Mississippi Legislature voted to create a four-year medical school. On July 1, 1955, the University Medical Center opened in the capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], as a four-year medical school. The [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]], as it is now called, is the health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi. It houses the University of Mississippi School of Medicine along with five other health science schools: nursing, dentistry, health-related professions, graduate studies and pharmacy (The School of Pharmacy is split between the Oxford and University of Mississippi Medical Center campuses).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html|title=Overview - University of Mississippi Medical Center|publisher=Umc.edu|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=December 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222200427/http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html|archive-date=February 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were made via the executive and legislative branches of the Mississippi state government to relocate or otherwise close the University of Mississippi. The Mississippi Legislature between 1900 and 1930 introduced several bills aiming to accomplish this, but no legislation was ever passed by either house. One such bill was introduced in 1912 by Senator William Ellis of Carthage, Mississippi, which would have merged the college with then-Mississippi A&M.<ref>David Sansing, The History of the University of Mississippi: A Sesquicentennial History, Ch. 8</ref> However, this measure was soundly defeated, despite the bill only seeking to form an exploratory committee.\n\nIn February 1920, 56 members of the legislature arrived on campus and discussed with students and faculty the idea of consolidating MS A&M, MS College of Women and Ole Miss to be in Jackson, rather than appropriate $750,000.00 of funds requested by then-Chancellor Joseph Powers which were needed to repair dilapidated and structurally unsound buildings on the campus, which was discovered following the partial collapse of a dormitory in 1917 and a scathing review of other buildings later that same year by the state architect.<ref>David Sansing, The History of the University of Mississippi: A Sesquicentennial History, Ch. *</ref> These funds, plus an additional $300,000.00 were appropriated to the school, which was used to build 4 male dormitories, a female dormitory and a pharmacy building, which partially resolved a longstanding issue of inadequate dormitory space for students. During the 1930s, [[Governor of Mississippi|Mississippi Governor]] [[Theodore G. Bilbo]], a populist, tried to move the university to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]. Chancellor [[Alfred Hume]] gave the state legislators a grand tour of Ole Miss and the surrounding historic city of Oxford, persuading them to keep it in its original setting.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], UM was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"list-of-v-12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html |title=U.S. Naval Administration in World War II|publisher=HyperWar Foundation|accessdate=September 29, 2011|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n===Integration of 1962 and legacy===\n[[File:James Meredith OleMiss.jpg|thumb|right|James Meredith walking to class at the University of Mississippi, accompanied by [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]]]]\n\n{{See also|Ole Miss riot of 1962}}\n[[Desegregation]] came to Ole Miss in the early 1960s with the activities of [[United States Air Force]] veteran [[James Meredith]] from [[Kosciusko, Mississippi]].

In that era, the university provided two-year pre-clinical education certificates, and graduates went out of state to complete doctor of medicine degrees. In 1950, the Mississippi Legislature voted to create a four-year medical school. On July 1, 1955, the University Medical Center opened in the capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], as a four-year medical school. The [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]], as it is now called, is the health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi. It houses the University of Mississippi School of Medicine along with five other health science schools: nursing, dentistry, health-related professions, graduate studies and pharmacy (The School of Pharmacy is split between the Oxford and University of Mississippi Medical Center campuses).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html|title=Overview - University of Mississippi Medical Center|publisher=Umc.edu|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=December 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222200427/http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html|archive-date=February 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were made via the executive and legislative branches of the Mississippi state government to relocate or otherwise close the University of Mississippi. The Mississippi Legislature between 1900 and 1930 introduced several bills aiming to accomplish this, but no legislation was ever passed by either house. One such bill was introduced in 1912 by Senator William Ellis of Carthage, Mississippi, which would have merged the college with then-Mississippi A&M.<ref>David Sansing, The History of the University of Mississippi: A Sesquicentennial History, Ch. 8</ref> However, this measure was soundly defeated, despite the bill only seeking to form an exploratory committee.\n\nIn February 1920, 56 members of the legislature arrived on campus and discussed with students and faculty the idea of consolidating MS A&M, MS College of Women and Ole Miss to be in Jackson, rather than appropriate $750,000.00 of funds requested by then-Chancellor Joseph Powers which were needed to repair dilapidated and structurally unsound buildings on the campus, which was discovered following the partial collapse of a dormitory in 1917 and a scathing review of other buildings later that same year by the state architect.<ref>David Sansing, The History of the University of Mississippi: A Sesquicentennial History, Ch. *</ref> These funds, plus an additional $300,000.00 were appropriated to the school, which was used to build 4 male dormitories, a female dormitory and a pharmacy building, which partially resolved a longstanding issue of inadequate dormitory space for students. During the 1930s, [[Governor of Mississippi|Mississippi Governor]] [[Theodore G. Bilbo]], a populist, tried to move the university to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]. Chancellor [[Alfred Hume]] gave the state legislators a grand tour of Ole Miss and the surrounding historic city of Oxford, persuading them to keep it in its original setting.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], UM was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"list-of-v-12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html |title=U.S. Naval Administration in World War II|publisher=HyperWar Foundation|accessdate=September 29, 2011|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n===Integration of 1962 and legacy===\n[[File:James Meredith OleMiss.jpg|thumb|right|James Meredith walking to class at the University of Mississippi, accompanied by [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]]]]\n\n{{See also|Ole Miss riot of 1962}}\n[[Desegregation]] came to Ole Miss in the early 1960s with the activities of [[United States Air Force]] veteran [[James Meredith]] from [[Kosciusko, Mississippi]].
