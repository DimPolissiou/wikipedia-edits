It is part of the Borough of [[Mid and East Antrim]]. It had a population of 29,551 people at the [[United Kingdom census, 2011|2011 Census]].<ref name=Census2011/>\n\nThe town is built on land given to the Adair family by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1626, on the basis that the town holds two annual fairs and a free Saturday market in perpetuity. {{As of|2018}}, the Saturday market still runs. It is a popular shopping hub within Northern Ireland and is home to [[Ballymena United F.C.]]\n\nBallymena incorporates an area of {{convert|632|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}} and is home to large villages such as [[Cullybackey]], [[Galgorm Parks|Galgorm]], [[Ahoghill]] and [[Broughshane]]. The town used to host Ireland's largest one-day agricultural show at the Ballymena Showgrounds. The town centre has many historic buildings. The Town Hall was built in 1924 on the site of the old Market House, and was refurbished in 2007 at a cost of roughly \u00a320 million.\n\nIn this town all the women will open their legs for crack.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe recorded history of the Ballymena area dates to the [[Early Christian]] period from the 5th to the 7th centuries. [[Ringfort]]s are found in the [[townland]] of Ballykeel and a site known as Camphill Fort in the townland of Ballee may also have been of this type. There are a number of [[souterrain]] sites within a {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km}} radius of the centre of Ballymena.\n\n{{convert|2|mi|spell=In|abbr=off}} north in the townland of Kirkinriola, the ancient parish church and graveyard possess several indicators of Early Christian settlement, including a souterrain. Also in 1868, a gravedigger found a large stone slab on which was carved a cross with the inscription ''ord do degen''. This refers to Bishop Degen, who lived in Ireland during the 7th century. This stone is now in the porch of [[St Patrick's Church, Ballymena|St. Patrick's Church of Ireland]], at the end of Castle Street.\n\nAt the end of the 5th century, a church was founded in Connor, {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} south of Ballymena. This was followed by a monastery at Templemoyle, Kells. In 831, however, the [[Nordic countries|Norse]] invaded the Ballymena area and burned the church.\n\nIn the 12th century, the [[Normans]] conquered much of [[County Antrim]] and [[County Down]] after having taken over England the century before. They created the core of the [[Earl of Ulster|Earldom of Ulster]]. During this campaign, they built great mounds of earth topped by wooden towers, referred to as ''mottes'', as defensive structures. The Harryville ([[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]]: ''Herrieville'') area's [[motte-and-bailey]] is one of the best examples of this type of fortification in Northern Ireland. Some sources{{who|date=February 2011}}, however, credit the [[Loughinsholin|U\u00ed Fhloinn]] with building the mid-Antrim mottes and baileys in imitation of the invaders; the U\u00ed Fhloinn defeated and repelled the Earl of Ulster, [[John de Courcy]], in 1177 and 1178.\n\nIn 1315, [[Edward Bruce]] (brother of King [[Robert I of Scotland]], known as \"Robert Bruce\") invaded Ireland. On 10 September 1315, at the Battle of Tawnybrack ({{convert|5|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} south of Ballymena at Kells), Edward conquered the army of [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster|Richard De Burgo]], the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Earl of Ulster]].\n\n===Post-medieval===\nIn 1576, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] granted land, including the town of Ballymena, to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]. The lands had been forfeited to the crown after Shane O'Neill's resistance in the 1560s. Smith brought English settlers to the area, among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. By 1581, Smith's settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.\n\nOn 10 May 1607, [[James I of England|King James I]] granted the native Irish chief, Ruair\u00ed \u00d3g MacQuillan the Ballymena Estate. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland. The estate was temporarily renamed \"Kinhilstown\" after Adair's lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early 17th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid. In 1626 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate; they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.\n\nIn 1641, the local Ballymena garrison were defeated by Irish rebels in the battle of Bundooragh. Ballymena's first market house (on the site of the present town hall) was built in 1684.\n\nIn 1690, the Duke of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], a Williamite general, used Galgorm Castle as his headquarters. [[Robert Adair (politician)|Sir Robert Adair]] raised a Regiment of Foot for [[William III of England|King William III]] and fought at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\n[[File:Ballymena Church Street Tower of old Parish Church SE 2014 09 15.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of the 1707 church.

In 1707, the first [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ([[Church of Ireland]]) parish church was built. In 1740, the original Ballymena Castle burned down. The [[Gracehill]] [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] settlement was founded in 1765. During the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], Ballymena was occupied from 7 to 9 June by a force of around 10,000 [[United Irishmen]]. They stormed the Market House (now the Town Hall), killing three of its defenders.\n\nThe first modern [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic]] Church in Ballymena was consecrated in 1827. By 1834 the population of Ballymena was about 4,000. In 1848 the [[Belfast and Ballymena Railway]] was established. In 1865 [[Robert Adair, 1st Baron Waveney|Robert Alexander Shafto Adair]] (late [[Baron Waveney]]) started building Ballymena Castle, a magnificent family residence, in the Demesne. The castle was not completed until 1887.\n\nIn 1870 [[The People's Park, Ballymena|The People's Park]] was established.\n\n===Twentieth century===\n[[File:Church Street, Ballymena, Co. Antrim (26482362184).jpg|thumb|Church Street, Ballymena, in the early 1900s]]\nIn 1900, Ballymena assumed urban status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballymena.gov.uk/historyandheritage.asp |accessdate=15 July 2007 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713231430/http://www.ballymena.gov.uk/historyandheritage.asp |archivedate=13 July 2007 }}</ref> Under the provisions of the [[Irish Land Act]] of 1903, the Adairs disposed of most of their Ballymena estate to the occupying tenants in 1904. The \"old\" town hall building, which also contained the post office and estate office, burned down in 1919. [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert]], [[Duke of York]] (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]) laid the cornerstone to the new town hall on 24 July 1924, and it was officially opened on 20 November 1928.\n\nThe Urban District Council petitioned for borough status and the Charter was granted in December 1937. The first meeting of councillors as a borough Council was held on 23 May 1939. The population of Ballymena reached 13,000. Ballymena Castle was demolished in the 1950s. In 1973, the Urban and Rural District Councils were merged to create  [[Ballymena (borough)|Ballymena Borough Council]]. Following local government reoganisation in 2015, the Borough Council was merged with the Boroughs of [[Carrickfergus|Carrickfergus Borough Council]] and [[Larne|Larne Borough Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/local-government-reform |title=Local government reform |website=Nidirect.gov.uk |date= 27 October 2015|accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref> During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Ballymena was home to a large number of evacuees from [[Gibraltar]].

Many young men who had been conscripted on the United Kingdom mainland, along with others who had volunteered for service in the British Army, embarked upon their period of basic training in the Regimental Depot, prior to being posted to the regular regimental battalions. Many of these young men were to serve in Korea, Cyprus and with the British Army of the Rhine. In 1968 due to a series of government austerity measures, the remaining three Irish regiments, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (27th) Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th) and the Royal Irish Fusiliers (89th) merged to become the Royal Irish Rangers. Early in the 1990s the [[The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)|Royal Irish Regiment]], whose Regimental Headquarters was at St Patrick's Barracks, was granted the Freedom of the Borough.\n\nLike other towns in Northern Ireland, [[The Troubles in Ballymena|Ballymena was affected by the Troubles]], a lengthy period of religious and partisan tensions and armed confrontations from the 1960s through 1998. A total of eleven people were killed in or near the town by the IRA and various [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] groups.\n\nDuring the later half of the 20th century, Ballymena, like many other once prosperous industrial centres in Northern Ireland, experienced economic change and industrial restructuring; many of its former factories closed. Since the 2010s Ballymena has seen a decline in its retail and manufacturing sectors. Both [[Michelin]] and JTI have left the area. Local firm [[Wrightbus]] is also struggling citing a downturn in orders. It is hoped that the creation of a manufacturing hub at the former Michelin site will attract businesses to the area.\n\nIn March 2000, the actor [[Liam Neeson]], a native of Ballymena, was offered the [[freedom of the city|freedom of the borough]] by the council, which approved the action by a 12\u20139 vote. The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] objected to the offer and drew attention to his comments from an interview in 1999 with an American political magazine, ''[[George (magazine)|George]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Neeson declined the award, citing tensions, and affirmed he was proud of his connection to the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1410198,00.html|title='Did you ever do the dead man's shuffle?'|author=Xan Brooks|newspaper=the Guardian|date=11 February 2005}}</ref> [[Ian Paisley]] was eventually made a freeman of Ballymena in December 2004 instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/article.asp?printerFriendly=true&ArtKey=ballymena |title=EIPS \u2013 Dr Paisley Given The Freedom Of Ballymena |website=Ianpaisley.org |date= |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nBallymena is described by some observers as being at the heart of [[Northern Ireland]]'s equivalent of the [[Bible Belt]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/drugs/Story/0,2763,439125,00.html|title=Drugs secret lurks in Ulster's Bible belt|author=Rosie Cowan|newspaper=the Guardian|date=17 February 2001}}</ref> It has a large Protestant majority.

It is part of the Borough of [[Mid and East Antrim]]. It had a population of 29,551 people at the [[United Kingdom census, 2011|2011 Census]].<ref name=Census2011/>\n\nThe town is built on land given to the Adair family by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1626, on the basis that the town holds two annual fairs and a free Saturday market in perpetuity. {{As of|2018}}, the Saturday market still runs. It is a popular shopping hub within Northern Ireland and is home to [[Ballymena United F.C.]]\n\nBallymena incorporates an area of {{convert|632|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}} and is home to large villages such as [[Cullybackey]], [[Galgorm Parks|Galgorm]], [[Ahoghill]] and [[Broughshane]]. The town used to host Ireland's largest one-day agricultural show at the Ballymena Showgrounds. The town centre has many historic buildings. The Town Hall was built in 1924 on the site of the old Market House, and was refurbished in 2007 at a cost of roughly \u00a320 million.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe recorded history of the Ballymena area dates to the [[Early Christian]] period from the 5th to the 7th centuries. [[Ringfort]]s are found in the [[townland]] of Ballykeel and a site known as Camphill Fort in the townland of Ballee may also have been of this type. There are a number of [[souterrain]] sites within a {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km}} radius of the centre of Ballymena.\n\n{{convert|2|mi|spell=In|abbr=off}} north in the townland of Kirkinriola, the ancient parish church and graveyard possess several indicators of Early Christian settlement, including a souterrain. Also in 1868, a gravedigger found a large stone slab on which was carved a cross with the inscription ''ord do degen''. This refers to Bishop Degen, who lived in Ireland during the 7th century. This stone is now in the porch of [[St Patrick's Church, Ballymena|St. Patrick's Church of Ireland]], at the end of Castle Street.\n\nAt the end of the 5th century, a church was founded in Connor, {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} south of Ballymena. This was followed by a monastery at Templemoyle, Kells. In 831, however, the [[Nordic countries|Norse]] invaded the Ballymena area and burned the church.\n\nIn the 12th century, the [[Normans]] conquered much of [[County Antrim]] and [[County Down]] after having taken over England the century before. They created the core of the [[Earl of Ulster|Earldom of Ulster]]. During this campaign, they built great mounds of earth topped by wooden towers, referred to as ''mottes'', as defensive structures. The Harryville ([[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]]: ''Herrieville'') area's [[motte-and-bailey]] is one of the best examples of this type of fortification in Northern Ireland. Some sources{{who|date=February 2011}}, however, credit the [[Loughinsholin|U\u00ed Fhloinn]] with building the mid-Antrim mottes and baileys in imitation of the invaders; the U\u00ed Fhloinn defeated and repelled the Earl of Ulster, [[John de Courcy]], in 1177 and 1178.\n\nIn 1315, [[Edward Bruce]] (brother of King [[Robert I of Scotland]], known as \"Robert Bruce\") invaded Ireland. On 10 September 1315, at the Battle of Tawnybrack ({{convert|5|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} south of Ballymena at Kells), Edward conquered the army of [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster|Richard De Burgo]], the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Earl of Ulster]].\n\n===Post-medieval===\nIn 1576, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] granted land, including the town of Ballymena, to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]. The lands had been forfeited to the crown after Shane O'Neill's resistance in the 1560s. Smith brought English settlers to the area, among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. By 1581, Smith's settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.\n\nOn 10 May 1607, [[James I of England|King James I]] granted the native Irish chief, Ruair\u00ed \u00d3g MacQuillan the Ballymena Estate. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland. The estate was temporarily renamed \"Kinhilstown\" after Adair's lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early 17th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid. In 1626 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate; they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.\n\nIn 1641, the local Ballymena garrison were defeated by Irish rebels in the battle of Bundooragh. Ballymena's first market house (on the site of the present town hall) was built in 1684.\n\nIn 1690, the Duke of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], a Williamite general, used Galgorm Castle as his headquarters. [[Robert Adair (politician)|Sir Robert Adair]] raised a Regiment of Foot for [[William III of England|King William III]] and fought at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\n[[File:Ballymena Church Street Tower of old Parish Church SE 2014 09 15.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of the 1707 church.

In 1707, the first [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ([[Church of Ireland]]) parish church was built. In 1740, the original Ballymena Castle burned down. The [[Gracehill]] [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] settlement was founded in 1765. During the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], Ballymena was occupied from 7 to 9 June by a force of around 10,000 [[United Irishmen]]. They stormed the Market House (now the Town Hall), killing three of its defenders.\n\nThe first modern [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic]] Church in Ballymena was consecrated in 1827. By 1834 the population of Ballymena was about 4,000. In 1848 the [[Belfast and Ballymena Railway]] was established. In 1865 [[Robert Adair, 1st Baron Waveney|Robert Alexander Shafto Adair]] (late [[Baron Waveney]]) started building Ballymena Castle, a magnificent family residence, in the Demesne. The castle was not completed until 1887.\n\nIn 1870 [[The People's Park, Ballymena|The People's Park]] was established.\n\n===Twentieth century===\n[[File:Church Street, Ballymena, Co.

The \"old\" town hall building, which also contained the post office and estate office, burned down in 1919. [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert]], [[Duke of York]] (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]) laid the cornerstone to the new town hall on 24 July 1924, and it was officially opened on 20 November 1928.\n\nThe Urban District Council petitioned for borough status and the Charter was granted in December 1937. The first meeting of councillors as a borough Council was held on 23 May 1939. The population of Ballymena reached 13,000. Ballymena Castle was demolished in the 1950s. In 1973, the Urban and Rural District Councils were merged to create  [[Ballymena (borough)|Ballymena Borough Council]]. Following local government reoganisation in 2015, the Borough Council was merged with the Boroughs of [[Carrickfergus|Carrickfergus Borough Council]] and [[Larne|Larne Borough Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/local-government-reform |title=Local government reform |website=Nidirect.gov.uk |date= 27 October 2015|accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref> During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Ballymena was home to a large number of evacuees from [[Gibraltar]].

Many young men who had been conscripted on the United Kingdom mainland, along with others who had volunteered for service in the British Army, embarked upon their period of basic training in the Regimental Depot, prior to being posted to the regular regimental battalions. Many of these young men were to serve in Korea, Cyprus and with the British Army of the Rhine. In 1968 due to a series of government austerity measures, the remaining three Irish regiments, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (27th) Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th) and the Royal Irish Fusiliers (89th) merged to become the Royal Irish Rangers. Early in the 1990s the [[The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)|Royal Irish Regiment]], whose Regimental Headquarters was at St Patrick's Barracks, was granted the Freedom of the Borough.\n\nLike other towns in Northern Ireland, [[The Troubles in Ballymena|Ballymena was affected by the Troubles]], a lengthy period of religious and partisan tensions and armed confrontations from the 1960s through 1998. A total of eleven people were killed in or near the town by the IRA and various [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] groups.\n\nDuring the later half of the 20th century, Ballymena, like many other once prosperous industrial centres in Northern Ireland, experienced economic change and industrial restructuring; many of its former factories closed. Since the 2010s Ballymena has seen a decline in its retail and manufacturing sectors. Both [[Michelin]] and JTI have left the area. Local firm [[Wrightbus]] is also struggling citing a downturn in orders. It is hoped that the creation of a manufacturing hub at the former Michelin site will attract businesses to the area.\n\nIn March 2000, the actor [[Liam Neeson]], a native of Ballymena, was offered the [[freedom of the city|freedom of the borough]] by the council, which approved the action by a 12\u20139 vote. The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] objected to the offer and drew attention to his comments from an interview in 1999 with an American political magazine, ''[[George (magazine)|George]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Neeson declined the award, citing tensions, and affirmed he was proud of his connection to the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1410198,00.html|title='Did you ever do the dead man's shuffle?'|author=Xan Brooks|newspaper=the Guardian|date=11 February 2005}}</ref> [[Ian Paisley]] was eventually made a freeman of Ballymena in December 2004 instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/article.asp?printerFriendly=true&ArtKey=ballymena |title=EIPS \u2013 Dr Paisley Given The Freedom Of Ballymena |website=Ianpaisley.org |date= |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nBallymena is described by some observers as being at the heart of [[Northern Ireland]]'s equivalent of the [[Bible Belt]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/drugs/Story/0,2763,439125,00.html|title=Drugs secret lurks in Ulster's Bible belt|author=Rosie Cowan|newspaper=the Guardian|date=17 February 2001}}</ref> It has a large Protestant majority.
