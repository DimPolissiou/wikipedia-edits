The motion was not upheld and Gregorson Campbell became the minister of both parishes,{{r|Herald}} a position he held for thirty years.{{sfnp|Nutt|1895|p=xi|ps=none}}\n\n==Folklore collections==\nInterest in mythology and folklore gained momentum in the last quarter of the 19th century, probably fuelled by the contentious debates surrounding the authenticity of the ''[[Ossian]]'' poems published by [[James Macpherson]] during the 1760s.{{sfnp|Cheape|1993|p=118|ps=none}} Gregorson Campbell continued to build on the collection he started during his period of recuperation around 1858, preserving the traditional tales as quoted at the time. The folklorist [[John Francis Campbell]] (1822\u201385), also known as Campbell of [[Islay]], had his first mythology books published in 1860{{sfnp|Dorson|1999|p=393|ps=none}} and he corresponded with Gregorson Campbell. Both men were fluent in several languages, including [[Scottish Gaelic]], and their letters discuss the variations in the folk tales, with Campbell of Islay stating: \"I have about 16 versions of one story in Gaelic, and no two have the same name.\"{{sfnp|Campbell|Gregorson Campbell|1895|pp=138\u2013139|ps=none}}\n\nGregorson Campbell had his own style of collating legends, meticulously transcribing the stories as dictated by the individual storytellers, and only rarely interspersing tales with his own comments.{{sfnp|Griffiths|Morton|2010|p=13|ps=none}} Christian ministers in Scotland differed in their attitudes towards the traditional beliefs and myths perpetuated by their parishioners, and were often dismissive of what they considered to be [[superstition]] and [[paganism]], but Gregorson Campbell persisted in enthusiastically adding to his collection throughout the late 1800s.{{sfnp|Griffiths|Morton|2010|p=141|ps=none}} He was concerned that the intolerance shown by some of his fellow collectors towards the illiterate Gaelic-speaking storytellers and those who believed in the myths would result in the loss of a valuable resource, as he regarded the narrators as having \"powers of mind of a highest order\".{{sfnp|Davis|1992|p=216|ps=none}}\n\n===Published work===\n[[File:GregorsonCampbellFionn (cropped).jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Line drawing by E.

The Gaelic Society of Inverness published some of the tales, also given in Gaelic with an English translation, from 1888 until 1892.{{sfnp|Nutt|1895|p=xiv|ps=none}} The first of these in 1888, \"Sir Olave O'Corn\", also involved a King of Ireland and included some explanatory notes from Gregorson Campbell.{{sfnp|Gregorson Campbell|1888|pp=69\u201381|ps=none}} ''Celtic Magazine'' and ''Highland Monthly'' were two other journals that published some of his folklore.{{sfnp|Nutt|1895|pp=xiv\u2013xv}} Some of these were reprinted in the first compendium of Gregorson Campbell's collection, ''The Fians'', a set of traditional tales and verses about combat printed as part of the Argyllshire series of books in 1891.{{sfnp|Nutt|1895|p=xv}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nGregorson Campbell's health deteriorated in the last years of his life, especially after the death of his mother Helen at the Tiree [[manse]] in 1890; he died on 22 November 1891 before seeing the final printed edition of ''The Fians''.{{sfnp|Nutt|1895|p=xii|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Maier|2000|p=56|ps=none}} Alfred Nutt, fellow folklorist and publisher, chronicled details of Gregorson Campbell's life as an introduction to the second compilation of Gregorson Campbell's collection of myths, ''Clan Traditions and Popular Tales of the Western Highlands and Islands'', published in 1895.{{sfnp|Dorson|1999|p=411|ps=none}} Two other books were published posthumously: ''Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland'' in 1900, and ''Witchcraft and Second Sight in the West Highlands'' the following year.{{sfnp|Maier|2000|p=56|ps=none}}\n\n[[Richard Dorson]], American author and director of the Folklore Institute at Indiana University, describes Gregorson Campbell as worthy of a \"front rank among [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] folklorists\"{{sfnp|Dorson|1999|p=412|ps=none}} and Sophia Kingshill, author and folklorist, felt his writing was \"vivid and engaging\".{{sfnp|Kingshill|2012|p=xi|ps=none}} Contemporary praise was not entirely universal; an anonymous review of ''Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland'' included in ''The Scottish Antiquary, Or, Northern Notes & Queries'' (now ''[[The Scottish Historical Review]]'') in 1901 described the work as \"a book of considerable pretension\" and stated it was in need of proofreading, citing several printing errors.{{sfnp|Anonymous|1901|pp=170\u2013171|ps=none}}\n\n==References==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist|notes=}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Aberdeen\">\n{{citation |work=The [[Aberdeen Journal]]|date=20 March 1861 |issue=5906 |p=6 |title=Scotland |publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000031/18610320/119/0006?browse=true |url-access=subscription }}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Herald\">\n{{citation |newspaper=[[Glasgow Herald]] |date=1 June 1861 |issue=6673 |title=Established Church Assembly |url=http://find.galegroup.com/dvnw/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=DVNW&userGroupName=aber&tabID=T003&docPage=article&docId=BB3203514020&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0 |url-access=subscription }}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation |author=Anonymous |journal=The Scottish Antiquary, or, Northern Notes and Queries |volume=15 |issue=59 |date=January 1901 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |title=Review |jstor=25517009}}{{subscription required}}\n*{{citation |first=John Francis|last=Campbell |first2=John |last2=Gregorson Campbell |contribution=Correspondence between J.
