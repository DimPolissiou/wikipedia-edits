These elections formed part of the [[2018 United States elections]]. Other coinciding elections were the [[2018 United States Senate elections]] and the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections]]. The last regular gubernatorial elections for all but three of the states took place in [[2014 United States gubernatorial elections|2014]]. Governors in New Hampshire and Vermont serve two-year terms, meaning that their most recent gubernatorial elections took place in [[2016 United States gubernatorial elections|2016]]. Meanwhile, Oregon held a special election in 2016 to fill an unexpired term.\n\nMany of the states holding gubernatorial elections [[Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|have term limits]] which made some multi-term governors ineligible for re-election. Two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors were term-limited while six incumbent Democratic governors were eligible for re-election. Among [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governors, twelve were term-limited while eleven could seek re-election. One [[Independent politician|independent]] governor was eligible for re-election.\n\nElections were held in 26 of the 33 states with Republican governors, 9 of the 16 states with Democratic governors, 1 state (Alaska) with an independent governor, 2 territories (Guam and Northern Mariana Islands) with Republican governors, 1 territory (U.S. Virgin Islands) with an independent governor and the District of Columbia with a Democratic mayor. Incumbent state governors running to be reelected included 14 Republicans, 5 Democrats and 1 independent. Territorial incumbents running included one Republican and one independent. The incumbent Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C. also ran for re-election.\n\nDemocrats gained control of 9 state and territorial governorships that had previously been held by Republicans and an independent. They picked up Republican-held open seats in the states of [[2018 Kansas gubernatorial election|Kansas]], [[2018 Maine gubernatorial election|Maine]], [[2018 Michigan gubernatorial election|Michigan]], [[2018 Nevada gubernatorial election|Nevada]] and [[2018 New Mexico gubernatorial election|New Mexico]], in addition to defeating Republican incumbents in [[2018 Illinois gubernatorial election|Illinois]] and [[2018 Wisconsin gubernatorial election|Wisconsin]] and not losing any seats of their own. Additionally, they won the Republican controlled territory of ([[2018 Guamanian gubernatorial election|Guam]]) and the independent controlled territory of the ([[2018 United States Virgin Islands gubernatorial election|U.S. Virgin Islands]]). Republicans won the governorship of [[2018 Alaska gubernatorial election|Alaska]] previously held by an independent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-governor-elections.html|title=Governor Election Results: Democrats Retake Several States|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2018|accessdate=December 11, 2018}}</ref> Democrats also won the total popular vote for the year's gubernatorial elections for the second year in a row.\n\n== Nominations ==\nIn 2018, all states held primary elections to decide major nominees for the general election.  California held a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] to select nominees while the other 35 states held partisan primaries.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329020377|title=Changing Outcomes: Electoral Competition in the Gubernatorial Primaries of 2018|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> Nominations were contested except in Democratic primaries in Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Alaska and in Republican primaries in New Mexico, Iowa, Maryland, New Hampshire and New York.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Because the primary did not yield a candidate winning the state-required minimum share of the vote, runoff elections were held for Republican nominations in South Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma as well as for the Democratic nomination in Texas, four of the ten states with a runoff requirement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Runoff_election|title=Runoff election|website=Ballotpedia|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> In Georgia and Oklahoma, the runoff reversed the order of finish in the first primary.\n\nOn average, there were 4.5 candidates per contested gubernatorial nomination and the average nominee received 61% of the vote cast.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The extent of competition varied widely across primaries, both within and across states. For the Republican nominations in Texas and Wisconsin and the Democratic nomination in Oregon, only the winner received 9% or more of the vote case\u2014one-sided elections.

These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use \"<u>tossup</u>\" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, \"<u>lean</u>\" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, \"<u>likely\" or \"favored</u>\" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage and \"<u>safe\" or \"solid</u>\" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a \"<u>tilt</u>\" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the \"lean\" rating would indicate (except Fox News, where \"likely\" is the highest rating given). Governors whose names are in parentheses are not contesting the election.\n<!-- Colors:\nstyle=\"background:#f66\"|{{sort|104|Safe R}}\nstyle=\"background:#f99\"|{{sort|103|Likely R}}\nstyle=\"background:#fcc\"|{{sort|102|Lean R}}\nstyle=\"background:#fdd\"|{{sort|101|Tilt R}}\n{{sort|100|Tossup}}\nstyle=\"background:#ddf\"|{{sort|099|Tilt D}}\nstyle=\"background:#ccf\"|{{sort|098|Lean D}}\nstyle=\"background:#99f\"|{{sort|097|Likely D}}\nstyle=\"background:#66f\"|{{sort|096|Safe D}}\n-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

gubernatorial elections''' were held on November 6, 2018 in 36 states and three territories. These elections formed part of the [[2018 United States elections]]. Other coinciding elections were the [[2018 United States Senate elections]] and the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections]]. The last regular gubernatorial elections for all but three of the states took place in [[2014 United States gubernatorial elections|2014]]. Governors in New Hampshire and Vermont serve two-year terms, meaning that their most recent gubernatorial elections took place in [[2016 United States gubernatorial elections|2016]]. Meanwhile, Oregon held a special election in 2016 to fill an unexpired term.\n\nMany of the states holding gubernatorial elections [[Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|have term limits]] which made some multi-term governors ineligible for re-election. Two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors were term-limited while six incumbent Democratic governors were eligible for re-election. Among [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governors, twelve were term-limited while eleven could seek re-election. One [[Independent politician|independent]] governor was eligible for re-election.\n\nElections were held in 26 of the 33 states with Republican governors, 9 of the 16 states with Democratic governors, 1 state (Alaska) with an independent governor, 2 territories (Guam and Northern Mariana Islands) with Republican governors, 1 territory (U.S. Virgin Islands) with an independent governor and the District of Columbia with a Democratic mayor. Incumbent state governors running to be reelected included 14 Republicans, 5 Democrats and 1 independent. Territorial incumbents running included one Republican and one independent. The incumbent Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C. also ran for re-election.\n\nDemocrats gained control of 9 state and territorial governorships that had previously been held by Republicans and an independent. They picked up Republican-held open seats in the states of [[2018 Kansas gubernatorial election|Kansas]], [[2018 Maine gubernatorial election|Maine]], [[2018 Michigan gubernatorial election|Michigan]], [[2018 Nevada gubernatorial election|Nevada]] and [[2018 New Mexico gubernatorial election|New Mexico]], in addition to defeating Republican incumbents in [[2018 Illinois gubernatorial election|Illinois]] and [[2018 Wisconsin gubernatorial election|Wisconsin]] and not losing any seats of their own. Additionally, they won the Republican controlled territory of ([[2018 Guamanian gubernatorial election|Guam]]) and the independent controlled territory of the ([[2018 United States Virgin Islands gubernatorial election|U.S. Virgin Islands]]). Republicans won the governorship of [[2018 Alaska gubernatorial election|Alaska]] previously held by an independent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-governor-elections.html|title=Governor Election Results: Democrats Retake Several States|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2018|accessdate=December 11, 2018}}</ref> Democrats also won the total popular vote for the year's gubernatorial elections for the second year in a row.\n\n== Nominations ==\nIn 2018, all states held primary elections to decide major nominees for the general election.  California held a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] to select nominees while the other 35 states held partisan primaries.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329020377|title=Changing Outcomes: Electoral Competition in the Gubernatorial Primaries of 2018|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> Nominations were contested except in Democratic primaries in Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Alaska and in Republican primaries in New Mexico, Iowa, Maryland, New Hampshire and New York.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Because the primary did not yield a candidate winning the state-required minimum share of the vote, runoff elections were held for Republican nominations in South Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma as well as for the Democratic nomination in Texas, four of the ten states with a runoff requirement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Runoff_election|title=Runoff election|website=Ballotpedia|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> In Georgia and Oklahoma, the runoff reversed the order of finish in the first primary.\n\nOn average, there were 4.5 candidates per contested gubernatorial nomination and the average nominee received 61% of the vote cast.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The extent of competition varied widely across primaries, both within and across states.

These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use \"<u>tossup</u>\" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, \"<u>lean</u>\" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, \"<u>likely\" or \"favored</u>\" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage and \"<u>safe\" or \"solid</u>\" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a \"<u>tilt</u>\" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the \"lean\" rating would indicate (except Fox News, where \"likely\" is the highest rating given). Governors whose names are in parentheses are not contesting the election.\n<!-- Colors:\nstyle=\"background:#f66\"|{{sort|104|Safe R}}\nstyle=\"background:#f99\"|{{sort|103|Likely R}}\nstyle=\"background:#fcc\"|{{sort|102|Lean R}}\nstyle=\"background:#fdd\"|{{sort|101|Tilt R}}\n{{sort|100|Tossup}}\nstyle=\"background:#ddf\"|{{sort|099|Tilt D}}\nstyle=\"background:#ccf\"|{{sort|098|Lean D}}\nstyle=\"background:#99f\"|{{sort|097|Likely D}}\nstyle=\"background:#66f\"|{{sort|096|Safe D}}\n-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

New perspectives}}</ref> The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.\n\nEuropean Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each \"neo\"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765\u20131830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The \"Rococo\" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, \"corrected\" and \"restored\" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.\n\nThe [[Empire style]], a second phase of Neoclassicism in architecture and the [[decorative arts]], had its cultural centre in Paris in the [[Napoleonic era]].\n\n==History==\nNeoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,<ref name=Irwin>{{cite book| title=Neoclassicism A&I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher=Phaidon Press| year=1997| pages=| isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/neoclassicism0000irwi}}</ref> which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.<ref>Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21</ref> While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered.

His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' (\"History of Ancient Art\", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\",<ref>Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted</ref> and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find \"not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone\". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: \"The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients\".<ref>Both quotes from the first pages of \"Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture\"</ref>\n\nWith the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}</ref> \"Neoclassicism\" in each art implies a particular canon of a \"classical\" model.\n\nIn English, the term \"Neoclassicism\" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and \"Neoclassicism\" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.<ref>Honour, 21</ref>\n\n[[File:Anton Raphael Mengs - Das Urteil des Paris (ca. 1757).jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]]; ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''; circa 1757; oil on canvas; height: 226 cm, width: 295 cm, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio; [[Hermitage Museum]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nThe term \"Neoclassical\" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as \"the true style\", \"reformed\" and \"revival\"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.<ref>Honour, 11, 23-25</ref> [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.\n\nNeoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.<ref>Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21</ref>\n\nAs for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much \"Neoclassical\" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally being on the winning side.<ref>Honour, 43-62</ref>\n\n==Painting and printmaking==\n{{see also|Capriccio (art)}}\n[[File:View of the so-called Temple of Concord with the Temple of Saturn, on the right the Arch of Septimius Severus MET DP837542.jpg|thumb|''View of the so-called Temple of Concord with the Temple of Saturn, on the right the Arch of Septimius Severus''; by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]; 1760\u20131778; [[etching]]; size of the entire sheet: 53.8 x 79.2 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\n\nIt is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as \"insipid\" and \"almost entirely uninteresting to us\"\u2014some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],<ref>Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)</ref> by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as \"the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times\".<ref>Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)</ref> The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium<ref>Honour, 113-114</ref>) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once \"fired the artistic youth of Europe\" but are now \"neglected\",<ref>Honour, 14</ref> while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having \"an unctuous softness and tediousness\" by [[Fritz Novotny]].<ref>Novotny, 62</ref>  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. \n[[File:Jacques-Louis David, Le Serment des Horaces.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Oath of the Horatii]]''; by [[Jacques-Louis David]]; 1784; oil on canvas; height: 330 cm, width: 425 cm; [[Louvre]]]]\n\nThe work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\".<ref>Novotny, 51-54</ref> Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' (\"Imaginary Prisons\") whose \"oppressive cyclopean architecture\" conveys \"dreams of fear and frustration\".<ref>Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57</ref> The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the \"Gothic\" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.\n\nNeoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].<ref>Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22</ref>\n\nDavid's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.<ref>Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nGiovanni Pauolo Panini - Fantasy View with the Pantheon and other Monuments of Ancient Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|''Fantasy view with the Pantheon and other monuments of Ancient Rome'', an example of a [[capriccio (art)|capriccio]]; 1737; oil on canvas; 98.9 x 137.49&nbsp;cm; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Houston, Texas|Huston]], US)\n\nLarge sculpture gallery built on arches and lit from above . . .

His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.<ref>Novotny, 378\u2013379</ref><ref>Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930</ref>\n\n[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.<ref>Novotny, 379-384</ref> All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.\n\nAn early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].<ref>Novotny, 384-385</ref> [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,<ref>Novotny, 388-389</ref> with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive \"character heads\" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.<ref>Novotny, 390-392</ref> Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.\n\nSince prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,<ref>Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11</ref> the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Harriet Hosmer]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPoetry and Music by Claude Michel, called Clodion, c. 1774-1778, marble - National Gallery of Art, Washington - DSC08957.JPG|''Poetry and Music''; by [[Claude Michel]], called Clodion; circa 1774\u20131778; marble; [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]])\n\nCupid and Psyche MET DP248228.jpg|''Cupid and Psyche''; by [[Antonio Canova]]; 1794; plaster; overall: 134.6 \u00d7 151.1 \u00d7 81.3&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArtemisia in Mourning MET DP236931.jpg|''Artemisia in mourning''; by Philipp Jakob Scheffauer; 1794; marble; height: 50.2&nbsp;cm, width: 30&nbsp;cm, depth: 5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCanova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|''Hebe'' by Antonio Canova; 1800\u20131805; marble; height: 158&nbsp;cm; in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)\n\nPerseus with the Head of Medusa MET DP249451.jpg|[[Perseus]] with the head of [[Medusa]]; by Antonio Canova; 1804\u20131806; marble; height: 242.6&nbsp;cm, width: 191.8&nbsp;cm, depth: 102.9&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nPaolina Borghese (Canova).jpg|''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]''; by [[Antonio Canova]]; 1805\u20131808; marble; [[Galleria Borghese]] (Rome)\n\nFilatrice MET DT6964.jpg|''Filatrice''; by [[Henry Kirke Brown]]; 1850; bronze; 50.8 x 30.5 x 20.3&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nFile:Emotions X.jpg|One of the \"character heads\" of [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] \n</gallery>\n\n==Architecture and the decorative arts==\n{{Main|Neoclassical architecture}}\n[[File:Syon House, Long Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Adam style]], interior of [[Syon House]] in London, designed by [[Robert Adam]] in 1760s]]\n[[File:Etrurisches Zimmer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|\"The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] room\", from [[Potsdam]] (Germany), illustration by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Klose]] in circa 1840]]\n\nNeoclassical art was traditional and new, historical and modern, conservative and progressive all at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alisson Lee|title=Historical dictionary of neoclassical art and architecture.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nNeoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden, Poland and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.\n\nA second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the \"Louis XVI style\", and the second in the styles called \"Directoire\" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built \"[[United States Capitol|capitol]]\" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and \"black basaltes\" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.\n\nIndoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,<ref name=\"Gontar\">Gontar</ref> with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichit\u00e0 di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most \"Roman\" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary.\n\nTechniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Cama\u00efeu|en cama\u00efeu]]'' (\"like cameos\"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of \"Pompeiian red\" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Go\u00fbt grec]]'' (\"Greek style\"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the \"Louis XVI\" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: \"Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another\".<ref>Honour, 110\u2013111, 110 quoted</ref>\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison - Appartement de Jos\u00e9phine 003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos\u00e9phine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]\n\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,<ref name=\"Gontar\"/> the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] \"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\".<ref>Honour, 171\u2013184, 171 quoted</ref> An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and \"Louis Seize\", or Louis XVI, in France.\n\nNeoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond\u2014a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s \u2014, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.\n\nGothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, \"romantic\" appearance.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCup and cover, made by Louisa Courtauld and George Cowles (1771-72).jpg|Cup with cover; by [[Louisa Courtauld]] and [[George Cowles (silversmith)|George Cowles]]; 1771\u20131772; silver; height: 38.1&nbsp;cm\n\nGiovanni Ottaviani - Plate IX from Loggie di Rafaele nel Vaticano - Google Art Project.jpg|Plate with various ornaments and patterns; 1772\u20131777; brush and watercolor and gouache over etching on white wove paper; [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]] (New York City)\n\nRobert and James Adam.

Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette R\u00e9camier]], [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], [[Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: \"''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''\" (\"One could not be more sumptuously undressed\"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.<ref>Hunt, 244</ref> Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.\n\nVery light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated\u2014for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.<ref>Hunt, 244-245</ref>  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.\n\nNeoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. Even when David designed a new French \"national costume\" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.\n\nThe trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.\n\nClassically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French \"\u00e0 la Titus\" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,<ref>Hunt, 243</ref> and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that \"more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''\u00e0 la Titus''.<ref>Rifelj, 35</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Hamilton Palmyra.JPG|''[[James Dawkins (1722-1757)|James Dawkins]] and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'', by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1758)\nFile:Jacques-Louis David Henriette de Verninac 1799.jpg|''[[Madame Raymond de Verninac]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], with clothes and chair in [[Directoire style]]. \"Year 7\": that is, 1798\u201399.\nFile:Jacques-Louis David 016.jpg|''[[Portrait of Madame R\u00e9camier]]'', David, 1800\nFile:Elizabeth Alexeevna with mirror by J.L.Mosnier (1802, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|[[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Elizabeth Alexeievna]], Empress of Russia and no political radical, in 1802\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Later Neoclassicism==\n[[File:NatGal.jpg|thumb|The West building (1941) of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, with the East Building (1978) and the [[United States Capitol]] visible behind and to the left]]\n{{Classicism}}\nIn American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890\u20131917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.\n\nConservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as \"reactionary\", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked \"progressive\". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts D\u00e9coratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann|\u00c9.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis S\u00fce|S\u00fce]] & [[Andr\u00e9 Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].\n\nThere was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th-century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)\n\nThis literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.\n\n===In music===\n[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music|Classical]] and [[baroque music|Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music|Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed \"classical\" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]].\n\nThe 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino|Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound to which the Neoclassicists aspired. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.\n\n=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===\n[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]\nIn 1905\u20131914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]\n\nWith the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.\n\nNeoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including \"exported\" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.\n\n===Architecture in the 21st century===\n{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}\n[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]\n\nAfter a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.\n\nAs of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html|title=Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism}}</ref> Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.\n\nFor sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].<ref>[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] \u2013 ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014</ref>\n\nIn the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.\n\nIn Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[American Empire (style)]]\n*[[Antiquization]]\n*[[Nazi architecture]]\n*[[Neoclassical architecture]]\n*[[Neoclassicism in France]]\n*[[Neo-Grec]], the late Greek-Revival style\n*[[1795\u20131820 in Western fashion]]\n*[[Skopje 2014]]\n*[[Stalinist architecture]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''The Romantic Rebellion: Romantic versus Classic Art'', 1976, Omega. {{ISBN|0-86007-718-7}}.\n* [[Hugh Honour|Honour, Hugh]], ''Neo-classicism.

Neoclassicism was born in Rome largely thanks to the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], at the time of the rediscovery of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their [[Grand Tour]] and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1189&dq=neoclassicism+originated+in.Rome#v=onepage&q=neoclassicism%20originated%20in.Rome&f=false | title=Oxford Dictionary of English| isbn=9780199571123| last1=Stevenson| first1=Angus| date=2010-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/978/|title=The road from Rome to Paris.

New perspectives}}</ref> The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.\n\nEuropean Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each \"neo\"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765\u20131830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The \"Rococo\" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, \"corrected\" and \"restored\" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.\n\nThe [[Empire style]], a second phase of Neoclassicism in architecture and the [[decorative arts]], had its cultural centre in Paris in the [[Napoleonic era]].\n\n==History==\nNeoclassicism is a western culture.

His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' (\"History of Ancient Art\", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\",<ref>Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted</ref> and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find \"not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone\". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: \"The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients\".<ref>Both quotes from the first pages of \"Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture\"</ref>\n\nWith the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}</ref> \"Neoclassicism\" in each art implies a particular canon of a \"classical\" model.\n\nIn English, the term \"Neoclassicism\" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and \"Neoclassicism\" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.<ref>Honour, 21</ref>\n\n[[File:Anton Raphael Mengs - Das Urteil des Paris (ca. 1757).jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]]; ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''; circa 1757; oil on canvas; height: 226 cm, width: 295 cm, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio; [[Hermitage Museum]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nThe term \"Neoclassical\" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as \"the true style\", \"reformed\" and \"revival\"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.<ref>Honour, 11, 23-25</ref> [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.\n\nNeoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.<ref>Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21</ref>\n\nAs for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much \"Neoclassical\" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally being on the winning side.<ref>Honour, 43-62</ref>\n\n==Painting and printmaking==\n{{see also|Capriccio (art)}}\n[[File:View of the so-called Temple of Concord with the Temple of Saturn, on the right the Arch of Septimius Severus MET DP837542.jpg|thumb|''View of the so-called Temple of Concord with the Temple of Saturn, on the right the Arch of Septimius Severus''; by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]; 1760\u20131778; [[etching]]; size of the entire sheet: 53.8 x 79.2 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\n\nIt is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as \"insipid\" and \"almost entirely uninteresting to us\"\u2014some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],<ref>Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)</ref> by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as \"the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times\".<ref>Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)</ref> The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium<ref>Honour, 113-114</ref>) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once \"fired the artistic youth of Europe\" but are now \"neglected\",<ref>Honour, 14</ref> while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having \"an unctuous softness and tediousness\" by [[Fritz Novotny]].<ref>Novotny, 62</ref>  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. \n[[File:Jacques-Louis David, Le Serment des Horaces.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Oath of the Horatii]]''; by [[Jacques-Louis David]]; 1784; oil on canvas; height: 330 cm, width: 425 cm; [[Louvre]]]]\n\nThe work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\".<ref>Novotny, 51-54</ref> Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' (\"Imaginary Prisons\") whose \"oppressive cyclopean architecture\" conveys \"dreams of fear and frustration\".<ref>Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57</ref> The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the \"Gothic\" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.\n\nNeoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].<ref>Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22</ref>\n\nDavid's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.<ref>Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nGiovanni Pauolo Panini - Fantasy View with the Pantheon and other Monuments of Ancient Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|''Fantasy view with the Pantheon and other monuments of Ancient Rome'', an example of a [[capriccio (art)|capriccio]]; 1737; oil on canvas; 98.9 x 137.49&nbsp;cm; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Houston, Texas|Huston]], US)\n\nLarge sculpture gallery built on arches and lit from above . . .

His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.<ref>Novotny, 378\u2013379</ref><ref>Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930</ref>\n\n[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.<ref>Novotny, 379-384</ref> All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.\n\nAn early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].<ref>Novotny, 384-385</ref> [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,<ref>Novotny, 388-389</ref> with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive \"character heads\" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.<ref>Novotny, 390-392</ref> Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.\n\nSince prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,<ref>Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11</ref> the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Harriet Hosmer]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPoetry and Music by Claude Michel, called Clodion, c. 1774-1778, marble - National Gallery of Art, Washington - DSC08957.JPG|''Poetry and Music''; by [[Claude Michel]], called Clodion; circa 1774\u20131778; marble; [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]])\n\nCupid and Psyche MET DP248228.jpg|''Cupid and Psyche''; by [[Antonio Canova]]; 1794; plaster; overall: 134.6 \u00d7 151.1 \u00d7 81.3&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArtemisia in Mourning MET DP236931.jpg|''Artemisia in mourning''; by Philipp Jakob Scheffauer; 1794; marble; height: 50.2&nbsp;cm, width: 30&nbsp;cm, depth: 5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCanova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|''Hebe'' by Antonio Canova; 1800\u20131805; marble; height: 158&nbsp;cm; in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)\n\nPerseus with the Head of Medusa MET DP249451.jpg|[[Perseus]] with the head of [[Medusa]]; by Antonio Canova; 1804\u20131806; marble; height: 242.6&nbsp;cm, width: 191.8&nbsp;cm, depth: 102.9&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nPaolina Borghese (Canova).jpg|''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]''; by [[Antonio Canova]]; 1805\u20131808; marble; [[Galleria Borghese]] (Rome)\n\nFilatrice MET DT6964.jpg|''Filatrice''; by [[Henry Kirke Brown]]; 1850; bronze; 50.8 x 30.5 x 20.3&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nFile:Emotions X.jpg|One of the \"character heads\" of [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] \n</gallery>\n\n==Architecture and the decorative arts==\n{{Main|Neoclassical architecture}}\n[[File:Syon House, Long Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Adam style]], interior of [[Syon House]] in London, designed by [[Robert Adam]] in 1760s]]\n[[File:Etrurisches Zimmer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|\"The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] room\", from [[Potsdam]] (Germany), illustration by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Klose]] in circa 1840]]\n\nNeoclassical art was traditional and new, historical and modern, conservative and progressive all at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alisson Lee|title=Historical dictionary of neoclassical art and architecture.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nNeoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden, Poland and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.\n\nA second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the \"Louis XVI style\", and the second in the styles called \"Directoire\" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built \"[[United States Capitol|capitol]]\" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and \"black basaltes\" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.\n\nIndoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,<ref name=\"Gontar\">Gontar</ref> with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichit\u00e0 di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most \"Roman\" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary.\n\nTechniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Cama\u00efeu|en cama\u00efeu]]'' (\"like cameos\"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of \"Pompeiian red\" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Go\u00fbt grec]]'' (\"Greek style\"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the \"Louis XVI\" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: \"Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another\".<ref>Honour, 110\u2013111, 110 quoted</ref>\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison - Appartement de Jos\u00e9phine 003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos\u00e9phine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]\n\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,<ref name=\"Gontar\"/> the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] \"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\".<ref>Honour, 171\u2013184, 171 quoted</ref> An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and \"Louis Seize\", or Louis XVI, in France.\n\nNeoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond\u2014a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s \u2014, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.\n\nGothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, \"romantic\" appearance.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCup and cover, made by Louisa Courtauld and George Cowles (1771-72).jpg|Cup with cover; by [[Louisa Courtauld]] and [[George Cowles (silversmith)|George Cowles]]; 1771\u20131772; silver; height: 38.1&nbsp;cm\n\nGiovanni Ottaviani - Plate IX from Loggie di Rafaele nel Vaticano - Google Art Project.jpg|Plate with various ornaments and patterns; 1772\u20131777; brush and watercolor and gouache over etching on white wove paper; [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]] (New York City)\n\nRobert and James Adam.

Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette R\u00e9camier]], [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], [[Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: \"''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''\" (\"One could not be more sumptuously undressed\"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.<ref>Hunt, 244</ref> Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.\n\nVery light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated\u2014for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.<ref>Hunt, 244-245</ref>  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.\n\nNeoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. Even when David designed a new French \"national costume\" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.\n\nThe trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.\n\nClassically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French \"\u00e0 la Titus\" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,<ref>Hunt, 243</ref> and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that \"more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''\u00e0 la Titus''.<ref>Rifelj, 35</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Hamilton Palmyra.JPG|''[[James Dawkins (1722-1757)|James Dawkins]] and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'', by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1758)\nFile:Jacques-Louis David Henriette de Verninac 1799.jpg|''[[Madame Raymond de Verninac]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], with clothes and chair in [[Directoire style]]. \"Year 7\": that is, 1798\u201399.\nFile:Jacques-Louis David 016.jpg|''[[Portrait of Madame R\u00e9camier]]'', David, 1800\nFile:Elizabeth Alexeevna with mirror by J.L.Mosnier (1802, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|[[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Elizabeth Alexeievna]], Empress of Russia and no political radical, in 1802\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Later Neoclassicism==\n[[File:NatGal.jpg|thumb|The West building (1941) of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, with the East Building (1978) and the [[United States Capitol]] visible behind and to the left]]\n{{Classicism}}\nIn American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890\u20131917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.\n\nConservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as \"reactionary\", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked \"progressive\". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts D\u00e9coratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann|\u00c9.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis S\u00fce|S\u00fce]] & [[Andr\u00e9 Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].\n\nThere was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th-century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)\n\nThis literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.\n\n===In music===\n[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music|Classical]] and [[baroque music|Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music|Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed \"classical\" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]].\n\nThe 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino|Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound to which the Neoclassicists aspired. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.\n\n=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===\n[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]\nIn 1905\u20131914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]\n\nWith the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.\n\nNeoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including \"exported\" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.\n\n===Architecture in the 21st century===\n{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}\n[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]\n\nAfter a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.\n\nAs of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html|title=Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism}}</ref> Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.\n\nFor sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].<ref>[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] \u2013 ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014</ref>\n\nIn the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.\n\nIn Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[American Empire (style)]]\n*[[Antiquization]]\n*[[Nazi architecture]]\n*[[Neoclassical architecture]]\n*[[Neoclassicism in France]]\n*[[Neo-Grec]], the late Greek-Revival style\n*[[1795\u20131820 in Western fashion]]\n*[[Skopje 2014]]\n*[[Stalinist architecture]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''The Romantic Rebellion: Romantic versus Classic Art'', 1976, Omega. {{ISBN|0-86007-718-7}}.\n* [[Hugh Honour|Honour, Hugh]], ''Neo-classicism.

The sizes most commonly in use today are the soprano (aka \"descant\", lowest note [[Scientific pitch notation|C<sub>5</sub>]]), alto (aka \"treble\", lowest note F<sub>4</sub>), tenor (lowest note C<sub>4</sub>) and bass (lowest note F<sub>3</sub>). Recorders are traditionally constructed from wood and ivory, while most recorders made in recent years are constructed from molded plastic. The recorders' internal and external proportions vary, but the bore is generally reverse conical (i.e. tapering towards the foot) to cylindrical, and all recorder fingering systems make extensive use of [[#Forked fingerings|forked fingerings]].\n\nThe recorder is first documented in Europe in the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], and continued to enjoy wide popularity in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] periods, but was little used in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods. It was revived in the 20th century as part of the [[historically informed performance]] movement, and became a popular amateur and educational instrument. Composers who have written for the recorder include [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Luciano Berio]], and [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Today, there are many professional [[List of recorder players|recorder players]] who demonstrate the instrument's full solo range and a large community of amateurs.<ref name=\":5\">For example, Eve O'Kelly describes how [[Frans Br\u00fcggen]] \"achieved worldwide recognition as a recorder virtuoso\" in her book ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-36681-X}}. p. 62</ref>\n\nThe sound of the recorder is often described as clear and sweet,<ref name=\":7\"/> and has historically been associated with birds and shepherds. It is notable for its quick response and its corresponding ability to produce a wide variety of articulations. This ability, coupled with its open finger holes, allow it to produce a wide variety of tone colors and special effects. Acoustically, its tone is relatively pure and, when the edge is positioned in the center of the\nairjet, odd harmonics predominate in its sound (when the edge is decidedly off-center, an even distribution of harmonics occurs).<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation |first=Jean-Marc |last=Bonard |date=January 2001 |title=The Physicist's Guide to the Orchestra |journal=[[European Journal of Physics]]|volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=89\u2013101 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/22/1/309 |arxiv=physics/0008053|bibcode=2001EJPh...22...89B }}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com:80/subscriber/article/grove/music/23022|archive-url = https://archive.today/20120525190031/http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/23022|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2012-05-25|title = Recorder|date = |access-date = 2016-02-06|website = Grove Music Online|publisher = Oxford University Press|last = Lasocki|first = David}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe instrument has been known by its modern English name at least since the 14th century.

Until about 1695, the names \"recorder\" and \"flute\" overlapped, but from 1673 to the late 1720s in England, the word \"flute\" always meant recorder.<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\"/> In the 1720s, as the transverse flute overtook the recorder in popularity, English adopted the convention already present in other European languages of qualifying the word \"flute\", calling the recorder variously the \"common flute\", \"common English-flute\", or simply \"English flute\" while the transverse instrument was distinguished as the \"German flute\" or simply \"flute\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flute-a-bec.com/textestanesbygb.html|title=Stanesby : Tenor Recorder (\"The True Concert Flute\")|website=www.flute-a-bec.com}}</ref> Until at least 1765, some writers still used \"flute\" to mean recorder.<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\"/>\n\n=== Other languages ===\nUntil the mid 18th century, musical scores written in Italian refer to the instrument as {{lang|it|flauto}}, whereas the transverse instrument was called {{lang|it|flauto traverso}}. This distinction, like the English switch from \"recorder\" to \"flute,\" has caused confusion among modern editors, writers and performers.\n\nIndeed, in most European languages, the first term for the recorder was the word for flute alone. In the present day, cognates of the word \"flute,\" when used without qualifiers, remain ambiguous and may refer to either the recorder, the modern concert flute, or other non-western flutes. Starting in the 1530s, these languages began to add qualifiers to specify this particular flute.<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\"/> In the case of the recorder, these describe variously \n{{div col}}\n* the \"sweetness\" or \"gentleness\" of the sound\n** ''flauto dolce'' (Italian) \n** ''fl\u00fbte douce'' (French) \n** ''flauta dulce'' (Spanish) \n** ''flauta doce'' (Brazilian Portuguese)\n** ''flaut dulce'' (Romanian)\n* the \"beak\"\n** ''zobcov\u00e1 flauta'' (Slovak)\n** ''zobcov\u00e1 fl\u00e9tna'' (Czech)\n** ''fl\u00fbte \u00e0 bec'' (French) \n** ''flauta de pico'' (Spanish) \n** ''flauto a becco'' (Italian) \n** \u03c6\u03bb\u03ac\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 ''phlauto me ramphos'' (Greek)\n** ''bekfluto'' (Esperanto)\n** ''nokkahuilu'' (Finnish)\n* the block\n** ''Blockfl\u00f6te'' (German) \n** ''blokfluit'' (Dutch) \n** ''blokfluit'' (Afrikaans) \n** ''blokkfl\u00f8yte'' (Norwegian)\n** ''blokfl\u00f8jte'' (Danish)\n** {{Lang|se|blockfl\u00f6jt}} (Swedish) \n** ''blok flauta'' (Croatian)\n** ''blok fl\u00fct'' (Turkish)\n** \u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0444\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0430 ''blokfleita'' (Bulgarian and Russian)\n* its vertical orientation (as opposed to the \"transverse\" flute)\n** ''flauto diritto'' (Italian)\n** ''flet prosty'' (Polish)\n** \u7ad6\u7b1b ''\"shu-di\"'' (Chinese, Mainland China) \n** \u76f4\u7b1b ''\"zhi-di\"'' (Chinese, Taiwan) \n** \u7e26\u7b1b ''\"tatebue\"'' (Japanese) \n* the number of holes\n** ''fl\u00fbte \u00e0 neuf trous'' (archaic; French)\n** ''flauto da 8 fori'' (archaic; Italian) \n* a diminutive relation to the \"transverse\" flute \n**\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea \"khalilit\" (Hebrew: the suffix \u05d9\u05ea- \"-it\" is a diminutive; the transverse flute is known as \u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \"khalil\", from the [[Semitic root|root]] \"\u05d7\u05dc\u05dc\" which refers to a hollow inner space)\n* a supposed geographical origin\n**''fluste d'Angleterre'' (archaic; French)\n**''flauto italiano'' (archaic; Italian)\n* the ability for the recorder in C<sub>5</sub> to fit comfortably in the hand\n** ''handfluit'' (archaic; Dutch)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nSince the 15th century, a variety of sizes of recorder have been documented, but a consistent terminology and notation for the different sizes was not formulated until the 20th century.\n\n=== Modern recorders ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"float:right;\"\n!colspan=6|Ranges of the modern recorder family\n|-\n!

This is not, however, a reflection of sounding pitch, and serves primarily to denote the pitch relationships between the different instruments. Groups of recorders played together are referred to as \"consorts\". Recorders are also often referred to by their lowest sounding note: \"recorder in F\" refers to a recorder with lowest note<!-- n.b. this refers to the note 01234567, which may not be the lowest fingered note or even the lowest playable note --> F, in any octave.\n\nThe table in this section shows the standard names of modern recorders in F and C and their respective ranges. Music composed after the modern revival of the recorder most frequently uses soprano, alto, tenor, and bass recorders, although sopranino and great bass are also fairly common.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|title = Catalogue of Recorder Repertoire: Advanced search|url = http://www.blokfluit.org/modern/search-by-title/advanced-search/|website = www.blokfluit.org|access-date = 2016-02-04}}</ref>  Consorts of recorders are often referred to using the terminology of organ registers: 8\u2032 (8 foot) pitch referring to a consort sounding as written, 4\u2032 pitch a consort sounding an octave above written, and 16\u2032 a consort sounding an octave below written. The combination of these consorts is also possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Woodwind Instruments and Their History|last = Baines|first = Anthony|publisher = |year = 1957|isbn = |location = |page = 248}}</ref>\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the [[tessitura]] of a baroque recorder lies approximately one octave above the tessitura of the human voice type after which it is named. For example, the tessitura of a soprano voice is roughly C<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>6</sub>, while the tessitura of a soprano recorder is C<sub>5</sub>\u2013C<sub>7</sub>.\n\nModern variations include standard British terminology, due to [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], which refers to the recorder in C<sub>5</sub> (soprano) as the descant and the recorder in F<sub>4</sub> (alto) as the treble. As conventions and instruments vary, especially for larger and more uncommon instruments, it is often practical to state the recorder's lowest note along with its name to avoid confusion.\n\n==== Notation ====\nModern recorder parts are notated in the key they sound in. Parts for alto, tenor and contrabass recorders are notated at pitch, while parts for sopranino, soprano, bass, and great bass are typically notated an octave below their sounding pitch. As a result, soprano and tenor recorders are notated identically; alto and sopranino are notated identically; and bass and contrabass recorders are notated identically. [[Clef#Octave clefs|Octave clefs]] may be used to indicate the sounding pitch, but usage is inconsistent.\n\nRare sizes and notations include the [[Garklein recorder|garklein]], which may be notated two octaves below its sounding pitch, and the sub-contrabass, which may be notated an octave above its sounding pitch.{{Clarify|date=August 2018|reason=Is there any music written specifically for either of these instruments? If so, where can the notation be verified?}}\n\n=== Historical recorders ===\nThe earliest known document mentioning \"a pipe called Recordour\" dates from 1388.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Rowland-Jones |first=Anthony |date=Autumn 2016 |title=The Invention of the Recorder |magazine=The Recorder Magazine |volume=36 |issue=3 |page=81 |publisher=Peacock Press |location=[[Hebden Bridge]] }}</ref>\nHistorically, recorders were used to play vocal music and parts written for other instruments, or for a general instrument. As a result, it was frequently the performers' responsibility to read parts not specifically intended for the instrument and to choose appropriate instruments. When such consorts consisted only of recorders, the pitch relationships between the parts were typically preserved, but when recorders were combined with other instruments, octave discrepancies were often ignored.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Woodwind Instruments and Their History|last = Baines|first = Anthony|publisher = |year = 1957|isbn = |location = |page = 242}}</ref>\n\nRecorder consorts in the 16th century were tuned in fifths and only occasionally employed tuning by octaves as seen in the modern C, F recorder consort. This means that consorts could be composed of instruments nominally in B{{music|flat}}, F, C, G, D, A and even E, although typically only three or four distinct sizes were used simultaneously. To use modern terminology, these recorders were treated as transposing instruments: consorts would be read identically to a consort made up of F<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, and G<sub>4</sub> instruments. This is made possible by the fact that adjacent sizes are separated by fifths, with few exceptions. These parts would be written using [[Chiavette|''chiavi naturali'']], allowing the parts to roughly fit in the range of a single staff, and also in the range of the recorders of the period. (see [[Recorder (musical instrument)#Structure 2|Renaissance structure]])\n\nTranspositions (\"registers\"), such as C<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>, G<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, or B{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub>\u2013F<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>, all read as F<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub> instruments, were possible as described by Praetorius in his ''[[Syntagma Musicum]]''. Three sizes of instruments could be used to play four-part music by doubling the middle size, e.g. F<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>, or play six-part music by doubling the upper size and tripling the middle size, e.g. F<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|title = Adrian Brown Recorders: Recorder Types|url = http://www.adrianbrown.org/recorder_types/index.html|website = www.adrianbrown.org|access-date = 2016-02-09|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184153/http://www.adrianbrown.org/recorder_types/index.html|archive-date = 2016-03-03|url-status=dead|df = }}</ref> Modern nomenclature for such recorders refers to the instruments' relationship to the other members of consort, rather than their absolute pitch, which may vary.

In Germanic countries, the equivalent of the same term, ''Quartfl\u00f6te'', was applied both to the tenor in C<sub>4</sub>, the interval being measured down from the alto in F<sub>4</sub>, and to a recorder in C<sub>5</sub> (soprano), the interval of a fourth apparently being measured up from an alto in G<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\" /> Recorder parts in the Baroque were typically notated using the treble clef, although they may also be notated in French violin clef (G clef on the bottom line of the staff).\n\nIn modern usage, recorders not in C or F are alternatively referred to using the name of the closest instrument in C or F, followed by the lowest note. For example, a recorder with lowest note G<sub>4</sub> may be known as a G-alto or alto in G, a recorder with lowest note D<sub>5</sub> (also \"sixth flute\") as a D-soprano or soprano in D, and a recorder in G<sub>3</sub> as a G-bass or G-basset. This usage is not totally consistent. Notably, the baroque recorder in D<sub>4</sub> is not commonly referred to as a D-tenor nor a D-alto; it is most commonly referred to using the historical name \"[[voice flute]]\".\n\n==Structure==\n===Materials===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n!Some hardwoods used to make recorders\n|-\n|\n* [[Maple#Tonewood|maple]]wood (''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]'', [[specific gravity]] 0.63)\n* [[Pear#Uses|pear]]wood (''Pyrus communis'', specific gravity 0.65), \n* [[Plum#Cultivation and uses|plum]]wood (''[[Prunus domestica]]'', specific gravity 0.79), \n* Castello \"[[boxwood]]\" (''[[Calycophyllum]] multiflorum'', specific gravity 0.8), \n* Zapatero \"boxwood\" (''[[Gossypiospermum]] praecox'', specific gravity 0.8), \n* [[olive]]wood (''Olea europaea'', specific gravity 0.85), \n* European boxwood (''[[Buxus sempervirens]]'', specific gravity 0.95), \n* [[rosewood]] (including [[tulipwood]] (''[[Dalbergia]] decipularis'', specific gravity 0.95), \n* palisander (''[[Dalbergia retusa]]'', specific gravity 1.05), \n* [[Kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] (''[[Dalbergia cearensis]]'', specific gravity 1.2), etc.), \n* [[ebony]] (''[[List of Diospyros species|Diospyros]] perrieri'', specific gravity 1.1), or \n* grenadilla (''[[Dalbergia melanoxylon]]'', specific gravity 1.2)\n|}\nRecorders have historically been constructed from hardwoods and ivory, sometimes with metal keys.

In either case, more ergonomically placed keys can be used to cover the tone holes. Keys also allow the design of longer instruments with larger tone holes. Keys are most common in recorders larger than the alto. Instruments larger than the tenor need at least one key so the player can cover all eight holes.

Note that the 4th finger-hole is larger than the 5th.]]\n\n===German fingering===\nIn the early 20th century, [[Peter Harlan]] developed a recorder with apparently simpler fingering, called German fingering. A recorder designed for German fingering has a hole five that is smaller than hole four, whereas baroque and neo-baroque recorders have a hole four that is smaller than hole five. The immediate difference in fingering is for F (soprano) or B{{Music|b}} (alto), which on a neo-baroque instrument must be fingered 0 123 4\u201367. With German fingering, this becomes a simpler 0 123 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013. Unfortunately, however, this makes many other chromatic notes too out of tune to be usable.<ref name=ARJtechnique>A Rowland-Jones, ''Recorder Technique'' {{ISBN|0-907908-75-6}}</ref> German fingering became popular in Europe, especially Germany, in the 1930s, but rapidly became obsolete in the 1950s as people began to treat the recorder more seriously, and the limitations of German fingering became more widely appreciated.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edgar|last=Hunt|authorlink=Edgar Hunt|title=The Recorder and Its Music|publisher=Eulenburg|location=London|year=1977|isbn=9780903873055}}{{Page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref> Recorders with German fingering are today manufactured exclusively for educational purposes.\n\n=== Pitch ===\nModern recorders are most commonly [[Pitch (music)|pitched]] at A=440&nbsp;Hz, but among serious amateurs and professionals, other pitch standards are often found.

A) block B) windway C) labium]]\n\n=== Basic sound production ===\nThe recorder produces sound in the manner of a [[whistle]] or an organ [[flue pipe]]. In normal play, the player blows into the ''windway'' (B), a narrow channel in the ''head joint'', which directs a stream of air across a gap called the ''window'', at a sharp edge called the ''labium'' (C). The air stream alternately travels above and below the labium, exciting standing waves in the bore of the recorder, and producing [[Sound|sound waves]] that emanate away from the window. Feedback from the [[resonance]] of the tube regulates the pitch of the sound.\n\nIn recorders, as in all woodwind instruments, the air column inside the instrument behaves like a vibrating string, to use a musical analogy, and has multiple [[Overtone|modes of vibration]]. These waves produced inside the instrument are not travelling waves, like those the ear perceives as sound, but rather stationary [[standing wave]]s consisting of areas of high pressure and low pressure inside the tube, called nodes. The perceived pitch is the lowest, and typically loudest, mode of vibration in the air column. The other pitches are ''harmonics'', or ''overtones''. Players typically describe recorder pitches by the number of nodes in the air column. Notes with a single node are in the ''first register,'' notes with two nodes in the ''second register,'' etc. As the number of nodes in the tube increases, the number of notes a player can produce in a given register decreases because of the physical constraint of the spacing of the nodes in the bore. On a Baroque recorder, the first, second, and third registers span about a major ninth, a major sixth, and a minor third respectively.\n\n=== Harmonic profile ===\nThe recorder sound, for the most part, lacks high harmonics and odd harmonics predominate in its sound with the even harmonics being almost entirely absent, although the harmonic profile of the recorder sound varies from recorder to recorder, and from fingering to fingering.<ref name=\":4\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As a result of the lack of high harmonics, writers since Praetorius have remarked that it is difficult for the human ear to correctly perceive the sounding octave of the recorder: if the same pitch were played on a violin and on a recorder, the violin sound would have louder high harmonics.\n\n==== Air ====\nAs in organ [[flue pipe]]s, the sounding pitch of duct type whistles is affected by the velocity of the air stream as it impinges upon the labium. The pitch generally increases with velocity of the airstream, up to a point.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pipe sensitivity|url = http://www.fonema.se/pipstiff/pipstiff.html|website = www.fonema.se|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref>\n\nAir speed can also be used to influence the number of pressure nodes in a process called over blowing. At higher airstream velocities, lower modes of vibration of the air column become unstable, resulting in a change of register.\n\nThe air stream is affected by the shaping of the surfaces in the head of the recorder (the \"voicing\"), and the way the player blows air into the windway. Recorder voicing is determined by physical parameters such as the proportions and curvature of the windway along both the longitudinal and latitudinal axes, the beveled edges (''chamfers'') of the windway facing towards the labium, the length of the window, the sharpness of the labium (i.e. the steepness of the ramp) among other parameters. The player is able to control the speed and turbulence of the airstream using the diaphragm and vocal tract.\n\n==== Fingers ====\nThe finger holes, used in combination or partially covered, affect the sounding pitch of the instrument.\n\nAt the most basic level, the sequential uncovering of finger holes increases the sounding pitch of the instrument by decreasing the effective sounding length of the instrument, and vice versa for the sequential covering of holes. In the fingering 01234567, only the bell of the instrument is open, resulting in a low pressure node at the bell end of the instrument. The fingering 0123456 sounds at a higher pitch because the seventh hole and the bell both release air, creating a low pressure node at the seventh hole.\n\nBesides sequential uncovering, recorders can use forked fingering to produce tones other than those produced by simple sequential lifting of fingers. In the fingering 0123, air leaks from the open holes 4,5,6, and 7. The pressure inside the bore is higher at the fourth hole than at the fifth, and decreases further at the 6th and 7th holes. Consequently, the most air leaks from the fourth hole and the least air leaks from the seventh hole. As a result, covering the fourth hole affects the pitch more than covering any of the holes below it. Thus, at the same air pressure, the fingering 01235 produces a pitch between 0123 and 01234. Forked fingerings allow recorder players to obtain fine gradations in pitch and timbre.\n\nA recorder's pitch is also affected by the partial covering of holes. This technique is an important tool for intonation, and is related to the fixed process of tuning a recorder, which involves the adjustment of the size and shape of the finger holes through carving and the application of wax.\n\nOne essential use of partial covering is in \"leaking,\" or partially covering, the thumb hole to destabilize low harmonics. This allows higher harmonics to sound at lower air pressures than by over-blowing alone, as on simple whistles. The player may also leak other holes to destabilize lower harmonics in place of the thumb hole (hole 0). This technique is demonstrated in the fingering tables of Ganassi's Fontegara (1535), which illustrate the simultaneous leaking of holes 0, 2, and 5 to produce some high notes. For example, Ganassi's table produces the 15th (third octave tonic) as the fourth harmonic of the tonic, leaking holes 0, 2 and 5 and produces the 16th as the third harmonic of the fifth, leaking holes 0 and 2. On some Baroque recorders, the 17th can be produced as the third harmonic of the sixth, leaking hole 0 as well as hole 1, 2 or both.\n\n==Technique==\nAlthough the design of the recorder has changed over its 700-year history, notably in fingering and bore profile (see History), the technique of playing recorders of different sizes and periods is much the same. Indeed, much of what is known about the technique of playing the recorder is derived from historical treatises and manuals dating to the 16th\u201318th century. The following describes the commonalities of recorder technique across all time periods. \n[[File:FolleJourn\u00e9e2009 altorecorder.jpg|thumb|A musician playing a recorder]]\n[[File:Woman and child reenactors - Fort Ross State Historic Park - Jenner, California - Stierch.jpg|thumb|left|A woman and girl playing recorders at [[Fort Ross State Historic Park]] in 2015]]\n\n=== Playing position ===\nIn normal playing position, the recorder is held with both hands, covering the fingerholes or depressing the keys with the pads of the fingers: four fingers on the lower hand, and the index, middle and ring fingers and thumb on the upper hand. In standard modern practice, the right hand is the lower hand, while the left hand is the upper hand, although this was not standardized before the modern revival of the recorder.\n\nThe recorder is supported by the lips, which loosely seal around the beak of the instrument, the thumb of the lower hand, and, depending on the note fingered, by the other fingers and the upper thumb. A practice documented in many historical fingering charts is the use of finger seven or eight to support the recorder when playing notes for which the coverage of this hole negligibly affects the sounding pitch (e.g. notes with many holes uncovered). Larger recorders may have a thumbrest, or a neckstrap for extra support, and may use a bocal to direct air from the player's mouth to the windway.\n\nRecorders are typically held at an angle between vertical and horizontal, the attitude depending on the size and weight of the recorder, and personal preference.\n\n=== Fingers ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+How the fingers and holes are numbered\n! Fingers!! Holes\n|-\n| [[File:NumberedLeftHand.jpg|200px]]<br />[[File:NumberedRightHand.jpg|200px]]\n| [[File:Numbered finger holes.jpg|left]]\n|}\n\nPitches are produced on the recorder by covering the holes while blowing into the instrument. Modern terminology refers to the holes on the front of the instrument using the numbers 1 through 7, starting with the hole closest to the beak, with the thumbhole numbered hole 0. At the most basic level, the fingering technique of the recorder involves the sequential uncovering of the holes from lowest to highest (i.e. uncovering 7, then uncovering 7 and 6, then uncovering 7, 6 and 5, etc.) producing ever higher pitches. In practice, however, the uncovering of the holes is not strictly sequential, and the half covering or uncovering of holes is an essential part of recorder technique.\n[[File:Hotteterre flute-a-bec frag.jpg|thumb|\nIllustration of a man playing a recorder from Jacques Hotteterre's \"Principes de la flute traversiere, de la Flute a Bec, et du Haut-bois\" (1728)\n]]\n\n==== Forked fingerings ====\nA forked fingering is a fingering in which an open hole has covered holes below it: fingerings for which the uncovering of the holes is not sequential. For example, the fingering 0123 is not a forked fingering, while 0123 56 is a forked fingering because the open hole 4 has holes covered below it{{Snd}} holes 5 and 6. Forked fingerings allow for smaller adjustments in pitch than the sequential uncovering of holes alone would allow. For example, at the same air speed the fingering 0123 5 sounds higher than 01234 but lower than 0123. Many standard recorder fingerings are forked fingerings. Forked fingerings may also be used to produce microtonal variations in pitch.\n\nForked fingerings have a different harmonic profile from non-forked fingerings, and are generally regarded as having a weaker sound. Forked fingerings that have  a different tone color or are slightly sharp or flat can provide so-called \"alternate fingerings\". For example, the fingering 0123 and its slightly sharper forked variant 012 4567.\n\n==== Partial covering of holes ====\nPartial covering of the holes is an essential part of the playing technique of all recorders. This is variously known as \"leaking,\" \"shading,\" \"half-holing,\" and in the context of the thumb hole, \"pinching\".\n\nThe primary function of the thumbhole is to serve as an octaving vent. When it is leaked, the first mode of vibration of the air column becomes unstable: i.e., the register changes. In most recorders, this is required for the playing of every note higher than a ninth above the lowest note. The player must adjust the position of the thumb for these notes to sound stably and in tune.\n\nThe partial opening of the thumbhole may be achieved by sliding or rolling the thumb off of the hole, or by bending the thumb at the first knuckle. To partially uncover a covered hole, the player may slide the finger off of the hole, bend or roll the finger away from the hole, gently lift the finger from the hole, or a combination of these. To partially cover an open hole, the reverse is possible.\n\nGenerally speaking, the partial opening of covered fingerholes raises the pitch of the sounding note while the partial closure of open fingerholes lowers the pitch.\n\n==== Holes 6 and 7 ====\nOn most \"baroque\" modeled modern recorders, the lower two fingers of the lower hand actually cover two holes each (called \"double holes\"). Whereas on the vast majority of baroque recorders and all earlier recorders these two fingers covered a single hole (\"single holes\"), double holes have become standard for baroque modeled modern recorders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dolmetsch.com/fingerings.htm|title=Recorder Fingerings|website=www.dolmetsch.com|access-date=2016-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304133127/http://www.dolmetsch.com/fingerings.htm|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> By covering one or both of these two, smaller holes, a recorder player can play the notes a semitone above the lowest note and a minor third above the lowest note, notes that are only possible on single holed recorders through the partial covering of those holes, or the covering of the bell.\n\n==== Covering the bell ====\nThe open end of the bore facing away from the player (the \"bell\") may be covered to produce extra notes or effects. Because both hands are typically engaged in holding the recorder or covering the finger holes, the covering of the bell is normally achieved by bringing the end of the recorder in contact with the leg or knee, typically achieved through a combination of bending of the torso and/or raising of the knee. Alternatively, in rare cases instruments may be equipped with a key designed to cover the bell (\"bell key\"), operated by one of the fingers, typically the pinky finger of the upper hand, which is not normally used to cover a hole. Fingerings with a covered bell extend the recorder's chromatic playable range above and below the nominal fingered range.\n\n=== Air ===\nThe pitch and volume of the recorder sound are influenced by the speed of the air travelling through the windway, which may be controlled by varying the breath pressure and the shape of the vocal tract. The sound is also affected by the turbulence of the air entering the recorder. Generally speaking, faster air in the windway produces a higher pitch. Thus blowing harder causes a note it to go sharp whereas blowing the note gently causes it to go flat. Knowing this fact and the knowledge of a recorder's individual tonal differences over its full range will help recorders play in tune with other instruments by knowing which notes will need slightly more or less air to stay in tune.  As mentioned above at ''Harmonic profile'' blowing much harder can result in [[overblowing]].\n\n==== Breath ====\nThe technique of inhalation and exhalation for the recorder differs from that of many other wind instruments in that the recorder requires very little air pressure to produce a sound, unlike reed or brasswind instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.recorderhomepage.net/technique/breathing-2/|title=Breathing {{!}} Recorder Home Page|website=www.recorderhomepage.net|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref> Thus, it is often necessary for a recorder player to produce long, controlled streams of air at a very low pressure. Recorder breathing technique focuses on the controlled release of air rather than on maintaining diaphragmatic pressure.\n\n==== Tongue, mouth, and throat ====\nThe use of the tongue to stop and start the air is called \"articulation\". In this capacity, the tongue has two basic functions: to control the start of the note (the attack) and the end, or the length of the note (legato, staccato). Articulations are roughly analogous to [[consonant]]s. Practically any consonant that may produced with the tongue, mouth, and throat may be used to articulate on the recorder. Transliterations of common articulation patterns include \"du du du du\" (using the tip of the tongue, \"single tonguing\") \"du gu du gu,\" (alternating between the tip and the back of the tongue, \"double tonguing\") and \"du g'll du g'll\" (articulation with the tip and the sides of the tongue, \"double tonguing\"). The attack of the note is governed by such factors as the pressure buildup behind the tongue and shape of the articulant, while the length of the note governed by the stoppage of the air by the tongue. Each articulation pattern has a different natural pattern of attack and length, and recorder technique seeks to produce a wide variety of lengths and attacks using these articulation patterns. Patterns such as these have been used since at least the time of Ganassi (1535).\n\nMouth and throat shapes are roughly analogous to [[vowel]]s. The shape of the vocal track affects the velocity and turbulence of the air entering the recorder. The shape of the mouth and vocal tract affect are closely related to the consonant used to articulate.\n\n=== Coordination ===\nThe player must coordinate fingers and tongue to align articulations with finger movements. In normal play, articulated attacks should align with the proper fingering, even in legato passages or in difficult finger transitions and the fingers move in the brief silence between the notes (silence d'articulation) created by the stoppage of the air by the tongue.\n\nBoth fingers and the breath can be used to control the pitch of the recorder. Coordinating the two is essential to playing the recorder in tune and with a variety of dynamics and timbres. On an elementary level, breath pressure and fingerings must accord with each other to provide an in-tune pitch. As an example of a more advanced form of coordination, a gradual increase in breath pressure combined with the shading of holes, when properly coordinated, results in an increase in volume and change in tone color without a change in pitch. The reverse is possible, decreasing breath pressure and gradually lifting fingers.\n\n==={{Anchor|Fingering}}Basic fingering===\n{{See also|Fingering (music)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"34\" |Recorder fingerings (English): Lowest note through the nominal range of 2 octaves and a tone\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Note\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background:#f8eaba;\" | First octave\n|&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background:#f8eaba;\" | Second octave\n|&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background:#f8eaba;\" | Third octave\n|-\n!

See the table above for \"English\" fingerings for the standard range. The numbers at the top correspond to the fingers and the holes on the recorder. The vast majority of recorders manufactured today are designed to play using these fingerings, with slight variations. Nonetheless, recorder fingerings vary widely between models and are mutable even for a single recorder: recorder players may use three or more fingerings for the same note along with partial covering of the holes to achieve proper intonation, in coordination with the breath or in faster passages where some fingerings are unavailable. This chart is a general guide, but by no means a definitive or complete fingering chart for the recorder, an impossible task. Rather, it is the basis for a much more complex fingering system, which is still being added to today.\n\nSome [[font]]s show miniature glyphs of complete recorder fingering charts in [[TrueType]] format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fontspace.com/algomgom/recorder|title=Recorder font by algomgom|website=FontSpace}}</ref> Because there are no [[Unicode]] values for complete recorder fingering charts, these fonts are custom encoded.\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe earliest extant duct flutes date to the [[neolithic]].

The castle was only inhabited from 1335 to 1418. As the area was not disturbed until the modern excavation, the recorder has been dated to the period of occupation of the castle. The instrument has a cylindrical bore about {{convert|11|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter and is about {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} long with a vibrating air column of about {{convert|270|mm|abbr=on}}. The block has survived, but the labium is damaged, making the instrument unplayable. The instrument has tenons on both ends of the instrument, suggesting the presence of now lost ferrules or turnings. Uncertainty regarding the nature of these fittings has hindered reconstruction of the instrument's original state.\n\nA second, structurally different instrument (\"G\u00f6ttingen recorder\") was discovered in 1987 in an archaeological excavation of the latrine of a medieval house in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Germany]]. It has been dated to between 1246 and 1322. It is fruitwood in one piece with turnings, measuring about {{convert|256|mm|abbr=on}} long. It has a cylindrical bore about {{convert|13.6|mm|abbr=on}} at the highest measurable point, narrowing to {{convert|13.2|mm|abbr=on}} between the first and second finger holes, to {{convert|12.7|to(-)|12.8|mm|abbr=on}} between the second and third finger holes, and contracting to {{convert|11.5|mm|abbr=on}} at the seventh hole. The bore expands to {{convert|14.5|mm|abbr=on}} at the bottom of the instrument, which has a bulbous foot. Unusually, the finger holes taper conically outwards, the opposite of the undercutting found in Baroque recorders. The top of the instrument is damaged: only a cut side of the windway survives, and the block has been lost. A reconstruction by Hans Reiners has a strident, penetrating sound rich in overtones and has a range of two octaves. With the thumb hole and the first three finger holes covered, the reconstruction produces a pitch ca. 450&nbsp;Hz.\n\nIn the 21st century, a number of other instruments and fragments dated to the medieval period have come to light. These include a 14th-century fragment of a headjoint excavated in [[Esslingen (district)|Esslingen]], Germany (\"Esslingen fragment\"); a birch instrument dated to the second half of the 14th century unearthed in [[Tartu]], Estonia (\"Tartu recorder\"); and a fruitwood instrument dated to the 15th century, found in [[Elbl\u0105g]], Poland (\"Elbl\u0105g recorder\").\n\nCommon features of the surviving instruments include: a narrow cylindrical bore (except the G\u00f6ttingen recorder); a doubled seventh hole for the little finger of the lower hand to allow for right- or left- handed playing (except the Tartu recorder); a seventh hole that produces a semitone instead of a tone; and a flat or truncated head, instead of the narrow beak found on later instruments. Additionally, the Esslingen fragment has turnings similar to the G\u00f6ttingen recorder. No complete instruments larger than {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} have survived, although the Esslingen fragment may represent a larger recorder.<ref>Nicholas S. Lander, \"[http://www.recorderhomepage.net/instruments/a-memento-the-medieval-recorder/ A Memento: The Medieval Recorder]\" (Recorder Home Page, 1996\u20132014).

According to Virdung (1511), the hole that was not used was plugged with wax.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Musica getutscht|last = Virdung|first = Sebastian|publisher = |year = 1511|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Musica_getutscht_(Virdung,_Sebastian)}}</ref> It was not until the Baroque period,  when instruments with adjustable footjoints were developed, that widely spaced double holes became obsolete.\n\nThe classification of these instruments is primarily complicated by the fact that the seventh hole produces a semitone instead of a tone. As a result, chromatic fingerings are difficult, and require extensive half-holing. These instruments share similarities with the six holed [[flageolet]], which used three fingers on each hand and had no thumb hole. Anthony Rowland-Jones has suggested that the thumb hole on these early flutes was an improvement upon the flageolet to provide a stronger fingering for the note an octave above the tonic, while the seventh finger hole provided a leading tone to the tonic. As a result, he has suggested that these flutes should be described as improved flageolets, and has proposed the condition that true recorders produce a tone (rather than a semitone) when the seventh finger is lifted.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nControversy aside, there is little question that these instruments are at least precursors to later instruments that are indisputably recorders. Because there is sparse documentary evidence from the earliest history of the instrument, such questions may never be resolved. Indeed, historically there was no need for an all-inclusive definition that encompassed every form of the instrument past and present.\n\n===== Iconography =====\nRecorders with a cylindrical profile are depicted in many medieval paintings, however their appearance does not easily correspond to the surviving instruments, and may be stylized. The earliest depictions of the recorder are probably in \"The Mocking of Christ\" from the monastery church of St George in Staro Nagori\u010dano near Kumanovo, Macedonia (the painting of the church began in 1315) in which a man plays a cylindrical recorder; and the center panel of the \"Virgin and Child\" attributed to Pedro (Pere) Serra (c. 1390), painted for the church of S. Clara, Tortosa, now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona, in which a group of angels play musical instruments around the Virgin Mary, one of them playing a cylindrical recorder.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nStarting in the Middle Ages, angels have frequently been depicted playing one or more recorders, often grouped around the Virgin, and in several notable paintings trios of angels play recorders. This is perhaps a sign of the trinity, although the music must have often been in three parts.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nNo music marked for the recorder survives from prior to 1500. Groups of recorder players or recorder playing angels, particularly trios, are depicted in paintings from the 15th century, indicating the recorder was used in these configurations, as well as with other instruments. Some of the earliest music must have been vocal repertory.\n\nModern recorder players have taken up the practice of playing instrumental music from the period, perhaps anachronistically, such as the monophonic estampies from the [[Chansonnier du Roi]] (13th), [[Add MS 29987]] (14th or 15th), or the [[Codex Faenza]] (15th), and have arranged keyboard music, such as the estampies from the [[Robertsbridge Codex|Robertsbridge codex]] (14th), or the vocal works of composers such as [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Johannes Ciconia]] for recorder ensembles.\n\n===Renaissance===\nIn the 16th century, the structure, repertoire, and performing practice of the recorder is better documented than in prior epochs. The recorder was one of the most important wind instruments of the Renaissance, and many instruments dating to the 16th century survive, including some matched consorts.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> This period also produced the first extant books describing the recorder, including the treatises of Virdung (1511), Agricola (1529), Ganassi (1535), Cardano (c1546), Jambe de Fer (1556), and Praetorius (1619). Nonetheless, understanding of the instrument and its practice in this period is still developing.\n\n==== Structure ====\nIn the 16th century, the recorder saw important developments in its structure. As in the recorders of the Middle Ages, the etiology of these changes remains uncertain, development was regional and multiple types of recorder existed simultaneously. Our knowledge is based on documentary sources and surviving instruments.\n\n===== Surviving instruments =====\nFar more recorders survive from the Renaissance than from the Middle Ages. Most of the surviving instruments from the period have a wide, cylindrical bore from the blockline to the uppermost fingerhole, an inverted conical portion down to around the lowest finger hole (the \"choke\"), then a slight flare to the bell. Externally, they have a curved shape similar to the bore, with a profile like a stretched hourglass. Their sound is warm, rich in harmonics, and somewhat introverted.<ref name=\":7\" /> Surviving consorts of this type, identified by their makers marks, include those marked \"HIER S\u2022\" or \"HIE\u2022S\" found in Vienna, Sibiu and Verona; and those marked with variations on a rabbit's footprint, designated \"!!\" by Adrian Brown, which are dispersed among various museums. The pitch of these recorders is often generally grouped around A&nbsp;=&nbsp;466&nbsp;Hz, however little pitch standardization existed in the period. This type of recorder is described by Praetorius in ''De Organographia'' (1619). A surviving consort by \"!!\" follows the exact size configuration suggested by Praetorius: stacked fifths up from the basset in F<sub>3</sub>, and down a fifth then a fourth to bass in B{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub> and great bass in F<sub>2</sub>. Instruments marked \"HIER S\u2022\" or \"HIE\u2022S\" are in stacked fifths from great bass in F<sub>2</sub> to soprano in E<sub>5</sub>.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Renaissance recorder makers|url = http://www.adrianbrown.org/recorder_types/rrm.html|website = www.adrianbrown.org|access-date = 2016-02-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161008004008/http://www.adrianbrown.org/recorder_types/rrm.html|archive-date = 2016-10-08|url-status=dead|df = }}</ref> Many of these instruments are pitched around A&nbsp;=&nbsp;440&nbsp;Hz or A&nbsp;=&nbsp;466&nbsp;Hz, although pitch varied regionally and between consorts.\n\nThe range of this type is normally an octave plus a minor 7th, but as remarked by Praetorius (1619) and demonstrated in the fingering tables of Ganassi's ''Fontegara'' (1535),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego|Sylvestro di Ganassi dal Fontego]], ''Opera Intitula Fontegara, Laquale isegna a sonare di flauto cho tutta l'arte opportuna a esso istrumento massime il diminuire ilquale sara utile ad ogni istrumeno di fiato et chorde et anchora a chi si dileta di canto'' (Impressum Venetiis: per syluestro di ganassi dal fontego Sonator dalla illustrissima signoria di Venetia hautor pprio., 1535).

Their range is more suitable for the performance of vocal music, rather than purely instrumental music. This type is the recorder typically referred to as the \"normal\" Renaissance recorder, however this modern appellation does not fully capture the heterogeneity of instruments of the 16th century.\n\nAnother surviving Renaissance type has a narrow cylindrical bore and cylindrical profile like the medieval exemplars but a choke at the last hole. The earliest surviving recorders of this type were made by the Rafi family, instrument makers active in Lyons in Southern France in the early 16th century. Two recorders marked \"C.RAFI\" were acquired by the Accademia Filarmonica, Bologna in 1546, where they remain today. A consort of recorders or similar make, marked \"P.GRE/C/E,\" was donated to the Accademia in 1675, expanding the pair marked \"C.RAFI\". Other recorders by the Rafi family survive in Northern Europe, notably a pair in Brussels. It is possible that Grece worked in the Rafi workshop, or was a member of the Rafi family. The pitch of the Rafi/Grece instruments is around A&nbsp;=&nbsp;440&nbsp;Hz. They have a relatively quiet sound with good pitch stability favoring dynamic expression.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Recorder Home Page Databases|url = http://www.recorderhomepage.net/databases/Historic_Makerslist.php?start=41|website = www.recorderhomepage.net|access-date = 2016-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Recorder Home Page Databases|url = http://www.recorderhomepage.net/databases/Historic_Instrumentslist.php?x_Maker_Abbreviation=Rafi&z_Maker_Abbreviation=LIKE&cmd=search|website = www.recorderhomepage.net|access-date = 2016-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Recorder Home Page Databases|url = http://www.recorderhomepage.net/databases/Historic_Makersview.php?showdetail=&Makers_Number=27|website = www.recorderhomepage.net|access-date = 2016-02-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1556, French author Philibert Jambe de Fer gave a set of fingerings for hybrid instruments such as the Rafi and Grece instruments that give a range of two octaves. Here, the 15th was now produced, as on most later recorders, as a variant of the 14th instead of as the fourth harmonic of the tonic, as in Ganassi's tables.\n\n===== Documentary evidence: treatises =====\n{| style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;\"\n!colspan=3|Recorders in 16th and early 17th century books\n|-\n|style=\"width:140px|[[File:VirdungP100crop.jpg|x300px|frameless]][[File:VirdungP14crop.jpg|x300px|frameless]]\n|style=\"width:100px|[[File:AgricolaP16crop.jpg|x300px|frameless]]\n|style=\"width:100px|[[File:Barocke Blockfl\u00f6ten.png|x300px|frameless]]\n|-\n|Virdung, ''Musica getutscht'' (1511)\n|Agricola, ''Musica instrumentalis deudsch'' (1529)\n|Praetorius, ''[[Syntagma Musicum]]'' (1629)\n|}\nThe first two treatises of the 16th century show recorders that differ from the surviving instruments dating to the century: these are [[Sebastian Virdung]]'s (b. 1465?) ''Musica getutscht''  (1511), and [[Martin Agricola]]'s (1486\u20131556) similar ''Musica instrumentalis deudsch'' (1529), published in Basel and Saxony respectively.\n\n''Musica Getutscht'', the earliest printed treatise on western musical instruments, is an extract of an earlier, now lost, manuscript treatise by Virdung, a chaplain, singer, and itinerant musician. The printed version was written in a vernacular form of [[Early New High German]], and was aimed at wealthy urban amateur musicians: the title translates, briefly, as \"Music, translated into German ... Everything there is to know about [music] \u2013 made simple.\" When a topic become too complex for Virdung to discuss briefly, he refers the reader to his lost larger work, an unhelpful practice for modern readers. While the illustrations have been called \"maddeningly inaccurate\" and his perspectives quirky,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarship.claremont.edu/ppr/vol7/iss2/12|title = \"Musica getutscht: A treatise on musical instruments (1511)\" by Sebastian Virdung.

Virdung depicts four recorders together: a \"ba\u00dfcontra\" or \"bassus\" (basset) in F<sub>3</sub> with an anchor shaped key and a perforated fontanelle, two tenors in C<sub>4</sub> and a \"discantus\" (alto) in G<sub>4</sub>. According to Virdung, the configurations F\u2013C\u2013C\u2013G or F\u2013C\u2013G\u2013G should be used for four-part music, depending on the range of the bass part. As previously mentioned, the accuracy of these woodcuts cannot be verified as no recorders fitting this description survive. Virdung also provides the first ever fingering chart for a recorder with a range of an octave and a seventh, though he says that the bass had a range of only an octave and sixth. In his fingering chart, he numbers which fingers to lift rather than those to put down and, unlike in later charts, numbers them from bottom (1) to top (8). His only other technical instruction is that the player must blow into the instrument and \"learn how to coordinate the articulations ... with the fingers\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Musica getutscht (Virdung, Sebastian)|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Musica_getutscht_(Virdung,_Sebastian)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref>\n\nMartin Agricola's ''Musica instrumentalis Deudsch'' (\"A German instrumental music, in which is contained how to learn to play ... all kinds of ... instruments\"), written in rhyming German verse (ostensibly to improve the understanding and retention of its contents), provides a similar account and copies most of its woodcuts directly from ''Getutscht''. Agricola also calls the tenor \"altus,\" mistakenly depicting it as a little smaller than the tenor in the woodcut (above, middle right). Like Virdung, Agricola takes it for granted that recorders should be played in four-part consorts. Unlike ''Getutscht'', which provides a single condensed fingering chart, Agricola provides separate, slightly differing, fingering charts for each instrument, leading some to suppose that Agricola experimented on three different instruments, rather than copying the fingerings from one size to the other two.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Martin Agricola's Poetic Discussion of the Recorder and Other Woodwind Instruments|last = Hettrick|first = William E. |date=1980\u20131983|journal = American Recorder|doi = |pmid = }}</ref> Agricola adds that graces (''Mordanten''), which make the melody ''subtil'', must be learned from a professional (''Pfeiffer''), and that the manner of ornamentation (''Coloratur'') of the organist is best of all.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Musica instrumentalis Deudsch (Agricola, Martin)|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Musica_instrumentalis_Deudsch_(Agricola,_Martin)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref> A substantial 1545 revision of ''Musica Instrumentalis'' approvingly mentions the use of vibrato (''zitterndem Wind'') for woodwind instruments, and includes an account of articulation, recommending the syllables ''de'' for [[Note value|semiminims]] and larger, ''di ri'' for semiminims and smaller, and the articulation ''tell ell ell ell el le'', which he calls the \"flutter-tongue\" ''(flitter zunge)'' for the smallest of note values, found in ''passagi (Colorirn)''.\n\nThe next treatise comes from Venice: Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego's (1492\u2013mid-1500s) ''Opera Intitulata Fontegara'' (1535), which is the first work to focus specifically on the technique of playing the recorder, and perhaps the only historical treatise ever published that approaches a description of a professional or virtuoso playing technique. Ganassi was a musician employed by the [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] and at the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica di San Marco]] at the time of the work's publication, an indication of his high level of accomplishment, and later wrote two works on the playing the viol and the violone, although he does not mention being employed by the Doge after ''Fontegara''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ganassi, Silvestro di|url = http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/silvestro-di-ganassi_(Dizionario_Biografico)/|website = www.treccani.it|access-date = 2016-02-12|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312033909/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/silvestro-di-ganassi_(Dizionario_Biografico)/|archive-date = 2016-03-12|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n''Fontegara'' can be broadly divided into two parts: the first concerns the technique of playing the recorder, the second demonstrated divisions (regole, passagi, ornaments), some of great complexity, which the player may use to ornament a melody or, literally, \"divide\" it into smaller notes. In all aspects, Ganassi emphasizes the importance of imitating the human voice, declaring that \"the aim of the recorder player is to imitate as closely as possible all the capabilities of the human voice\", maintaining that the recorder is indeed able to do this. For Ganassi, imitation of the voice has three aspects: \"a certain artistic proficiency,\" which seems to be the ability to perceive the nature of the music, prontezza (dexterity or fluency), achieved \"by varying the pressure of the breath and shading the tone by means of suitable fingering,\" and galanteria (elegance or grace), achieved by articulation, and by the use of ornaments, the \"simplest ingredient\" of them being the trill, which varies according to the expression.\n\nGanassi gives fingering tables for a range of an octave and a seventh, the standard range also remarked by Praetorius, then tells the reader that he has discovered, through long experimentation, more notes not known to other players due to their lack of perseverance, extending the range to two octaves and a sixth. Ganassi gives fingerings for three recorders with different makers marks, and advises the reader to experiment with different fingerings, as recorders vary in their bore. The makers mark of one of the recorders, in the form of a stylized letter \"A\", has been associated with the Schnitzer family of instrument makers in Germany, leading Hermann Moeck to suppose that Ganassi's recorder might have been Northern European in origin.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fl\u00f6tensignaturen auf alten Gem\u00e4lden|last = Moeck|first = Hermann|date = 1994|journal = Tibia |trans-title=Maker's marks in old paintings |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=128\u201329}}</ref> (see also Note on \"Ganassi\" recorders)\n\nGanassi uses three basic kinds of syllables ''te che'', ''te re'', and ''le re'' and also varies the vowel used with the syllable, suggesting the effect of mouth shape on the sound of the recorder. He gives many combinations of these syllables and vowels, and suggests the choice of the syllables according to their smoothness, ''te che'' being least smooth and ''le re'' being most so. He does not, however, demonstrate how the syllables should be used to music.\n\nMost of the treatise consists of tables of diminutions of intervals, small melodies and cadences, categorized by their meter. These several hundred divisions use quintuplets, septuplets, note values from whole notes to 32nd notes in modern notation, and demonstrate immense variety and complexity.\n\nThe frontispiece to ''Fontegara'' shows three recorder players play together with two singers. Like Agricola and Virdung, Ganassi takes for granted that recorders should be played in groups of four, and come in three sizes: F<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub> and G<sub>4</sub>. He makes a distinction between solo playing and ensemble playing, noting that what he has said is for solo players, and that when playing with others, it is most important to match them. Unfortunately, Ganassi gives only a few ornamented examples with little context for their use. Nonetheless, Ganassi offers a tantalizing glimpse at a highly developed professional culture and technique of woodwind playing that modern players can scarcely be said to have improved upon.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Opera Intitulata Fontegara (Ganassi, Sylvestro)|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Opera_Intitulata_Fontegara_(Ganassi,_Sylvestro)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref>\n\nGirolamo Cardano's (also Jerome Cardan, 1501\u20131576) ''De Musica'' was written around 1546, but not published until 1663 when it was published along with other works by Cardan, who was an eminent philosopher, mathematician and physician as well as a keen amateur recorder player who learned from a professional teacher, Leo Oglonus, as a child in Milan.\n\nHis account corroborates that of Ganassi, using the same three basic syllables and emphasizing the importance of breath control and ornamentation in recorder playing, but also documents several aspects of recorder technique otherwise undocumented until the 20th century. These include multiple techniques using the partial closing of the bell: to produce a tone or semitone below the tonic, and to change semitones into dieses (half semitones), which he says can also be produced by \"repercussively bending back the tongue\".<ref name=\":21\" /> He also adds that the position of the tongue, either extended or turned up towards the palate, can be used to improve, vary, and color notes. He is the first to differentiate between the amount of the breath (full, shallow, or moderate) and the force (relaxed or slow, intense, and the median between them) as well as the different amount of air required for each instrument, and describes a trill or vibrato called a ''vox tremula'' in which \"a tremulous quality in the breath\" is combined with a trilling of the fingers to vary the interval from anything between a major third and a diesis. He is also the first writer to mention the recorder in D{{sub|5}} (\"discantus\"), which he leaves unnamed.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\nComposer and singer Philibert Jambe de Fer ({{circa}} 1515{{Snd}} {{circa}} 1566) was the only French author of the 16th century to write about the recorder, in his ''Epitome musical''. He complains of the French name for the instrument, ''fleutte \u00e0 neuf trouz'' (\"flute with nine holes\") as, in practice, one of the lowermost holes must be plugged, leaving only eight open holes. He prefers ''fleute d'Italien'' or the Italian ''flauto''. His fingering chart is notable for two reasons, first for describing fingerings with the 15th produced as a variant on the 14th, and for using the third finger of the lower hand as a buttress finger, although only for three notes in the lower octave.<ref name=\":21\" /> (see also Renaissance structure)\n\nAurelio Virgiliano's \"Il dolcimelo\" ({{circa}} 1600) presents ricercars intended for or playable on the recorder, a description of other musical instruments, and a fingering chart for a recorder in G<sub>4</sub> similar to Jambe de Fer's.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Il Dolcimelo (Virgiliano, Aurelio){{Snd}} IMSLP/Petrucci Music Library: Free Public Domain Sheet Music|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Il_Dolcimelo_(Virgiliano,_Aurelio)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-13}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Syntagma musicum'' (1614\u201320) of Michael Praetorius (1571\u20131621) in three volumes (a fourth was intended but never finished) is an encyclopedic survey of music and musical instruments. Volume II, ''De Organographia'' (1619) is of particular interest for its description of no fewer than eight sizes of recorder (''klein Fl\u00f6tlein'' or ''exilent'' in G<sub>5</sub>, ''discant'' in C<sub>5</sub> or D<sub>5</sub>, ''alt'' in G<sub>4</sub>, ''tenor'' in C<sub>4</sub>, ''basset'' in F<sub>3</sub>, ''bass'' in B{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub>, and ''grossbass'' in F<sub>2</sub>) as well as the four-holed ''gar kleine Plockfl\u00f6tlein''.\n\nPraetorius was the first author to explain that recorders can confuse the ear into believing that they sound an octave lower than pitch, which phenomenon has more recently been explained in relation to the recorder's lack of high harmonics. He also shows the different \"registers\" of consort possible, 2\u2032 (discant, alt, and tenor), 4\u2032 (alt, tenor, and basset), and 8\u2032 (tenor, basset, and bass) (see also [[#Nomenclature|Nomenclature]]). Additionally, he proposed cutting the recorder between the beak and the first finger hole to allow for a kind of tuning slide to raise or lower its pitch, similar to the Baroque practice of adjusting a recorder's pitch by \"pulling out\" the top joint of the recorder.\n\nThe recorders described in Praetorius are of the \"stretched hourglass\" profile (see above, far right). He gives fingerings like those of Ganassi, and remarks that they normally have a range of an octave and a sixth, although exceptional players could extend that range by a fourth.\n\n===== \"Double recorder\" =====\nSome paintings from the 14th and 15th centuries depict musicians playing what appear to be two end-blown flutes simultaneously. In some cases, the two flutes are evidently disjoint, separate flutes of similar make, played angled away from each other, one pipe in each hand. In others, flutes of the same length have differing hand positions. In a final case, the pipes are parallel, in contact with each other, and differ in length.<ref name=\"dolciflauti \u00bb Double Recorder\">{{Cite web|title = dolciflauti \u00bb Double Recorder|url = http://www.livirghi.com/instruments-of-the-middle-age/flutes-of-the-middle-ages/|website = www.livirghi.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Catalogus: A Corpus of Trecento Pictures with Musical Subject Matter|last = Brown|first = Howard Mayer|publisher = Imago Musicae|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> While the iconographic criteria for a recorder are typically a clearly recognizable labium and a double handed vertical playing technique,<ref name=\":8\" /> such criteria are not prescriptive, and it is uncertain whether any of these depictions should be considered a single instrument, or constitute a kind of recorder. The identification of the instrument depicted is further complicated by the symbolism of the [[aulos]], a double piped instrument associated with the satyr [[Marsyas]] of [[Greek mythology]].\n\nAn instrument consisting of two attached, parallel, end-blown flutes of differing length, dating to the 15th or 16th century, was found in poor condition near All Souls College in Oxford. The instrument has four holes finger-holes and a thumb hole for each hand. The pipes have an inverted conical \"choke\" bore (see [[Recorder (musical instrument)#Structure 2|Renaissance structure]]). Bob Marvin has estimated that the pipes played a fifth apart, at approximately C<sub>5</sub> and G<sub>5</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.fomrhi.org/uploads/bulletins/Fomrhi-031.pdf |first=Bob |last=Marvin |title=A Double Recorder |journal=FoMHRI Quarterly|publisher=Fellowship of Makers and Researchers of Historical Instruments|date=April 1983 |issue= 31 |others=Communication 453 |pages=42\u201343 |accessdate=6 August 2015 }}</ref> The instrument is [[sui generis]]. Although the instrument's pipes have thumb holes, the lack of organological precedent makes classification of the instrument difficult. Marvin has used the terms \"double recorder\" and the categorization-agnostic ''flauto doppio'' (double flute) to describe the Oxford instrument.\n\nMarvin has designed a ''flauto doppio'' based on the Oxford instrument, scaled to play at F<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>5</sub>. Italian recorder maker Francesco Livirghi has designed a double recorder or ''flauto doppio'' with connected, angled pipes of the same length but played with different hand positions, based on iconographic sources. Its pipes play at F<sub>4</sub> and B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"dolciflauti \u00bb Double Recorder\"/> Both instruments use fingerings of the makers' design.\n\n===== Note on \"Ganassi\" recorders =====\nIn the 1970s, when recorder makers began to make the first models of recorders from the 16th and 17th centuries, such models were not always representative of the playing characteristics of the original instruments. Especially notable is [[Frederick G. Morgan|Fred Morgan]]'s much copied \"Ganassi\" model, based loosely on an instrument in the Vienna Kunsthistorisches museum (inventory number SAM 135), was designed to use the fingerings for the highest notes in Ganassi's tables in Fontegara. As Morgan knew, these notes were not in standard use; indeed Ganassi uses them in only a few of the hundreds of diminutions contained in Fontegara. Historically, such recorders did not exist as a distinct type, and the fingerings given by Ganassi were those of a skilled player particularly familiar with his instruments. When modern music is written for 'Ganassi recorders' it means this type of recorder.<ref name=\"Brown\">Adrian Brown, ''The Ganassi recorder: separating fact from fiction'', American Recorder 47(5): 11\u201318, 1984.</ref>\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nRecorders were probably first used to play vocal music, later adding purely instrumental forms such as dance music to their repertoire. Much of the vocal music of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries can be played on recorder consorts, and as illustrated in treatises from Virdung to Praetorius, the choice appropriate instruments and transpositions to play vocal music was common practice in the Renaissance. Additionally, some collections such as those of [[Pierre Attaingnant]] and [[Anthony Holborne]], indicate that their instrumental music was suitable for recorder consorts.<ref name=\":18\">Anthony Holborne, ''Pavans, Galliards, Almains and other short Aeirs, both grave and light, in five parts, for Viols, Violins, recorders or other Musicall Winde Instruments'', published in 1599</ref> This section first discusses repertoire marked for the recorder, then briefly, other repertoire played on recorder.\n\nIn 1505 Giovanni Alvise, a Venetian wind player, offered Francesco Gonzaga of Mantua a motet for eight recorders, however the work has not survived.\n\nPierre Attaingnant's ({{floruit}} 1528\u20131549) ''Vingt & sept chansons musicales a quatre parties a la fleuste dallement...et a la fleuste a neuf trous'' (1533) collects 28 (not 27, as in the title) four-part instrumental motets, nine of which he says were suitable for performance on flutes (''fleustes dallement'', German flutes), two on recorders (''fleuestes a neuf trous,'' Nine holed flutes, \"recorders\"), and twelve suitable for both. Of the twelve marked for both, seven use ''[[Chiavette|chiavi naturali]]'', or low-clefs typically used for recorders, while the others use the ''chiavette'' clefs used in the motets marked for flutes. Hence, the seven notated in ''chiavi naturali'' could be considered more appropriate for recorders. ''Vingt et sept chansons'' is the first published music marked for a recorder consort. Earlier is a part for Jacobus Barbireau's song \"Een vrolic wesen\", apparently for recorder, accompanying the recorder fingering chart in ''Livre plaisant et tres utile...''  (Antwerp, 1529), a partial French translation of Virdung's ''Musica getutscht''.\n\nJacques Moderne's ''S'ensuyvent plusieurs basses dances tant communes que incommunes'' published in the 1530s, depicts a four-part recorder consort such as those described in Virdung, Agricola, Ganassi and others, however the dances are not marked for recorders. His ''Musique de joye'' (1550) contains ricercares and dances for performance on \"espinetes, violons & fleustes\".\n\nIn 1539\u201340, Henry VIII of England, also a keen amateur player (see Cultural significance), imported five brothers of the Bassano family from Venice to form a consort, expanded to six members in 1550, forming a group that maintained an exceptional focus on the recorder until at least 1630 when the recorder consort was combined with the other wind groups. Most wind bands consisted of players playing sackbutts, shawms, and other loud instruments doubling on recorder. Some music probably intended for this group survives, including dance music by Augustine and Geronimo Bassano from the third quarter of the 16th century, and the more elaborate fantasias of Jeronimo Bassano ({{circa}} 1580), four in five parts and one in six parts. Additionally, the Fitzwilliam wind manuscript (''GB-Cfm'' 734) contains wordless motets, madrigals and dance pieces, including some by the Bassano family, probably intended for a recorder consort in six parts.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.instantharmony.net/Music/AR-08-84.pdf|title = The Recorder Consort at the English Court 1540\u20131673: Part I|last = Lasocki|first = David|date = 1984|journal = American Recorder|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 8}}</ref>\n\nThe English members of the Bassano family, having originated in Venice, were also probably familiar with the vocal style, advanced technique, and complex improvised ornamentation described in Ganassi's ''Fontegara'', and they were probably among the recorder players who Ganassi reports having worked and studied with: when they were brought to England, they were regarded as some of the best wind players in Venice. While most of the music attributed to the consort uses only a range of a thirteenth, it is possible that the Bassano's were familiar with Ganassi's extended range.<ref name=\":19\">''The Cambridge Companion to the Recorder'', p. 15: \"By far the largest amount of space in [Ganassi's treatise published in 1535] is devoted to details about ornamentation, which suggest a high level of extravagant embellishment in a remarkably rhythmically free manner...\"</ref>\n\nRecorders were also played with other instruments, especially in England, where it was called a mixed consort or \"broken consort\".\n\nOther 16th century composes whose instrumental music can be played well on recorder consorts include\n* [[Anthony Holborne]] (c. 1545{{Snd}} 1602)\n* [[Tielman Susato]] (c. 1510{{Snd}} c. 1570)\nOther notable composers of the Renaissance whose music may be played on the recorder include\n* [[Guillaume Dufay]] (1397\u20131474)\n* [[Johannes Ockeghem]] (1410/1425\u20131497)\n* [[Josquin des Prez]] (1450/1455\u20131521)\n* [[Heinrich Isaac]]  (1450\u20131517)\n* [[Ludwig Senfl]]  (1486{{Snd}} c. 1542)\n* [[Orlando di Lasso]] (c. 1530{{Snd}} 1594)\n* [[William Byrd]] (c. 1539{{Snd}} 1623)\n* [[John Dowland]] (1563\u20131626)\n\n==== Cultural significance ====\nThe recorder achieved great popularity in the 16th century, and is one of the most common instruments of the Renaissance. From the 15th century onwards, paintings show upper-class men and women playing recorder, and Virdung's didactic treatise ''Musica getutscht'' (1511), the first of its kind, was aimed at the amateur (see also Documentary evidence). Famously, [[Henry VIII of England]] was an avid player of the recorder, and at his death in 1547 an [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of his possessions]] included 76 recorders in consorts of various sizes and materials.<ref name=\":14\">''Oxford Companion to Music''. see section 2 of the article on \"Recorder Family\"</ref> Some Italian paintings from the 16th-century show aristocracy of both sexes playing the recorder, however many gentlemen found it unbecoming to play because it uses the mouth, preferring the lute and later the viol.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAt the turn of the 17th century, playwright William Shakespeare famously referenced the recorder in his most substantial play, \"The Tragedy of [[Hamlet]], Prince of Denmark,\" creating an extended metaphor between manipulation and playing a musical instrument.<ref name=\":15\">''[[Hamlet]]'', [[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 3#Scene 2.

These innovations allowed baroque recorders to possess a tone regarded as \"sweeter\" than that of the earlier instruments,<ref>Jonathan Wainwright and Peter Holman, ''From Renaissance To Baroque: Change in Instruments and Instrumental Music in the Seventeenth Century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7546-0403-9}}</ref> at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes.\n\nThe evolution of the Renaissance recorder into the Baroque instrument is generally attributed to the [[Hotteterre]] family, in France. They developed the ideas of a more tapered bore, bringing the finger-holes of the lowermost hand closer together, allowing greater range, and enabling the construction of instruments in several jointed sections. The last innovation allowed more accurate shaping of each section and also offered the player minor tuning adjustments, by slightly pulling out one of the sections to lengthen the instrument.\n\nThe French innovations were taken to London by Pierre [[Peter Bressan|Bressan]], a set of whose instruments survive in the [[Grosvenor Museum]], [[Chester]], as do other examples in various American, European and Japanese museums and private collections. Bressan's contemporary, [[Thomas Stanesby]], was born in [[Derbyshire]] but became an instrument maker in London. He and his son (Thomas Stanesby junior) were the other important British-based recorder-makers of the early 18th century.\n\nIn continental Europe, the [[Johann Christoph Denner|Denner]] family of Nuremberg were the most celebrated makers of this period.\n\nThe baroque recorder produces a most brilliant and projecting sound in the second octave, which is more facile and extended than that of earlier recorders, while the lowest notes in its range are relatively weak. Composers such as Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi exploit this property in their concertos for the instrument.\n\nMeasured from its lowest to its highest playable note, the baroque alto recorder has a range of at most two octaves and a fifth with many instruments having a smaller range. Even the most developed instruments of the period, however, cannot produce the augmented tonic, third and fourth of the third octave. Notably, [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]'s concerto TWV 51:F1 makes use some of these notes in the third octave, posing significant technical challenges to the player, perhaps requiring the covering of the bell or other unusual techniques.\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nDuring the baroque period, the recorder was traditionally associated with pastoral scenes, miraculous events, funerals, marriages, and amorous scenes. Images of recorders can be found in literature and artwork associated with all of these. [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&nbsp;S. Bach]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] used the recorder to suggest shepherds and imitate birds in their music.<ref>Nicholas S. Lander [http://www.recorderhomepage.net The Recorder Homepage] (1996\u2013 ). Last accessed 30 June 2014.</ref>\n\nAlthough the recorder achieved a greater level of standardization in the Baroque than in previous periods, indeed it is the first period in which there was a \"standard\" size of recorder, ambiguous nomenclature and uncertain organological evidence have led to controversy regarding which instruments should be used in some \"flute\" parts from the period.\n\n===== Fourth Brandenburg Concerto BWV 1049 =====\nThe concertino group of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] fourth [[Brandenburg Concerto]] in G major, BWV 1049, consists of a ''violono principale'', and {{lang|it|due fiauti d'echo}}, with ripieno strings. His later harpsichord transcription of this concerto, BWV 1057, lowers the key by a tone, as in all of Bach's harpsichord transcriptions, and is scored for solo harpsichord, two ''fiauti \u00e0 bec'' and ripieno strings. The desired instrument for the ''fiauti d'echo'' parts in BWV 1049 has been a matter of perennial musicological and organological debate for two primary reasons: first, the term ''fiauto d'echo'' is not mentioned in dictionaries or tutors of the period; and second, the first ''fiauto'' part uses F#6, a note which is difficult to produce on a Baroque alto recorder in F4.\n\nThe instrumentation of BWV 1057 is uncontroversial: ''fiauti \u00e0 bec'' unambiguously specifies recorders, and both parts have been modified to fit comfortably on altos in F4, avoiding, for example, an unplayable Eb4 in the second ''fiauto'' that would have resulted from a simple transposition of a tone.\n\nFor the first and last movements of the concerto, two opinions predominate: first, that both recorder parts should be played on alto recorders in F4; and second, that the first part should be played on an alto recorder in G and the second part on an alto in F. Tushaar Power has argued for the alto in G4 on the basis that Bach uses the high F#6, which can be easily played on an alto in G4, but not the low F4, a note not playable on the alto in G4. He corroborates this with other alto recorder parts in Bach's cantatas. Michael Marissen reads the repertoire differently, demonstrating that in other recorder parts, Bach used both the low F4 and F#6, as well as higher notes. Marissen argues that Bach was not as consistent as Power asserts, and that Bach would have almost certainly had access to only altos in F. He corroborates this with examinations of pitch standards and notation in Bach's cantatas, in which the recorder parts are sometimes written as transposing instruments to play with organs that sounded as much as a minor third above written pitch. Marissen also reads Bach's revisions to the recorder parts in BWV 1057 as indicative of his avoidance of F#6 in BWV 1049, a sign that he only used the difficult note when necessary in designing the part for an alto recorder in F4. He posits that Bach avoided F#6 in BWV 1049, at the cost of inferior counterpoint, reinstating them as E6 in BWV 1057.\n\nIn the second movement, breaking of beaming in the ''fiauto'' parts, markings of ''f'' and ''p,'' the fermata over the final double bar of the first movement, and the 21 bars of rest at the beginning of the third have led some musicologists to argue that Bach intended the use of \"echo flutes\" distinct from normal recorders in the second movement in particular. The breaking of beaming could be an indication of changes in register or tonal quality, the rests introduced to allow the players time to change instruments, and the markings of ''f'' and ''p'' further indicative of register or sound changes. Marissen has demonstrated that the ''f'' and ''p'' markings probably indicated tutti and solo sections rather than loud and soft ones.\n\nA number of instruments other than normal recorders have been suggested for the ''fiauto d'echo''. One of the earliest proposed alternatives, by Thurston Dart, was the use of double flageolets, a suggestion since revealed to be founded on unsteady musicological grounds. Dart did, however, bring to light numerous newspaper references to Paisible's performance on an \"echo flute\" between 1713 and 1718. Another contemporary reference to the \"echo flute\" is in Etienne Louli\u00e9's ''Elements ou principes de musique'' (Amsterdan, 1696): ''Les sons de deux flutes d'echo sont differents, parce que l'un est fort, & que l'autre est foible'' (The sounds of two echo flutes are different, because one is strong and the other is weak). Louli\u00e9 is unclear on why one would need two echo flutes to play strongly and weakly, and on why it is that echo flutes differ. Perhaps the echo flute was composed in two halves: one which plays strongly, the other weakly? On this we can only speculate.\n\nSurviving instruments which are candidates for echo flutes include an instrument in Leipzig which consists of two recorders of different tonal characteristics joined together at the head and footjoints by brass flanges. There is also evidence of double recorders tuned in thirds, but these are not candidates for the ''fiauto'' parts in BWV 1049.\n\n===== \"Concerti per flautino\" RV 443, 444, 445 =====\n[[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] wrote three concertos for the {{lang|it|flautino}}, possibly for performance by students at the [[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]] in Venice, where he taught and composed in the early 18th century. They feature virtuosic solo writing, and along with his concerto RV 441 and trio sonata RV 86 are his most virtuosic recorder works. They each survive a single hastily written manuscript copy, each titled ''Con.to per Flautino'' (Concerto for little flute) with the additional note ''Gl'istrom.ti trasportati alla 4a'' (The instruments transpose by a fourth) in RV 443 and ''Gl'istrom.ti alla 4ta Bassa'' (The instruments lower by a fourth) in RV 445. The three concertos RV 443, 444, and 445 are notated in C major, C major and A minor respectively. Also of note is the occasional use of notes outside the normal two octave compass of the recorder: the range of the solo sections is two octaves from notated F4 to notated F6, however there is a single notated C4 in the first movement of RV 444, a notated E4 in a tutti section in the first movement of RV 443 and low E4 in multiple tutti sections of RV 445.\n\nA number of possible ''flautini''  have been proposed as the instrument intended for the performance of these concertos. The first suggestion was the use of the one keyed piccolo, or another small transverse flute, however such instruments had fallen out of use in Venice by the generally accepted time of composition of these concertos in the 1720s, and this opinion is no longer considered well supported. Another suggestion, first proposed by Peter Thalheimer, is the \"french\" flageolet (see Flageolets below) in G5, which was notated in D4, appearing a fourth lower, possibly explaining the note in the margins of RV 443 and RV 445 (''Gl'istromti transportati alla 4a'') and supported by Bismantova (1677 rev. 1694) and Bonanni (1722) which equate ''flautino'' to the flageolet. However this suggestion has been opposed by the presence of notated F{{sub|4}} and F{{music|#}}{{sub|4}} which are not within the typical compass of the flageolet, although they may be produced through the covering of the bell, sometimes combined with underblowing, as attested by theorists as early as Cardano (c.&nbsp;1546) and as late as Bellay (c.&nbsp;1800).<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Flautino' und 'Flasolet' bei Antonio Vivaldi|last = Thalheimer|first = Peter|date = 1998|journal = Tibia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 2|volume = 23|pages = 97\u2013105|trans-title = 'Flautino' and 'Flasolet' in Antonio Vivaldi's works}}</ref>\n\nTwo instruments are conventionally accepted today for the performance of these concertos, the sopranino recorder, notated like an alto but sounding an octave higher, and the soprano recorder, following the instruction to transpose the parts down by a fourth. Winfried Michel was first to argue in favor of the soprano recorder in 1983, when he proposed to take Vivaldi at his word and transpose the string parts down a fourth and play the ''flautino'' part on a soprano recorder in C5 (also \"fifth-flute\") using the English practice of notating such flutes as transposing instruments using the fingerings of an alto recorder. Michel notes that this transposition allows for the use of the violins' and viola's lowest strings (in sections where they provide the accompaniment without bass) and the lowest two notes of the 'cello. He attributes the presence of notes not in the recorder's normal compass to Vivaldi's haste, noting that these notes do not appear in the solo sections.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Vivaldis Konzerte 'per Flautino' in ihrer wahren Gestalt: Ein letzter Leseversuch|last = Michel|first = Winfried|date = 1998|journal = Tibia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 2|volume = 23|pages = 106\u201311|trans-title = Vivaldi's concertos 'per flautino' in their true form: A final attempt at a reading}}</ref> He has edited editions of RV 443 and RV 445 for soprano recorder in G major and E minor respectively. Federico Maria Sardelli concurs with Michel in supposing that the margin note was intended to allow the performance of the concertos on the soprano recorder on a specific occasion, however concludes that they were probably written for the sopranino recorder in F5, noting that small transverse flutes had fallen out of use in Italy by Vivaldi's time, the paucity of flageolets in Italy, the range of the parts, and uses of the flautino in vocal arias.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1225&context=ppr|title = \"Vivaldi's Music for Flute and Recorder\" by Federico Sardelli|last = Bowers|first = Jane|date = 2008|journal = Performance Practice Review|doi = 10.5642/perfpr.200813.01.09|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 9|volume = 13|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\n===Classical and Romantic===\nThe recorder was little used in art music of the [[Classical music|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods. Researchers have long debated why this change occurred, and to what extent the recorder remained use in the late 18th century, and later the 19th century. A significant question in this debate is which, if any, duct flutes of this period are recorders or successors to recorders.\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nThe recorder work of the latter half of the 18th century most known today is probably a trio sonata by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;E. Bach]], Wq.163, composed in 1755{{Snd}} an arrangement of a trio sonata for two violins and continuo, scored for the unusual ensemble of viola, bass recorder and continuo.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Trio Sonata in F major, H.588 (Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel)|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Trio_Sonata_in_F_major,_H.588_(Bach,_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref> This work is also notable for being perhaps the only significant surviving historical solo work for bass recorder. Also of note are the works of Johann Christoph Schultze ({{circa}} 1733\u20131813), who wrote two concertos for the instrument, one in [[G major]] and another in [[B-flat major|B{{music|b}} major]], written around 1740.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Schultze, Johann Christian (c. 1740): Concert B flat-Major-EW986|url = http://www.edition-walhall.de/en/woodwind-/recorder/schultze-johann-christian-ca-1740-concert-b-flat-major.html|website = www.edition-walhall.de|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = Franz|last = Biersack}}</ref> The last occurrences of the recorder in art music are apparently by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] in ''[[Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn]]'' (1801) and ''Kleiner Tusch'' (1806). [[Hector Berlioz]] may have intended \"La fuite en Egypte\" from ''[[L'enfance du Christ]]'' (1853) for the instrument.<ref name=\":7\" /> [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] owned three recorders.<ref name=\":21\">{{harvnb|Griscom|Lasocki|2012|loc=\"A guide to the writings about the recorder for players and researchers\" (preface)}}</ref>\n\n==== Decline ====\nMany reasons supporting the conventional view that the recorder declined have been proposed. The first significant explanation for the recorder's decline was proposed by Waitzman (1967),<ref>Waitzman, Daniel: \"The Decline of the Recorder in the 18th Century\". Published in ''American Recorder'' 8 no. 2 (Spring 1967). pp.&nbsp;47\u201351</ref> who proposed six reasons:\n# The recorder lacked a significant class of professional players\n# The recorder's true nature was not appreciated\n# The high [[tessitura]] of the instrument discouraged composers from writing idiomatically for the instrument\n# The exploitation of the highest registers posed special problems for makers and players\n# Interest in clarino (4\u2032 pitch) instruments was waning\n# As a result of the first five factors, the recorder had a bad reputation, which discouraged students from studying the instrument \nIn the Baroque, the majority of professional recorder players were primarily oboists or string players. For this reason, the number of professional exponents of the recorder was smaller than that of other woodwinds.\n\nOthers attribute the decline of the recorder in part to the flute innovators of the time, such as [[Heinrich Grenser|Grenser]], and [[Johann George Tromlitz|Tromlitz]], who extended the transverse flute's range and evened out its tonal consistency through the addition of keys, or to the supposedly greater dynamic range and volume of the flute.<ref>Donald Murray et al. ''Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music'', Oxford University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-19-816504-8}}. p.&nbsp;122</ref> Similar developments occurring in many other orchestral instruments to make them louder, increase their range, and increase their tonal consistency did not simultaneously occur in the case of the recorder.\n\nA complementary view recently advanced by Nikolaj Tarasov is that the recorder, rather than totally disappearing, evolved in similar ways to other wind instruments through the addition of keys and other devices, and remained in use throughout the 19th century, with its direct descendant's popularity overlapping with the late 19th and early 20th century recorder revival.<ref name=\":22\" /> Support for this view rests on the organological classification of some 19th century duct flutes as recorders. For more on this question, see \"Other duct flutes\".\n\n==== Other duct flutes ====\nDuct flutes remained popular even as the recorder waned in the 18th century. As in the instrument's earliest history, questions of the instrument's quiddity are at the forefront of modern debate. The modification and renaming of recorders in the 18th century in order to prolong their use, and the uncertainty of the extent of the recorder's use the late 18th and early 19th centuries have fueled these debates. Some recent researchers contend that some 19th century duct flutes are actually recorders. This article briefly discusses the duct flutes presented as successors to the recorder: the English flageolet and the csakan, which were popular among amateurs in the second half of the 18th century, and the whole of the 19th.\n\n===== Flageolets =====\n[[File:French and english flageolets.jpg|thumb|French flageolet, left; English flageolet, right. Mid 19th c. Note the seven finger holes and single thumb hole of the English flageolet]]\nThe word \"[[flageolet]]\" has been used since the 16th century to refer to small duct flutes, and the instrument is sometimes designated using general terms such as ''flautino'' and ''flauto piccolo'', complicating identification of its earliest form. It was first described by [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]] in ''Harmonie universelle'' (1636) as having four fingers on the front, and two thumb holes on the back, with lowest note C6 and a compass of two octaves. Like the recorder, the upper thumb hole is used as an octaving vent. Flageolets were generally small flutes, however their lowest note varies.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The English-Flageolet 1800\u20131900|last = Macmillan|first = Douglas|date = 2010|journal=[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]|doi = 10.1093/em/caq081|pmid = |issue = 4|volume = 38|pages = 559}}</ref> They were initially popular in France, and it is from there that the flageolet first arrived in England in the seventeenth century, becoming a popular amateur instrument, as the recorder later did. Indeed, when the recorder was introduced to England it was presented as an easy instrument for those who already played the flageolet, and the earliest English recorder tutors are notated in the flageolet tablature of the time, called \"dot-way\".<ref name=\":21\" /> Notably, the diarist and naval administrator [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633\u20131703) and his wife were both amateur players of the flageolet, and Pepys was later an amateur recorder player.\n\nStarting in the early 1800s, a number of innovations to the flageolet were introduced, including the addition of keys to extend its range and allow it to more easily play accidentals. They also included novel solutions to the problem of condensation: most commonly, a sea sponge was placed inside the wind chamber (the conical chamber above the windway) to soak up moisture, while novel solutions such as the insertion of a thin wooden wedge into the windway, the drilling of little holes in the side of the block to drain condensation and a complex system for draining condensation through a hollowed out block developed, were also developed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bahn frei!

Creative recorder construction in the nineteenth century|isbn = |issn = 1864-6204}}</ref> Around 1800 in England, the recorder (\"English flute,\" see Name) came to be called an \"English flageolet,\" appropriating the name of the more fashionable instrument. From at least this time to the present, the flageolet in its first form has been called the French flageolet to differentiate it from the so-called English flageolet.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The French Flageolet: An Introduction|url = http://www.flageolets.com/articles/introduction/french.php|website = www.flageolets.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = en-GB|first = Jacob|last = Head}}</ref>\n\nFrom around 1803, when the London instrument maker William Bainbridge obtained a number of patents for improvements to the English flageolet, instruments were often referred as \"improved\" or \"patent\" flageolets with little reference to how they actually differed from their predecessors. In this period, the instrument had six finger holes and single thumb hole, and had as many as six keys. Tarasov reports that the English flageolets of the late 18th century had six finger holes and no thumb hole, and later regained the thumb hole seventh finger hole (see above, right).<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Blockfl\u00f6ten im 19.

Both remained popular until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nA significant amount of music was written for the flageolet in the 19th century, such as the etudes of Narcisse Bousquet although much of it was directed at amateurs.\n\nEnglish flageolets that may qualify as recorders are of two types: those early instruments, called \"English flageolets,\" which were actually recorders, and 19th century instruments with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. These instruments are not typically regarded as recorders, however Tarasov has argued for their inclusion in the family.\n\n===== Csakan =====\nThe csakan (from Hung. ''cs\u00e1k\u00e1ny \"''pickaxe\"), also known by the recorder's old french name ''flute douce'', was a duct flute in the shape of a walking stick or oboe popular in [[Vienna]] from about 1800 to the 1840s. The csakan was played using the fingerings of a recorder in C, and was typically pitched in A{{music|flat}} or G and played as a transposing instrument. The first documented appearance of the csakan was at a concert in [[Budapest]] on February 18, 1807 in a performance by its billed inventor, Anton Heberle ({{floruit}} 1806\u201316). Tarasov has contested Heberle's status as the inventor of the instrument, and has argued that the csakan grew out of a Hungarian war hammer of the same name, which was converted into a recorder, perhaps for playing military music. Around 1800, it was highly fashionable for make walking sticks with additional functions (e.g., umbrellas, swords, flutes, oboes, clarinets, horns) although the csakan was the most popular of these, and the only one that became a musical instrument in its own right.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Was ist ein Csakan? Von der Waffe zum Musikinstrument|last = Tarasov|first = Nikolaj|date = 2009|journal = Windkanal|doi = |pmid = |issue = 1|trans-title = What is a csakan? From war hammer to musical instrument|issn = 1864-6204|pages = 14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest instruments were shaped like a walking stick with a mouthpiece in the handle and had no keys, although they could eventually have up to thirteen keys, along with a tuning slide and a device for narrowing the thumb hole. In the 1820s a csakan \"in the pleasing shape of an oboe\" was introduced in a \"simple\" form with a single key and a \"complex\" form with up to twelve keys like those found on contemporaneous flutes. Well known makers of the csakan included Johann Ziegler and Stephan Koch in Vienna, and Franz Sch\u00f6llnast in [[Bratislava|Pressburg]]. According to accounts left by Sch\u00f6llnast, the csakan was primarily an amateur instrument, purchased by those who wanted something simple and inexpensive, however there were also accomplished professionals, such as Viennese court oboist Ernst Kr\u00e4hmer (1795\u20131837) who toured as far afield as Russia, playing the csakan with acclaimed virtuosity.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Csakan|last = Betz|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = |work = Grove Music Online|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/06917}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAround 400 works for the csakan were published in the first half of the 19th century, mainly for csakan solo, csakan duet or csakan with guitar or piano. The csakan's repertoire has not yet been fully explored. Notable composers for the instrument include Heberle and Kr\u00e4hmer, and Tarasov notes that piano works by Beethoven were arranged for csakan and guitar ([[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] is reported to have owned a walking-stick csakan). Modern recorder makers such as [[Conrad Mollenhauer GmbH|Bernhard Mollenhauer]] and Martin Wenner have made csakan copies.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Csakan|url = http://csakan.de/en|website = csakan.de|access-date = 2016-02-14|last = Mollenhauer|first = Bernhard}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = J.

Accounts of Kr\u00e4hmer's playing, which report his \"diminishing and swelling the notes, up to an almost unbelievable loudness\" imply a developed technique using shading and alternate fingerings, far beyond a purely amateur culture of house music. Additionally, Tarasov reports that some recorders by Baroque makers were modified, around 1800, through the addition of keys, including a [[Johann Christoph Denner|J.&nbsp;C. Denner]] (1655\u20131707) basset recorder in Budapest and an alto by Nikolaus Staub (1664\u20131734) with added G{{music|#}} keys, like the D{{music|#}} key on a baroque two-key flute. Another modification is the narrowing of the thumb hole, by way of an ivory plug on the J.&nbsp;C. Denner basset and an alto by Benedikt Gahn (1674\u20131711), to allow it to serve purely as an octaving vent, as found on many flageolets and csakans. These changes may be archetypal to those found on csakans and flageolets, and constitute an inchoate justification for the continuous development of the Baroque recorder into its 19th-century relatives.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Barockblockfl\u00f6ten 2.0: Indizien f\u00fcr die Verwendung von Barockblockfl\u00f6ten um 1800|last = Tarasov|first = Nikolaj|date = 2010|journal = Windkanal|doi = |pmid = |issue = 1|year = |trans-title = Baroque recorders 2.0: indicators of the use of Baroque recorders around 1800|pages = 12\u201315|isbn = |issn = 1864-6204}}</ref>\n\n===Modern revival===\n==== The \"revival\" ====\nThe concept of a recorder \"revival\" must be considered in the context of the decline of the recorder in the 18th and 19th centuries. The craft of recorder making was continued in some form by a number of families, such as the {{Lang|de|Berchtesgaden Fleitl}} produced by the Oeggle family, which traces its lineage to the Walch family of recorder makers<ref>MacMillan, D. (2007). \"The Recorder 1800\u20131905\". ''Recorder Magazine'' 27(4): 126\u2013131.</ref> the careers of the Schlosser family of [[Zwota]]. Heinrich Oskar Schlosser (1875\u20131947) made instruments sold by the firm of [[Moeck Musikinstrumente + Verlag|Moeck]] in Celle and helped to design their Tuju series of recorders.<ref>Tarasov, N.

''Windkanal'' 4: 14\u201317. {{in lang|de}}</ref> The firm [[Conrad Mollenhauer GmbH|Mollenhauer]], currently headed by Bernhard Mollenhauer, can trace its origins to historical instrument makers.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite web|title = Csakan|url = http://www.csakan.de/en|website = www.csakan.de|access-date = 2016-02-10|last = Mollenhauer}}</ref>\n\nThe recorder, if it did persist through the 19th century, did so in a manner quite unlike the success it enjoyed in previous centuries, or that it would enjoy in the century to come in. Among the earliest ensembles to begin use of recorders in the 20th century was the [[Bogenhauser K\u00fcnstlerkapelle]] (Bogenhausen Artists' Band) which from 1890 to 1939 used antique recorders and other instruments to play music of all ages, including arrangements of classical and romantic music. Nonetheless, the recorder was considered primarily an instrument of historical interest.\n\nThe eventual success of the recorder in the modern era is often attributed to [[Arnold Dolmetsch]]. While he was responsible for broadening interest in the United Kingdom beyond the small group of early music specialists, Dolmetsch was not solely responsible for the recorder's broader revival.  On the continent his efforts were preceded by those of musicians at the Brussels Conservatoire (where Dolmetsch received his training), and by the German [[Bogenhauser K\u00fcnstlerkapelle]]. Also in Germany, the work of Willibald Gurlitt, Werner Danckerts and Gustav Scheck proceeded quite independently of the Dolmetsches.<ref>Eve E. O'Kelly, ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-36681-X}}. Chapter 1: The Revival</ref>\n\n==== Players ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2019}}\n{{see also|List of recorder players}}\nCarl Dolmetsch, the son of Arnold Dolmetsch, became one of the first virtuoso recorder players in the 1920s; but more importantly he began to commission recorder works from leading composers of his day, especially for performance at the Haslemere festival which his father ran. Initially as a result of this, and later as a result of the development of a Dutch school of recorder playing led by Kees Otten, the recorder was introduced to serious musicians as a virtuoso solo instrument both in Britain and in northern Europe.\n\nAmong the influential virtuosos who figure in the revival of the recorder as a serious concert instrument in the latter part of the 20th century are Ferdinand Conrad, Kees Otten, [[Frans Br\u00fcggen]], Roger Cotte, [[Hans-Martin Linde]], [[New York Pro Musica|Bernard Krainis]], and [[David Munrow]]. Br\u00fcggen recorded most of the landmarks of the historical repertoire and commissioned a substantial number of new works for the recorder. Munrow's 1975 double album ''The Art of the Recorder'' remains as an important anthology of recorder music through the ages.\n\nAmong late 20th-century and early 21st-century recorder ensembles, the trio [[Sour Cream Trio|Sour Cream]] (led by [[Frans Br\u00fcggen]]), [[Flautando K\u00f6ln]], the [[Flanders Recorder Quartet]], [[Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet]] and [[Quartet New Generation]] have programmed remarkable mixtures of historical and contemporary repertoire. Soloists such as [[Piers Adams]], [[Dan Laurin]] and [[Dorothee Oberlinger]],  [[Michala Petri]], [[Maurice Steger]].\n\nIn the 2012 Charlotte Barbour-Condini became the first recorder player to reach the final of the biennial [[BBC Young Musician of the Year]] competition. Recorder player Sophie Westbrooke was a finalist in the 2014 competition.<ref>{{citation|author=BBC|title=BBC Young Musician|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2z5sMZbDZKnvmdml5FjxnLH/sophie-westbrooke|accessdate=25 November 2014|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Structure ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2019}}\nThe first recorders to be played in the modern period were antique instruments from previous periods. Anecdotally, Arnold Dolmetsch was motivated to make his own recorders after losing a bag containing his antique instruments. Recorders made in the early 20th century were imitative of baroque models in their exterior form, but differed significantly in their structure. Dolmetsch introduced English fingering, the now standard fingering for \"baroque\" model instruments, and standardized the doubled 6th and 7th holes found on a handful of antique instruments by the English makers Stanesby and Bressan. Dolmetsch instruments generally had a large rectangular windway, unlike the curved windways of all historical instruments, and played at modern pitch.\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nNearly twice as many pieces have been written for the recorder since its modern revival as were written in all previous epochs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Catalogue of Recorder Repertoire: Home|url = http://www.blokfluit.org/|website = www.blokfluit.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref> Many of these were composed by avant-garde composers of the latter half of the 20th century who used the recorder for the variety of extended techniques which are possible using its open holes and its sensitivity to articulation.\n\n{{Listen|type=music\n|filename    = Colin Ross - Etherea.ogg\n|title       = Etherea (Colin Ross, 1995)\n|description = [[New-age music]] performed on the recorder. 03:08 minutes}}\nModern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[J\u00fcrg Baur]], [[Josef Tal]], [[John Tavener]], [[Michael Tippett]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Steven Stucky]] and [[Edmund Rubbra]].\n\nOwing to its ubiquity as a teaching instrument and the relative ease of sound production, the recorder has occasionally been used in popular music by groups such as [[The Beatles]];<ref>For example, in \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\", according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S.

Notable historical makers include the Rafi, Schnitzer and Bassano families in the renaissance; [[Thomas Stanesby|Stanesby]] (Jr. and Sr.), [[Johann Christoph Denner|J.C.]] and [[Johann Christoph Denner|J. Denner]], [[Jacques-Martin Hotteterre|Hotteterre]], [[Peter Bressan|Bressan]], Haka, Heitz, Rippert, Rottenburgh, Steenbergen and Terton. Most of these makers also built other wind instruments such as oboes and transverse flutes. Notably, [[Jacob Denner]] is credited with the development of the clarinet from the chalumeau.\n\nRecorder making declined with the instrument's wane in the late 18th century, essentially severing the craft's transmission to the modern age. With few exceptions, the duct flutes manufactured in the 19th and late 18th centuries were intended for amateur or educational use, and were not constructed to the high standard of earlier epochs.\n\n[[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the first to achieve commercial production in the 20th century, began to build recorders in 1919. While these early recorders played at a low pitch like that of the available originals, he did not strive for exactitude in reproduction, and by the 1930s the Dolmetsch family firm, then under the direction of Arnold's son Carl Dolmetsch, was mass-producing recorders at modern pitch with wide, straight windways, and began to produce [[bakelite]] recorders shortly after the Second World War. Nonetheless, the Dolmetsch models were innovative for their time and proved influential, particularly in standardizing the English fingering system now standard for modern baroque-style instruments and doubled 6th and 7th holes, which are rare on antique instruments.\n\nIn Germany, [[Peter Harlan]] began to manufacture recorders in the 1920s, primarily for educational use in the youth movement. Following Harlan's success, numerous makers such as Adler and [[Conrad Mollenhauer GmbH|Mollenhauer]] began commercial production of recorders, fueling an explosion in the instrument's popularity in Germany. These recorders shared little in common with antiques, with large straight windways, anachronistically pitched consorts, modified fingering systems and other innovations.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, historically informed performance practice was on the rise and recorder makers increasingly sought to imitate the sound and character of antiques. The German-American maker [[Friedrich von Huene (musician)|Friedrich von Huene]] was among the first to research recorders held in European collections and produce instruments intended to reproduce the qualities of the antiques. Von Huene and his Australian colleague Frederick Morgan sought to connect the tradition of the historical wind-makers to the modern day with the understanding that doing so creates the best instruments, and those most suited to ancient music.\n\nVirtually all recorders manufactured today claim ascendancy to an antique model and most makers active today can trace their trade directly to one of these pioneering makers.\n\nToday, makers maintaining individual workshops include Ammann, Blezinger, Bolton, Boudreau, Breukink, Brown, Coomber, Cranmore, de Paolis, Ehlert, Grinter (dead), Marvin (dead), Meyer, Musch, Netsch, Prescott, Rohmer, Takeyama, von Huene, and Wenner. French maker Philippe Bolton created an electroacoustic recorder<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flute-a-bec.com/electrgb.html|title=Philippe Bolton, Recorder Maker{{Snd}} Electroacoustic Recorders|website=www.flute-a-bec.com}}</ref> and is among the last to offer mounted bell-keys and double bell-keys for both tenor and alto recorders.

Orff's five-volume opus of educational music ''Music for Children'' contains many pieces for recorders, usually scored for other instruments as well.<ref>Regner, Hermann. Orff-Schulwerk Floetenbuch, Preface. Translated by I.M. Rushworth. http://www.vosa.org/paul/sales_folder/orff_recorder.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042013/http://www.vosa.org/paul/sales_folder/orff_recorder.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nManufacturers have made recorders out of [[bakelite]] and other more modern plastics; they are thus easy to produce, hence inexpensive. Because of this, recorders are popular in schools, as they are one of the cheapest instruments to buy in bulk.<ref>Margo Hall, ''Teaching Kids Recorder'', iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-36743-7}}{{Self-published source|date=May 2019}}</ref> They are also relatively easy to play at a basic level because sound production needs only breath, and pitch is basically determined by fingering. It is, however, incorrect to assume that mastery is similarly easy\u2014like any other instrument, the recorder requires study to play well and in tune, and significant study to play at an advanced or professional level.\n\n==Recorder ensembles==\nThe recorder is a very social instrument. Many recorder players participate in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Recorder+flute |title=Recorder flute definition of Recorder flute in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of recorder music]]\n* [[List of recorder players]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last1=Griscom |first1=Richard |last2=Lasocki |first2=David |year=2012 |title=The Recorder: A Research and Information Guide |edition=3rd |series=Routledge Music Bibliographies |location=New York & London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-99858-1 |oclc=743214715 |ref=harv}} {{ISBN|978-0-203-87502-5}} (e-book).\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Recorders (musical instrument)}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Recorder (musical instrument)}}\n*[http://www.recorderhomepage.net/ Recorder Home Page]{{Snd}} A comprehensive website devoted to the recorder\n*[http://www.flute-a-bec.com/acoustiquegb.html How the recorder works]\n*[http://recordersheetmusic.org/ Interactive Sheet Music for the Recorder]\n*[http://www.flute-a-bec.com/tablhistogb.html Philippe Bolton\u2019s page of Historical recorder fingering charts]\n*[http://www.flute-a-bec.com/tablaturgb.html Philippe Bolton\u2019s page of modern recorder fingering charts]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190928154618/http://www.recorder-fingerings.com/ Recorder fingerings], Charts and trill charts, recorder-fingerings.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110710143437/http://www.dolmetsch.com/fingerings.htm Recorder fingerings], Dolmetsch Online\n*[https://archive.today/20141120204518/http://www.moeck.com/cms/index.php?id=38&L=1 Recorder fingerings], Moeck\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141110001837/http://www.mollenhauer.com/en/recorders/fingering-charts Recorder fingerings], Mollenhauer\n*[http://www.wfg.woodwind.org/recorder/ Recorder fingerings], Woodwind fingering guide \t\n*[https://www.zotero.org/paganpiper/items/collectionKey/EMSH9CWV/order/creator/sort/asc Nicholas Lander's Recorder Bibliography], A Zotero bibliographic database that contains details of some 4,000 references concerning the recorder.\n\n{{Flutes}}\n{{Renaissance music}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Baroque instruments]]\n[[Category:Early musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Internal fipple flutes]]\n[[Category:Recorders (musical instruments)| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|||Recorder (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox Instrument\n| name                  = Recorder\n| image                 = VariousRecorderFlutes.jpg\n| image_size            = 250px\n| alt                   = \n| caption               = ''Various recorders (second from the bottom disassembled into its three parts)''\n| background            =woodwind\n| names = See {{section link||Other languages}}\n| classification        =\n*[[Wind instrument|Wind]] \n*[[Woodwind instrument|Woodwind]]\n*[[Aerophone]]\n| hornbostel_sachs      = 421.221.12\n| hornbostel_sachs_desc = Flute with internal duct and finger holes\n| inventors             = \n| developed             =\n| timbre                = \n| volume                = \n| attack                = \n| decay                 = \n| range                 = Soprano recorder: C<sub>5</sub>\u2013D<sub>7</sub>(G<sub>7</sub>)[[File:Tonumfang-Sopranblockfl\u00f6te.jpg|180px|center]]\n| pitch                 = \n| related               =\n*[[Tin whistle]]\n*[[Flageolet]]\n*[[Csakan]]\n*[[Three-hole pipe]]\n| musicians             =[[List of recorder players|Recorder players]]\n| builders              =\n| articles              =\n}}\n\nThe '''recorder''' is a family of [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] [[musical instrument]] in the group known as ''internal duct flutes''\u2014[[Flute|flutes]] with a [[whistle]] mouthpiece, also known as [[fipple]] flutes. A recorder can be distinguished from other duct flutes by the presence of a thumb-hole for the upper hand and seven finger-holes: three for the upper hand and four for the lower. It is the most prominent duct flute in the [[Classical music|western classical tradition]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42041|title = Duct flute|date = |access-date = 2016-02-06|website = Grove Music Online|publisher = Oxford University Press|last = Montagu|first = Jeremy}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nRecorders are made in different sizes with names and compasses roughly corresponding to different vocal ranges. The sizes most commonly in use today are the soprano (aka \"descant\", lowest note [[Scientific pitch notation|C<sub>5</sub>]]), alto (aka \"treble\", lowest note F<sub>4</sub>), tenor (lowest note C<sub>4</sub>) and bass (lowest note F<sub>3</sub>). Recorders are traditionally constructed from wood and ivory, while most recorders made in recent years are constructed from molded plastic. The recorders' internal and external proportions vary, but the bore is generally reverse conical (i.e. tapering towards the foot) to cylindrical, and all recorder fingering systems make extensive use of [[#Forked fingerings|forked fingerings]].\n\nThe recorder is first documented in Europe in the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], and continued to enjoy wide popularity in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] periods, but was little used in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods. It was revived in the 20th century as part of the [[historically informed performance]] movement, and became a popular amateur and educational instrument. Composers who have written for the recorder include [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Luciano Berio]], and [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Today, there are many professional [[List of recorder players|recorder players]] who demonstrate the instrument's full solo range and a large community of amateurs.<ref name=\":5\">For example, Eve O'Kelly describes how [[Frans Br\u00fcggen]] \"achieved worldwide recognition as a recorder virtuoso\" in her book ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-36681-X}}. p. 62</ref>\n\nThe sound of the recorder is often described as clear and sweet,<ref name=\":7\"/> and has historically been associated with birds and shepherds. It is notable for its quick response and its corresponding ability to produce a wide variety of articulations. This ability, coupled with its open finger holes, allow it to produce a wide variety of tone colors and special effects. Acoustically, its tone is relatively pure and, when the edge is positioned in the center of the\nairjet, odd harmonics predominate in its sound (when the edge is decidedly off-center, an even distribution of harmonics occurs).<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation |first=Jean-Marc |last=Bonard |date=January 2001 |title=The Physicist's Guide to the Orchestra |journal=[[European Journal of Physics]]|volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=89\u2013101 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/22/1/309 |arxiv=physics/0008053|bibcode=2001EJPh...22...89B }}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com:80/subscriber/article/grove/music/23022|archive-url = https://archive.today/20120525190031/http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/23022|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2012-05-25|title = Recorder|date = |access-date = 2016-02-06|website = Grove Music Online|publisher = Oxford University Press|last = Lasocki|first = David}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe instrument has been known by its modern English name at least since the 14th century. David Lasocki reports the earliest use of \"recorder\" in the household accounts of the [[Earl of Derby]] (later [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]) in 1388, which register {{Lang|la|i. fistula nomine Recordour}} (one pipe called 'Recordour').<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\">David Lasocki, \"Recorder\",  \u00a7I. 1: Nomenclature, ''Grove Music Online'', edited by Deane Root, Oxford Music Online {{subscription}}.</ref>\n\nBy the 15th century, the name had appeared in English literature.

The name of the instrument is also uniquely English: in Middle French there is no equivalent noun sense of ''recorder'' referring to a musical instrument.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/dmf/recorder1?idf=xxx;etym=recordari|title = R\u00e9sultats de \"recorder<sup>1</sup>\" dans le Dictionnaire du Moyen Fran\u00e7ais|date = |access-date = 2016-02-05|website = Dictionnaire du Moyen Fran\u00e7ais|publisher = Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nPartridge indicates that the use of the instrument by ''jongleurs'' led to its association with the verb: ''recorder'' the minstrel's action, a \"recorder\" the minstrel's tool.<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title = Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English|last = Partridge|first = Eric|publisher = Routledge|year = 1977|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> The reason we know this instrument as the recorder and not one of the other instruments played by the ''jongleurs'' is uncertain.\n\n=== \"Flute\" and \"recorder\" ===\nThe introduction of the Baroque recorder to England by a group of French professionals in 1673 popularized the French name for the instrument, \"flute douce\", or simply \"flute\", a name previously reserved for the transverse instrument. Until about 1695, the names \"recorder\" and \"flute\" overlapped, but from 1673 to the late 1720s in England, the word \"flute\" always meant recorder.<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\"/> In the 1720s, as the transverse flute overtook the recorder in popularity, English adopted the convention already present in other European languages of qualifying the word \"flute\", calling the recorder variously the \"common flute\", \"common English-flute\", or simply \"English flute\" while the transverse instrument was distinguished as the \"German flute\" or simply \"flute\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flute-a-bec.com/textestanesbygb.html|title=Stanesby : Tenor Recorder (\"The True Concert Flute\")|website=www.flute-a-bec.com}}</ref> Until at least 1765, some writers still used \"flute\" to mean recorder.<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\"/>\n\n=== Other languages ===\nUntil the mid 18th century, musical scores written in Italian refer to the instrument as {{lang|it|flauto}}, whereas the transverse instrument was called {{lang|it|flauto traverso}}. This distinction, like the English switch from \"recorder\" to \"flute,\" has caused confusion among modern editors, writers and performers.\n\nIndeed, in most European languages, the first term for the recorder was the word for flute alone. In the present day, cognates of the word \"flute,\" when used without qualifiers, remain ambiguous and may refer to either the recorder, the modern concert flute, or other non-western flutes. Starting in the 1530s, these languages began to add qualifiers to specify this particular flute.<ref name=\"ReferenceB2\"/> In the case of the recorder, these describe variously \n{{div col}}\n* the \"sweetness\" or \"gentleness\" of the sound\n** ''flauto dolce'' (Italian) \n** ''fl\u00fbte douce'' (French) \n** ''flauta dulce'' (Spanish) \n** ''flauta doce'' (Brazilian Portuguese)\n** ''flaut dulce'' (Romanian)\n* the \"beak\"\n** ''zobcov\u00e1 flauta'' (Slovak)\n** ''zobcov\u00e1 fl\u00e9tna'' (Czech)\n** ''fl\u00fbte \u00e0 bec'' (French) \n** ''flauta de pico'' (Spanish) \n** ''flauto a becco'' (Italian) \n** \u03c6\u03bb\u03ac\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 ''phlauto me ramphos'' (Greek)\n** ''bekfluto'' (Esperanto)\n** ''nokkahuilu'' (Finnish)\n* the block\n** ''Blockfl\u00f6te'' (German) \n** ''blokfluit'' (Dutch) \n** ''blokfluit'' (Afrikaans) \n** ''blokkfl\u00f8yte'' (Norwegian)\n** ''blokfl\u00f8jte'' (Danish)\n** {{Lang|se|blockfl\u00f6jt}} (Swedish) \n** ''blok flauta'' (Croatian)\n** ''blok fl\u00fct'' (Turkish)\n** \u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0444\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0430 ''blokfleita'' (Bulgarian and Russian)\n* its vertical orientation (as opposed to the \"transverse\" flute)\n** ''flauto diritto'' (Italian)\n** ''flet prosty'' (Polish)\n** \u7ad6\u7b1b ''\"shu-di\"'' (Chinese, Mainland China) \n** \u76f4\u7b1b ''\"zhi-di\"'' (Chinese, Taiwan) \n** \u7e26\u7b1b ''\"tatebue\"'' (Japanese) \n* the number of holes\n** ''fl\u00fbte \u00e0 neuf trous'' (archaic; French)\n** ''flauto da 8 fori'' (archaic; Italian) \n* a diminutive relation to the \"transverse\" flute \n**\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea \"khalilit\" (Hebrew: the suffix \u05d9\u05ea- \"-it\" is a diminutive; the transverse flute is known as \u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \"khalil\", from the [[Semitic root|root]] \"\u05d7\u05dc\u05dc\" which refers to a hollow inner space)\n* a supposed geographical origin\n**''fluste d'Angleterre'' (archaic; French)\n**''flauto italiano'' (archaic; Italian)\n* the ability for the recorder in C<sub>5</sub> to fit comfortably in the hand\n** ''handfluit'' (archaic; Dutch)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nSince the 15th century, a variety of sizes of recorder have been documented, but a consistent terminology and notation for the different sizes was not formulated until the 20th century.\n\n=== Modern recorders ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"float:right;\"\n!colspan=6|Ranges of the modern recorder family\n|-\n!

This is not, however, a reflection of sounding pitch, and serves primarily to denote the pitch relationships between the different instruments. Groups of recorders played together are referred to as \"consorts\". Recorders are also often referred to by their lowest sounding note: \"recorder in F\" refers to a recorder with lowest note<!-- n.b. this refers to the note 01234567, which may not be the lowest fingered note or even the lowest playable note --> F, in any octave.\n\nThe table in this section shows the standard names of modern recorders in F and C and their respective ranges. Music composed after the modern revival of the recorder most frequently uses soprano, alto, tenor, and bass recorders, although sopranino and great bass are also fairly common.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|title = Catalogue of Recorder Repertoire: Advanced search|url = http://www.blokfluit.org/modern/search-by-title/advanced-search/|website = www.blokfluit.org|access-date = 2016-02-04}}</ref>  Consorts of recorders are often referred to using the terminology of organ registers: 8\u2032 (8 foot) pitch referring to a consort sounding as written, 4\u2032 pitch a consort sounding an octave above written, and 16\u2032 a consort sounding an octave below written. The combination of these consorts is also possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Woodwind Instruments and Their History|last = Baines|first = Anthony|publisher = |year = 1957|isbn = |location = |page = 248}}</ref>\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the [[tessitura]] of a baroque recorder lies approximately one octave above the tessitura of the human voice type after which it is named. For example, the tessitura of a soprano voice is roughly C<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>6</sub>, while the tessitura of a soprano recorder is C<sub>5</sub>\u2013C<sub>7</sub>.\n\nModern variations include standard British terminology, due to [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], which refers to the recorder in C<sub>5</sub> (soprano) as the descant and the recorder in F<sub>4</sub> (alto) as the treble. As conventions and instruments vary, especially for larger and more uncommon instruments, it is often practical to state the recorder's lowest note along with its name to avoid confusion.\n\n==== Notation ====\nModern recorder parts are notated in the key they sound in. Parts for alto, tenor and contrabass recorders are notated at pitch, while parts for sopranino, soprano, bass, and great bass are typically notated an octave below their sounding pitch. As a result, soprano and tenor recorders are notated identically; alto and sopranino are notated identically; and bass and contrabass recorders are notated identically. [[Clef#Octave clefs|Octave clefs]] may be used to indicate the sounding pitch, but usage is inconsistent.\n\nRare sizes and notations include the [[Garklein recorder|garklein]], which may be notated two octaves below its sounding pitch, and the sub-contrabass, which may be notated an octave above its sounding pitch.{{Clarify|date=August 2018|reason=Is there any music written specifically for either of these instruments?

As a result, it was frequently the performers' responsibility to read parts not specifically intended for the instrument and to choose appropriate instruments. When such consorts consisted only of recorders, the pitch relationships between the parts were typically preserved, but when recorders were combined with other instruments, octave discrepancies were often ignored.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Woodwind Instruments and Their History|last = Baines|first = Anthony|publisher = |year = 1957|isbn = |location = |page = 242}}</ref>\n\nRecorder consorts in the 16th century were tuned in fifths and only occasionally employed tuning by octaves as seen in the modern C, F recorder consort. This means that consorts could be composed of instruments nominally in B{{music|flat}}, F, C, G, D, A and even E, although typically only three or four distinct sizes were used simultaneously. To use modern terminology, these recorders were treated as transposing instruments: consorts would be read identically to a consort made up of F<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, and G<sub>4</sub> instruments. This is made possible by the fact that adjacent sizes are separated by fifths, with few exceptions. These parts would be written using [[Chiavette|''chiavi naturali'']], allowing the parts to roughly fit in the range of a single staff, and also in the range of the recorders of the period. (see [[Recorder (musical instrument)#Structure 2|Renaissance structure]])\n\nTranspositions (\"registers\"), such as C<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>, G<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, or B{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub>\u2013F<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>, all read as F<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub> instruments, were possible as described by Praetorius in his ''[[Syntagma Musicum]]''. Three sizes of instruments could be used to play four-part music by doubling the middle size, e.g. F<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>, or play six-part music by doubling the upper size and tripling the middle size, e.g. F<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|title = Adrian Brown Recorders: Recorder Types|url = http://www.adrianbrown.org/recorder_types/index.html|website = www.adrianbrown.org|access-date = 2016-02-09|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184153/http://www.adrianbrown.org/recorder_types/index.html|archive-date = 2016-03-03|url-status=dead|df = }}</ref> Modern nomenclature for such recorders refers to the instruments' relationship to the other members of consort, rather than their absolute pitch, which may vary.

For example, a recorder with lowest note G<sub>4</sub> may be known as a G-alto or alto in G, a recorder with lowest note D<sub>5</sub> (also \"sixth flute\") as a D-soprano or soprano in D, and a recorder in G<sub>3</sub> as a G-bass or G-basset. This usage is not totally consistent. Notably, the baroque recorder in D<sub>4</sub> is not commonly referred to as a D-tenor nor a D-alto; it is most commonly referred to using the historical name \"[[voice flute]]\".\n\n==Structure==\n===Materials===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n!Some hardwoods used to make recorders\n|-\n|\n* [[Maple#Tonewood|maple]]wood (''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]'', [[specific gravity]] 0.63)\n* [[Pear#Uses|pear]]wood (''Pyrus communis'', specific gravity 0.65), \n* [[Plum#Cultivation and uses|plum]]wood (''[[Prunus domestica]]'', specific gravity 0.79), \n* Castello \"[[boxwood]]\" (''[[Calycophyllum]] multiflorum'', specific gravity 0.8), \n* Zapatero \"boxwood\" (''[[Gossypiospermum]] praecox'', specific gravity 0.8), \n* [[olive]]wood (''Olea europaea'', specific gravity 0.85), \n* European boxwood (''[[Buxus sempervirens]]'', specific gravity 0.95), \n* [[rosewood]] (including [[tulipwood]] (''[[Dalbergia]] decipularis'', specific gravity 0.95), \n* palisander (''[[Dalbergia retusa]]'', specific gravity 1.05), \n* [[Kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] (''[[Dalbergia cearensis]]'', specific gravity 1.2), etc.), \n* [[ebony]] (''[[List of Diospyros species|Diospyros]] perrieri'', specific gravity 1.1), or \n* grenadilla (''[[Dalbergia melanoxylon]]'', specific gravity 1.2)\n|}\nRecorders have historically been constructed from hardwoods and ivory, sometimes with metal keys.

In either case, more ergonomically placed keys can be used to cover the tone holes. Keys also allow the design of longer instruments with larger tone holes. Keys are most common in recorders larger than the alto. Instruments larger than the tenor need at least one key so the player can cover all eight holes. Keys are sometimes also used on smaller recorders to allow for comfortable hand stretch, and acoustically improved hole placement and size.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Von Huene Workshop and the Early Music Shop of New England{{Snd}} Ergonomic or \"Comfort\"|url = http://www.vonhuene.com/c-49-ergonomic-or-comfort.aspx|website = www.vonhuene.com|access-date = 2016-02-06}}</ref>\n\nWhen playing a larger recorder, a player may not be able to simultaneously reach the keys or tone holes with the fingers and reach the windway with the mouth.

Note that the 4th finger-hole is larger than the 5th.]]\n\n===German fingering===\nIn the early 20th century, [[Peter Harlan]] developed a recorder with apparently simpler fingering, called German fingering. A recorder designed for German fingering has a hole five that is smaller than hole four, whereas baroque and neo-baroque recorders have a hole four that is smaller than hole five. The immediate difference in fingering is for F (soprano) or B{{Music|b}} (alto), which on a neo-baroque instrument must be fingered 0 123 4\u201367. With German fingering, this becomes a simpler 0 123 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013. Unfortunately, however, this makes many other chromatic notes too out of tune to be usable.<ref name=ARJtechnique>A Rowland-Jones, ''Recorder Technique'' {{ISBN|0-907908-75-6}}</ref> German fingering became popular in Europe, especially Germany, in the 1930s, but rapidly became obsolete in the 1950s as people began to treat the recorder more seriously, and the limitations of German fingering became more widely appreciated.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edgar|last=Hunt|authorlink=Edgar Hunt|title=The Recorder and Its Music|publisher=Eulenburg|location=London|year=1977|isbn=9780903873055}}{{Page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref> Recorders with German fingering are today manufactured exclusively for educational purposes.\n\n=== Pitch ===\nModern recorders are most commonly [[Pitch (music)|pitched]] at A=440&nbsp;Hz, but among serious amateurs and professionals, other pitch standards are often found.

In various regions, contexts, and time periods, pitch standards have varied from A=~392&nbsp;Hz to A=~520&nbsp;Hz. The pitches A=415&nbsp;Hz and A=466&nbsp;Hz, a semitone lower and a semitone higher than A=440&nbsp;Hz respectively, were chosen because they may be used with harpsichords or chamber organs that transpose up or down a semitone from A=440.<ref>David Jacques Way: [http://zhi.net/technical/pitch.shtml Harpsichord Pitch and Transposition]</ref> These pitch standards allow recorder players to collaborate with other instrumentalists at a pitch other than A=440&nbsp;Hz.\n\nSome recorder makers produce instruments at pitches other than the three standard pitches above, and recorders with interchangeable bodies at different pitches.<ref>Jacqueline Sorel: Renaissance Recorders after Ganassi: http://www.sorel-recorders.nl/models/m01ganassiE.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126055823/http://sorel-recorders.nl/models/m01ganassiE.html |date=2009-01-26 }} and http://www.sorel-recorders.nl/models/m10pricesexE.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225031713/http://www.sorel-recorders.nl/models/m10pricesexE.html |date=2014-02-25 }}</ref><ref>Jacqueline Sorel, Baroque Alto Recorder after Stanesby, Sr http://www.sorel-recorders.nl/models/m05stanesbyE.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127051250/http://sorel-recorders.nl/models/m05stanesbyE.html |date=2009-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n== Acoustics ==\n[[File:Recorder300.svg|left|thumb|Cross-section of the head of a recorder. A) block B) windway C) labium]]\n\n=== Basic sound production ===\nThe recorder produces sound in the manner of a [[whistle]] or an organ [[flue pipe]]. In normal play, the player blows into the ''windway'' (B), a narrow channel in the ''head joint'', which directs a stream of air across a gap called the ''window'', at a sharp edge called the ''labium'' (C). The air stream alternately travels above and below the labium, exciting standing waves in the bore of the recorder, and producing [[Sound|sound waves]] that emanate away from the window. Feedback from the [[resonance]] of the tube regulates the pitch of the sound.\n\nIn recorders, as in all woodwind instruments, the air column inside the instrument behaves like a vibrating string, to use a musical analogy, and has multiple [[Overtone|modes of vibration]]. These waves produced inside the instrument are not travelling waves, like those the ear perceives as sound, but rather stationary [[standing wave]]s consisting of areas of high pressure and low pressure inside the tube, called nodes. The perceived pitch is the lowest, and typically loudest, mode of vibration in the air column. The other pitches are ''harmonics'', or ''overtones''. Players typically describe recorder pitches by the number of nodes in the air column. Notes with a single node are in the ''first register,'' notes with two nodes in the ''second register,'' etc. As the number of nodes in the tube increases, the number of notes a player can produce in a given register decreases because of the physical constraint of the spacing of the nodes in the bore. On a Baroque recorder, the first, second, and third registers span about a major ninth, a major sixth, and a minor third respectively.\n\n=== Harmonic profile ===\nThe recorder sound, for the most part, lacks high harmonics and odd harmonics predominate in its sound with the even harmonics being almost entirely absent, although the harmonic profile of the recorder sound varies from recorder to recorder, and from fingering to fingering.<ref name=\":4\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As a result of the lack of high harmonics, writers since Praetorius have remarked that it is difficult for the human ear to correctly perceive the sounding octave of the recorder: if the same pitch were played on a violin and on a recorder, the violin sound would have louder high harmonics.\n\n==== Air ====\nAs in organ [[flue pipe]]s, the sounding pitch of duct type whistles is affected by the velocity of the air stream as it impinges upon the labium. The pitch generally increases with velocity of the airstream, up to a point.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pipe sensitivity|url = http://www.fonema.se/pipstiff/pipstiff.html|website = www.fonema.se|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref>\n\nAir speed can also be used to influence the number of pressure nodes in a process called over blowing. At higher airstream velocities, lower modes of vibration of the air column become unstable, resulting in a change of register.\n\nThe air stream is affected by the shaping of the surfaces in the head of the recorder (the \"voicing\"), and the way the player blows air into the windway. Recorder voicing is determined by physical parameters such as the proportions and curvature of the windway along both the longitudinal and latitudinal axes, the beveled edges (''chamfers'') of the windway facing towards the labium, the length of the window, the sharpness of the labium (i.e. the steepness of the ramp) among other parameters. The player is able to control the speed and turbulence of the airstream using the diaphragm and vocal tract.\n\n==== Fingers ====\nThe finger holes, used in combination or partially covered, affect the sounding pitch of the instrument.\n\nAt the most basic level, the sequential uncovering of finger holes increases the sounding pitch of the instrument by decreasing the effective sounding length of the instrument, and vice versa for the sequential covering of holes. In the fingering 01234567, only the bell of the instrument is open, resulting in a low pressure node at the bell end of the instrument. The fingering 0123456 sounds at a higher pitch because the seventh hole and the bell both release air, creating a low pressure node at the seventh hole.\n\nBesides sequential uncovering, recorders can use forked fingering to produce tones other than those produced by simple sequential lifting of fingers. In the fingering 0123, air leaks from the open holes 4,5,6, and 7. The pressure inside the bore is higher at the fourth hole than at the fifth, and decreases further at the 6th and 7th holes. Consequently, the most air leaks from the fourth hole and the least air leaks from the seventh hole. As a result, covering the fourth hole affects the pitch more than covering any of the holes below it. Thus, at the same air pressure, the fingering 01235 produces a pitch between 0123 and 01234. Forked fingerings allow recorder players to obtain fine gradations in pitch and timbre.\n\nA recorder's pitch is also affected by the partial covering of holes. This technique is an important tool for intonation, and is related to the fixed process of tuning a recorder, which involves the adjustment of the size and shape of the finger holes through carving and the application of wax.\n\nOne essential use of partial covering is in \"leaking,\" or partially covering, the thumb hole to destabilize low harmonics. This allows higher harmonics to sound at lower air pressures than by over-blowing alone, as on simple whistles. The player may also leak other holes to destabilize lower harmonics in place of the thumb hole (hole 0). This technique is demonstrated in the fingering tables of Ganassi's Fontegara (1535), which illustrate the simultaneous leaking of holes 0, 2, and 5 to produce some high notes. For example, Ganassi's table produces the 15th (third octave tonic) as the fourth harmonic of the tonic, leaking holes 0, 2 and 5 and produces the 16th as the third harmonic of the fifth, leaking holes 0 and 2. On some Baroque recorders, the 17th can be produced as the third harmonic of the sixth, leaking hole 0 as well as hole 1, 2 or both.\n\n==Technique==\nAlthough the design of the recorder has changed over its 700-year history, notably in fingering and bore profile (see History), the technique of playing recorders of different sizes and periods is much the same. Indeed, much of what is known about the technique of playing the recorder is derived from historical treatises and manuals dating to the 16th\u201318th century. The following describes the commonalities of recorder technique across all time periods. \n[[File:FolleJourn\u00e9e2009 altorecorder.jpg|thumb|A musician playing a recorder]]\n[[File:Woman and child reenactors - Fort Ross State Historic Park - Jenner, California - Stierch.jpg|thumb|left|A woman and girl playing recorders at [[Fort Ross State Historic Park]] in 2015]]\n\n=== Playing position ===\nIn normal playing position, the recorder is held with both hands, covering the fingerholes or depressing the keys with the pads of the fingers: four fingers on the lower hand, and the index, middle and ring fingers and thumb on the upper hand. In standard modern practice, the right hand is the lower hand, while the left hand is the upper hand, although this was not standardized before the modern revival of the recorder.\n\nThe recorder is supported by the lips, which loosely seal around the beak of the instrument, the thumb of the lower hand, and, depending on the note fingered, by the other fingers and the upper thumb. A practice documented in many historical fingering charts is the use of finger seven or eight to support the recorder when playing notes for which the coverage of this hole negligibly affects the sounding pitch (e.g. notes with many holes uncovered). Larger recorders may have a thumbrest, or a neckstrap for extra support, and may use a bocal to direct air from the player's mouth to the windway.\n\nRecorders are typically held at an angle between vertical and horizontal, the attitude depending on the size and weight of the recorder, and personal preference.\n\n=== Fingers ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+How the fingers and holes are numbered\n! Fingers!! Holes\n|-\n| [[File:NumberedLeftHand.jpg|200px]]<br />[[File:NumberedRightHand.jpg|200px]]\n| [[File:Numbered finger holes.jpg|left]]\n|}\n\nPitches are produced on the recorder by covering the holes while blowing into the instrument. Modern terminology refers to the holes on the front of the instrument using the numbers 1 through 7, starting with the hole closest to the beak, with the thumbhole numbered hole 0. At the most basic level, the fingering technique of the recorder involves the sequential uncovering of the holes from lowest to highest (i.e. uncovering 7, then uncovering 7 and 6, then uncovering 7, 6 and 5, etc.) producing ever higher pitches. In practice, however, the uncovering of the holes is not strictly sequential, and the half covering or uncovering of holes is an essential part of recorder technique.\n[[File:Hotteterre flute-a-bec frag.jpg|thumb|\nIllustration of a man playing a recorder from Jacques Hotteterre's \"Principes de la flute traversiere, de la Flute a Bec, et du Haut-bois\" (1728)\n]]\n\n==== Forked fingerings ====\nA forked fingering is a fingering in which an open hole has covered holes below it: fingerings for which the uncovering of the holes is not sequential. For example, the fingering 0123 is not a forked fingering, while 0123 56 is a forked fingering because the open hole 4 has holes covered below it{{Snd}} holes 5 and 6. Forked fingerings allow for smaller adjustments in pitch than the sequential uncovering of holes alone would allow. For example, at the same air speed the fingering 0123 5 sounds higher than 01234 but lower than 0123. Many standard recorder fingerings are forked fingerings. Forked fingerings may also be used to produce microtonal variations in pitch.\n\nForked fingerings have a different harmonic profile from non-forked fingerings, and are generally regarded as having a weaker sound. Forked fingerings that have  a different tone color or are slightly sharp or flat can provide so-called \"alternate fingerings\". For example, the fingering 0123 and its slightly sharper forked variant 012 4567.\n\n==== Partial covering of holes ====\nPartial covering of the holes is an essential part of the playing technique of all recorders. This is variously known as \"leaking,\" \"shading,\" \"half-holing,\" and in the context of the thumb hole, \"pinching\".\n\nThe primary function of the thumbhole is to serve as an octaving vent. When it is leaked, the first mode of vibration of the air column becomes unstable: i.e., the register changes. In most recorders, this is required for the playing of every note higher than a ninth above the lowest note. The player must adjust the position of the thumb for these notes to sound stably and in tune.\n\nThe partial opening of the thumbhole may be achieved by sliding or rolling the thumb off of the hole, or by bending the thumb at the first knuckle. To partially uncover a covered hole, the player may slide the finger off of the hole, bend or roll the finger away from the hole, gently lift the finger from the hole, or a combination of these. To partially cover an open hole, the reverse is possible.\n\nGenerally speaking, the partial opening of covered fingerholes raises the pitch of the sounding note while the partial closure of open fingerholes lowers the pitch.\n\n==== Holes 6 and 7 ====\nOn most \"baroque\" modeled modern recorders, the lower two fingers of the lower hand actually cover two holes each (called \"double holes\"). Whereas on the vast majority of baroque recorders and all earlier recorders these two fingers covered a single hole (\"single holes\"), double holes have become standard for baroque modeled modern recorders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dolmetsch.com/fingerings.htm|title=Recorder Fingerings|website=www.dolmetsch.com|access-date=2016-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304133127/http://www.dolmetsch.com/fingerings.htm|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> By covering one or both of these two, smaller holes, a recorder player can play the notes a semitone above the lowest note and a minor third above the lowest note, notes that are only possible on single holed recorders through the partial covering of those holes, or the covering of the bell.\n\n==== Covering the bell ====\nThe open end of the bore facing away from the player (the \"bell\") may be covered to produce extra notes or effects. Because both hands are typically engaged in holding the recorder or covering the finger holes, the covering of the bell is normally achieved by bringing the end of the recorder in contact with the leg or knee, typically achieved through a combination of bending of the torso and/or raising of the knee. Alternatively, in rare cases instruments may be equipped with a key designed to cover the bell (\"bell key\"), operated by one of the fingers, typically the pinky finger of the upper hand, which is not normally used to cover a hole. Fingerings with a covered bell extend the recorder's chromatic playable range above and below the nominal fingered range.\n\n=== Air ===\nThe pitch and volume of the recorder sound are influenced by the speed of the air travelling through the windway, which may be controlled by varying the breath pressure and the shape of the vocal tract. The sound is also affected by the turbulence of the air entering the recorder. Generally speaking, faster air in the windway produces a higher pitch. Thus blowing harder causes a note it to go sharp whereas blowing the note gently causes it to go flat. Knowing this fact and the knowledge of a recorder's individual tonal differences over its full range will help recorders play in tune with other instruments by knowing which notes will need slightly more or less air to stay in tune.  As mentioned above at ''Harmonic profile'' blowing much harder can result in [[overblowing]].\n\n==== Breath ====\nThe technique of inhalation and exhalation for the recorder differs from that of many other wind instruments in that the recorder requires very little air pressure to produce a sound, unlike reed or brasswind instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.recorderhomepage.net/technique/breathing-2/|title=Breathing {{!}} Recorder Home Page|website=www.recorderhomepage.net|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref> Thus, it is often necessary for a recorder player to produce long, controlled streams of air at a very low pressure. Recorder breathing technique focuses on the controlled release of air rather than on maintaining diaphragmatic pressure.\n\n==== Tongue, mouth, and throat ====\nThe use of the tongue to stop and start the air is called \"articulation\". In this capacity, the tongue has two basic functions: to control the start of the note (the attack) and the end, or the length of the note (legato, staccato). Articulations are roughly analogous to [[consonant]]s. Practically any consonant that may produced with the tongue, mouth, and throat may be used to articulate on the recorder. Transliterations of common articulation patterns include \"du du du du\" (using the tip of the tongue, \"single tonguing\") \"du gu du gu,\" (alternating between the tip and the back of the tongue, \"double tonguing\") and \"du g'll du g'll\" (articulation with the tip and the sides of the tongue, \"double tonguing\"). The attack of the note is governed by such factors as the pressure buildup behind the tongue and shape of the articulant, while the length of the note governed by the stoppage of the air by the tongue. Each articulation pattern has a different natural pattern of attack and length, and recorder technique seeks to produce a wide variety of lengths and attacks using these articulation patterns. Patterns such as these have been used since at least the time of Ganassi (1535).\n\nMouth and throat shapes are roughly analogous to [[vowel]]s. The shape of the vocal track affects the velocity and turbulence of the air entering the recorder. The shape of the mouth and vocal tract affect are closely related to the consonant used to articulate.\n\n=== Coordination ===\nThe player must coordinate fingers and tongue to align articulations with finger movements. In normal play, articulated attacks should align with the proper fingering, even in legato passages or in difficult finger transitions and the fingers move in the brief silence between the notes (silence d'articulation) created by the stoppage of the air by the tongue.\n\nBoth fingers and the breath can be used to control the pitch of the recorder. Coordinating the two is essential to playing the recorder in tune and with a variety of dynamics and timbres. On an elementary level, breath pressure and fingerings must accord with each other to provide an in-tune pitch. As an example of a more advanced form of coordination, a gradual increase in breath pressure combined with the shading of holes, when properly coordinated, results in an increase in volume and change in tone color without a change in pitch. The reverse is possible, decreasing breath pressure and gradually lifting fingers.\n\n==={{Anchor|Fingering}}Basic fingering===\n{{See also|Fingering (music)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"34\" |Recorder fingerings (English): Lowest note through the nominal range of 2 octaves and a tone\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Note\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background:#f8eaba;\" | First octave\n|&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background:#f8eaba;\" | Second octave\n|&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background:#f8eaba;\" | Third octave\n|-\n!

See the table above for \"English\" fingerings for the standard range. The numbers at the top correspond to the fingers and the holes on the recorder. The vast majority of recorders manufactured today are designed to play using these fingerings, with slight variations. Nonetheless, recorder fingerings vary widely between models and are mutable even for a single recorder: recorder players may use three or more fingerings for the same note along with partial covering of the holes to achieve proper intonation, in coordination with the breath or in faster passages where some fingerings are unavailable. This chart is a general guide, but by no means a definitive or complete fingering chart for the recorder, an impossible task. Rather, it is the basis for a much more complex fingering system, which is still being added to today.\n\nSome [[font]]s show miniature glyphs of complete recorder fingering charts in [[TrueType]] format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fontspace.com/algomgom/recorder|title=Recorder font by algomgom|website=FontSpace}}</ref> Because there are no [[Unicode]] values for complete recorder fingering charts, these fonts are custom encoded.\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe earliest extant duct flutes date to the [[neolithic]].

The castle was only inhabited from 1335 to 1418. As the area was not disturbed until the modern excavation, the recorder has been dated to the period of occupation of the castle. The instrument has a cylindrical bore about {{convert|11|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter and is about {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} long with a vibrating air column of about {{convert|270|mm|abbr=on}}. The block has survived, but the labium is damaged, making the instrument unplayable. The instrument has tenons on both ends of the instrument, suggesting the presence of now lost ferrules or turnings. Uncertainty regarding the nature of these fittings has hindered reconstruction of the instrument's original state.\n\nA second, structurally different instrument (\"G\u00f6ttingen recorder\") was discovered in 1987 in an archaeological excavation of the latrine of a medieval house in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Germany]]. It has been dated to between 1246 and 1322. It is fruitwood in one piece with turnings, measuring about {{convert|256|mm|abbr=on}} long. It has a cylindrical bore about {{convert|13.6|mm|abbr=on}} at the highest measurable point, narrowing to {{convert|13.2|mm|abbr=on}} between the first and second finger holes, to {{convert|12.7|to(-)|12.8|mm|abbr=on}} between the second and third finger holes, and contracting to {{convert|11.5|mm|abbr=on}} at the seventh hole. The bore expands to {{convert|14.5|mm|abbr=on}} at the bottom of the instrument, which has a bulbous foot. Unusually, the finger holes taper conically outwards, the opposite of the undercutting found in Baroque recorders. The top of the instrument is damaged: only a cut side of the windway survives, and the block has been lost. A reconstruction by Hans Reiners has a strident, penetrating sound rich in overtones and has a range of two octaves. With the thumb hole and the first three finger holes covered, the reconstruction produces a pitch ca. 450&nbsp;Hz.\n\nIn the 21st century, a number of other instruments and fragments dated to the medieval period have come to light. These include a 14th-century fragment of a headjoint excavated in [[Esslingen (district)|Esslingen]], Germany (\"Esslingen fragment\"); a birch instrument dated to the second half of the 14th century unearthed in [[Tartu]], Estonia (\"Tartu recorder\"); and a fruitwood instrument dated to the 15th century, found in [[Elbl\u0105g]], Poland (\"Elbl\u0105g recorder\").\n\nCommon features of the surviving instruments include: a narrow cylindrical bore (except the G\u00f6ttingen recorder); a doubled seventh hole for the little finger of the lower hand to allow for right- or left- handed playing (except the Tartu recorder); a seventh hole that produces a semitone instead of a tone; and a flat or truncated head, instead of the narrow beak found on later instruments. Additionally, the Esslingen fragment has turnings similar to the G\u00f6ttingen recorder.

According to Virdung (1511), the hole that was not used was plugged with wax.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Musica getutscht|last = Virdung|first = Sebastian|publisher = |year = 1511|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Musica_getutscht_(Virdung,_Sebastian)}}</ref> It was not until the Baroque period,  when instruments with adjustable footjoints were developed, that widely spaced double holes became obsolete.\n\nThe classification of these instruments is primarily complicated by the fact that the seventh hole produces a semitone instead of a tone. As a result, chromatic fingerings are difficult, and require extensive half-holing. These instruments share similarities with the six holed [[flageolet]], which used three fingers on each hand and had no thumb hole. Anthony Rowland-Jones has suggested that the thumb hole on these early flutes was an improvement upon the flageolet to provide a stronger fingering for the note an octave above the tonic, while the seventh finger hole provided a leading tone to the tonic. As a result, he has suggested that these flutes should be described as improved flageolets, and has proposed the condition that true recorders produce a tone (rather than a semitone) when the seventh finger is lifted.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nControversy aside, there is little question that these instruments are at least precursors to later instruments that are indisputably recorders. Because there is sparse documentary evidence from the earliest history of the instrument, such questions may never be resolved. Indeed, historically there was no need for an all-inclusive definition that encompassed every form of the instrument past and present.\n\n===== Iconography =====\nRecorders with a cylindrical profile are depicted in many medieval paintings, however their appearance does not easily correspond to the surviving instruments, and may be stylized. The earliest depictions of the recorder are probably in \"The Mocking of Christ\" from the monastery church of St George in Staro Nagori\u010dano near Kumanovo, Macedonia (the painting of the church began in 1315) in which a man plays a cylindrical recorder; and the center panel of the \"Virgin and Child\" attributed to Pedro (Pere) Serra (c. 1390), painted for the church of S. Clara, Tortosa, now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona, in which a group of angels play musical instruments around the Virgin Mary, one of them playing a cylindrical recorder.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nStarting in the Middle Ages, angels have frequently been depicted playing one or more recorders, often grouped around the Virgin, and in several notable paintings trios of angels play recorders. This is perhaps a sign of the trinity, although the music must have often been in three parts.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nNo music marked for the recorder survives from prior to 1500. Groups of recorder players or recorder playing angels, particularly trios, are depicted in paintings from the 15th century, indicating the recorder was used in these configurations, as well as with other instruments. Some of the earliest music must have been vocal repertory.\n\nModern recorder players have taken up the practice of playing instrumental music from the period, perhaps anachronistically, such as the monophonic estampies from the [[Chansonnier du Roi]] (13th), [[Add MS 29987]] (14th or 15th), or the [[Codex Faenza]] (15th), and have arranged keyboard music, such as the estampies from the [[Robertsbridge Codex|Robertsbridge codex]] (14th), or the vocal works of composers such as [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Johannes Ciconia]] for recorder ensembles.\n\n===Renaissance===\nIn the 16th century, the structure, repertoire, and performing practice of the recorder is better documented than in prior epochs. The recorder was one of the most important wind instruments of the Renaissance, and many instruments dating to the 16th century survive, including some matched consorts.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> This period also produced the first extant books describing the recorder, including the treatises of Virdung (1511), Agricola (1529), Ganassi (1535), Cardano (c1546), Jambe de Fer (1556), and Praetorius (1619). Nonetheless, understanding of the instrument and its practice in this period is still developing.\n\n==== Structure ====\nIn the 16th century, the recorder saw important developments in its structure. As in the recorders of the Middle Ages, the etiology of these changes remains uncertain, development was regional and multiple types of recorder existed simultaneously. Our knowledge is based on documentary sources and surviving instruments.\n\n===== Surviving instruments =====\nFar more recorders survive from the Renaissance than from the Middle Ages. Most of the surviving instruments from the period have a wide, cylindrical bore from the blockline to the uppermost fingerhole, an inverted conical portion down to around the lowest finger hole (the \"choke\"), then a slight flare to the bell. Externally, they have a curved shape similar to the bore, with a profile like a stretched hourglass. Their sound is warm, rich in harmonics, and somewhat introverted.<ref name=\":7\" /> Surviving consorts of this type, identified by their makers marks, include those marked \"HIER S\u2022\" or \"HIE\u2022S\" found in Vienna, Sibiu and Verona; and those marked with variations on a rabbit's footprint, designated \"!!\" by Adrian Brown, which are dispersed among various museums. The pitch of these recorders is often generally grouped around A&nbsp;=&nbsp;466&nbsp;Hz, however little pitch standardization existed in the period. This type of recorder is described by Praetorius in ''De Organographia'' (1619). A surviving consort by \"!!\" follows the exact size configuration suggested by Praetorius: stacked fifths up from the basset in F<sub>3</sub>, and down a fifth then a fourth to bass in B{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub> and great bass in F<sub>2</sub>. Instruments marked \"HIER S\u2022\" or \"HIE\u2022S\" are in stacked fifths from great bass in F<sub>2</sub> to soprano in E<sub>5</sub>.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Renaissance recorder makers|url = http://www.adrianbrown.org/recorder_types/rrm.html|website = www.adrianbrown.org|access-date = 2016-02-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161008004008/http://www.adrianbrown.org/recorder_types/rrm.html|archive-date = 2016-10-08|url-status=dead|df = }}</ref> Many of these instruments are pitched around A&nbsp;=&nbsp;440&nbsp;Hz or A&nbsp;=&nbsp;466&nbsp;Hz, although pitch varied regionally and between consorts.\n\nThe range of this type is normally an octave plus a minor 7th, but as remarked by Praetorius (1619) and demonstrated in the fingering tables of Ganassi's ''Fontegara'' (1535),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego|Sylvestro di Ganassi dal Fontego]], ''Opera Intitula Fontegara, Laquale isegna a sonare di flauto cho tutta l'arte opportuna a esso istrumento massime il diminuire ilquale sara utile ad ogni istrumeno di fiato et chorde et anchora a chi si dileta di canto'' (Impressum Venetiis: per syluestro di ganassi dal fontego Sonator dalla illustrissima signoria di Venetia hautor pprio., 1535).

Their range is more suitable for the performance of vocal music, rather than purely instrumental music. This type is the recorder typically referred to as the \"normal\" Renaissance recorder, however this modern appellation does not fully capture the heterogeneity of instruments of the 16th century.\n\nAnother surviving Renaissance type has a narrow cylindrical bore and cylindrical profile like the medieval exemplars but a choke at the last hole. The earliest surviving recorders of this type were made by the Rafi family, instrument makers active in Lyons in Southern France in the early 16th century. Two recorders marked \"C.RAFI\" were acquired by the Accademia Filarmonica, Bologna in 1546, where they remain today. A consort of recorders or similar make, marked \"P.GRE/C/E,\" was donated to the Accademia in 1675, expanding the pair marked \"C.RAFI\". Other recorders by the Rafi family survive in Northern Europe, notably a pair in Brussels. It is possible that Grece worked in the Rafi workshop, or was a member of the Rafi family. The pitch of the Rafi/Grece instruments is around A&nbsp;=&nbsp;440&nbsp;Hz. They have a relatively quiet sound with good pitch stability favoring dynamic expression.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Recorder Home Page Databases|url = http://www.recorderhomepage.net/databases/Historic_Makerslist.php?start=41|website = www.recorderhomepage.net|access-date = 2016-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Recorder Home Page Databases|url = http://www.recorderhomepage.net/databases/Historic_Instrumentslist.php?x_Maker_Abbreviation=Rafi&z_Maker_Abbreviation=LIKE&cmd=search|website = www.recorderhomepage.net|access-date = 2016-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Recorder Home Page Databases|url = http://www.recorderhomepage.net/databases/Historic_Makersview.php?showdetail=&Makers_Number=27|website = www.recorderhomepage.net|access-date = 2016-02-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1556, French author Philibert Jambe de Fer gave a set of fingerings for hybrid instruments such as the Rafi and Grece instruments that give a range of two octaves. Here, the 15th was now produced, as on most later recorders, as a variant of the 14th instead of as the fourth harmonic of the tonic, as in Ganassi's tables.\n\n===== Documentary evidence: treatises =====\n{| style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;\"\n!colspan=3|Recorders in 16th and early 17th century books\n|-\n|style=\"width:140px|[[File:VirdungP100crop.jpg|x300px|frameless]][[File:VirdungP14crop.jpg|x300px|frameless]]\n|style=\"width:100px|[[File:AgricolaP16crop.jpg|x300px|frameless]]\n|style=\"width:100px|[[File:Barocke Blockfl\u00f6ten.png|x300px|frameless]]\n|-\n|Virdung, ''Musica getutscht'' (1511)\n|Agricola, ''Musica instrumentalis deudsch'' (1529)\n|Praetorius, ''[[Syntagma Musicum]]'' (1629)\n|}\nThe first two treatises of the 16th century show recorders that differ from the surviving instruments dating to the century: these are [[Sebastian Virdung]]'s (b. 1465?) ''Musica getutscht''  (1511), and [[Martin Agricola]]'s (1486\u20131556) similar ''Musica instrumentalis deudsch'' (1529), published in Basel and Saxony respectively.\n\n''Musica Getutscht'', the earliest printed treatise on western musical instruments, is an extract of an earlier, now lost, manuscript treatise by Virdung, a chaplain, singer, and itinerant musician. The printed version was written in a vernacular form of [[Early New High German]], and was aimed at wealthy urban amateur musicians: the title translates, briefly, as \"Music, translated into German ... Everything there is to know about [music] \u2013 made simple.\" When a topic become too complex for Virdung to discuss briefly, he refers the reader to his lost larger work, an unhelpful practice for modern readers.

Virdung depicts four recorders together: a \"ba\u00dfcontra\" or \"bassus\" (basset) in F<sub>3</sub> with an anchor shaped key and a perforated fontanelle, two tenors in C<sub>4</sub> and a \"discantus\" (alto) in G<sub>4</sub>. According to Virdung, the configurations F\u2013C\u2013C\u2013G or F\u2013C\u2013G\u2013G should be used for four-part music, depending on the range of the bass part. As previously mentioned, the accuracy of these woodcuts cannot be verified as no recorders fitting this description survive. Virdung also provides the first ever fingering chart for a recorder with a range of an octave and a seventh, though he says that the bass had a range of only an octave and sixth. In his fingering chart, he numbers which fingers to lift rather than those to put down and, unlike in later charts, numbers them from bottom (1) to top (8). His only other technical instruction is that the player must blow into the instrument and \"learn how to coordinate the articulations ... with the fingers\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Musica getutscht (Virdung, Sebastian)|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Musica_getutscht_(Virdung,_Sebastian)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref>\n\nMartin Agricola's ''Musica instrumentalis Deudsch'' (\"A German instrumental music, in which is contained how to learn to play ... all kinds of ... instruments\"), written in rhyming German verse (ostensibly to improve the understanding and retention of its contents), provides a similar account and copies most of its woodcuts directly from ''Getutscht''. Agricola also calls the tenor \"altus,\" mistakenly depicting it as a little smaller than the tenor in the woodcut (above, middle right). Like Virdung, Agricola takes it for granted that recorders should be played in four-part consorts. Unlike ''Getutscht'', which provides a single condensed fingering chart, Agricola provides separate, slightly differing, fingering charts for each instrument, leading some to suppose that Agricola experimented on three different instruments, rather than copying the fingerings from one size to the other two.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Martin Agricola's Poetic Discussion of the Recorder and Other Woodwind Instruments|last = Hettrick|first = William E. |date=1980\u20131983|journal = American Recorder|doi = |pmid = }}</ref> Agricola adds that graces (''Mordanten''), which make the melody ''subtil'', must be learned from a professional (''Pfeiffer''), and that the manner of ornamentation (''Coloratur'') of the organist is best of all.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Musica instrumentalis Deudsch (Agricola, Martin)|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Musica_instrumentalis_Deudsch_(Agricola,_Martin)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref> A substantial 1545 revision of ''Musica Instrumentalis'' approvingly mentions the use of vibrato (''zitterndem Wind'') for woodwind instruments, and includes an account of articulation, recommending the syllables ''de'' for [[Note value|semiminims]] and larger, ''di ri'' for semiminims and smaller, and the articulation ''tell ell ell ell el le'', which he calls the \"flutter-tongue\" ''(flitter zunge)'' for the smallest of note values, found in ''passagi (Colorirn)''.\n\nThe next treatise comes from Venice: Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego's (1492\u2013mid-1500s) ''Opera Intitulata Fontegara'' (1535), which is the first work to focus specifically on the technique of playing the recorder, and perhaps the only historical treatise ever published that approaches a description of a professional or virtuoso playing technique. Ganassi was a musician employed by the [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] and at the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica di San Marco]] at the time of the work's publication, an indication of his high level of accomplishment, and later wrote two works on the playing the viol and the violone, although he does not mention being employed by the Doge after ''Fontegara''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ganassi, Silvestro di|url = http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/silvestro-di-ganassi_(Dizionario_Biografico)/|website = www.treccani.it|access-date = 2016-02-12|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312033909/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/silvestro-di-ganassi_(Dizionario_Biografico)/|archive-date = 2016-03-12|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n''Fontegara'' can be broadly divided into two parts: the first concerns the technique of playing the recorder, the second demonstrated divisions (regole, passagi, ornaments), some of great complexity, which the player may use to ornament a melody or, literally, \"divide\" it into smaller notes. In all aspects, Ganassi emphasizes the importance of imitating the human voice, declaring that \"the aim of the recorder player is to imitate as closely as possible all the capabilities of the human voice\", maintaining that the recorder is indeed able to do this. For Ganassi, imitation of the voice has three aspects: \"a certain artistic proficiency,\" which seems to be the ability to perceive the nature of the music, prontezza (dexterity or fluency), achieved \"by varying the pressure of the breath and shading the tone by means of suitable fingering,\" and galanteria (elegance or grace), achieved by articulation, and by the use of ornaments, the \"simplest ingredient\" of them being the trill, which varies according to the expression.\n\nGanassi gives fingering tables for a range of an octave and a seventh, the standard range also remarked by Praetorius, then tells the reader that he has discovered, through long experimentation, more notes not known to other players due to their lack of perseverance, extending the range to two octaves and a sixth. Ganassi gives fingerings for three recorders with different makers marks, and advises the reader to experiment with different fingerings, as recorders vary in their bore. The makers mark of one of the recorders, in the form of a stylized letter \"A\", has been associated with the Schnitzer family of instrument makers in Germany, leading Hermann Moeck to suppose that Ganassi's recorder might have been Northern European in origin.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fl\u00f6tensignaturen auf alten Gem\u00e4lden|last = Moeck|first = Hermann|date = 1994|journal = Tibia |trans-title=Maker's marks in old paintings |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=128\u201329}}</ref> (see also Note on \"Ganassi\" recorders)\n\nGanassi uses three basic kinds of syllables ''te che'', ''te re'', and ''le re'' and also varies the vowel used with the syllable, suggesting the effect of mouth shape on the sound of the recorder. He gives many combinations of these syllables and vowels, and suggests the choice of the syllables according to their smoothness, ''te che'' being least smooth and ''le re'' being most so. He does not, however, demonstrate how the syllables should be used to music.\n\nMost of the treatise consists of tables of diminutions of intervals, small melodies and cadences, categorized by their meter. These several hundred divisions use quintuplets, septuplets, note values from whole notes to 32nd notes in modern notation, and demonstrate immense variety and complexity.\n\nThe frontispiece to ''Fontegara'' shows three recorder players play together with two singers. Like Agricola and Virdung, Ganassi takes for granted that recorders should be played in groups of four, and come in three sizes: F<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub> and G<sub>4</sub>. He makes a distinction between solo playing and ensemble playing, noting that what he has said is for solo players, and that when playing with others, it is most important to match them. Unfortunately, Ganassi gives only a few ornamented examples with little context for their use. Nonetheless, Ganassi offers a tantalizing glimpse at a highly developed professional culture and technique of woodwind playing that modern players can scarcely be said to have improved upon.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Opera Intitulata Fontegara (Ganassi, Sylvestro)|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Opera_Intitulata_Fontegara_(Ganassi,_Sylvestro)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref>\n\nGirolamo Cardano's (also Jerome Cardan, 1501\u20131576) ''De Musica'' was written around 1546, but not published until 1663 when it was published along with other works by Cardan, who was an eminent philosopher, mathematician and physician as well as a keen amateur recorder player who learned from a professional teacher, Leo Oglonus, as a child in Milan.\n\nHis account corroborates that of Ganassi, using the same three basic syllables and emphasizing the importance of breath control and ornamentation in recorder playing, but also documents several aspects of recorder technique otherwise undocumented until the 20th century. These include multiple techniques using the partial closing of the bell: to produce a tone or semitone below the tonic, and to change semitones into dieses (half semitones), which he says can also be produced by \"repercussively bending back the tongue\".<ref name=\":21\" /> He also adds that the position of the tongue, either extended or turned up towards the palate, can be used to improve, vary, and color notes. He is the first to differentiate between the amount of the breath (full, shallow, or moderate) and the force (relaxed or slow, intense, and the median between them) as well as the different amount of air required for each instrument, and describes a trill or vibrato called a ''vox tremula'' in which \"a tremulous quality in the breath\" is combined with a trilling of the fingers to vary the interval from anything between a major third and a diesis. He is also the first writer to mention the recorder in D{{sub|5}} (\"discantus\"), which he leaves unnamed.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\nComposer and singer Philibert Jambe de Fer ({{circa}} 1515{{Snd}} {{circa}} 1566) was the only French author of the 16th century to write about the recorder, in his ''Epitome musical''. He complains of the French name for the instrument, ''fleutte \u00e0 neuf trouz'' (\"flute with nine holes\") as, in practice, one of the lowermost holes must be plugged, leaving only eight open holes. He prefers ''fleute d'Italien'' or the Italian ''flauto''. His fingering chart is notable for two reasons, first for describing fingerings with the 15th produced as a variant on the 14th, and for using the third finger of the lower hand as a buttress finger, although only for three notes in the lower octave.<ref name=\":21\" /> (see also Renaissance structure)\n\nAurelio Virgiliano's \"Il dolcimelo\" ({{circa}} 1600) presents ricercars intended for or playable on the recorder, a description of other musical instruments, and a fingering chart for a recorder in G<sub>4</sub> similar to Jambe de Fer's.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Il Dolcimelo (Virgiliano, Aurelio){{Snd}} IMSLP/Petrucci Music Library: Free Public Domain Sheet Music|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Il_Dolcimelo_(Virgiliano,_Aurelio)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-13}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Syntagma musicum'' (1614\u201320) of Michael Praetorius (1571\u20131621) in three volumes (a fourth was intended but never finished) is an encyclopedic survey of music and musical instruments. Volume II, ''De Organographia'' (1619) is of particular interest for its description of no fewer than eight sizes of recorder (''klein Fl\u00f6tlein'' or ''exilent'' in G<sub>5</sub>, ''discant'' in C<sub>5</sub> or D<sub>5</sub>, ''alt'' in G<sub>4</sub>, ''tenor'' in C<sub>4</sub>, ''basset'' in F<sub>3</sub>, ''bass'' in B{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub>, and ''grossbass'' in F<sub>2</sub>) as well as the four-holed ''gar kleine Plockfl\u00f6tlein''.\n\nPraetorius was the first author to explain that recorders can confuse the ear into believing that they sound an octave lower than pitch, which phenomenon has more recently been explained in relation to the recorder's lack of high harmonics. He also shows the different \"registers\" of consort possible, 2\u2032 (discant, alt, and tenor), 4\u2032 (alt, tenor, and basset), and 8\u2032 (tenor, basset, and bass) (see also [[#Nomenclature|Nomenclature]]). Additionally, he proposed cutting the recorder between the beak and the first finger hole to allow for a kind of tuning slide to raise or lower its pitch, similar to the Baroque practice of adjusting a recorder's pitch by \"pulling out\" the top joint of the recorder.\n\nThe recorders described in Praetorius are of the \"stretched hourglass\" profile (see above, far right). He gives fingerings like those of Ganassi, and remarks that they normally have a range of an octave and a sixth, although exceptional players could extend that range by a fourth.\n\n===== \"Double recorder\" =====\nSome paintings from the 14th and 15th centuries depict musicians playing what appear to be two end-blown flutes simultaneously. In some cases, the two flutes are evidently disjoint, separate flutes of similar make, played angled away from each other, one pipe in each hand. In others, flutes of the same length have differing hand positions. In a final case, the pipes are parallel, in contact with each other, and differ in length.<ref name=\"dolciflauti \u00bb Double Recorder\">{{Cite web|title = dolciflauti \u00bb Double Recorder|url = http://www.livirghi.com/instruments-of-the-middle-age/flutes-of-the-middle-ages/|website = www.livirghi.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Catalogus: A Corpus of Trecento Pictures with Musical Subject Matter|last = Brown|first = Howard Mayer|publisher = Imago Musicae|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> While the iconographic criteria for a recorder are typically a clearly recognizable labium and a double handed vertical playing technique,<ref name=\":8\" /> such criteria are not prescriptive, and it is uncertain whether any of these depictions should be considered a single instrument, or constitute a kind of recorder. The identification of the instrument depicted is further complicated by the symbolism of the [[aulos]], a double piped instrument associated with the satyr [[Marsyas]] of [[Greek mythology]].\n\nAn instrument consisting of two attached, parallel, end-blown flutes of differing length, dating to the 15th or 16th century, was found in poor condition near All Souls College in Oxford. The instrument has four holes finger-holes and a thumb hole for each hand. The pipes have an inverted conical \"choke\" bore (see [[Recorder (musical instrument)#Structure 2|Renaissance structure]]). Bob Marvin has estimated that the pipes played a fifth apart, at approximately C<sub>5</sub> and G<sub>5</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.fomrhi.org/uploads/bulletins/Fomrhi-031.pdf |first=Bob |last=Marvin |title=A Double Recorder |journal=FoMHRI Quarterly|publisher=Fellowship of Makers and Researchers of Historical Instruments|date=April 1983 |issue= 31 |others=Communication 453 |pages=42\u201343 |accessdate=6 August 2015 }}</ref> The instrument is [[sui generis]]. Although the instrument's pipes have thumb holes, the lack of organological precedent makes classification of the instrument difficult. Marvin has used the terms \"double recorder\" and the categorization-agnostic ''flauto doppio'' (double flute) to describe the Oxford instrument.\n\nMarvin has designed a ''flauto doppio'' based on the Oxford instrument, scaled to play at F<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>5</sub>. Italian recorder maker Francesco Livirghi has designed a double recorder or ''flauto doppio'' with connected, angled pipes of the same length but played with different hand positions, based on iconographic sources. Its pipes play at F<sub>4</sub> and B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"dolciflauti \u00bb Double Recorder\"/> Both instruments use fingerings of the makers' design.\n\n===== Note on \"Ganassi\" recorders =====\nIn the 1970s, when recorder makers began to make the first models of recorders from the 16th and 17th centuries, such models were not always representative of the playing characteristics of the original instruments. Especially notable is [[Frederick G. Morgan|Fred Morgan]]'s much copied \"Ganassi\" model, based loosely on an instrument in the Vienna Kunsthistorisches museum (inventory number SAM 135), was designed to use the fingerings for the highest notes in Ganassi's tables in Fontegara. As Morgan knew, these notes were not in standard use; indeed Ganassi uses them in only a few of the hundreds of diminutions contained in Fontegara. Historically, such recorders did not exist as a distinct type, and the fingerings given by Ganassi were those of a skilled player particularly familiar with his instruments. When modern music is written for 'Ganassi recorders' it means this type of recorder.<ref name=\"Brown\">Adrian Brown, ''The Ganassi recorder: separating fact from fiction'', American Recorder 47(5): 11\u201318, 1984.</ref>\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nRecorders were probably first used to play vocal music, later adding purely instrumental forms such as dance music to their repertoire. Much of the vocal music of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries can be played on recorder consorts, and as illustrated in treatises from Virdung to Praetorius, the choice appropriate instruments and transpositions to play vocal music was common practice in the Renaissance. Additionally, some collections such as those of [[Pierre Attaingnant]] and [[Anthony Holborne]], indicate that their instrumental music was suitable for recorder consorts.<ref name=\":18\">Anthony Holborne, ''Pavans, Galliards, Almains and other short Aeirs, both grave and light, in five parts, for Viols, Violins, recorders or other Musicall Winde Instruments'', published in 1599</ref> This section first discusses repertoire marked for the recorder, then briefly, other repertoire played on recorder.\n\nIn 1505 Giovanni Alvise, a Venetian wind player, offered Francesco Gonzaga of Mantua a motet for eight recorders, however the work has not survived.\n\nPierre Attaingnant's ({{floruit}} 1528\u20131549) ''Vingt & sept chansons musicales a quatre parties a la fleuste dallement...et a la fleuste a neuf trous'' (1533) collects 28 (not 27, as in the title) four-part instrumental motets, nine of which he says were suitable for performance on flutes (''fleustes dallement'', German flutes), two on recorders (''fleuestes a neuf trous,'' Nine holed flutes, \"recorders\"), and twelve suitable for both. Of the twelve marked for both, seven use ''[[Chiavette|chiavi naturali]]'', or low-clefs typically used for recorders, while the others use the ''chiavette'' clefs used in the motets marked for flutes. Hence, the seven notated in ''chiavi naturali'' could be considered more appropriate for recorders. ''Vingt et sept chansons'' is the first published music marked for a recorder consort. Earlier is a part for Jacobus Barbireau's song \"Een vrolic wesen\", apparently for recorder, accompanying the recorder fingering chart in ''Livre plaisant et tres utile...''  (Antwerp, 1529), a partial French translation of Virdung's ''Musica getutscht''.\n\nJacques Moderne's ''S'ensuyvent plusieurs basses dances tant communes que incommunes'' published in the 1530s, depicts a four-part recorder consort such as those described in Virdung, Agricola, Ganassi and others, however the dances are not marked for recorders. His ''Musique de joye'' (1550) contains ricercares and dances for performance on \"espinetes, violons & fleustes\".\n\nIn 1539\u201340, Henry VIII of England, also a keen amateur player (see Cultural significance), imported five brothers of the Bassano family from Venice to form a consort, expanded to six members in 1550, forming a group that maintained an exceptional focus on the recorder until at least 1630 when the recorder consort was combined with the other wind groups. Most wind bands consisted of players playing sackbutts, shawms, and other loud instruments doubling on recorder. Some music probably intended for this group survives, including dance music by Augustine and Geronimo Bassano from the third quarter of the 16th century, and the more elaborate fantasias of Jeronimo Bassano ({{circa}} 1580), four in five parts and one in six parts. Additionally, the Fitzwilliam wind manuscript (''GB-Cfm'' 734) contains wordless motets, madrigals and dance pieces, including some by the Bassano family, probably intended for a recorder consort in six parts.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.instantharmony.net/Music/AR-08-84.pdf|title = The Recorder Consort at the English Court 1540\u20131673: Part I|last = Lasocki|first = David|date = 1984|journal = American Recorder|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 8}}</ref>\n\nThe English members of the Bassano family, having originated in Venice, were also probably familiar with the vocal style, advanced technique, and complex improvised ornamentation described in Ganassi's ''Fontegara'', and they were probably among the recorder players who Ganassi reports having worked and studied with: when they were brought to England, they were regarded as some of the best wind players in Venice.

From the 15th century onwards, paintings show upper-class men and women playing recorder, and Virdung's didactic treatise ''Musica getutscht'' (1511), the first of its kind, was aimed at the amateur (see also Documentary evidence). Famously, [[Henry VIII of England]] was an avid player of the recorder, and at his death in 1547 an [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of his possessions]] included 76 recorders in consorts of various sizes and materials.<ref name=\":14\">''Oxford Companion to Music''. see section 2 of the article on \"Recorder Family\"</ref> Some Italian paintings from the 16th-century show aristocracy of both sexes playing the recorder, however many gentlemen found it unbecoming to play because it uses the mouth, preferring the lute and later the viol.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAt the turn of the 17th century, playwright William Shakespeare famously referenced the recorder in his most substantial play, \"The Tragedy of [[Hamlet]], Prince of Denmark,\" creating an extended metaphor between manipulation and playing a musical instrument.<ref name=\":15\">''[[Hamlet]]'', [[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 3#Scene 2.

These innovations allowed baroque recorders to possess a tone regarded as \"sweeter\" than that of the earlier instruments,<ref>Jonathan Wainwright and Peter Holman, ''From Renaissance To Baroque: Change in Instruments and Instrumental Music in the Seventeenth Century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7546-0403-9}}</ref> at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes.\n\nThe evolution of the Renaissance recorder into the Baroque instrument is generally attributed to the [[Hotteterre]] family, in France. They developed the ideas of a more tapered bore, bringing the finger-holes of the lowermost hand closer together, allowing greater range, and enabling the construction of instruments in several jointed sections. The last innovation allowed more accurate shaping of each section and also offered the player minor tuning adjustments, by slightly pulling out one of the sections to lengthen the instrument.\n\nThe French innovations were taken to London by Pierre [[Peter Bressan|Bressan]], a set of whose instruments survive in the [[Grosvenor Museum]], [[Chester]], as do other examples in various American, European and Japanese museums and private collections. Bressan's contemporary, [[Thomas Stanesby]], was born in [[Derbyshire]] but became an instrument maker in London. He and his son (Thomas Stanesby junior) were the other important British-based recorder-makers of the early 18th century.\n\nIn continental Europe, the [[Johann Christoph Denner|Denner]] family of Nuremberg were the most celebrated makers of this period.\n\nThe baroque recorder produces a most brilliant and projecting sound in the second octave, which is more facile and extended than that of earlier recorders, while the lowest notes in its range are relatively weak. Composers such as Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi exploit this property in their concertos for the instrument.\n\nMeasured from its lowest to its highest playable note, the baroque alto recorder has a range of at most two octaves and a fifth with many instruments having a smaller range. Even the most developed instruments of the period, however, cannot produce the augmented tonic, third and fourth of the third octave. Notably, [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]'s concerto TWV 51:F1 makes use some of these notes in the third octave, posing significant technical challenges to the player, perhaps requiring the covering of the bell or other unusual techniques.\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nDuring the baroque period, the recorder was traditionally associated with pastoral scenes, miraculous events, funerals, marriages, and amorous scenes. Images of recorders can be found in literature and artwork associated with all of these. [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&nbsp;S. Bach]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] used the recorder to suggest shepherds and imitate birds in their music.<ref>Nicholas S. Lander [http://www.recorderhomepage.net The Recorder Homepage] (1996\u2013 ). Last accessed 30 June 2014.</ref>\n\nAlthough the recorder achieved a greater level of standardization in the Baroque than in previous periods, indeed it is the first period in which there was a \"standard\" size of recorder, ambiguous nomenclature and uncertain organological evidence have led to controversy regarding which instruments should be used in some \"flute\" parts from the period.\n\n===== Fourth Brandenburg Concerto BWV 1049 =====\nThe concertino group of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] fourth [[Brandenburg Concerto]] in G major, BWV 1049, consists of a ''violono principale'', and {{lang|it|due fiauti d'echo}}, with ripieno strings. His later harpsichord transcription of this concerto, BWV 1057, lowers the key by a tone, as in all of Bach's harpsichord transcriptions, and is scored for solo harpsichord, two ''fiauti \u00e0 bec'' and ripieno strings. The desired instrument for the ''fiauti d'echo'' parts in BWV 1049 has been a matter of perennial musicological and organological debate for two primary reasons: first, the term ''fiauto d'echo'' is not mentioned in dictionaries or tutors of the period; and second, the first ''fiauto'' part uses F#6, a note which is difficult to produce on a Baroque alto recorder in F4.\n\nThe instrumentation of BWV 1057 is uncontroversial: ''fiauti \u00e0 bec'' unambiguously specifies recorders, and both parts have been modified to fit comfortably on altos in F4, avoiding, for example, an unplayable Eb4 in the second ''fiauto'' that would have resulted from a simple transposition of a tone.\n\nFor the first and last movements of the concerto, two opinions predominate: first, that both recorder parts should be played on alto recorders in F4; and second, that the first part should be played on an alto recorder in G and the second part on an alto in F. Tushaar Power has argued for the alto in G4 on the basis that Bach uses the high F#6, which can be easily played on an alto in G4, but not the low F4, a note not playable on the alto in G4. He corroborates this with other alto recorder parts in Bach's cantatas. Michael Marissen reads the repertoire differently, demonstrating that in other recorder parts, Bach used both the low F4 and F#6, as well as higher notes. Marissen argues that Bach was not as consistent as Power asserts, and that Bach would have almost certainly had access to only altos in F. He corroborates this with examinations of pitch standards and notation in Bach's cantatas, in which the recorder parts are sometimes written as transposing instruments to play with organs that sounded as much as a minor third above written pitch. Marissen also reads Bach's revisions to the recorder parts in BWV 1057 as indicative of his avoidance of F#6 in BWV 1049, a sign that he only used the difficult note when necessary in designing the part for an alto recorder in F4. He posits that Bach avoided F#6 in BWV 1049, at the cost of inferior counterpoint, reinstating them as E6 in BWV 1057.\n\nIn the second movement, breaking of beaming in the ''fiauto'' parts, markings of ''f'' and ''p,'' the fermata over the final double bar of the first movement, and the 21 bars of rest at the beginning of the third have led some musicologists to argue that Bach intended the use of \"echo flutes\" distinct from normal recorders in the second movement in particular. The breaking of beaming could be an indication of changes in register or tonal quality, the rests introduced to allow the players time to change instruments, and the markings of ''f'' and ''p'' further indicative of register or sound changes. Marissen has demonstrated that the ''f'' and ''p'' markings probably indicated tutti and solo sections rather than loud and soft ones.\n\nA number of instruments other than normal recorders have been suggested for the ''fiauto d'echo''. One of the earliest proposed alternatives, by Thurston Dart, was the use of double flageolets, a suggestion since revealed to be founded on unsteady musicological grounds. Dart did, however, bring to light numerous newspaper references to Paisible's performance on an \"echo flute\" between 1713 and 1718. Another contemporary reference to the \"echo flute\" is in Etienne Louli\u00e9's ''Elements ou principes de musique'' (Amsterdan, 1696): ''Les sons de deux flutes d'echo sont differents, parce que l'un est fort, & que l'autre est foible'' (The sounds of two echo flutes are different, because one is strong and the other is weak). Louli\u00e9 is unclear on why one would need two echo flutes to play strongly and weakly, and on why it is that echo flutes differ. Perhaps the echo flute was composed in two halves: one which plays strongly, the other weakly? On this we can only speculate.\n\nSurviving instruments which are candidates for echo flutes include an instrument in Leipzig which consists of two recorders of different tonal characteristics joined together at the head and footjoints by brass flanges. There is also evidence of double recorders tuned in thirds, but these are not candidates for the ''fiauto'' parts in BWV 1049.\n\n===== \"Concerti per flautino\" RV 443, 444, 445 =====\n[[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] wrote three concertos for the {{lang|it|flautino}}, possibly for performance by students at the [[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]] in Venice, where he taught and composed in the early 18th century. They feature virtuosic solo writing, and along with his concerto RV 441 and trio sonata RV 86 are his most virtuosic recorder works. They each survive a single hastily written manuscript copy, each titled ''Con.to per Flautino'' (Concerto for little flute) with the additional note ''Gl'istrom.ti trasportati alla 4a'' (The instruments transpose by a fourth) in RV 443 and ''Gl'istrom.ti alla 4ta Bassa'' (The instruments lower by a fourth) in RV 445. The three concertos RV 443, 444, and 445 are notated in C major, C major and A minor respectively. Also of note is the occasional use of notes outside the normal two octave compass of the recorder: the range of the solo sections is two octaves from notated F4 to notated F6, however there is a single notated C4 in the first movement of RV 444, a notated E4 in a tutti section in the first movement of RV 443 and low E4 in multiple tutti sections of RV 445.\n\nA number of possible ''flautini''  have been proposed as the instrument intended for the performance of these concertos. The first suggestion was the use of the one keyed piccolo, or another small transverse flute, however such instruments had fallen out of use in Venice by the generally accepted time of composition of these concertos in the 1720s, and this opinion is no longer considered well supported. Another suggestion, first proposed by Peter Thalheimer, is the \"french\" flageolet (see Flageolets below) in G5, which was notated in D4, appearing a fourth lower, possibly explaining the note in the margins of RV 443 and RV 445 (''Gl'istromti transportati alla 4a'') and supported by Bismantova (1677 rev. 1694) and Bonanni (1722) which equate ''flautino'' to the flageolet. However this suggestion has been opposed by the presence of notated F{{sub|4}} and F{{music|#}}{{sub|4}} which are not within the typical compass of the flageolet, although they may be produced through the covering of the bell, sometimes combined with underblowing, as attested by theorists as early as Cardano (c.&nbsp;1546) and as late as Bellay (c.&nbsp;1800).<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Flautino' und 'Flasolet' bei Antonio Vivaldi|last = Thalheimer|first = Peter|date = 1998|journal = Tibia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 2|volume = 23|pages = 97\u2013105|trans-title = 'Flautino' and 'Flasolet' in Antonio Vivaldi's works}}</ref>\n\nTwo instruments are conventionally accepted today for the performance of these concertos, the sopranino recorder, notated like an alto but sounding an octave higher, and the soprano recorder, following the instruction to transpose the parts down by a fourth. Winfried Michel was first to argue in favor of the soprano recorder in 1983, when he proposed to take Vivaldi at his word and transpose the string parts down a fourth and play the ''flautino'' part on a soprano recorder in C5 (also \"fifth-flute\") using the English practice of notating such flutes as transposing instruments using the fingerings of an alto recorder. Michel notes that this transposition allows for the use of the violins' and viola's lowest strings (in sections where they provide the accompaniment without bass) and the lowest two notes of the 'cello. He attributes the presence of notes not in the recorder's normal compass to Vivaldi's haste, noting that these notes do not appear in the solo sections.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Vivaldis Konzerte 'per Flautino' in ihrer wahren Gestalt: Ein letzter Leseversuch|last = Michel|first = Winfried|date = 1998|journal = Tibia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 2|volume = 23|pages = 106\u201311|trans-title = Vivaldi's concertos 'per flautino' in their true form: A final attempt at a reading}}</ref> He has edited editions of RV 443 and RV 445 for soprano recorder in G major and E minor respectively. Federico Maria Sardelli concurs with Michel in supposing that the margin note was intended to allow the performance of the concertos on the soprano recorder on a specific occasion, however concludes that they were probably written for the sopranino recorder in F5, noting that small transverse flutes had fallen out of use in Italy by Vivaldi's time, the paucity of flageolets in Italy, the range of the parts, and uses of the flautino in vocal arias.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1225&context=ppr|title = \"Vivaldi's Music for Flute and Recorder\" by Federico Sardelli|last = Bowers|first = Jane|date = 2008|journal = Performance Practice Review|doi = 10.5642/perfpr.200813.01.09|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 9|volume = 13|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\n===Classical and Romantic===\nThe recorder was little used in art music of the [[Classical music|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods. Researchers have long debated why this change occurred, and to what extent the recorder remained use in the late 18th century, and later the 19th century. A significant question in this debate is which, if any, duct flutes of this period are recorders or successors to recorders.\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nThe recorder work of the latter half of the 18th century most known today is probably a trio sonata by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;E. Bach]], Wq.163, composed in 1755{{Snd}} an arrangement of a trio sonata for two violins and continuo, scored for the unusual ensemble of viola, bass recorder and continuo.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Trio Sonata in F major, H.588 (Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel)|url = http://imslp.org/wiki/Trio_Sonata_in_F_major,_H.588_(Bach,_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel)|website = imslp.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref> This work is also notable for being perhaps the only significant surviving historical solo work for bass recorder. Also of note are the works of Johann Christoph Schultze ({{circa}} 1733\u20131813), who wrote two concertos for the instrument, one in [[G major]] and another in [[B-flat major|B{{music|b}} major]], written around 1740.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Schultze, Johann Christian (c. 1740): Concert B flat-Major-EW986|url = http://www.edition-walhall.de/en/woodwind-/recorder/schultze-johann-christian-ca-1740-concert-b-flat-major.html|website = www.edition-walhall.de|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = Franz|last = Biersack}}</ref> The last occurrences of the recorder in art music are apparently by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] in ''[[Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn]]'' (1801) and ''Kleiner Tusch'' (1806).

The first significant explanation for the recorder's decline was proposed by Waitzman (1967),<ref>Waitzman, Daniel: \"The Decline of the Recorder in the 18th Century\". Published in ''American Recorder'' 8 no. 2 (Spring 1967). pp.&nbsp;47\u201351</ref> who proposed six reasons:\n# The recorder lacked a significant class of professional players\n# The recorder's true nature was not appreciated\n# The high [[tessitura]] of the instrument discouraged composers from writing idiomatically for the instrument\n# The exploitation of the highest registers posed special problems for makers and players\n# Interest in clarino (4\u2032 pitch) instruments was waning\n# As a result of the first five factors, the recorder had a bad reputation, which discouraged students from studying the instrument \nIn the Baroque, the majority of professional recorder players were primarily oboists or string players. For this reason, the number of professional exponents of the recorder was smaller than that of other woodwinds.\n\nOthers attribute the decline of the recorder in part to the flute innovators of the time, such as [[Heinrich Grenser|Grenser]], and [[Johann George Tromlitz|Tromlitz]], who extended the transverse flute's range and evened out its tonal consistency through the addition of keys, or to the supposedly greater dynamic range and volume of the flute.<ref>Donald Murray et al. ''Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music'', Oxford University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-19-816504-8}}. p.&nbsp;122</ref> Similar developments occurring in many other orchestral instruments to make them louder, increase their range, and increase their tonal consistency did not simultaneously occur in the case of the recorder.\n\nA complementary view recently advanced by Nikolaj Tarasov is that the recorder, rather than totally disappearing, evolved in similar ways to other wind instruments through the addition of keys and other devices, and remained in use throughout the 19th century, with its direct descendant's popularity overlapping with the late 19th and early 20th century recorder revival.<ref name=\":22\" /> Support for this view rests on the organological classification of some 19th century duct flutes as recorders. For more on this question, see \"Other duct flutes\".\n\n==== Other duct flutes ====\nDuct flutes remained popular even as the recorder waned in the 18th century. As in the instrument's earliest history, questions of the instrument's quiddity are at the forefront of modern debate. The modification and renaming of recorders in the 18th century in order to prolong their use, and the uncertainty of the extent of the recorder's use the late 18th and early 19th centuries have fueled these debates. Some recent researchers contend that some 19th century duct flutes are actually recorders. This article briefly discusses the duct flutes presented as successors to the recorder: the English flageolet and the csakan, which were popular among amateurs in the second half of the 18th century, and the whole of the 19th.\n\n===== Flageolets =====\n[[File:French and english flageolets.jpg|thumb|French flageolet, left; English flageolet, right. Mid 19th c. Note the seven finger holes and single thumb hole of the English flageolet]]\nThe word \"[[flageolet]]\" has been used since the 16th century to refer to small duct flutes, and the instrument is sometimes designated using general terms such as ''flautino'' and ''flauto piccolo'', complicating identification of its earliest form. It was first described by [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]] in ''Harmonie universelle'' (1636) as having four fingers on the front, and two thumb holes on the back, with lowest note C6 and a compass of two octaves. Like the recorder, the upper thumb hole is used as an octaving vent. Flageolets were generally small flutes, however their lowest note varies.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The English-Flageolet 1800\u20131900|last = Macmillan|first = Douglas|date = 2010|journal=[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]|doi = 10.1093/em/caq081|pmid = |issue = 4|volume = 38|pages = 559}}</ref> They were initially popular in France, and it is from there that the flageolet first arrived in England in the seventeenth century, becoming a popular amateur instrument, as the recorder later did. Indeed, when the recorder was introduced to England it was presented as an easy instrument for those who already played the flageolet, and the earliest English recorder tutors are notated in the flageolet tablature of the time, called \"dot-way\".<ref name=\":21\" /> Notably, the diarist and naval administrator [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633\u20131703) and his wife were both amateur players of the flageolet, and Pepys was later an amateur recorder player.\n\nStarting in the early 1800s, a number of innovations to the flageolet were introduced, including the addition of keys to extend its range and allow it to more easily play accidentals. They also included novel solutions to the problem of condensation: most commonly, a sea sponge was placed inside the wind chamber (the conical chamber above the windway) to soak up moisture, while novel solutions such as the insertion of a thin wooden wedge into the windway, the drilling of little holes in the side of the block to drain condensation and a complex system for draining condensation through a hollowed out block developed, were also developed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bahn frei!

In this period, the instrument had six finger holes and single thumb hole, and had as many as six keys. Tarasov reports that the English flageolets of the late 18th century had six finger holes and no thumb hole, and later regained the thumb hole seventh finger hole (see above, right).<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Blockfl\u00f6ten im 19.

Both remained popular until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nA significant amount of music was written for the flageolet in the 19th century, such as the etudes of Narcisse Bousquet although much of it was directed at amateurs.\n\nEnglish flageolets that may qualify as recorders are of two types: those early instruments, called \"English flageolets,\" which were actually recorders, and 19th century instruments with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. These instruments are not typically regarded as recorders, however Tarasov has argued for their inclusion in the family.\n\n===== Csakan =====\nThe csakan (from Hung. ''cs\u00e1k\u00e1ny \"''pickaxe\"), also known by the recorder's old french name ''flute douce'', was a duct flute in the shape of a walking stick or oboe popular in [[Vienna]] from about 1800 to the 1840s. The csakan was played using the fingerings of a recorder in C, and was typically pitched in A{{music|flat}} or G and played as a transposing instrument. The first documented appearance of the csakan was at a concert in [[Budapest]] on February 18, 1807 in a performance by its billed inventor, Anton Heberle ({{floruit}} 1806\u201316). Tarasov has contested Heberle's status as the inventor of the instrument, and has argued that the csakan grew out of a Hungarian war hammer of the same name, which was converted into a recorder, perhaps for playing military music. Around 1800, it was highly fashionable for make walking sticks with additional functions (e.g., umbrellas, swords, flutes, oboes, clarinets, horns) although the csakan was the most popular of these, and the only one that became a musical instrument in its own right.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Was ist ein Csakan? Von der Waffe zum Musikinstrument|last = Tarasov|first = Nikolaj|date = 2009|journal = Windkanal|doi = |pmid = |issue = 1|trans-title = What is a csakan? From war hammer to musical instrument|issn = 1864-6204|pages = 14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest instruments were shaped like a walking stick with a mouthpiece in the handle and had no keys, although they could eventually have up to thirteen keys, along with a tuning slide and a device for narrowing the thumb hole. In the 1820s a csakan \"in the pleasing shape of an oboe\" was introduced in a \"simple\" form with a single key and a \"complex\" form with up to twelve keys like those found on contemporaneous flutes. Well known makers of the csakan included Johann Ziegler and Stephan Koch in Vienna, and Franz Sch\u00f6llnast in [[Bratislava|Pressburg]]. According to accounts left by Sch\u00f6llnast, the csakan was primarily an amateur instrument, purchased by those who wanted something simple and inexpensive, however there were also accomplished professionals, such as Viennese court oboist Ernst Kr\u00e4hmer (1795\u20131837) who toured as far afield as Russia, playing the csakan with acclaimed virtuosity.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Csakan|last = Betz|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = |work = Grove Music Online|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/06917}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAround 400 works for the csakan were published in the first half of the 19th century, mainly for csakan solo, csakan duet or csakan with guitar or piano. The csakan's repertoire has not yet been fully explored. Notable composers for the instrument include Heberle and Kr\u00e4hmer, and Tarasov notes that piano works by Beethoven were arranged for csakan and guitar ([[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] is reported to have owned a walking-stick csakan). Modern recorder makers such as [[Conrad Mollenhauer GmbH|Bernhard Mollenhauer]] and Martin Wenner have made csakan copies.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Csakan|url = http://csakan.de/en|website = csakan.de|access-date = 2016-02-14|last = Mollenhauer|first = Bernhard}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = J.

Accounts of Kr\u00e4hmer's playing, which report his \"diminishing and swelling the notes, up to an almost unbelievable loudness\" imply a developed technique using shading and alternate fingerings, far beyond a purely amateur culture of house music. Additionally, Tarasov reports that some recorders by Baroque makers were modified, around 1800, through the addition of keys, including a [[Johann Christoph Denner|J.&nbsp;C. Denner]] (1655\u20131707) basset recorder in Budapest and an alto by Nikolaus Staub (1664\u20131734) with added G{{music|#}} keys, like the D{{music|#}} key on a baroque two-key flute. Another modification is the narrowing of the thumb hole, by way of an ivory plug on the J.&nbsp;C. Denner basset and an alto by Benedikt Gahn (1674\u20131711), to allow it to serve purely as an octaving vent, as found on many flageolets and csakans. These changes may be archetypal to those found on csakans and flageolets, and constitute an inchoate justification for the continuous development of the Baroque recorder into its 19th-century relatives.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Barockblockfl\u00f6ten 2.0: Indizien f\u00fcr die Verwendung von Barockblockfl\u00f6ten um 1800|last = Tarasov|first = Nikolaj|date = 2010|journal = Windkanal|doi = |pmid = |issue = 1|year = |trans-title = Baroque recorders 2.0: indicators of the use of Baroque recorders around 1800|pages = 12\u201315|isbn = |issn = 1864-6204}}</ref>\n\n===Modern revival===\n==== The \"revival\" ====\nThe concept of a recorder \"revival\" must be considered in the context of the decline of the recorder in the 18th and 19th centuries. The craft of recorder making was continued in some form by a number of families, such as the {{Lang|de|Berchtesgaden Fleitl}} produced by the Oeggle family, which traces its lineage to the Walch family of recorder makers<ref>MacMillan, D. (2007). \"The Recorder 1800\u20131905\". ''Recorder Magazine'' 27(4): 126\u2013131.</ref> the careers of the Schlosser family of [[Zwota]]. Heinrich Oskar Schlosser (1875\u20131947) made instruments sold by the firm of [[Moeck Musikinstrumente + Verlag|Moeck]] in Celle and helped to design their Tuju series of recorders.<ref>Tarasov, N.

''Windkanal'' 4: 14\u201317. {{in lang|de}}</ref> The firm [[Conrad Mollenhauer GmbH|Mollenhauer]], currently headed by Bernhard Mollenhauer, can trace its origins to historical instrument makers.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite web|title = Csakan|url = http://www.csakan.de/en|website = www.csakan.de|access-date = 2016-02-10|last = Mollenhauer}}</ref>\n\nThe recorder, if it did persist through the 19th century, did so in a manner quite unlike the success it enjoyed in previous centuries, or that it would enjoy in the century to come in. Among the earliest ensembles to begin use of recorders in the 20th century was the [[Bogenhauser K\u00fcnstlerkapelle]] (Bogenhausen Artists' Band) which from 1890 to 1939 used antique recorders and other instruments to play music of all ages, including arrangements of classical and romantic music. Nonetheless, the recorder was considered primarily an instrument of historical interest.\n\nThe eventual success of the recorder in the modern era is often attributed to [[Arnold Dolmetsch]]. While he was responsible for broadening interest in the United Kingdom beyond the small group of early music specialists, Dolmetsch was not solely responsible for the recorder's broader revival.  On the continent his efforts were preceded by those of musicians at the Brussels Conservatoire (where Dolmetsch received his training), and by the German [[Bogenhauser K\u00fcnstlerkapelle]]. Also in Germany, the work of Willibald Gurlitt, Werner Danckerts and Gustav Scheck proceeded quite independently of the Dolmetsches.<ref>Eve E. O'Kelly, ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-36681-X}}. Chapter 1: The Revival</ref>\n\n==== Players ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2019}}\n{{see also|List of recorder players}}\nCarl Dolmetsch, the son of Arnold Dolmetsch, became one of the first virtuoso recorder players in the 1920s; but more importantly he began to commission recorder works from leading composers of his day, especially for performance at the Haslemere festival which his father ran. Initially as a result of this, and later as a result of the development of a Dutch school of recorder playing led by Kees Otten, the recorder was introduced to serious musicians as a virtuoso solo instrument both in Britain and in northern Europe.\n\nAmong the influential virtuosos who figure in the revival of the recorder as a serious concert instrument in the latter part of the 20th century are Ferdinand Conrad, Kees Otten, [[Frans Br\u00fcggen]], Roger Cotte, [[Hans-Martin Linde]], [[New York Pro Musica|Bernard Krainis]], and [[David Munrow]]. Br\u00fcggen recorded most of the landmarks of the historical repertoire and commissioned a substantial number of new works for the recorder. Munrow's 1975 double album ''The Art of the Recorder'' remains as an important anthology of recorder music through the ages.\n\nAmong late 20th-century and early 21st-century recorder ensembles, the trio [[Sour Cream Trio|Sour Cream]] (led by [[Frans Br\u00fcggen]]), [[Flautando K\u00f6ln]], the [[Flanders Recorder Quartet]], [[Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet]] and [[Quartet New Generation]] have programmed remarkable mixtures of historical and contemporary repertoire. Soloists such as [[Piers Adams]], [[Dan Laurin]] and [[Dorothee Oberlinger]],  [[Michala Petri]], [[Maurice Steger]].\n\nIn the 2012 Charlotte Barbour-Condini became the first recorder player to reach the final of the biennial [[BBC Young Musician of the Year]] competition. Recorder player Sophie Westbrooke was a finalist in the 2014 competition.<ref>{{citation|author=BBC|title=BBC Young Musician|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2z5sMZbDZKnvmdml5FjxnLH/sophie-westbrooke|accessdate=25 November 2014|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Structure ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2019}}\nThe first recorders to be played in the modern period were antique instruments from previous periods. Anecdotally, Arnold Dolmetsch was motivated to make his own recorders after losing a bag containing his antique instruments. Recorders made in the early 20th century were imitative of baroque models in their exterior form, but differed significantly in their structure. Dolmetsch introduced English fingering, the now standard fingering for \"baroque\" model instruments, and standardized the doubled 6th and 7th holes found on a handful of antique instruments by the English makers Stanesby and Bressan. Dolmetsch instruments generally had a large rectangular windway, unlike the curved windways of all historical instruments, and played at modern pitch.\n\n==== Repertoire ====\nNearly twice as many pieces have been written for the recorder since its modern revival as were written in all previous epochs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Catalogue of Recorder Repertoire: Home|url = http://www.blokfluit.org/|website = www.blokfluit.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref> Many of these were composed by avant-garde composers of the latter half of the 20th century who used the recorder for the variety of extended techniques which are possible using its open holes and its sensitivity to articulation.\n\n{{Listen|type=music\n|filename    = Colin Ross - Etherea.ogg\n|title       = Etherea (Colin Ross, 1995)\n|description = [[New-age music]] performed on the recorder. 03:08 minutes}}\nModern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[J\u00fcrg Baur]], [[Josef Tal]], [[John Tavener]], [[Michael Tippett]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Steven Stucky]] and [[Edmund Rubbra]].\n\nOwing to its ubiquity as a teaching instrument and the relative ease of sound production, the recorder has occasionally been used in popular music by groups such as [[The Beatles]];<ref>For example, in \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\", according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S.

Notable historical makers include the Rafi, Schnitzer and Bassano families in the renaissance; [[Thomas Stanesby|Stanesby]] (Jr. and Sr.), [[Johann Christoph Denner|J.C.]] and [[Johann Christoph Denner|J. Denner]], [[Jacques-Martin Hotteterre|Hotteterre]], [[Peter Bressan|Bressan]], Haka, Heitz, Rippert, Rottenburgh, Steenbergen and Terton. Most of these makers also built other wind instruments such as oboes and transverse flutes. Notably, [[Jacob Denner]] is credited with the development of the clarinet from the chalumeau.\n\nRecorder making declined with the instrument's wane in the late 18th century, essentially severing the craft's transmission to the modern age. With few exceptions, the duct flutes manufactured in the 19th and late 18th centuries were intended for amateur or educational use, and were not constructed to the high standard of earlier epochs.\n\n[[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the first to achieve commercial production in the 20th century, began to build recorders in 1919. While these early recorders played at a low pitch like that of the available originals, he did not strive for exactitude in reproduction, and by the 1930s the Dolmetsch family firm, then under the direction of Arnold's son Carl Dolmetsch, was mass-producing recorders at modern pitch with wide, straight windways, and began to produce [[bakelite]] recorders shortly after the Second World War. Nonetheless, the Dolmetsch models were innovative for their time and proved influential, particularly in standardizing the English fingering system now standard for modern baroque-style instruments and doubled 6th and 7th holes, which are rare on antique instruments.\n\nIn Germany, [[Peter Harlan]] began to manufacture recorders in the 1920s, primarily for educational use in the youth movement. Following Harlan's success, numerous makers such as Adler and [[Conrad Mollenhauer GmbH|Mollenhauer]] began commercial production of recorders, fueling an explosion in the instrument's popularity in Germany. These recorders shared little in common with antiques, with large straight windways, anachronistically pitched consorts, modified fingering systems and other innovations.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, historically informed performance practice was on the rise and recorder makers increasingly sought to imitate the sound and character of antiques. The German-American maker [[Friedrich von Huene (musician)|Friedrich von Huene]] was among the first to research recorders held in European collections and produce instruments intended to reproduce the qualities of the antiques. Von Huene and his Australian colleague Frederick Morgan sought to connect the tradition of the historical wind-makers to the modern day with the understanding that doing so creates the best instruments, and those most suited to ancient music.\n\nVirtually all recorders manufactured today claim ascendancy to an antique model and most makers active today can trace their trade directly to one of these pioneering makers.\n\nToday, makers maintaining individual workshops include Ammann, Blezinger, Bolton, Boudreau, Breukink, Brown, Coomber, Cranmore, de Paolis, Ehlert, Grinter (dead), Marvin (dead), Meyer, Musch, Netsch, Prescott, Rohmer, Takeyama, von Huene, and Wenner. French maker Philippe Bolton created an electroacoustic recorder<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flute-a-bec.com/electrgb.html|title=Philippe Bolton, Recorder Maker{{Snd}} Electroacoustic Recorders|website=www.flute-a-bec.com}}</ref> and is among the last to offer mounted bell-keys and double bell-keys for both tenor and alto recorders. Those bell-keys extend easily the range of the instrument to more than three octaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flute-a-bec.com/cletengb.html|title=Philippe Bolton, Recorder Maker{{Snd}} a Recorder Bell Key|website=www.flute-a-bec.com}}</ref> Invented by Carl Dolmetsch in 1957, he first used the bell-key system publicly in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recorderhomepage.net/history/innovations-in-recorder-design/|title=Innovations|website=recorderhomepage.net|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Use in schools==\n[[File:Japanese YAMAHA Instruments Recorders 1.JPG|thumb|Plastic recorder ([[Yamaha]])]]\nIn the mid-20th century, German composer and music educator [[Carl Orff]] popularized the recorder for use in schools as part of [[Orff-Schulwerk]] programs in German schools. Orff's five-volume opus of educational music ''Music for Children'' contains many pieces for recorders, usually scored for other instruments as well.<ref>Regner, Hermann. Orff-Schulwerk Floetenbuch, Preface. Translated by I.M. Rushworth. http://www.vosa.org/paul/sales_folder/orff_recorder.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042013/http://www.vosa.org/paul/sales_folder/orff_recorder.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nManufacturers have made recorders out of [[bakelite]] and other more modern plastics; they are thus easy to produce, hence inexpensive. Because of this, recorders are popular in schools, as they are one of the cheapest instruments to buy in bulk.<ref>Margo Hall, ''Teaching Kids Recorder'', iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-36743-7}}{{Self-published source|date=May 2019}}</ref> They are also relatively easy to play at a basic level because sound production needs only breath, and pitch is basically determined by fingering. It is, however, incorrect to assume that mastery is similarly easy\u2014like any other instrument, the recorder requires study to play well and in tune, and significant study to play at an advanced or professional level.\n\n==Recorder ensembles==\nThe recorder is a very social instrument. Many recorder players participate in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Recorder+flute |title=Recorder flute definition of Recorder flute in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of recorder music]]\n* [[List of recorder players]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last1=Griscom |first1=Richard |last2=Lasocki |first2=David |year=2012 |title=The Recorder: A Research and Information Guide |edition=3rd |series=Routledge Music Bibliographies |location=New York & London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-99858-1 |oclc=743214715 |ref=harv}} {{ISBN|978-0-203-87502-5}} (e-book).\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Recorders (musical instrument)}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Recorder (musical instrument)}}\n*[http://www.recorderhomepage.net/ Recorder Home Page]{{Snd}} A comprehensive website devoted to the recorder\n*[http://www.flute-a-bec.com/acoustiquegb.html How the recorder works]\n*[http://recordersheetmusic.org/ Interactive Sheet Music for the Recorder]\n*[http://www.flute-a-bec.com/tablhistogb.html Philippe Bolton\u2019s page of Historical recorder fingering charts]\n*[http://www.flute-a-bec.com/tablaturgb.html Philippe Bolton\u2019s page of modern recorder fingering charts]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190928154618/http://www.recorder-fingerings.com/ Recorder fingerings], Charts and trill charts, recorder-fingerings.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110710143437/http://www.dolmetsch.com/fingerings.htm Recorder fingerings], Dolmetsch Online\n*[https://archive.today/20141120204518/http://www.moeck.com/cms/index.php?id=38&L=1 Recorder fingerings], Moeck\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141110001837/http://www.mollenhauer.com/en/recorders/fingering-charts Recorder fingerings], Mollenhauer\n*[http://www.wfg.woodwind.org/recorder/ Recorder fingerings], Woodwind fingering guide \t\n*[https://www.zotero.org/paganpiper/items/collectionKey/EMSH9CWV/order/creator/sort/asc Nicholas Lander's Recorder Bibliography], A Zotero bibliographic database that contains details of some 4,000 references concerning the recorder.\n\n{{Flutes}}\n{{Renaissance music}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Baroque instruments]]\n[[Category:Early musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Internal fipple flutes]]\n[[Category:Recorders (musical instruments)| ]]\n", "name_user": "ChrisCarss Former24.108.99.31", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder_(musical_instrument)"}

They form the dominant racial group in the region. \n\nMajority of the modern Afro-Caribbeans descend from slaves taken to [[History of the Caribbean|colonial Caribbean]] via the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]] between the 15th and 19th centuries to work primarily on various [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]]s and in domestic households. Other names for the ethnic group include '''Black Caribbean''', '''Afro-''' or '''Black West Indian''', or '''Afro-''' or '''Black''' '''Antillean'''. The term Afro-Caribbean was not coined by [[West Indian]]s themselves but was first used by Americans in the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Committee on Foreign Affairs|first1=United States Congress House|title=Hearings|date=1970|volume=2|pages=64\u201369|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yj8gAAAAMAAJ&q=Afro-+Caribbean}}</ref>\n\nPeople of Afro-Caribbean descent today mainly have between 85\u201395% African ancestry with their remaining DNA being of non-African ancestry, such as European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Amerindian descent, as there has been extensive intermarriage and unions among the peoples over the centuries.  \nAlthough most Afro-Caribbean people today live in [[French language|French]]-, [[English language|English]]-, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking Caribbean nations and territories, there are also significant diaspora populations throughout the [[Western world]]\u2014especially in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Both the home and diaspora populations have produced a number of individuals who have had a notable influence on modern Western, Caribbean, and African societies; they include political activists such as [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[C. L. R. James]]; writers and theorists such as [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and [[Frantz Fanon]]; US military leader and statesman [[Colin Powell]]; and musicians [[Bob Marley]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Rihanna]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Afro-Caribbean history}}\n\n===16th\u201318th centuries===\nDuring the post-Columbian era, the archipelagos and islands of the [[Caribbean]] were the first sites of [[African diaspora]] dispersal in the western Atlantic. Specifically, in 1492, [[Pedro Alonso Ni\u00f1o]], an African-Spanish seafarer, was recorded as piloting one of Columbus' ships. He returned in 1499, but did not settle. In the early 16th century, more Africans began to enter the population of the Spanish Caribbean colonies, sometimes arriving as free men of mixed ancestry or as indentured servants, but increasingly as [[Slavery in the Americas|enslaved]] workers and servants. This increasing demand for African labour in the Caribbean was in part the result of massive depopulation of the native [[Taino]] and other indigenous peoples caused by the new [[infectious diseases]], harsh conditions, and warfare brought by European colonists. By the mid-16th century, the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] from [[West Africa]] to the Caribbean was so profitable that [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] were prepared to engage in piracy as well as break Spanish colonial laws, in order to forcibly transport approximately 1500 enslaved people from [[Sierra Leone]] to [[San Domingo]] (modern-day [[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]]).<ref>{{Google books|3ukDAAAAMAAJ| ''Some Historical Account of Guinea: With an Inquiry into the Rise and Progress of the Slave Trade|page=48}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, European colonial development in the Caribbean became increasingly reliant on plantation slavery to cultivate and process the lucrative commodity crop of [[sugarcane]]. On many islands shortly before the end of the 18th century, the enslaved Afro-Caribbeans greatly outnumbered their European masters. In addition, there developed a class of [[free people of color]], especially in the French islands, where persons of mixed race were given certain rights.<ref>Stephen D. Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research]], [[Harvard University]]. Based on \"records for 27,233 voyages that set out to obtain slaves for the Americas\". {{cite book |last=Stephen Behrendt |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-00071-5 |chapter=Transatlantic Slave Trade |quote= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/africanaencyclop00appi }}</ref> On [[Saint-Domingue]], free people of color and slaves rebelled against harsh conditions, and constant inter-imperial warfare. Inspired by French revolutionary sentiments that at one point freed the slaves, [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and [[Jean Jacques Dessalines]] led the [[Haitian Revolution]] that gained the independence of [[Haiti]] in 1804, the first Afro-Caribbean republic in the [[Western Hemisphere]].\n\n===19th\u201320th centuries===\nIn 1804, Haiti, with its overwhelmingly African population and leadership, became the second nation in the Americas to win independence from a European state. During the 19th century, continuous waves of rebellion, such as the [[Baptist War]], led by [[Sam Sharpe]] in Jamaica, created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region by various colonial powers. Great Britain abolished slavery in its holdings in 1834. [[Cuba]] was the last island to be emancipated, when Spain abolished slavery in its colonies.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people, who were a majority in many Caribbean societies, began to assert their cultural, economic, and political rights with more vigor on the world stage. [[Marcus Garvey]] was among many influential immigrants to the United States from Jamaica, expanding his [[UNIA]] movement in [[New York City]] and the U.S.<ref>Martin, Tony. ''Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggle of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association''. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976.</ref>  Afro-Caribbeans were influential in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] as artists and writers. [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] developed a [[n\u00e9gritude]] movement.\n\nIn the 1960s, the West Indian territories were given their political independence from [[British Empire|British colonial rule]]. They were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as [[reggae music]], [[Calypso music|calypso]] and [[rastafari]]anism within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a developing Afro-Caribbean diaspora in the United States, including such figures as [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]], was influential in the development of the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1960s and the [[hip-hop]] movement of the 1980s. African-Caribbean individuals also contributed to cultural developments in Europe, as evidenced by influential theorists such as [[Frantz Fanon]]<ref>Nigel C.

trace their full or partial ancestry to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. They form the dominant racial group in the region. \n\nMajority of the modern Afro-Caribbeans descend from slaves taken to [[History of the Caribbean|colonial Caribbean]] via the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]] between the 15th and 19th centuries to work primarily on various [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]]s and in domestic households. Other names for the ethnic group include '''Black Caribbean''', '''Afro-''' or '''Black West Indian''', or '''Afro-''' or '''Black''' '''Antillean'''. The term Afro-Caribbean was not coined by [[West Indian]]s themselves but was first used by Americans in the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Committee on Foreign Affairs|first1=United States Congress House|title=Hearings|date=1970|volume=2|pages=64\u201369|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yj8gAAAAMAAJ&q=Afro-+Caribbean}}</ref>\n\nPeople of Afro-Caribbean descent today mainly have between 85\u201395% African ancestry with their remaining DNA being of non-African ancestry, such as European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Amerindian descent, as there has been extensive intermarriage and unions among the peoples over the centuries.  \nAlthough most Afro-Caribbean people today live in [[French language|French]]-, [[English language|English]]-, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking Caribbean nations and territories, there are also significant diaspora populations throughout the [[Western world]]\u2014especially in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Both the home and diaspora populations have produced a number of individuals who have had a notable influence on modern Western, Caribbean, and African societies; they include political activists such as [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[C. L. R. James]]; writers and theorists such as [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and [[Frantz Fanon]]; US military leader and statesman [[Colin Powell]]; and musicians [[Bob Marley]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Rihanna]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Afro-Caribbean history}}\n\n===16th\u201318th centuries===\nDuring the post-Columbian era, the archipelagos and islands of the [[Caribbean]] were the first sites of [[African diaspora]] dispersal in the western Atlantic. Specifically, in 1492, [[Pedro Alonso Ni\u00f1o]], an African-Spanish seafarer, was recorded as piloting one of Columbus' ships. He returned in 1499, but did not settle. In the early 16th century, more Africans began to enter the population of the Spanish Caribbean colonies, sometimes arriving as free men of mixed ancestry or as indentured servants, but increasingly as [[Slavery in the Americas|enslaved]] workers and servants. This increasing demand for African labour in the Caribbean was in part the result of massive depopulation of the native [[Taino]] and other indigenous peoples caused by the new [[infectious diseases]], harsh conditions, and warfare brought by European colonists. By the mid-16th century, the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] from [[West Africa]] to the Caribbean was so profitable that [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] were prepared to engage in piracy as well as break Spanish colonial laws, in order to forcibly transport approximately 1500 enslaved people from [[Sierra Leone]] to [[San Domingo]] (modern-day [[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]]).<ref>{{Google books|3ukDAAAAMAAJ| ''Some Historical Account of Guinea: With an Inquiry into the Rise and Progress of the Slave Trade|page=48}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, European colonial development in the Caribbean became increasingly reliant on plantation slavery to cultivate and process the lucrative commodity crop of [[sugarcane]]. On many islands shortly before the end of the 18th century, the enslaved Afro-Caribbeans greatly outnumbered their European masters. In addition, there developed a class of [[free people of color]], especially in the French islands, where persons of mixed race were given certain rights.<ref>Stephen D. Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research]], [[Harvard University]]. Based on \"records for 27,233 voyages that set out to obtain slaves for the Americas\". {{cite book |last=Stephen Behrendt |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-00071-5 |chapter=Transatlantic Slave Trade |quote= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/africanaencyclop00appi }}</ref> On [[Saint-Domingue]], free people of color and slaves rebelled against harsh conditions, and constant inter-imperial warfare. Inspired by French revolutionary sentiments that at one point freed the slaves, [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and [[Jean Jacques Dessalines]] led the [[Haitian Revolution]] that gained the independence of [[Haiti]] in 1804, the first Afro-Caribbean republic in the [[Western Hemisphere]].\n\n===19th\u201320th centuries===\nIn 1804, Haiti, with its overwhelmingly African population and leadership, became the second nation in the Americas to win independence from a European state. During the 19th century, continuous waves of rebellion, such as the [[Baptist War]], led by [[Sam Sharpe]] in Jamaica, created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region by various colonial powers. Great Britain abolished slavery in its holdings in 1834. [[Cuba]] was the last island to be emancipated, when Spain abolished slavery in its colonies.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people, who were a majority in many Caribbean societies, began to assert their cultural, economic, and political rights with more vigor on the world stage. [[Marcus Garvey]] was among many influential immigrants to the United States from Jamaica, expanding his [[UNIA]] movement in [[New York City]] and the U.S.<ref>Martin, Tony. ''Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggle of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association''. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976.</ref>  Afro-Caribbeans were influential in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] as artists and writers. [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] developed a [[n\u00e9gritude]] movement.\n\nIn the 1960s, the West Indian territories were given their political independence from [[British Empire|British colonial rule]]. They were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as [[reggae music]], [[Calypso music|calypso]] and [[rastafari]]anism within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a developing Afro-Caribbean diaspora in the United States, including such figures as [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]], was influential in the development of the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1960s and the [[hip-hop]] movement of the 1980s. African-Caribbean individuals also contributed to cultural developments in Europe, as evidenced by influential theorists such as [[Frantz Fanon]]<ref>Nigel C.

The earlier railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines by 1907. Pneumatic sliding doors were introduced on tube trains in 1919 and sub-surface trains in the late 1930s. Until the early 1960s an electric locomotive was exchanged for a steam locomotive on [[Metropolitan line]] services beyond Rickmansworth. The [[Victoria line]] opened in the late 1960s using [[automatic train operation]] (ATO), and the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|last trains]] ran with a [[Conductor (transportation)#Train guard|guard]] in 2000. {{As of|2013|3}} the Central, Jubilee, and Northern lines also use forms of ATO, the latter two using a system called TBTC ([[Communication-based train control|transmission-based train control]]).\n\nThe older sub-surface trains were replaced between 2010 and 2017 by new air-conditioned [[London Underground S Stock|S Stock]], and the replacement of trains on the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines is under consideration.\n\n==Current stock==\n[[File:Acton Town tube station MMB 03 D Stock 1973 Stock.jpg|thumb|A deep-tube [[Piccadilly line]] [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] train (right) arrive, and a sub-surface [[District line]] [[London Underground D78 Stock|D78 Stock]] train (left) just leaving, at [[Acton Town tube station|Acton Town Underground station]].]]\n\nLondon Underground trains come in two sizes, larger sub-surface trains and smaller deep-tube trains.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1612.aspx |title= Rolling Stock |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> Since the early 1960s all passenger trains have been [[electric multiple units]] (EMUs) with sliding doors,{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=159}} and a train last ran with a guard in 2000.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=205}} All lines use fixed-length trains with between six and eight cars, except for the Waterloo & City line, which uses four cars.<ref name=\"RSData\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231025/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/foi/Rolling_stock_Data_Sheet_2nd_Edition.pdf |title=Rolling Stock Data Sheet |publisher=Transport for London |date=March 2007 |archivedate=4 October 2013 |url=//www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/foi/Rolling_stock_Data_Sheet_2nd_Edition.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> New trains are designed for maximum number of standing passengers and for speed of access to the cars, and have [[regenerative braking]] and public address systems.<ref name=\"Connor\">{{cite news |title= Deep tube transformation |last=Connor |first=Piers |work=[[Modern Railways]] |date=January 2013 |pages=44\u201347}}</ref>\n\nSince 1999 all new stock has had to comply with accessibility regulations that require such things as access and room for wheelchairs, and the size and location of door controls.

Ten were built in 1905, and these operated in pairs, initially used to haul [[London and North Western Railway]] passenger trains on their [[Outer Circle (London)|Outer Circle]] route between Earl's Court and Mansion House.

The first order was only for motor cars; half had Westinghouse brakes, Metro-Vickers control systems and four MV153 motors; they replaced the motor cars working with bogie stock trailers. The rest of the motor cars had the same motor equipment but used vacuum brakes, and worked with converted 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to form 'MV' units. In 1929, 'MW' stock was ordered, 30 motor coaches and 25 trailers similar to the 'MV' units, but with Westinghouse brakes. A further batch of 'MW' stock was ordered in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-coach trains, and included additional trailers to increase the length of the previous 'MW' batch trains to 8-coaches.

With limited resources, 89 cars to the same design as the 1938 Stock ([[London Underground 1949 Stock|1949 Stock]]) were ordered and the pre-war streamlined prototypes were rebuilt.

However, in 1970 the service on the Northern line was poor with up to 40 services a day being cancelled due it part to its aging 1938 Stock and also the poor [[industrial relations]] at that time at Acton Works.

The Jubilee line would need 33 trains and a second order of 1972 Stock, known as Mk II, was ordered.

The trains come in two sizes, [[London Underground infrastructure#Subsurface versus deep-level tube lines|smaller deep-tube trains]] and larger sub-surface trains that are of a similar size to those on British main lines. New trains are designed for the maximum number of [[standing passenger]]s and for speed of access to the cars.\n\nServices started in 1863 when the [[Metropolitan Railway]] opened using [[steam locomotive]]s hauling gas-lit wooden carriages, braked from guards' compartment. In 1890, the first tube railway opened, using electric locomotives hauling carriages with small windows, nicknamed \"[[padded cell]]s\". Other tube railways opened in the early 20th century using electric multiple units known as gate stock, as access to them was via lattice gates at each end of the car. The earlier railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines by 1907. Pneumatic sliding doors were introduced on tube trains in 1919 and sub-surface trains in the late 1930s. Until the early 1960s an electric locomotive was exchanged for a steam locomotive on [[Metropolitan line]] services beyond Rickmansworth. The [[Victoria line]] opened in the late 1960s using [[automatic train operation]] (ATO), and the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|last trains]] ran with a [[Conductor (transportation)#Train guard|guard]] in 2000. {{As of|2013|3}} the Central, Jubilee, and Northern lines also use forms of ATO, the latter two using a system called TBTC ([[Communication-based train control|transmission-based train control]]).\n\nThe older sub-surface trains were replaced between 2010 and 2017 by new air-conditioned [[London Underground S Stock|S Stock]], and the replacement of trains on the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines is under consideration.\n\n==Current stock==\n[[File:Acton Town tube station MMB 03 D Stock 1973 Stock.jpg|thumb|A deep-tube [[Piccadilly line]] [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] train (right) arrive, and a sub-surface [[District line]] [[London Underground D78 Stock|D78 Stock]] train (left) just leaving, at [[Acton Town tube station|Acton Town Underground station]].]]\n\nLondon Underground trains come in two sizes, larger sub-surface trains and smaller deep-tube trains.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1612.aspx |title= Rolling Stock |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> Since the early 1960s all passenger trains have been [[electric multiple units]] (EMUs) with sliding doors,{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=159}} and a train last ran with a guard in 2000.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=205}} All lines use fixed-length trains with between six and eight cars, except for the Waterloo & City line, which uses four cars.<ref name=\"RSData\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231025/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/foi/Rolling_stock_Data_Sheet_2nd_Edition.pdf |title=Rolling Stock Data Sheet |publisher=Transport for London |date=March 2007 |archivedate=4 October 2013 |url=//www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/foi/Rolling_stock_Data_Sheet_2nd_Edition.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> New trains are designed for maximum number of standing passengers and for speed of access to the cars, and have [[regenerative braking]] and public address systems.<ref name=\"Connor\">{{cite news |title= Deep tube transformation |last=Connor |first=Piers |work=[[Modern Railways]] |date=January 2013 |pages=44\u201347}}</ref>\n\nSince 1999 all new stock has had to comply with accessibility regulations that require such things as access and room for wheelchairs, and the size and location of door controls.

These started work on circle services, including the new electric service to New Cross via the ELR. {{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=64}} In 1921, 20 motor cars, 33 trailers and 6 first class driving trailers were received with three pairs of double sliding doors on each side. These were introduced on circle services.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=71}}\n\nBetween 1927 and 1933 multiple unit compartment stock was built in batches by the [[Metro Cammell|Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon]] and [[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company|Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Co.]] companies to be used on electric services from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth. The first order was only for motor cars; half had Westinghouse brakes, Metro-Vickers control systems and four MV153 motors; they replaced the motor cars working with bogie stock trailers. The rest of the motor cars had the same motor equipment but used vacuum brakes, and worked with converted 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to form 'MV' units. In 1929, 'MW' stock was ordered, 30 motor coaches and 25 trailers similar to the 'MV' units, but with Westinghouse brakes. A further batch of 'MW' stock was ordered in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-coach trains, and included additional trailers to increase the length of the previous 'MW' batch trains to 8-coaches. These had [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] WT545 motors, and although designed to work in multiple with the MV153, this did not work well in practice.\n{{-}}\n\n====London Passenger Transport Board====\nIn 1933 the Metropolitan and District railways were merged with the other underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LTPB). In 1934 ninety former Metropolitan Railway cars were refurbished to form the [[London Underground Circle Stock|Circle Stock]]. Although most of these cars were made in 1921, some were older. The motors were replaced and the cars were repainted a red and cream.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=76}} Serving the Metropolitan main line there were three incompatible types of multiple unit compartment stock that had been built in 1927\u201333, and these were assembled into 9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;8-car and 10&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6-car trains after Westinghouse brakes were fitted and some cars regeared.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=72\u201374}} The LPTB, continuing the District Railway multiple unt classification system{{sfn|Horne|2006|p=63}} labelled these [[London Underground T Stock|T Stock]].{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=72\u201374}} In 1932 the District Railway to Upminster had been electrified and new vehicles bought.

A combination of 3-car units and 2-car units to run in six and eight car trains were delivered from July 1939. Two trailers were included in an eight car formation, but these were designed to allow conversion to motor cars at a later date after improvements to the power supply.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nAfter World War II [[London Underground R Stock|R Stock]], composed of new cars and the Q Stock trailers that had been built in 1938, replaced the trains with hand-operated sliding doors that remained on the District line.{{sfn|Horne|2006|pp=74\u201375}} The new trains were built between 1949 and 1959,{{sfn|Horne|2006|p=75}} and after 1952 trains were constructed from aluminium, saving weight. One train was left unpainted as an experiment and considered a success, so between 1963\u201368 trains were left unpainted or painted white or grey to match.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=100\u2013101}} A number of former District Railway F Stock became available for use on the Metropolitan line. These mainly worked the semi-fast Harrow and Uxbridge services, although they also ran on the East London line as modified four-car sets.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=78\u201381}} This transfer allowed the Circle Stock to be replaced by 5-car trains of O and P Stock.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=94}} After 1955 the traction control equipment was replaced on these trains and the cars relabelled CO and CP stock as appropriate.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=94}}\n\nWhen the Amersham electrification project commenced in 1959, London Transport placed an order  for 248 cars of [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|A60 stock]] to replace the T stock and remaining locomotive hauled trains. A further twenty-seven trains of the A62 stock were built in 1962\u201363 to replace the F and P stock trains on the Uxbridge service. These were arranged as 4-car units which could operate as four or eight car trains.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=110}}\nFour car units operated on the Chesham shuttle and, from 1977, on the East London railway.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=113}} The transfer of CO/CP Stock from the Metropolitan to the District line in the early 1960s allowed some of the Q stock to be scrapped.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=97}} In 1968 an order was placed for 35 six car trains to replace the CO/CP Stock on the Hammersmith & City and Circle lines.

Seating was mostly longitudinal for 48 passengers and straps were provided for those standing.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=38}} The [[Great Northern & City Railway]] was a built to take main line trains from the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) at [[Finsbury Park station|Finsbury Park]] to the City at a terminus at Moorgate. However the GNR refused permission for trains to use its Finsbury Park station, so platforms were built beneath the station instead.{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=23\u201324}} Public service on the line began in 1904, using larger electric multiple units with control equipment supplied by [[British Thomson-Houston]].{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=48\u201350}}\n\nThe [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] (UERL) had been established in April 1902 by the American [[Charles Yerkes]] to build and run three cross-London tube lines:{{sfn|Green|1987|p=30}} the [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway]] (now part of the [[Northern line]]), [[Baker Street and Waterloo Railway]] ([[Bakerloo line]]) and the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway]] ([[Piccadilly line]]). A power station capable of providing power for these tube lines was built at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek.{{sfn|Horne|2006|p=40}} Similar electric multiple units were purchased for the three lines, controversially from America, France and Hungary,{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=91, 97}} and known as \"[[London Underground Gate Stock|Gate Stock]]\", as access to the cars was via lattice gates at each end.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=32}} Motor cars, trailers and control trailers were coupled to make a train of two to six cars, with the motor cars positioned at the outer ends. These had full width control compartments behind the driver and seated about 40, whereas the trailers seated about 50.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=91\u201395}} A gateman operated the lattice gates using a crank handle and announced each station as the train approached. A bell rung by the rear guard when all gates were closed was echoed down the train by each gateman until the front guard signalled the driver to proceed.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=95}}\n\nMore trains were bought in 1914 for the Bakerloo line extension to Paddington. To speed up boarding these cars had inward swinging centre doors that were under the control of the gatemen.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=116}} From 1915 the Bakerloo was extended to a junction with the [[London & North Western Railway]] (LNWR) at [[Queen's Park (London) station|Queens Park]] and because of the difficulties of [[World War I]], cars were transferred from the Piccadilly line.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=126\u2013127}} From 1917 tube trains ran through to {{rws|Watford Junction}} using Central London Railway motor cars that had been built for an uncompleted extension to Ealing.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=128\u2013129}} These returned in 1920 when the extension opened and the [[London Underground Watford Joint Stock|Watford Joint Stock]], two thirds owned by the LNWR, arrived. Four and six car trains were formed, a motor car permitted in the middle of a tube train as there was an emergency passage through the control compartment. Access was by three single inwardly swinging doors on either side of the cars.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=161}} Cars with sliding pneumatic doors were ordered in 1919 for the Piccadilly line. No gatesmen were needed and these trains were staffed by a driver and two guards. An open door was first indicated by a semaphore arm, but these were easily damaged, and by 1923 interlock switches proving the doors were closed were introduced.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\n====Standard Stock====\n[[File:Hendon Central station, underground railway above ground (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|Three car Standard Stock train at Hendon Central on today's Northern line|thumb]]\n[[File:London Underground tube coach (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|Longitudinal seating inside the motor car|thumb]]\n{{main|London Underground Standard Stock}}\nThere were major extensions of the City & South London and the Hampstead lines in the 1920s. The tunnels of the City & South London Railway were rebuilt to have the same diameter of the other tubes, and extended north to a junction with the Hampstead line at Camden Town, and south to Morden. The Hampstead line was extended to Edgware and south to another junction with the City & South London at Kennington, this opening in 1926.{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=36\u201337}} New stock was required to run on the rebuilt City & South London and extensions so in 1922 six prototype cars were ordered from five manufacturers. With attention given to noise reduction, there were two {{convert|4|ft|6|in|adj=on}} pneumatic doors on each side of the trailers.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=164}} From this development work a total of 1460 cars of Standard Stock would be built by six manufacturers in 18 batches between 1923 and 1934.{{sfn|Bruce|1988|p=127}} Production cars were first ordered in 1923, and the Hampstead line received the first of these later in the same year. Motor cars had a control compartment with a central gangway over the motored bogie and seated 30. The trailers seated 48 and the control trailers 44, with transverse and longitudinal seating. Initially trains had a crew of three, a driver and two guards. In 1928, once the use of air-operated doors had proved to be successful, modifications were made to enable a train to be operated by a crew of two.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=109}}\n\nBetween 1926 and 1928, the Central London cars were converted to air-door operation{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=106\u2013107}} and it had been planned to convert the Gate Stock on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. However, cost of building a new car was calculated as only slightly more than the cost of converting an old one, and so an order for new cars was placed. Delivered in 1929 and 1930, these vehicles enabled Gate Stock to be withdrawn from the Piccadilly line in June 1929, and the last gate stock train ran on 1 January 1930.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=108}} After 1929 the design was slightly altered with longer cars with wider doors and additional single-leaf doors on the trailers and electro-pneumatic brakes. Trains to this design were bought in 1931 and 1934 for the extensions of the Piccadilly line to South Harrow and Uxbridge, Hounslow and Cockfosters.{{sfn|Bruce|1988|pp=63\u201364}}\n\n====London Passenger Transport Board====\nThe merger of London's underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board (LTPB){{sfn|Green|1987|p=46}} was followed by the 1935\u201340 [[New Works Programme]] that included extension of the Bakerloo, Central and Northern lines.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=116}} New trains would be needed and [[London Underground 1935 Stock|four prototype six-car trains]] were built, three with streamlined cabs. Modern electrical equipment was fitted under the floor, removing the need for a control compartment on the motor cars, increasing the number of seats to 40.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=120\u2013121}} [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 Stock]], without the streamlining, entered service on the Northern line in June 1938. A seven train was formed from two trailer cars and five motor cars, one of which had no cab,{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=124}} the increased power giving greater acceleration.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=258}} Eventually a total of 1121 cars were built.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=126}} By 1938 the Central line had been converted from the original 3-rail to the 4-rail system, the tunnels enlarged and platforms lengthened to take 8-car trains of the displaced Standard Stock, the last Central London Railway train running in 1939.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=247\u2013248}} In the same year Standard Stock replaced the 1904 Gate Stock on the isolated Northern City Line.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=131}} The Bakerloo line also received some 1938 Stock, these running with some converted trailers of Standard Stock.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=126}} The Central line extensions were suspended during World War II and many Standard Stock cars were placed in store.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=262}} These cars were in a poor state after the war and extensive refurbishment was needed when the extensions had been completed.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=313}} After the war more trains were needed. With limited resources, 89 cars to the same design as the 1938 Stock ([[London Underground 1949 Stock|1949 Stock]]) were ordered and the pre-war streamlined prototypes were rebuilt. These were introduced on the Piccadilly line, releasing some Standard Stock to augment the trains on the Central line.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=313\u2013314}}\n\n[[File:Barons Court Station - geograph.org.uk - 1762897.jpg|An unpainted aluminium 1959 Stock train on the Piccadilly line at Barons Court|thumb|left]]\n\nThree prototype aluminium-bodied seven-car trains were ordered in 1956, to be followed by 76&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7-car trains of [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]]. It was planned that these would be introduced on the Piccadilly line, allowing the later Standard Stock cars to be transferred to the Central line.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=318}} However the Central line's Standard Stock was proving troublesome and the trains were diverted to replace these trains, augmented with an extra car. A follow on order of [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]], as it became known, entered service on the Central line, releasing the 1959 Stock for the Piccadilly line. Standard Stock was withdrawn from the Central line in 1963 and Piccadilly line in 1964.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=320}} The [[Victoria line]] had been recommended in a 1949 report as it would reduce congestion on other lines.{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=58\u201359}} New trains were needed for the new line, and eight-car trains made up from two four-car units with two driving motors and two trailers were ordered in 1964.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=335}} Trials of [[Automatic Train Operation]] (ATO) were carried out on the District line in 1962\u201363, followed by longer term operation on the Central line on a shuttle service between [[Woodford tube station|Woodford]] and [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]].{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=336}} Successful, the Victoria line its [[London Underground 1967 Stock|1967 Stock]] was equipped, and as the new trains arrived they spent three weeks between working Woodford and Hainault.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=338}} The line opened to Victoria in stages in 1968\u201369 and extended to Brixton in 1971.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=59}}\n\nIn the 1970s the Piccadilly line was extended to [[Heathrow Airport]] and the [[Jubilee line]] was built under central London, taking over the Bakerloo line's Stanmore branch at Baker Street.{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=62\u201363}} Also the isolated Northern City line was connected with the suburban railway at Finsbury Park.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=55}} The Standard Stock trains had been replaced by 1938 Stock in 1966,{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=164}} and this last ran in the tunnels in 1975.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=175}} A through main line service started in 1976 and the line transferred to British Rail.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=55}} A new fleet of trains was to be built for the Piccadilly line, and its 1956\u201359 Stock was to replace the 1938 Stock trains elsewhere on the system. However, in 1970 the service on the Northern line was poor with up to 40 services a day being cancelled due it part to its aging 1938 Stock and also the poor [[industrial relations]] at that time at Acton Works. The Northern line urgently needed newer trains and 30 more than would be available from the Piccadilly line.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=403\u2013404}} The first batch of [[London Underground 1972 Stock|1972 Stock]] (known afterwards as Mk I stock) was ordered to fill this shortfall. Rapidly designed, this was the 1967 stock design adapted for operation with a driver and guard, entering service on the Northern line between 1972 and 1973. The Jubilee line would need 33 trains and a second order of 1972 Stock, known as Mk II, was ordered. Entering service on the Northern line between 1973 and 1974, these differed from the Mk Is as it was planned to convert the line to ATO.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=404\u2013405}} These were transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1977, and when the Jubilee line opened in 1979 it used the 1972 Mk II stock while the Bakerloo line had 36 trains of refurbished 1938 stock.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=406}} The [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] ordered for the Piccadilly line was a new design. Instead of seven cars, the trains were composed of six cars, each about {{convert|6|ft}} longer than the 1959 Stock cars. This allowed a symmetrical train with fewer cars and bogies.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=407}} Space for luggage for passengers connecting with flights at Heathrow was left beside the doors, leaving 44 seats in each car.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=408\u2013409}}\n[[File:Ltmd-1983ts-interior.jpg|thumb|Inside 1983 Stock as used on the Jubilee line]]\nEstimating that the remaining 1938 Stock needed replacement by 1984, London Transport proposed in 1979 to build 33 trains for the Jubilee line, releasing its trains for use elsewhere on the system. After some negotiation 15 trains were ordered with an option for a further 13. The resulting [[London Underground 1983 Stock|1983 Stock]] was a development of the 1973 Stock, with six of the longer {{convert|58|ft}} cars, but with single leaf doors, similar to the D Stock that had been introduced on the District line.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=415\u2013418}}  Trains entered service between 1983 and 1985, with each new delivery triggering a cascade with a 1972 Mk II moving to the Northern line, replacing a 1959 Stock that moved to the Bakerloo line allowing a 1938 Stock train to be scrapped. In 1986 passenger numbers were increasing and a further {{fract|16|1|2}} trains of 1983 Stock were ordered, and these entered service in 1987\u201388.{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=418}} After agreement about One Person Operation (OPO) was reached with the trade unions in 1983, work began converting trains and lines.

Carried out from 1970 to 1971, during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974). The objectives of the campaign were to close down FRELIMO's infiltration routes across the [[Tanzania]]n border and to destroy permanent FRELIMO bases inside the liberated zones in Northern Mozambique. Gordian Knot was a seven-month long campaign ultimately employing thirty-five thousand men, and was almost successful since it destroyed most guerrilla camps located inside FRELIMO's liberated zones and captured large numbers of rebels and armaments, forcing [[FRELIMO]] to retreat from their bases and outposts in the provinces.<ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOLnKr1r-6o&NR Parte 2 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auHKkWJpAvE&NR Parte 3 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY16N1qE1sk Parte 4 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSfWaY5vqvI&NR Parte 5 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDXfU7h1t6w Parte 6 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref> The operation ultimately failed when FRELIMO forces regrouped and thrust further south into the province of Tete, opening a new front and overstretching the Portuguese Army. The failure of Gordian Knot helped fuel the discontent that led to the [[Carnation Revolution]] in April 1974.\n\n==Background==\n===Independentist guerrilla===\nThe [[communist]]-inspired, independent-seeking guerillas of ([[FRELIMO]]) soon realised the difficulties they would encounter in militarily defeating the [[NATO]]-backed Portuguese forces on the open battlefield and for this reason FRELIMO took on a strategy that was relatively unique. With no real working class or Mozambican military to isolate from the Portuguese regime and ultimately from which to gain support as in the case of a typical [[Marxist-Leninist]] strategy, FRELIMO's military adopted a [[Maoist]] strategy. The Maoist insurgency is typically three-staged:\n\n*The '''First Stage''' was to create networks of guerrilla political/progaganda groups to win popular support and to train terrorist teams to intimidate sections of the population which may be hesitant to support the insurgency or which support the targeted government outright. The intent is to neutralize any area of the population which will not support the insurgency at the outset and to organize the areas of the population which will provide support.\n*The '''Second Stage''' (or open guerrilla warfare) began with armed resistance by small bands of guerrillas operating in rural areas where terrain is rugged and government control is weak. Initially, this stage is characterised by low level hit-and-run tactics designed to highlight the strength and organization of the insurgent movement and expose the weaknesses of the government. As more of the population is won over to the insurgency, the magnitude of the armed resistance and guerrilla warfare is increased to include greater segments of the countryside and more lucrative targets. The rate of increase in the guerrilla effort is dictated solely by the response of the government. If the government responds in a forceful, well-organized fashion, the insurgency may remain in an early stage two mode of operation for a prolonged period of time or may even revert to stage one. The intent of stage two, however, is to continue to gather popular support and gain control of the countryside, isolating government forces in small areas, mainly urban, and making them pay a heavy price when they venture into guerrilla-controlled areas.\n*The '''Third Stage''' of a Maoist insurgency is the evolution of the insurgency into an open civil war, where the guerrilla forces take on the appearance of a [[regular army]] and [[conventional warfare]] is more predominant. The intent here is to openly defeat and displace the existing government authority if it has not already come apart from within.\n\nThis was the strategy [[FRELIMO]] adopted from the outset with a notable exception. FRELIMO had not yet moved to the third stage of the [[Maoist]] strategy by 1970. The Portuguese had held relative military supremacy during the course of the liberation struggle but struggled to win the support of the majority of the population outside the major cities and towns, where settlers and colonial authorities had firmly established themselves.\n\n===Arrival of Brigadier General Ka\u00falza de Arriaga===\nIn March 1970, a new commander for Portuguese forces in the Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]] was appointed. Brigadier General [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] had studied the Mozambican theater from a position on the staff of the Institute of Higher Military Studies in [[Lisbon]] and had served as commander of ground forces in Mozambique for eight months prior to assignment as overall commander. He possessed definite ideas on the conduct of the war in Mozambique which were reinforced by a visit to the [[United States]] for consultations with General [[William Westmoreland]] concerning American tactics in [[Vietnam]]. Arriaga insisted on the deployment of aircraft to support ground operations, particularly helicopter gunships. He initiated large scale \"search-and-destroy\" missions. He also requested a further increase of troops and materiel. Bolstered with three thousand additional Portuguese soldiers, Arriaga launched the largest offensive campaign of the Portuguese Colonial War - Operation Gordian Knot (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00f3 G\u00f3rdio'').\n\n==The operation==\n[[File:Buscadearmadilhas.jpg|left|thumb|Portuguese soldiers on patrol.]]\nThe objectives of the campaign were to seal off the infiltration routes across the [[Tanzania]]n border and to destroy permanent guerrilla bases. \"Gordian Knot\" was a seven-month campaign employing ultimately thirty-five thousand men, and was almost successful. The brunt of the effort was in the [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]], in the extreme north of [[Mozambique]] on the border with guerrilla sympathizer, Tanzania. Tactics consisted of lightning quick airborne assaults on small camps. Continual [[artillery]] and aviation bombardment rained down on larger targets, while bulldozer-guided, motorized armies converged. These tactics were effective and Arriaga pursued the guerrillas relentlessly. However, the exertions of \"Gordian Knot\" could not be continued indefinitely.\n\nThe Portuguese had excellent coordination between [[light bombers]], [[helicopters]] and reinforced ground patrols. They used the American tactics of quick airborne (heliborne) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the [[Portuguese Air Force]] (For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea Portuguesa or FAP) to surround and eliminate the guerrillas. These bombardments were accompanied by the use of [[heavy artillery]]. The Portuguese also used mounted cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult for motor transport, while units of captured or deserted guerrillas were employed to penetrate their former bases.\n\nHowever, as the number of guerrillas killed and captured increased, so did the number of Portuguese casualties. The politicians in Lisbon{{mdash}}the [[metropole]]{{mdash}}, although dissatisfied with the success of the counterinsurgency until Arriaga's assumption of command, had been content with the relatively low casualty figures. As casualty rates continued to climb during \"Gordian Knot\", their early pleasure with the improving tactical operations diminished. Political meddling in the conduct of the war occurred with increasing frequency.<ref>Thomas H. Henriksen, Revolution and Counterrevolution, (London: Greenwood Press, 1983), p. 49.</ref>\n\nThough \"Gordian Knot\" had been the most successful campaign of the counterinsurgency, it had not delivered the ultimate victory desired by Arriaga - for several reasons.  The first, noted above, was political \"queasiness\" with the increased casualty rates and subsequent meddling in the operation itself. The second was the onset of the rainy season in November which proved to be longer than usual and subsequently gave the guerrillas more than enough time to partially recover. The third was the simple fact that Arriaga had to mass all of the Portuguese forces in Mozambique to pursue the campaign in the extreme northern provinces in the hopes of a relatively quick but decisive victory. [[FRELIMO]] realized this and reacted by dispersing into the jungle, prolonging the campaign and trying to consume Portuguese resources. Simultaneously, guerrillas increased operations in other provinces, left sparsely guarded by Portuguese troops, but with no success. A Portuguese communique issued in late January, 1971, acknowledged that, in spite of the massive operation, not all military objectives had been realised.\n\nThe Portuguese eventually reported that 651 guerrillas were killed and another 1,840 were captured, for the loss of 132 Portuguese troops. Arriaga claimed that his troops had destroyed 61 guerrilla bases and 165 guerrilla camps, while 40 tons of ammunition had been captured in the first two months of the operation.\n\n==Aftermath==\nArriaga, whether disillusioned by \"Gordian Knot\" or restrained by Lisbon due to budgetary issues, shifted from extended conventional sweeps to small unit actions deploying black and white [[shock troops]]. By this time, half of the Portuguese troops on the field were conscripted black Africans from Mozambique. By 1972, the situation had deteriorated with the Portuguese forces operating out of traditionally secluded strongholds inside FRELIMO liberated zones and controlled areas. The violence and brutality of Portuguese actions against the population of the countryside were increasing along with various massacres against civilians. The Portuguese stepped up new defensive tactics, herding civilians into villages and trying to ensure the population was not reachable by FRELIMO. The Portuguese regime subsequently changed its message from \"destroying FRELIMO\" to \"bringing the situation under control.\" \n\nDespite the initial Portuguese military success, the number of monthly casualties never declined to zero. FRELIMO continued to cross the border to maintain links with the local population and opened a new front in the Province of Tete near the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam by rerouting their forces through Zambia. As the liberation struggle continued on, the Portuguese regime continued to commit horrific atrocities, the most infamous of which was the massacre at Wiriyamu, a village which had been classified as collaborating with FRELIMO by the [[PIDE/DGS]]. The incident itself was not brought to the attention of the rest of the world until nearly a year later, in July 1973, by a Dominican priest who witnessed the massacre. It was at first denied, then contested, investigated and again denied by the Portuguese authorities of the Estado Novo. Though full details of the entire episode are still not known, a large number of innocent civilians were slaughtered by a group of Portuguese soldiers during a planned operation (Operation Marosca) to attack an alleged guerrilla base. The [[PIDE/DGS]] agent who guided the soldiers told them explicitly that the orders were to \"kill everyone\", despite only civilians having been found in the village and there being no signs of FRELIMO activity. This agent, Chico Kavachi, was later murdered before he could be interviewed in an investigation ordered by the Portuguese government after the massacre became public in July 1973.<ref>Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Afonso, Aniceto. Os anos da Guerra Colonial - Wiriyamu, De Mo\u00e7ambique para o mundo. Lisboa, 2010</ref> Some historians speculate that the DGS wanted to deliberately create an embarrassment for the government, so as to get rid of Ka\u00falza de Arriaga, whom they considered an incompetent general.\n\n===Long-term effect===\nLater counter-claims, probably at the behest of the Portuguese government, have been made in a report of the Archbishop of Dar es Salaam [[Laureaen Rugambwa]] that the killings were carried out by FRELIMO combatants, not Portuguese forces.<ref>Arslan Humbarachi & Nicole Muchnik, ''Portugal's African Wars'', N.Y., 1974.</ref> In addition, others claimed that the alleged massacres by Portuguese military forces were fabricated to tar the reputation of the Portuguese state abroad.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html Adrian Hastings], [[The Daily Telegraph]] (June 26, 2001)</ref> But the exposure of the Wiriyamu massacre brought with it the exposure of numerous other massacres on a smaller scale and increased worldwide (particularly Third World) condemnation of Portugal. During 1973 and early 1974, the situation continued to worsen for the Portuguese. FRELIMO continued to advance further into Portuguese-controlled territory from fronts in Tete and Cabo Delgado. The civilian authorities in Lisbon, embarrassed by the atrocities and massacres exposed, had lost a great amount of confidence in military solutions and were encouraging the expansion of operations by [[PIDE]].<ref>Adrian Hastings, Wiriyamu, (London: Search Press, 1974)</ref> PIDE's paramilitary endeavours were viewed as excessively brutal and counterproductive by the leaders of the military, and disagreement on the proper role of the secret police in combating the insurgency widened the rift between the central government and the military leadership and helped fuel the discontent and disillusionment within the Armed Forces.\n\nWhen the [[Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas]] (MFA) seized control of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|the government in Lisbon]] on 25 April 1974, an event known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], the Portuguese position in Mozambique all but collapsed.\n\nGeneral [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]], head of the new government and a former commander of counter-independence forces in other Portuguese territories in Africa, manoeuvred to maintain some control over the destiny of the Mozambican people by calling for a cease-fire and Portuguese sponsored elections. However, FRELIMO, sensing victory, refused to allow Sp\u00ednola to impose a neocolonialist solution on Mozambique.\n\nFRELIMO announced the opening of a new front in [[Zambezia Province|Zambezia]] and poured guerrillas into the central regions of the country, advancing further south. The Spinola government countered by ordering northern outposts abandoned and the concentration of troops in the southern regions, by handing out arms to rural settlers, and by ordering<ref>F. X. Maier, Revolution and Terrorism in Mozambique, (New York: American Affairs Association Inc., 1974), p. 24. & Thomas H. Henriksen, Revolution and Counterrevolution, (London: Greenwood Press, 1983), p. 57.</ref> an increase in bombing attacks on guerrilla-controlled territories. These measures were intended to support the Portuguese position at the negotiating table. However, the Portuguese troops fighting in Mozambique realised that the coup in Lisbon, the change of regime and the opening of negotiations with FRELIMO were a prelude to withdrawal. Instead of engaging FRELIMO, many refused to continue risking their lives and enacted local ceasefires and surrenders. By mid-summer 1974, an undeclared truce prevailed, since the bulk of the Portuguese army would not leave their barracks and refused to fight. On 8 September 1974, an accord was signed formalising the cease-fire. The agreement called for a transitional government with full independence for Mozambique to be granted on 25 June 1975 - the thirteenth anniversary of FRELIMO. The [[Portuguese Colonial War]] had ended, but the newly independent territories of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] would enter a period of chaos and devastating [[civil war]]s ([[Angolan Civil War]] and [[Mozambican Civil War]]) which lasted several decades and claimed millions of lives and refugees.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n==See also==\n*[[Operation Green Sea]]\n*[[Frente Leste]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1970]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1971]]\n[[Category:History of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Military operations involving Portugal]]\n[[Category:1970 in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Mozambican War of Independence]]\n[[Category:Portuguese Colonial War]]\n[[Category:July 1970 events in Africa]]\n[[Category:August 1970 events in Africa]]\n[[Category:Military operations post-1945]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Operation Gordian Knot\n| partof      = [[Mozambican War of Independence]]\n| image       =File:Msumbiji_Cabo_Delgado.PNG|thumb|left|400px|Provincial map\n| caption     =\n| date        =6 July 1970-January 1971\n| place       =[[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]\n| result      = Short-Term Portuguese Victory\n* Portuguese army seizes initiative in northern provinces.\n* FRELIMO re-organises and opens new southern front.\n| combatant1  ={{flag|Portugal}}\n| combatant2  ={{flagicon|Mozambique|1974}} [[FRELIMO]]\n| commander1  ={{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]]\n| commander2  ={{flagicon|Mozambique|1974}} [[Samora Machel]]<br>{{flagicon|Mozambique|1974}} [[Alberto Chipande]]\n| units1      ={{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Armed Forces|For\u00e7as Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese Army]]\n* [[Portuguese Navy]]\n* [[Portuguese Air Force]]\n| units2      = [[File:Flag of FPLM.svg|20px]] For\u00e7as Populares de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Mo\u00e7ambique\n| strength1   = 34,000-35,000 soldiers\n| strength2   = 9,000-11,000 guerillas\n| casualties1 =132 killed<br>82 wounded<br>15 vehicles destroyed/damaged\n| casualties2 =651 killed<br>1,840 captured<br>61 bases destroyed<br>165 camps and sanctuaries destroyed\n| casualties3 =4 civilians killed\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Mozambican War of Independence}}\n\n'''Operation Gordian Knot''' (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00f3 G\u00f3rdio'') was the largest and most expensive [[Portugal|Portuguese]] military campaign in the Portuguese overseas province of [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]], [[East Africa]]. Carried out from 1970 to 1971, during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974). The objectives of the campaign were to prevent FRELIMO's infiltration routes across the [[Tanzania]]n border and to destroy permanent FRELIMO bases inside the liberated zones in Northern Mozambique. Gordian Knot was a seven-month long campaign ultimately employing thirty-five thousand men, and was almost successful since it destroyed most guerrilla camps located inside FRELIMO's liberated zones and captured large numbers of rebels and armaments, forcing [[FRELIMO]] to retreat from their bases and outposts in the provinces.<ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOLnKr1r-6o&NR Parte 2 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auHKkWJpAvE&NR Parte 3 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY16N1qE1sk Parte 4 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSfWaY5vqvI&NR Parte 5 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt|en}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDXfU7h1t6w Parte 6 - Opera\u00e7\u00e3o \"N\u00d3-G\u00d3RDIO\"], [[RTPN]] ([[youtube.com]])</ref> The operation ultimately failed when FRELIMO forces regrouped and thrusted further south in the province of Tete, opening a new front and overstretching the Portuguese Army. The failure of Gordian Knot helped fuel the discontent that led to the [[Carnation Revolution]] in April 1974.\n\n==Background==\n===Independentist guerrilla===\nThe [[communist]]-inspired independentist guerrilla ([[FRELIMO]]), soon realised the difficulties they would encounter in militarily defeating the [[NATO]] backed Portuguese forces on the open battlefield and for this reason FRELIMO took on an strategy that was relatively unique. With no real working class or Mozambican military to isolate from the Portuguese regime and ultimately from which to gain support as in the case of a typical [[Marxist-Leninist]] strategy, FRELIMO's military adopted a [[Maoist]] strategy. The Maoist insurgency is typically three-staged:\n\n*The '''First Stage''' was to create networks of guerrilla political/progaganda groups to win popular support and to train terrorist teams to intimidate sections of the population which may be hesitant to support the insurgency or which support the targeted government outright. The intent is to neutralize any area of the population which will not support the insurgency at the outset and to organize the areas of the population which will provide support.\n*The '''Second Stage''' (or open guerrilla warfare), began with armed resistance by small bands of guerrillas operating in rural areas where terrain is rugged and government control is weak. Initially, this stage is characterised by low level hit and run tactics designed to highlight the strength and organization of the insurgent movement and expose the weaknesses of the government. As more of the population is won over to the insurgency the magnitude of the armed resistance and guerrilla warfare is increased to include greater segments of the countryside and more lucrative targets. The rate of increase in the guerrilla effort is dictated solely by the response of the government. If the government responds in a forceful, well-organized fashion, the insurgency may remain in an early stage two mode of operation for a prolonged period of time or may even revert to stage one. The intent of stage two, however, is to continue to gather popular support and gain control of the countryside, isolating government forces in small areas, mainly urban, and making them pay a heavy price when they venture into guerrilla controlled areas.\n*The '''Third Stage''' of a Maoist insurgency is the evolution of the insurgency into an open civil war, where the guerrilla forces take on the appearance of a [[regular army]] and [[conventional warfare]] is more predominant. The intent here is to openly defeat and displace the existing government authority if it has not already come apart from within.\n\nThis was the strategy [[FRELIMO]] adopted from the outset with a notable exception. FRELIMO had not yet moved to the third stage of the [[Maoist]] strategy by 1970. The Portuguese had held relative military supremacy during the course of the liberation struggle but struggled to win support of the majority of the population outside of the major cities and towns, where settlers and colonial authorities had firmly established themselves.\n\n===Arrival of Brigadier General Ka\u00falza de Arriaga===\nIn March 1970, during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] a new commander for Portuguese forces in the Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]] was appointed. Brigadier General [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] had studied the Mozambican theater from a position on the staff of the Institute of Higher Military Studies in [[Lisbon]] and had served as commander of ground forces in Mozambique for eight months prior to assignment as overall commander. He possessed definite ideas on the conduct of the war in Mozambique which were reinforced by a visit to the [[United States]] for consultations with General [[William Westmoreland]] concerning American tactics in [[Vietnam]]. Arriaga insisted on the deployment of aircraft to support ground operations, particularly helicopter gunships; and initiated large scale \"search-and-destroy\" missions. He also requested a further increase of troops and material. Bolstered with three thousand additional Portuguese soldiers, Arriaga launched the largest offensive campaign of the Portuguese Colonial War - Operation Gordian Knot (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00f3 G\u00f3rdio'').\n\n==The operation==\n[[File:Buscadearmadilhas.jpg|left|thumb|Portuguese soldiers on patrol.]]\nThe objectives of the campaign were to seal off the infiltration routes across the [[Tanzania]]n border and to destroy permanent guerrilla bases. \"Gordian Knot\" was a seven-month campaign employing ultimately thirty-five thousand men, and was almost successful. The brunt of the effort was in the [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]] district, in the northernmost area of [[Mozambique]], on the border with guerrilla sympathizer Tanzania. Tactics consisted of lightning quick airborne assaults on small camps. Continual [[artillery]] and aviation bombardment rained down on larger sites while bulldozer guided, motorized armies converged. These tactics were effective and Arriaga pursued the guerrillas relentlessly; however, the exertions of \"Gordian Knot\" could not be continued indefinitely.\n\nThe Portuguese had excellent coordination between [[light bombers]], [[helicopters]] and reinforced ground patrols. They utilised the American tactics of quick airborne (helibourne) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the [[Portuguese Air Force]] (For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea Portuguesa or FAP) to surround and eliminate the guerrillas. These bombardments were accompanied by the use of [[heavy artillery]]. The Portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult to motor transport, and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases.\n\nHowever, as the number of guerrilla killed and captured increased, so did the number of Portuguese casualties. The politicians in Lisbon{{mdash}}the [[metropole]]{{mdash}}although dissatisfied with the success of the counterinsurgency until Arriaga's assumption of command, had been content with the relatively low casualty figures. As casualty rates continued to climb during \"Gordian Knot\" their early pleasure with the improving tactical operations diminished.  Political meddling in the conduct of the war appeared with increasing frequency.<ref>Thomas H. Henriksen, Revolution and Counterrevolution, (London: Greenwood Press, 1983), p. 49.</ref>\n\nThough \"Gordian Knot\" had been the most successful campaign of the counterinsurgency it had not delivered the ultimate victory desired by Arriaga - for several reasons.  The first, noted above, was political \"queasiness\" with the increased casualty rates and subsequent meddling in the operation itself. The second was the onset of the rainy season in November which proved to be longer than usual and subsequently gave the guerrillas more than enough time to partially recover. The third was the simple fact that Arriaga had to mass all of the Portuguese forces in Mozambique to pursue the campaign in the extreme northern provinces in hopes of a relatively quick but decisive victory. [[FRELIMO]] realized this and reacted continually dispersed into the jungle, prolonging the campaign and trying to consume Portuguese resources. Simultaneously, guerrillas increased operations in other provinces, sparsely guarded by Portuguese troops, however, with no success. A Portuguese communique issued in late January, 1971, acknowledged that in spite of the massive operation, not all military objectives had been realised.\n\nThe Portuguese eventually reported that 651 guerrillas has been killed and another 1,840 guerrillas had been captured, for the loss of 132 Portuguese troops. Arriaga claimed his troops to have destroyed 61 guerrilla bases and 165 guerrilla camps, while 40 tons of ammunition had been captured in the first two months of the operation.\n\n==Aftermath==\nArriaga, whether disillusioned by \"Gordian Knot\" or restrained by Lisbon due to budgetary issues, shifted from extended conventional sweeps to small unit actions deploying black and white [[shock troops]]. By this time, half of the Portuguese troops on the field were conscripted black Africans from Mozambique. By 1972, the situation had deteriorated with the Portuguese forces operating out of traditional secluded strongholds inside FRELIMO liberated zones and controlled areas. The violence and brutality of Portuguese campaign actions against the population of the countryside were increasing along with various massacres against civilians. The Portuguese stepped up new defensive tactics, herding them into villages and trying to ensure the population was not reachable by FRELIMO. The Portuguese regime subsequently shifted tune from \"destroying FRELIMO\" to \"bringing the situation under control.\" \n\nDespite the initial Portuguese military success, the number of monthly casualties never reached zero. FRELIMO continued to cross the border to maintain links with the local population and opened a new front in the Province of Tete near the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam by rerouting their forces through Zambia. As the liberation struggle continued on the Portuguese regime continued to commit horrific atrocities. The most famous of which was the Massacre at Wiriyamu, a village which had been classified as collaborating with FRELIMO by the [[PIDE/DGS]]. The incident itself was not brought to the attention of the rest of the world until nearly a year later, in July 1973, by a Dominican priest who witnessed the massacre. It was at first denied, then contested, investigated and again denied by the Portuguese authorities of the Estado Novo. Though full details of the entire episode are still not known, a large amount of innocent civilians were slaughtered by a group of Portuguese soldiers during a planned operation (Operation Marosca) to attack an alleged guerrilla base. The [[PIDE/DGS]] agent who guided the soldiers told them explicitly that the orders were to \"kill everyone\", despite only civilians having been found in the village and there being no signs of FRELIMO activity. This agent, Chico Kavachi, was later murdered before he could be interviewed in an investigation ordered by the Portuguese government after the massacre became known in July 1973.<ref>Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Afonso, Aniceto. Os anos da Guerra Colonial - Wiriyamu, De Mo\u00e7ambique para o mundo. Lisboa, 2010</ref> Some historians speculate that the DGS wanted to deliberately create an embarrassment to the government, so as to get rid of Ka\u00falza de Arriaga, whom they considered an incompetent general.\n\n===Long-term effect===\nLater counter-claims, probably at the behest of the Portuguese government, have been made in a report of Archbishop of Dar es Salaam [[Laureaen Rugambwa]] that the killings were carried out by FRELIMO combatants, not Portuguese forces.<ref>Arslan Humbarachi & Nicole Muchnik, ''Portugal's African Wars'', N.Y., 1974.</ref> In addition, others claimed that the alleged massacres by Portuguese military forces were fabricated to tar the reputation of the Portuguese state abroad.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html Adrian Hastings], [[The Daily Telegraph]] (June 26, 2001)</ref> But the exposure of the Wiriyamu massacre brought with it the exposure of numerous other massacres on a smaller scale and increased worldwide (particularly third-world) condemnation of Portugal. During 1973 and early 1974, the situation continued to worsen for the Portuguese, FRELIMO continued to advance further into Portuguese controlled territory from fronts in Tete and Cabo Delgado. The civilian authorities in Lisbon, embarrassed by the atrocities and massacres exposed had lost a great amount of confidence in military solutions and were encouraging the expansion of operations by [[PIDE]].<ref>Adrian Hastings, Wiriyamu, (London: Search Press, 1974)</ref> PIDE's paramilitary endeavours were viewed as excessively brutal and counterproductive by the leaders of the military, and disagreement on the proper role of the secret police in combating the insurgency widened the rift between the central government and the military leadership and helped fuel the discontent and disillusionment within the Armed Forces.\n\nWhen the [[Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas]] (MFA) seized control of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|the government in Lisbon]] on 25 April 1974, an event known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], the Portuguese position in Mozambique all but collapsed.\n\nGeneral [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]], head of the new government and former commander of counter independence forces in other Portuguese territory in Africa, [[Portuguese Guinea]], manoeuvred to maintain some control over the destiny of the Mozambican people by calling for a cease-fire and Portuguese sponsored elections; but FRELIMO, sensing victory, refused to allow Sp\u00ednola to impose a neocolonialist solution onto Mozambique.\n\nFRELIMO announced the opening of a new front in [[Zambezia Province|Zambezia]] and poured guerrillas into the middle regions of the country, advancing further south. The Spinola government countered by ordering northern outposts abandoned and the concentration of troops in the southern regions, by handing out arms to rural settlers, and by ordering<ref>F. X. Maier, Revolution and Terrorism in Mozambique, (New York: American Affairs Association Inc., 1974), p. 24. & Thomas H. Henriksen, Revolution and Counterrevolution, (London: Greenwood Press, 1983), p. 57.</ref> an increase in bombing attacks on guerrilla controlled territories. These measures were intended to support the Portuguese position at the negotiating table. The Portuguese troops fighting in Mozambique realised that the coup in Lisbon, the change of regime and the opening of negotiations with FRELIMO were a prelude to withdrawal. Instead of engaging FRELIMO, many refused to continue risking their lives and enacted local ceasefires and surrenders. By mid-summer an undeclared truce prevailed since the bulk of the Portuguese army would not leave their barracks and refused to fight; on 8 September 1974, an accord was signed formalising the cease-fire. The agreement called for a transitional government with full independence for Mozambique to be granted on 25 June 1975 - the thirteenth anniversary of FRELIMO. The [[Portuguese Colonial War]] had ended, but the newly independent territories of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] would enter a period of chaos and devastating [[civil war]]s ([[Angolan Civil War]] and [[Mozambican Civil War]]) which lasted several decades and claimed millions of lives and refugees.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n==See also==\n*[[Operation Green Sea]]\n*[[Frente Leste]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1970]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1971]]\n[[Category:History of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Military operations involving Portugal]]\n[[Category:1970 in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Mozambican War of Independence]]\n[[Category:Portuguese Colonial War]]\n[[Category:July 1970 events in Africa]]\n[[Category:August 1970 events in Africa]]\n[[Category:Military operations post-1945]]\n", "name_user": "Bolingbroke8", "label": "safe", "comment": "Improving the quality of English used.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gordian_Knot"}
