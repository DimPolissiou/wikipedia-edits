The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, East Asia and then worldwide, by mid-to-late March most cultural heritage organisations had closed, and arts events postponed or cancelled, either voluntarily or by government mandate.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, East Asia and then worldwide, by mid-to-late March most cultural heritage organisations had closed, and arts events postponed or cancelled, either voluntarily or by government mandate.

When my grandmother was asked how many children she had, she said: 'One.' She had nine daughters and one son. She said the same about our family. That we only had one child. 'What about us?' my sister and I asked. 'You are going to get us little sons,' she answered. It made me desperate. What was I supposed to do with my life on earth? Giving birth to little sons!

In socialist thought, such an oppressed collective must show unity in the face of \"the oppressors\" and segments of this oppressed collective such as men cannot be criticised. For Withuis, \"[s]uch criticism would weaken the position of the oppressed social class, you'd play into the hands of the '[[Right-wing politics|right]]', and you'd accuse 'victims' of misdeeds (which is impossible in this mindset). '[[Groupthink]]' denies the conflicting interests amongst the oppressed, which serves in favour of the most powerful inside such a group.\" Withuis found that Hirsi Ali was right in accusing the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] of forgetting Muslim women, but wondered whether her choice for the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|Liberal Party]] was all that much better, especially if it would form a governing coalition with the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], which Withuis alleged to be even less friendly to (Muslim) women.<ref name=\"Withuis\"/>\n\nFor ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', Wim Wirtz reviewed Hirsi Ali's book during the ongoing controversy about her statements and her defection from Labour to the Liberals. 'Whoever takes the time to uninhibitedly study the booklet ''De zoontjesfabriek'' (...) will have to try pretty hard to find any offensive texts in it,' he remarked, though adding that this might be because, as a Westerner, he 'is used to the possibility of having his whole kith and kinhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=De_zoontjesfabriek&action=edit#e being subjected to discussion in a democratic [[Rechtsstaat]] without repercussions.' According to Wirtz, the book was nuanced and did not [[apostasy in Islam|reject all of Islam]], but held a fiery plea for [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|reforming Islam]], especially with respect to Muslim women: 'no more physical abuse, forced [[female genital mutilation|genital cutting]], [[arranged marriage]], legitimised rape and a second-class position as a 'son factory' within the Muslim community.'<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/de-moslim-als-individu~b8dccbad/ |title=De moslim als individu |author=Wim Wirtz |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=20 December 2002 |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Flanders|Flemish]] newspaper ''[[De Morgen]]'', a reviewer of Moroccan origin wrote that Hirsi Ali's observations, especially the notion that 'a Muslim woman gains in status the more sons she has', made her think a lot about 'my own family, my own environment, also stories that I've heard from other Muslim girls'. In her judgement, 'Hirsi Ali sometimes misses subtlety when she writes about Islam, and that is because she often proceeds from generalisations. Other times, however, she hits the nails right on the head.'<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.demorgen.be/nieuws/de-zoontjesfabriek~b6b88c62/ |title=De zoontjesfabriek.

For his part, her calls for reforming and moderating Islam ('Enlightening') were worthy of praise, but Dros claimed she actually wanted to go even further and fight against religion as a whole, citing passages such as 'I've got nothing against religion as a source of consolation, but I do reject religion as a standard for morality, as a guide for life.' Dros therefore put Hirsi Ali in a line of other radical atheists ('Enlightenment fundamentalists') such as [[Herman Philipse]], [[Paul Cliteur]], [[Maarten 't Hart]] and [[Rudy Kousbroek]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/dwars-op-haar-eigen-verlichtingspad~a59f7aa8/ |title=Dwars op haar eigen Verlichtingspad |author=Lodewijk Dros |work=[[Trouw]] |date=29 January 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zoontjesfabriek}}\n[[Category:Books by Ayaan Hirsi Ali]]\n[[Category:2002 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Books critical of Islam]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=May 2019}}{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name             = De zoontjesfabriek\n| title_orig       = \n| translator       = \n| image            = De zoontjesfabriek.jpg\n| caption          = \n| author           = [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]]\n| illustrator      = \n| cover_artist     = \n| country          = \n| language         = Dutch\n| series           = \n| subject          = [[Women in Islam]], [[criticism of Islam]]\n| genre            = Collection of essays\n| publisher        = Uitgeverij Augustus\n| pub_date         = December 2002<ref name=\"Google Books\"/>\n| english_pub_date = \u2013\n| media_type       = Print\n| pages            = 94\n| isbn             = 9789045703558\n| oclc             = \n| dewey            = \n| congress         = \n| preceded_by      = \u2013\n| followed_by      = [[The Caged Virgin]]\n| notes            = \n}}\n'''''De zoontjesfabriek.

'Such criticism would weaken the position of the oppressed social class, you'd play into the hands of the '[[Right-wing politics|right]]', and you'd accuse 'victims' of misdeeds (which is impossible in this mindset). '[[Groupthink]]' denies the conflicting interests amongst the oppressed, which serves in favour of the most powerful inside such a group.' Withuis found that Hirsi Ali was right in accusing the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] of forgetting Muslim women, but wondered whether her choice for the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|Liberal Party]] was all that much better, especially if it would form a governing coalition with the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], which Withuis alleged to be even less friendly to (Muslim) women.<ref name=\"Withuis\"/>\n\nFor ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', Wim Wirtz reviewed Hirsi Ali's book during the ongoing controversy about her statements and her defection from Labour to the Liberals. 'Whoever takes the time to uninhibitedly study the booklet ''De zoontjesfabriek'' (...) will have to try pretty hard to find any offensive texts in it,' he remarked, though adding that this might be because, as a Westerner, he 'is used to the possibility of having his whole kith and kine being subjected to discussion in a democratic [[Rechtsstaat]] without repercussions.' According to Wirtz, the book was nuanced and did not [[apostasy in Islam|reject all of Islam]], but held a fiery plea for [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|reforming Islam]], especially with respect to Muslim women: 'no more physical abuse, forced [[female genital mutilation|genital cutting]], [[arranged marriage]], legitimised rape and a second-class position as a 'son factory' within the Muslim community.'<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/de-moslim-als-individu~b8dccbad/ |title=De moslim als individu |author=Wim Wirtz |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=20 December 2002 |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Flanders|Flemish]] newspaper ''[[De Morgen]]'', a reviewer of Moroccan origin wrote that Hirsi Ali's observations, especially the notion that 'a Muslim woman gains in status the more sons she has', made her think a lot about 'my own family, my own environment, also stories that I've heard from other Muslim girls'. In her judgement, 'Hirsi Ali sometimes misses subtlety when she writes about Islam, and that is because she often proceeds from generalisations. Other times, however, she hits the nails right on the head.'<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.demorgen.be/nieuws/de-zoontjesfabriek~b6b88c62/ |title=De zoontjesfabriek.

For his part, her calls for reforming and moderating Islam ('Enlightening') were worthy of praise, but Dros claimed she actually wanted to go even further and fight against religion as a whole, citing passages such as 'I've got nothing against religion as a source of consolation, but I do reject religion as a standard for morality, as a guide for life.' Dros therefore put Hirsi Ali in a line of other radical atheists ('Enlightenment fundamentalists') such as [[Herman Philipse]], [[Paul Cliteur]], [[Maarten 't Hart]] and [[Rudy Kousbroek]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/dwars-op-haar-eigen-verlichtingspad~a59f7aa8/ |title=Dwars op haar eigen Verlichtingspad |author=Lodewijk Dros |work=[[Trouw]] |date=29 January 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zoontjesfabriek}}\n[[Category:Books by Ayaan Hirsi Ali]]\n[[Category:2002 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Books critical of Islam]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_zoontjesfabriek"}

She rose to prominence as a member of the girl group [[Fifth Harmony]], formed on [[The X Factor (American TV series)|''The X Factor USA'']] in 2012, signing a joint record deal with [[Syco Music]] and [[Epic Records]]. While in Fifth Harmony, Cabello began to establish herself as a solo artist with the release of the collaborations \"[[I Know What You Did Last Summer (song)|I Know What You Did Last Summer]]\" with [[Shawn Mendes]], and \"[[Bad Things (Machine Gun Kelly and Camila Cabello song)|Bad Things]]\" with [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]], the latter reaching number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Its lead single \"[[Havana (Camila Cabello song)|Havana]]\" topped the charts in several countries including the US and UK, and follow-up single \"[[Never Be the Same (Camila Cabello song)|Never Be the Same]]\" reached the top 10 in multiple countries. Cabello's 2019 duet with Mendes, \"[[Se\u00f1orita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Se\u00f1orita]]\", became her second single as lead artist to top the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and also reached number one in a number of European countries. Her second studio album, ''[[Romance (Camila Cabello album)|Romance]]'' (2019), peaked at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and number one in Canada. Cabello is set to star in an upcoming film adaptation of ''[[Cinderella (2021 film)|Cinderella]]'' (2021), for [[Sony Pictures]].\n\nCabello has amassed billions of streams on music platforms.
