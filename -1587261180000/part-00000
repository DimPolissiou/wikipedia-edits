May 29, 1985. pg. A1</ref> The plan was approved by [[Metropolitan Toronto]], but funding was delayed by the provincial government of [[David Peterson]]'s [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].\n\nIn 1993, the governing [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) under [[Bob Rae]] proposed provincial funding for four subway/LRT projects for the TTC. Included in these four proposals were plans to build new subway lines along [[Eglinton Avenue|Eglinton]] and Sheppard avenues and work was begun on both projects.<ref>Royson James. \"Deciding which train to take.\" ''Toronto Star''.\" March 8, 1994. pg. A15</ref> The NDP was defeated in the [[1995 Ontario general election|1995 provincial election]], and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives]] under [[Mike Harris]] were elected. Harris cancelled the [[Eglinton West line|Eglinton subway]] (and filled in the hole near [[Eglinton West station]], though work resumed in 2014 with the advent of [[Line 5 Eglinton]] construction, albeit using different rail technology), but continued work on the Sheppard Line.\n\nFunding for the Sheppard Line was initially rejected by city council.{{clarify|which city council?|date=May 2015}} However, after a number of votes on different alterations to the project (including only building the subway line as far as Leslie Street), the proposal to build the Sheppard Line tunnels only, without tracks, was passed by a narrow margin. After this vote passed city council, a re-vote was taken on the entire Sheppard line project to Don Mills, which then passed by a very narrow margin. James Bow, a Toronto transit reporter, has documented that the political clout of North York Mayor [[Mel Lastman]] (he was later elected Mayor of the amalgamated City of Toronto in 1998) was crucial to the Sheppard Line proposal being implemented.<ref>[http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5110.shtml \"The Sheppard Subway \u2013 Transit Toronto \u2013 Content\"].</ref> Councillor [[Joe Pantalone]] strongly supported the line, arguing it was a matter of civic equity and that the suburbs deserved good transit, which would \u2013 in his opinion \u2013 bring development.<ref name=\"morrow\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lessons-from-torontos-sheppard-subway-line/article5402731/ |title=Lessons from Toronto's Sheppard subway line |first=Adrian |last=Morrow |work=The Globe and Mail |date=November 16, 2012 |access-date=May 1, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430070344/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lessons-from-torontos-sheppard-subway-line/article5402731/ |archive-date=April 30, 2017}}</ref> [[David L. Gunn]], who was general manager of the TTC, opposed the Sheppard line, saying that it \"made no sense to build an expensive new subway when the existing system was strapped for cash to make basic repairs\" and \"if the city wanted to expand transit, it would be better to do it downtown, easing congestion in the busiest parts of the system\".<ref name=\"morrow\" />\n\n===Completion and opening===\n[[File:Sheppard Yonge Platform 02.jpg|thumb|left|The roughed-in [[Spanish solution]] platform in [[Sheppard\u2013Yonge station]]]]\nThe Sheppard line was opened on November 22, 2002. It was the city's first new subway line since the opening of the [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth|Bloor\u2013Danforth line]] in 1966.<ref name=\"star2016\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20161119/282656097044749 |title=November 22, 2002: The Sheppard Subway Line opens its doors |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=November 19, 2016 |first=Sophie |last=Van Bastelaer}}</ref> It remained the newest subway infrastructure in Toronto for 15 years until the opening of the [[Toronto\u2013York Spadina Subway Extension]] in 2017. It is shorter than had been planned, running from [[Yonge Street]] (at the former Sheppard station, renamed Sheppard\u2013Yonge when the Sheppard line opened) east to Don Mills Road rather than further west to [[Sheppard West station|Downsview station]] and southeast to [[Scarborough Centre station]]. Downsview (renamed Sheppard West in May 2017) had been built in 1996, ostensibly with the intention of being the western terminus of the Sheppard Line prior to the latter's truncation.\n\nThe Sheppard line cost just under [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1{{nbsp}}billion and took eight years to build. It is the first subway line in Canada that had plain tunnel sections built entirely by [[tunnel boring machine]]. The Sheppard line is the only subway line in Toronto that does not have any open sections. All stations on the line are in [[cut-and-cover]]<!--Don't bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]--> sections with the expansion of Sheppard station having required an S-shaped diversion of Yonge Street. Just east of [[Leslie station]], there is an enclosed bridge over the east branch of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]].\n\nIt is the first line to have accessibility elevators at every station.<ref name=\"star2016\" /> The automated system to announce each stop was installed in January 2006.\n\nStations are built to accommodate the TTC's standard subway trains of six {{convert|23|m|ft|0|adj=on}} cars, but part of each platform has been blocked off since only four-car trains are needed to carry the amount of traffic on the line. The line was designed so that it can be extended at both ends, allowing for the construction of the westward and eastward branches that had been planned. Likewise, the Sheppard line level of Sheppard\u2013Yonge station is constructed as a roughed-in [[Spanish solution]] station in anticipation of increased ridership.\n\n[[Platform screen doors]] were proposed for the Sheppard line. Installed at the edge of the platforms, platform screen doors would align themselves with the subway-car doors when in station for safety and suicide prevention. The system was dropped because of the financial cost.\n\n===Rolling stock===\nFrom its opening in November 2002 to May 2016, the line was operated solely with four-car [[T series (Toronto subway)|T1]] subway trains with two staff members operating the trains \u2013 one driver and one guard who operates the doors. On May 30, 2016, new four-car [[Toronto Rocket]] (TR) subway trains were introduced on this line. They replaced the older T1 subway trains, which were moved to [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]. The TRs are based on [[Bombardier Transportation]]'s [[Bombardier Movia|Movia]]-styled train sets and are the first TTC trains which have no separators between the cars. This allows passengers to walk freely from one end to the other, unlike Toronto's previous subway cars. The change to TR trains was necessary because Line 4 trains are based in [[Davisville Yard]], which is accessed via [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]]. That line will operate using an [[automatic train control]] system, which is scheduled to go online in phases between 2017 and 2020, and the T1 trains are not compatible with this system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sheppard-subway-line-gets-new-toronto-rocket-trains-1.3607811 |title=Sheppard subway line gets new Toronto Rocket trains |work=CBC News |date=May 30, 2016 |access-date=May 1, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004152256/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sheppard-subway-line-gets-new-toronto-rocket-trains-1.3607811 |archive-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> Since October 9, 2016, Line 4 is serviced entirely by four-car TR trains, which are operated by one staff member who both drives the train and operates the doors (similar to the model already in place on [[Line 3 Scarborough]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cp24.com/news/ttc-switching-to-single-operator-model-for-line-4-subway-as-of-oct-9-1.3091153 |title=TTC switching to single-operator model for Line 4 subway as of Oct. 9 |website=CP24 |last=Fox |first=Chris |date=September 27, 2016 |access-date=June 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927200936/http://www.cp24.com/news/ttc-switching-to-single-operator-model-for-line-4-subway-as-of-oct-9-1.3091153 |archive-date=September 27, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Residential development===\n[[File:TTC_Bessarion_Concord.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bessarion station]] in 2008]]\nFrom its opening in 2002 to 2014, the Sheppard line spurred over $1{{nbsp}}billion of construction of new housing,<ref name=\"Metro-2014-12-04\" /> including several high-rise condominium towers, along its route as [[transit-oriented development]]s.

The original proposal for the Sheppard line was for a major subway line running from [[Sheppard West station]] on the University portion of Line 1 to [[Scarborough Centre station]]. Instead, funding was only approved for a truncated line with several phased expansions.\n\n===Eastward extension===\nThe TTC considered the eastward extension of the Sheppard line to Scarborough Centre station as one of its top priorities for rapid-transit expansion, which would expand [[rapid transit]] in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] for the first time since the completion of [[Line 3 Scarborough]]. The eastward extension would include new stations at Consumers Road, [[Victoria Park Avenue]], [[Warden Avenue]]<!--Don't bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]-->, [[Kennedy Road (Toronto)|Kennedy Road]]<!--Don't bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]-->, [[Agincourt GO Station]], and Progress Avenue, terminating at the existing Scarborough Centre Station on Line 3 Scarborough. The expansion proposal also included the possible addition of a station at [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale Avenue]] between Sheppard\u2013Yonge and Bayview stations on the existing portion of the line.\n\nThe TTC estimates that a Sheppard subway to Scarborough Centre would have 7,800 riders per hour while 10,000 per hour is the minimum number of riders per hour considered appropriate for a subway. The maximum capacity of the subway is about 30,000 riders per hour, approximately the load the Yonge line carries in the morning rush.<ref name=\"TorStar20150518\" />\n[[Image:Sheppard Yonge Eastward.gif|thumb|center|upright=3.6|Potential eastward extension of the Sheppard line from Don Mills to Scarborough Centre]]\n\n===Westward extension===\nA separate {{convert|4.5|km|mi|adj=on}} westward extension to Sheppard West station considered the creation of stations at Senlac Road, [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]], and Faywood Boulevard. Lower population density made this expansion a much lower priority, as the minimal increase in ridership was insufficient to justify the costs. The approval of the Spadina subway extension to the [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]] in [[Regional Municipality of York|York Region]] renewed interest in this phase, as a subway connection between Sheppard West and Sheppard\u2013Yonge stations would significantly lower commuting times for [[York University]] students. The tunnel from Sheppard\u2013Yonge to Welbeck Road (east of Senlac Road) was built for train storage at the time of original construction.\n\nIn 2013, this extension was listed as being considered as a \"Unfunded Future Rapid Transit Project\" in the City of Toronto's \"Feeling Congested?\" report.<ref>[http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2013/pg/bgrd/backgroundfile-64550.pdf Toronto Feeling Congested? report]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Sheppard Yonge West.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.7|Potential westward extension of the Sheppard line from {{ttcs|Sheppard\u2013Yonge}} to {{ttcs|Sheppard West}}]]\n\n===Transit City===\n{{Main|Sheppard East LRT}}\nIn March 2007, the City of Toronto and the TTC released the [[Transit City]] proposal to begin a new round of transit expansion using [[light rail]] technology on dedicated rights-of-way instead of subway technology. Under this plan, the Sheppard East subway extension had been replaced by a light rail line running from Don Mills Station along Sheppard Avenue East to Meadowvale Road, where it would meet the northern terminus of an extended [[Line 3 Scarborough]]. Under this proposal, there would be no direct connection between [[North York City Centre]] and [[Scarborough City Centre]].\n\nIn 2009, a westward extension was again considered by the TTC to link the line to [[Wilson Yard|Wilson Subway Yard]]. It was immediately dismissed due to cost.<ref>[http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2009/December_16_2009/Reports/Yonge_University_Spa.pdf TTC Report December 16 2009]</ref>\n\n===Rob Ford era===\nAs a result of the election of [[Rob Ford]] as mayor of Toronto in 2010, the western extension of the Sheppard subway to Sheppard West Station and the eastern extension to Scarborough Centre were considered a priority again.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/transportation/article/899641--war-on-the-car-is-over-ford-moves-transit-underground |location=Toronto |work=The Star |first1=Tess |last1=Kalinowski |first2=David |last2=Rider |title='War on the car is over': Ford moves transit underground |date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> Ford indicated in a December 2010 interview with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' newspaper that all other transit projects would come second to completing the Sheppard line.

The City of Toronto will assume complete financial responsibility for the project, which is proposed to be funded through a [[public\u2013private partnership]], as well as surplus funds from the proposed [[Line 5 Eglinton|Eglinton Crosstown line]], if there will be any. Massive redevelopment along the route would be needed to generate these funds, as the current population density and projected ridership is too low to support the cost of the expansion by itself.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/toronto-mayor-rob-fords-transit-plan-wins-provincial-approval/article1963854/ \"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's transit plan wins provincial approval\"] By John Lorinc and Adrian Morrow, [[The Globe and Mail]], March 30, 2011</ref><ref>[http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/03/31/funding-questions-linger-after-new-transit-plan-announced/ \"Funding questions linger after new transit plan announced\"] By Natalie Alcoba, [[National Post]].

Harris cancelled the [[Eglinton West line|Eglinton subway]] (and filled in the hole near [[Eglinton West station]], though work resumed in 2014 with the advent of [[Line 5 Eglinton]] construction, albeit using different rail technology), but continued work on the Sheppard Line.\n\nFunding for the Sheppard Line was initially rejected by city council.{{clarify|which city council?|date=May 2015}} However, after a number of votes on different alterations to the project (including only building the subway line as far as Leslie Street), the proposal to build the Sheppard Line tunnels only, without tracks, was passed by a narrow margin. After this vote passed city council, a re-vote was taken on the entire Sheppard line project to Don Mills, which then passed by a very narrow margin.

Just east of [[Leslie station]], there is an enclosed bridge over the east branch of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]].\n\nIt is the first line to have accessibility elevators at every station.<ref name=\"star2016\" /> The automated system to announce each stop was installed in January 2006.\n\nStations are built to accommodate the TTC's standard subway trains of six {{convert|23|m|ft|0|adj=on}} cars, but part of each platform has been blocked off since only four-car trains are needed to carry the amount of traffic on the line. The line was designed so that it can be extended at both ends, allowing for the construction of the westward and eastward branches that had been planned. Likewise, the Sheppard line level of Sheppard\u2013Yonge station is constructed as a roughed-in [[Spanish solution]] station in anticipation of increased ridership.\n\n[[Platform screen doors]] were proposed for the Sheppard line. Installed at the edge of the platforms, platform screen doors would align themselves with the subway-car doors when in station for safety and suicide prevention. The system was dropped because of the financial cost.\n\n===Rolling stock===\nFrom its opening in November 2002 to May 2016, the line was operated solely with four-car [[T series (Toronto subway)|T1]] subway trains with two staff members operating the trains \u2013 one driver and one guard who operates the doors. On May 30, 2016, new four-car [[Toronto Rocket]] (TR) subway trains were introduced on this line. They replaced the older T1 subway trains, which were moved to [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]. The TRs are based on [[Bombardier Transportation]]'s [[Bombardier Movia|Movia]]-styled train sets and are the first TTC trains which have no separators between the cars. This allows passengers to walk freely from one end to the other, unlike Toronto's previous subway cars. The change to TR trains was necessary because Line 4 trains are based in [[Davisville Yard]], which is accessed via [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]]. That line will operate using an [[automatic train control]] system, which is scheduled to go online in phases between 2017 and 2020, and the T1 trains are not compatible with this system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sheppard-subway-line-gets-new-toronto-rocket-trains-1.3607811 |title=Sheppard subway line gets new Toronto Rocket trains |work=CBC News |date=May 30, 2016 |access-date=May 1, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004152256/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sheppard-subway-line-gets-new-toronto-rocket-trains-1.3607811 |archive-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> Since October 9, 2016, Line 4 is serviced entirely by four-car TR trains, which are operated by one staff member who both drives the train and operates the doors (similar to the model already in place on [[Line 3 Scarborough]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cp24.com/news/ttc-switching-to-single-operator-model-for-line-4-subway-as-of-oct-9-1.3091153 |title=TTC switching to single-operator model for Line 4 subway as of Oct. 9 |website=CP24 |last=Fox |first=Chris |date=September 27, 2016 |access-date=June 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927200936/http://www.cp24.com/news/ttc-switching-to-single-operator-model-for-line-4-subway-as-of-oct-9-1.3091153 |archive-date=September 27, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Residential development===\n[[File:TTC_Bessarion_Concord.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bessarion station]] in 2008]]\nFrom its opening in 2002 to 2014, the Sheppard line spurred over $1{{nbsp}}billion of construction of new housing,<ref name=\"Metro-2014-12-04\" /> including several high-rise condominium towers, along its route as [[transit-oriented development]]s.

The original proposal for the Sheppard line was for a major subway line running from [[Sheppard West station]] on the University portion of Line 1 to [[Scarborough Centre station]]. Instead, funding was only approved for a truncated line with several phased expansions.\n\n===Eastward extension===\nThe TTC considered the eastward extension of the Sheppard line to Scarborough Centre station as one of its top priorities for rapid-transit expansion, which would expand [[rapid transit]] in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] for the first time since the completion of [[Line 3 Scarborough]]. The eastward extension would include new stations at Consumers Road, [[Victoria Park Avenue]], [[Warden Avenue]]<!--Don't bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]-->, [[Kennedy Road (Toronto)|Kennedy Road]]<!--Don't bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]-->, [[Agincourt GO Station]], and Progress Avenue, terminating at the existing Scarborough Centre Station on Line 3 Scarborough. The expansion proposal also included the possible addition of a station at [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale Avenue]] between Sheppard\u2013Yonge and Bayview stations on the existing portion of the line.\n\nThe TTC estimates that a Sheppard subway to Scarborough Centre would have 7,800 riders per hour while 10,000 per hour is the minimum number of riders per hour considered appropriate for a subway. The maximum capacity of the subway is about 30,000 riders per hour, approximately the load the Yonge line carries in the morning rush.<ref name=\"TorStar20150518\" />\n[[Image:Sheppard Yonge Eastward.gif|thumb|center|upright=3.6|Potential eastward extension of the Sheppard line from Don Mills to Scarborough Centre]]\n\n===Westward extension===\nA separate {{convert|4.5|km|mi|adj=on}} westward extension to Sheppard West station considered the creation of stations at Senlac Road, [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]], and Faywood Boulevard. Lower population density made this expansion a much lower priority, as the minimal increase in ridership was insufficient to justify the costs. The approval of the Spadina subway extension to the [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]] in [[Regional Municipality of York|York Region]] renewed interest in this phase, as a subway connection between Sheppard West and Sheppard\u2013Yonge stations would significantly lower commuting times for [[York University]] students. The tunnel from Sheppard\u2013Yonge to Welbeck Road (east of Senlac Road) was built for train storage at the time of original construction.\n\nIn 2013, this extension was listed as being considered as a \"Unfunded Future Rapid Transit Project\" in the City of Toronto's \"Feeling Congested?\" report.<ref>[http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2013/pg/bgrd/backgroundfile-64550.pdf Toronto Feeling Congested? report]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Sheppard Yonge West.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.7|Potential westward extension of the Sheppard line from {{ttcs|Sheppard\u2013Yonge}} to {{ttcs|Sheppard West}}]]\n\n===Transit City===\n{{Main|Sheppard East LRT}}\nIn March 2007, the City of Toronto and the TTC released the [[Transit City]] proposal to begin a new round of transit expansion using [[light rail]] technology on dedicated rights-of-way instead of subway technology. Under this plan, the Sheppard East subway extension had been replaced by a light rail line running from Don Mills Station along Sheppard Avenue East to Meadowvale Road, where it would meet the northern terminus of an extended [[Line 3 Scarborough]]. Under this proposal, there would be no direct connection between [[North York City Centre]] and [[Scarborough City Centre]].\n\nIn 2009, a westward extension was again considered by the TTC to link the line to [[Wilson Yard|Wilson Subway Yard]]. It was immediately dismissed due to cost.<ref>[http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2009/December_16_2009/Reports/Yonge_University_Spa.pdf TTC Report December 16 2009]</ref>\n\n===Rob Ford era===\nAs a result of the election of [[Rob Ford]] as mayor of Toronto in 2010, the western extension of the Sheppard subway to Sheppard West Station and the eastern extension to Scarborough Centre were considered a priority again.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/transportation/article/899641--war-on-the-car-is-over-ford-moves-transit-underground |location=Toronto |work=The Star |first1=Tess |last1=Kalinowski |first2=David |last2=Rider |title='War on the car is over': Ford moves transit underground |date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> Ford indicated in a December 2010 interview with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' newspaper that all other transit projects would come second to completing the Sheppard line.

The City of Toronto will assume complete financial responsibility for the project, which is proposed to be funded through a [[public\u2013private partnership]], as well as surplus funds from the proposed [[Line 5 Eglinton|Eglinton Crosstown line]], if there will be any. Massive redevelopment along the route would be needed to generate these funds, as the current population density and projected ridership is too low to support the cost of the expansion by itself.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/toronto-mayor-rob-fords-transit-plan-wins-provincial-approval/article1963854/ \"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's transit plan wins provincial approval\"] By John Lorinc and Adrian Morrow, [[The Globe and Mail]], March 30, 2011</ref><ref>[http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/03/31/funding-questions-linger-after-new-transit-plan-announced/ \"Funding questions linger after new transit plan announced\"] By Natalie Alcoba, [[National Post]].
