The young Shah possessed a decidedly more refined temperament, and amongst the unsavory developments that \"would haunt him when he was king\" were the political disgrace brought by his father on [[Teymourtash]]; the dismissal of Foroughi by the mid-1930s; and [[Ali Akbar Davar]]'s suicide in 1937.<ref>Gholam Reza Afghami.

Given the situation, alongside the strong personal support of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] for covert action, the American government gave the go-ahead to a committee, attended by the Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]], Kermit Roosevelt, Henderson, and [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]]. Kermit Roosevelt returned to Iran on 13 July 1953, and again on 1 August 1953, in his first meeting with the king. A car picked him up at midnight and drove him to the palace. He lay down on the seat and covered himself with a blanket as guards waved his driver through the gates. The Shah got into the car and Roosevelt explained the mission. The CIA bribed him with $1&nbsp;million in Iranian currency, which Roosevelt had stored in a large safe \u2013 a bulky cache, given the then exchange rate of 1,000 rial to 15 dollars.<ref>Robert Graham, ''Iran: The Illusion of Power'', p. 66.</ref>\n\nThe Communists staged massive demonstrations to hijack Mosaddegh's initiatives, and the United States actively plotted against him. On 16 August 1953, the right wing of the Army attacked. Armed with an order by the Shah, it appointed General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] as prime minister. A coalition of mobs and retired officers close to the Palace executed this coup d'\u00e9tat. They failed dismally and the Shah decided to leave the country.

Opposition against him grew tremendously. They roamed Tehran, raising red flags and pulling down statues of Reza Shah. This was rejected by conservative clerics like [[Abol-Ghasem Kashani|Kashani]] and [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] leaders like [[Hossein Makki]], who sided with the king. On 18 August 1953, Mosaddegh defended the government against this new attack.

In the meantime, according to the CIA plot, Zahedi appealed to the military, claimed to be the legitimate prime minister and charged Mosaddegh with staging a coup by ignoring the Shah's decree.

''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 159.</ref> Perron was a man much resented for his influence on Mohammad Reza and was often described by enemies as a \"diabolical\" and \"mysterious\" character, whose position was that of a private secretary, but who was one of the Shah's closest advisors, holding far more power than his job title suggested.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 50\"/>\n\nIn a 1957 study compiled by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], Mohammad Reza was praised for his \"growing maturity\" and no longer needing \"to seek advice at every turn\" as the previous 1951 study had concluded.<ref>Milani, Abbas.

Mohammad Reza had strong etatist tendencies and was deeply involved in the economy with his economic policies bearing a strong resemblance to the same etatist policies being pursued by General  [[Park Chung-hee]] in South Korea at the same time. Mohammad Reza considered himself to be a socialist, saying he was \"more socialist and revolutionary than anyone\".<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 313\"/> Reflecting his self-proclaimed socialist tendencies, though unions were illegal, but the Shah brought in labour laws that were \"surprising fair to workers\".<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 314\"/> Iran in the  1960s and 70s was a tolerant place for the Jewish minority with one Iranian Jew, David Menasheri, remembering that Mohammad Reza's reign was the \"golden age\" for Iranian Jews when they were equals, and when the Iranian Jewish community was one of the wealthiest Jewish communities in the world.

While the arrangement did not preclude other partnerships and treaties, it helped to provide a somewhat stable environment in which Mohammad Reza could implement his reforms. Another factor guiding Mohammad Reza in his foreign policy was his wish for financial stability, which required strong diplomatic ties. A third factor was his wish to present Iran as a prosperous and powerful nation; this fuelled his domestic policy of Westernisation and reform. A final component was his promise that communism could be halted at Iran's border if his monarchy was preserved. By 1977, the country's treasury, the Shah's autocracy, and his strategic alliances seemed to form a protective layer around Iran.<ref>Precht, Henry.

Although when interviewed on [[CBS 60 Minutes|''60 Minutes'']] by reporter [[Mike Wallace]], he criticised [[American Jews]] for their presumed control over U.S. media and finance, those remarks were intended to pacify Arab critics, and bilateral relations between Iran and Israel were not adversely affected.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5EXLpXeoXkC&pg=PT84#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Israel's Quest for Recognition and Acceptance in Asia|last=Abadi|first=Joseph|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers / Routledge|year=2004|page=84}}</ref> In a 1967 memo to President [[Lyndon B.

In return, [[Seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Iran took full control]] of [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]] and [[Abu Musa]] in the [[Strait of Hormuz]], three strategically sensitive islands which were claimed by the [[United Arab Emirates]]. During this period, the Shah maintained cordial relations with the Persian Gulf states and established close diplomatic ties with [[Saudi Arabia]]. Mohammad Reza saw Iran as the natural dominant power in the Persian Gulf region, and tolerated no challenges to Iranian hegemony, a claim that was supported by a gargantuan arms-buying spree that started in the early 1960s.<ref>Karsh, Effraim.

Mohammad Reza was distrustful of both the Socialist government of [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] and the [[Arab nationalist]] [[Baath party]]. He resented the internationally recognised Iran-Iraq border on the [[Shatt al-Arab]] river, which a 1937 treaty fixed on the low watermark on the Iranian side, giving Iraq control of most of the Shatt al-Arab.<ref>Zonis, Marvin.

In a July 1969 visit to Guam, President Nixon had announced the Nixon Doctrine, which declared that the United States would honour its treaty commitments in Asia, but \"as far as the problems of international security are concerned&nbsp;... the United States is going to encourage and has a right to expect that this problem will increasingly be handled by, and the responsibility for it taken by, the Asian nations themselves.\"<ref name=\"Karsh, Effraim, p. 199\"/> The particular Asian nation the Nixon Doctrine was aimed at was [[South Vietnam]], but the Shah seized upon the doctrine, with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for their own defence, to argue that the Americans should sell him arms without limitation, a suggestion that Nixon embraced.<ref name=\"Karsh, Effraim, p. 199\"/> A particular dynamic was established in American-Iranian relations from 1969 onward, in which the Americans gave in to whatever Mohammad Reza demanded, as they felt they needed a strong Iran as a pro-American force in the Middle East and could not afford to lose Iran as an ally.<ref name=\"Karsh, Effraim, p. 200\">Karsh, Effraim ''Islamic Imperialism A History'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, p. 200.</ref> Further adding to the Shah's confidence was the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] of 1969, which forced the [[Red Army]] to make a major redeployment to the Chinese border.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 321\">Milani, Abbas. ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 321.</ref> Mohammad Reza, who always feared the prospect of a Soviet invasion, welcomed the Sino-Soviet war and the resulting reduction of Red Army divisions along the Soviet-Iranian border as giving him more room internationally.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 321\"/>\n\n[[File:Gerald Ford and Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi Whitehouse South Lawn.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Mohammad Reza and [[Gerald Ford]] on the [[South Lawn]], 1975]]\n\nUnder Nixon, the United States finally agreed to sever all contact with any Iranians opposed to the Shah's regime, a concession that Mohammad Reza had been seeking since 1958.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 318\"/> The often very anti-American tone of the Iranian press was ignored because Mohammad Reza supported the U.S. in the [[Vietnam War]] and likewise the Americans ignored the Shah's efforts to raise oil prices, despite the fact it cost many American consumers more.<ref name=\"Karsh, Effraim, p. 200\"/> After 1969, a process of \"reverse leverage\" set in, when Mohammad Reza began to dictate to the United States as the Americans needed him more than he needed the Americans.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 201\">Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 201.</ref> The American [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] wrote in 1982 that because of the Vietnam War, it was not politically possible in the 1970s for the United States to fight a major war: \"There was no possibility of assigning any American forces to the Indian Ocean in the midst of the Vietnam War and its attendant trauma. Congress would have tolerated no such commitment; the public would not have supported it. Fortunately, Iran was willing to play this role.\"<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 201\"/> Consequently, the Americans badly needed Iran as an ally, which allowed Mohammad Reza to dictate to them. This experience greatly boosted the Shah's ego, as he felt he was able to impose his will on the world's most powerful nation.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 201\"/>\n\nThe Americans initially rejected Mohammad Reza's suggestion that they join him in supporting the Iraqi Kurdish ''peshmerga'' fighting for independence on the grounds that an independent Kurdistan would inspire the Turkish Kurds to rebel, and they had no interest in antagonising the [[NATO]] member Turkey.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 360\"/> Some of the Shah's advisers also felt it was unwise to support the ''peshmerga'', saying that if the Iraqi Kurds won independence, then the Iranian Kurds would want to join them. When Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran in May 1972, the Shah convinced them to take a larger role in what had, up to then, been a mainly Israeli-Iranian operation to aid [[Iraqi Kurds]] in their struggles against Iraq, against the warnings of the CIA and State Department that the Shah would ultimately betray the Kurds. He did this in March 1975 with the signing of the [[1975 Algiers Agreement|Algiers Accord]] that settled Iraqi-Iranian border disputes, an action taken without prior consultation with the U.S., after which he cut off all aid to the Kurds and prevented the U.S. and Israel from using Iranian territory to provide them assistance.<ref name=\"nationalinterest21jan15\">{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-5-most-precarious-us-allies-all-time-12075?page=3 |title=The 5 Most Precarious US Allies of All Time|last1=Keck|first1=Zachary|date=21 January 2015 |website=National Interest.org|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs a way of increasing pressure on Baghdad, the ''peshmerga'' had been encouraged by Iran and the U.S. to abandon guerrilla war for conventional war in April 1974, so the years 1974\u201375 saw the heaviest fighting between the Iraqi Army and the ''[[peshmerga]]''.

In December 1973, only two months after oil prices were raised by 70 per cent, he urged [[OPEC]] nations to push prices even higher, which they agreed to do, more than doubling the price. Oil prices increased 470 per cent over a 12-month period, which also increased Iran's GDP by 50 per cent. Despite personal pleas from President Nixon, the Shah ignored any complaints, claimed the U.S. was importing more oil than any time in the past, and proclaimed that \"the industrial world will have to realise that the era of their terrific progress and even more terrific income and wealth based on cheap oil is finished.\"<ref name=\"nationalinterest21jan15\"/>\n\n===Modernisation and evolution of government===\n{{Further|White Revolution}}\n[[File:Shahanshah visit microwave network.jpg|thumb|After opening the Micro-wave station, the Shah visits its different departments, 1970]]\n\nWith Iran's great oil wealth, the Shah became the preeminent leader of the Middle East, and self-styled \"Guardian\" of the [[Persian Gulf]].

In the words of a U.S. Embassy dispatch: \"The Shah's picture is everywhere. The beginning of all film showings in public theaters presents the Shah in various regal poses accompanied by the strains of the National Anthem&nbsp;... The monarch also actively extends his influence to all phases of social affairs&nbsp;... there is hardly any activity or vocation in which the Shah or members of his family or his closest friends do not have a direct or at least a symbolic involvement.

Ethiopia and Iran, along with Turkey and Israel, were envisioned as an \"[[alliance of the periphery]]\" that would constrain Arab power in the greater Middle East.\n\nIn an era of high oil prices, Iran's economy boomed while the economies of the Western nations were trapped in [[stagflation]] (economic stagnation and inflation) after the 1973\u201374 oil shocks, which seemed to prove the greatness of Mohammad Reza both to himself and to the rest of the world.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 66\">Zonis, Marvin.

For most ordinary Iranians, struggling with inflation, poverty, air pollution (Iranian cities in the 1970s were amongst the most polluted in the world), having to pay extortion payments to the police who demanded money from even those performing legal jobs such as selling fruits on the street, and daily traffic jams, the Shah's sponsorship of international conferences were just a waste of money and time.<ref>Zonis, Marvin.

He curbed the power of certain ancient elite factions by expropriating large and medium-sized estates for the benefit of more than four million small farmers. He took a number of other major measures, including extending [[suffrage]] to women and the participation of workers in factories through shares and other measures. In the 1970s, the governmental programme of free-of-charge nourishment for children at school known as \"Taghziye R\u0101yegan\" ([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u062a\u063a\u0630\u06cc\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0646 lit. ''free nourishment'') was implemented. Under the Shah's reign, the national Iranian income showed an unprecedented rise for an extended period.\n\n[[File:Atomic women Iran.JPG|thumb|left|Iranian newspaper clip from 1968, reading: \"A quarter of Iran's nuclear energy scientists are women\", a marked change in women's rights.]]\n\nImprovement of the educational system was made through the creation of new elementary schools. In addition, literacy courses were set up in remote villages by the [[Imperial Iranian Armed Forces]], this initiative being called \"Sep\u0101h-e D\u0101nesh\" ([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u0633\u067e\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634) meaning \"Army of Knowledge\". The Armed Forces were also engaged in infrastructural and other educational projects throughout the country \"Sep\u0101h-e Tarvij va \u0100b\u0101d\u0101ni\" ([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u0633\u067e\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u062c \u0648 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc lit.

The Shah instituted exams for Islamic theologians to become established clerics. Many Iranian university students were sent to and supported in foreign, especially Western, countries and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1977, the number of universities increased in number from 7 to 22, the number of institutions of advanced learning rose from 47 to 200, and the number of students in higher education soared from 36,742 to 100,000. Iran's literacy programs were among the most innovative and effective anywhere in the world, so that by 1977 the number of Iranians able to read and write had climbed from just 17 percent to more than 50 percent.<ref>Amir Taheri, \"New Frame for a New Picture,\" ''Kayhan International'', June 10, 1978.</ref>\n\nIn the field of diplomacy, Iran realised and maintained friendly relations with Western and East European countries as well as the state of [[Israel]] and China and became, especially through its close friendship with the United States, more and more a hegemonial power in the [[Persian Gulf]] region and the Middle East. The suppression of the communist guerrilla movement in the region of [[Dhofar]] in Oman with the help of the Iranian army after a formal request by [[Qaboos bin Said al Said|Sultan Qaboos]] was widely regarded in this context.\n\nAs to infrastructural and technological progress, the Shah continued and developed further the policies introduced by his father. His programmes included projects in technologies such as steel, telecommunications, petrochemical facilities, power plants, dams and the automobile industry. The [[Sharif University of Technology|Aryamehr University of Technology]] was established as a major new academic institution.<ref>Robert Graham, Iran, St. Martins, January 1979</ref><ref>Gholam Reza Afkhami, The Life and Times of the Shah, University of California Press, January 2009, {{ISBN|0-520-25328-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25328-5}}</ref><ref>Abbas Milani, The Persian Sphinx: Amir Abbas Hoveyda and the Riddle of the Iranian Revolution, Mage Publishers,  1 October 2003; {{ISBN|0-934211-88-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-934211-88-8}}</ref>\n\nInternational cultural cooperation was encouraged and organised, such as the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] and [[Shiraz Arts Festival]]. As part of his various financial support programmes in the fields of culture and arts, the Shah, along with King Hussein of Jordan made a donation to the [[Chinese Muslim Association]] for the construction of the [[Taipei Grand Mosque]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Islam in Taiwan|author=Peter G.

''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 160.</ref>\n\nIn June 1978, Mohammad Reza's French doctors first revealed to the French government how serious his cancer was, and in September the French government informed the American government that the Shah was dying of cancer; until then, U.S. officials had no idea that Mohammad Reza had even been diagnosed with cancer four years earlier.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 160\"/> The Shah had created a very centralised system in which he was the key decision-maker on all issues, and as the Iranian-American historian Abbas Milani noted, he was mentally crippled in the summer of 1978 owing to his tendency to be indecisive when faced with a crisis which, combined with his cancer and the effects of the anti-cancer drugs, made his mood \"increasingly volatile and unpredictable. One day, he was full of verve and optimism and the next day or hour he fell into a catatonic stupor,\" bringing the entire government to a halt.<ref>Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref> Milani wrote that the Shah was in 1978 \"beset with depression, indecision and paralysis, and his indecision led to the immobilisation of the entire system.\"<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas The Shah, p. 409\">Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 409.</ref> Empress Farah grew so frustrated with her husband that she suggested numerous times that he leave Iran for medical treatment and appoint her regent, saying she would handle the crisis and save the House of Pahlavi.

There were several instances where army units had opened fire, the most significant being the events on 8 September 1978. The day, which later became known as \"Black Friday\", thousands of people had gathered in Tehran's Jaleh Square for a religious demonstration. With the population generally refusing to recognise martial law, the soldiers opened fire, killing and seriously injuring a large number of people. Black Friday played a crucial role in further radicalising the protest movement. The massacre so reduced the chance for reconciliation that Black Friday is referred to as \"the point of no return\" for the revolution.<ref>The Persian Sphinx: Amir Abbas Hoveyda and the Riddle of the Iranian Revolution, Abbas Milani, pp. 292\u2013293</ref><ref>Seven Events That Made America America, By [[Larry Schweikart]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=BMnUBQJBbgIC&pg=PT147&lpg=PT147&dq=shah+was+finished+after+Black+Friday&source=bl&ots=cO3GMfUWGj&sig=RGLg1EqzPDPZ1PoXL8bcle9__JM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QP16UJ_7Cof7iwLpq4DYAg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=shah%20was%20finished%20after%20Black%20Friday&f=false p.]</ref><ref>''The Iranian Revolution of 1978/1979 and How Western Newspapers Reported It'' by Edgar Kl\u00fcsener, p. 12</ref><ref>''Cultural History After Foucault'' by John Neubauer, p. 64</ref><ref>''Islam in the World Today: A Handbook of Politics, Religion, Culture, and Society''  by Werner Ende, Udo Steinbach, p. 264</ref><ref>''The A to Z of Iran'', by John H.

This became a major scandal, as the contrast between the dazzling elegance of the celebration and the misery of the nearby villages was so dramatic that no one could ignore it. Months before the festivities, university students went on strike in protest. Indeed, the cost was so sufficiently impressive that the Shah forbade his associates to discuss the actual figures. However he and his supporters argued that the celebrations opened new investments in Iran, improved relationships with the other leaders and nations of the world, and provided greater recognition of Iran.<ref>(R.W Cottam, ''Nationalism in Iran'', p. 329)</ref><ref>Michael Ledeen & William Lewis, ''Debacle: The American Failure in Iran'', Knopf, p. 22</ref>\n\n[[File:Ghassem Rezai With Shah.jpg|thumb|The Shah and the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Hassan Ali Mansur]], [[Niavaran Palace]], 1964]]\n\nOther actions that are thought to have contributed to his downfall include antagonising formerly apolitical Iranians \u2013 especially merchants of the bazaars \u2013 with the creation in 1975 of a [[single party]] political monopoly (the ''Rastakhiz'' Party), with compulsory membership and dues, and general aggressive interference in the political, economic, and religious concerns of people's lives;<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'' (1982) pp. 442\u20136.</ref> and the 1976 change from an [[Islamic calendar]] to an Imperial calendar, marking the conquest of [[Babylon]] by [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] as the first day, instead of the migration of [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]].

While school attendance rose (by 1966 the school attendance of urban seven- to fourteen-year-olds was estimated at 75.8%), Iran's labour market could not absorb a high number of educated youth. In 1966, high school graduates had \"a higher rate of unemployment than did the illiterate\", and the educated unemployed often supported the revolution.<ref>Fischer, Michael M.J., ''Iran, From Religious Dispute to Revolution'', Harvard University Press, 1980, p. 59</ref>\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Henry Boniet in Cuernavaca, Mexico, 1979.jpg|thumb|The Shah and Henry Boniet in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]], in 1979]]\n\nDuring his second exile, Mohammad Reza travelled from country to country seeking what he hoped would be temporary residence. First he flew to [[Aswan]], [[Egypt]], where he received a warm and gracious welcome from President [[Anwar El-Sadat]]. He later lived in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]] as a guest of King [[Hassan II]]. Mohammad Reza loved to support royalty during his time as Shah and one of those who benefitted had been Hassan, who received an interest-free loan of US$110&nbsp;million from his friend.<ref>Milani, Abbas.

He was offered treatment in [[Switzerland]], but insisted on treatment in the United States. President Carter did not wish to admit Mohammad Reza to the U.S. but came under pressure from many quarters, with Henry Kissinger phoning Carter to say he would not endorse the SALT II treaty that Carter had just signed with the Soviet Union unless the former Shah was allowed into the United States, reportedly prompting Carter more than once to hang up his phone in rage in the [[Oval Office]] and shout \"Fuck the Shah!\".<ref>Milani, Abbas. ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 420</ref> As many Republicans were attacking the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II treaty]] as an American give-away to the Soviet Union, Carter was anxious to have the endorsement of a Republican elder statesman like Kissinger to fend off this criticism. Mohammad Reza had decided not to tell his Mexican doctors he had cancer, and the Mexican doctors had misdiagnosed his illness as malaria, giving him a regime of anti-malarial drugs that did nothing to treat his cancer, which caused his health to go into rapid decline as he lost 30 pounds.<ref>Milani, Abbas. ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 420.</ref> In September 1979, a doctor sent by [[David Rockefeller]] reported to the State Department that Mohammad Reza needed to come to the United States for medical treatment, an assessment not shared by Kean, who stated that the proper medical equipment for treating Mohammad Reza's cancer could be found in Mexico and the only problem was the former Shah's unwillingness to tell the Mexicans he had cancer.<ref>Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, pp. 420\u2013421.</ref> The State Department warned Carter not to admit the former Shah into the U.S., saying it was likely that the Iranian regime would seize the American embassy in Tehran if that occurred.<ref>Milani, Abbas.

His prolonged stay in the United States was extremely unpopular with the revolutionary movement in Iran, which still resented the United States' overthrow of [[Mosaddegh|Prime Minister Mosaddegh]] and the years of support for the Shah's rule.

This caused riots by Panamanians who objected to the Shah being in their country. General [[Omar Torrijos]], the dictator of Panama kept Mohammad Reza as a virtual prisoner at the Paitilla Medical Center, a hospital condemned by the former Shah's American doctors as \"an inadequate and poorly staffed hospital\", and in order to hasten his death allowed only Panamanian doctors to treat his cancer.<ref>Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 164</ref> General Torrijos, a populist left-winger had only taken in Mohammad Reza under heavy American pressure, and he made no secret of his dislike of Mohammad Reza, whom he called after meeting him \"the saddest man he had ever met\".<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 427\">Milani, Abbas. ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 427.</ref> When he first met Mohammad Reza, Torrijos taunted him by telling him \"it must be hard to fall off the Peacock Throne into Contadora\" and called him a \"''chupon''\", a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term meaning an ''orange'' that has all the juice squeezed out of it, which is slang for someone who is finished.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 427\"/>\n\nTorrijos added to Mohammad Reza's misery by making his chief bodyguard a militantly Marxist sociology professor who spent much time lecturing Mohammad Reza on how he deserved his fate because he been a tool of the \"American imperialism\" that was oppressing the Third World, and charged Mohammad Reza a monthly rent of US$21,000, making him pay for all his food and the wages of the 200 National Guardsmen assigned as his bodyguards.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 427\"/> The [[The Interim Government of Iran|new government]] in Iran still demanded his and [[Farah Pahlavi|his wife's]] immediate extradition to Tehran. A short time after Mohammad Reza's arrival in Panama, an Iranian ambassador was dispatched to the Central American nation carrying a 450-p. extradition request. That official appeal alarmed both the Shah and his advisors. Whether the Panamanian government would have complied is a matter of speculation amongst historians.<ref>Milani, Abbas.

The Shah's diagnosis of cancer would not be revealed to him until 1978. Medical reports given to the Shah were falsified and altered in order to state that the Shah was in good health to conceal his cancer from him. The Shah later met with French physicians in 1976 in Zurich who were disturbed by the Shah's abnormal blood count.

Despite substantial opposition from Shiite religious jurists, the [[Women's rights movement in Iran|Iranian feminist movement]], led by activists such as Fatemah Sayyeh, achieved further advancement under Mohammad Reza. His regime's changes focused on the civil sphere, and private-oriented family law remained restrictive, although the 1967 and 1975 Family Protection Laws attempted to reform this trend.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Syracuse University Press|title=Gendering the Middle East: Emerging Perspectives|last=Deniz|first=Kandiyoti|year=1996|pages=54\u201356|isbn=0-8156-0339-8}}</ref> During the reign of the Shah, women gained the right to freely choose any profession, for example first female Iranian ministers such as [[Farrokhroo Parsa]] and judges such as [[Shirin Ebadi]], while [[Mehrangiz Dowlatshahi]] became the first female cabinet member and ambassador of Iran. These activities alienated Islamic traditionalists and hastened the fall of the Shah.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\n[[File:Shah-zahedi-haj.jpg|thumb|Mohammad Reza during his [[Hajj]] pilgrimage in the 1970s]]\n\nFrom his mother, Mohammad Reza inherited an almost messianic belief in his own greatness and that God was working in his favour, which explained the often passive and fatalistic attitudes that he displayed as an adult.<ref>Milani, Abbas. ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, pp. 23\u201324.</ref> In 1973, Mohammad Reza told the Italian journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]]:<blockquote>A king who does not need to account to anyone for what he says and does is unavoidably doomed to loneliness. However, I am not entirely alone, because a force others can't perceive accompanies me. My mystical force. Moreover, I receive messages. I have lived with God besides me since I was 5 years old.

Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was recognized as the [[List of Shia Islamic dynasties|last Shia Muslim king]] in Islamic history.]]\n\nMohamed Reza often spoke in public and in private from childhood onward of his belief that God had chosen him for a \"divine mission\" to transform Iran, as he believed that dreams he had as a child of the Twelve Imams of Shia Islam were all messages from God.<ref>Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, pp. 21 & 150\u2013151.</ref> In his 1961 book ''Mission for My Country'', Mohammad Reza wrote: <blockquote>From the time I was six or seven, I have felt that perhaps there is a supreme being, who is guiding me. I don't know. Sometimes the thought disturbs me because then, I ask myself, what is my own personality, and am I possessed of free will? Still, I often reflect, if I am driven-or perhaps I should say supported-by another force, there must be a reason.<ref>Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 152.</ref></blockquote> In his biography of the Shah, [[Marvin Zonis]] has argued that Mohammad Reza really believed in these claims of divine support. Shia Islam has no tradition of describing Shahs being favoured with messages from God, very few Shahs had ever claimed that their dreams were divine messages, and most people in the West laughed and snickered at Mohammad Reza's claim that his dreams were messages from God.<ref>Zonis, Marvin.

All political personalities who had suffered disgrace during his father's reign were rehabilitated, and the forced unveiling policy inaugurated by his father in 1935 was overturned. Despite the young king's enlightened decisions, the British Minister in Tehran reported to London that \"the young Shah received a fairly spontaneous welcome on his first public experience, possibly rather [due] to relief at the disappearance of his father than to public affection for himself\".

The young Shah possessed a decidedly more refined temperament, and amongst the unsavory developments that \"would haunt him when he was king\" were the political disgrace brought by his father on [[Teymourtash]]; the dismissal of Foroughi by the mid-1930s; and [[Ali Akbar Davar]]'s suicide in 1937.<ref>Gholam Reza Afghami. ''The Life and Times of the Shah'' (2009), p. 34 f.</ref> An even more significant decision that cast a long shadow was the disastrous and one-sided agreement his father had negotiated with the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC) in 1933, one which compromised the country's ability to receive more favourable returns from oil extracted from the country.\n\n===Relationship with his exiled father===\nMohammad Reza expressed concern for his exiled father who had previously complained to the British governor of Mauritius that living on the island was both a climatic and social prison. Attentively following his life in exile, Mohammad Reza would object to his father's treatment to British at any opportunity.

The Prime Minister requested direct control of the army from the [[Majlis]]. Given the situation, alongside the strong personal support of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] for covert action, the American government gave the go-ahead to a committee, attended by the Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]], Kermit Roosevelt, Henderson, and [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]]. Kermit Roosevelt returned to Iran on 13 July 1953, and again on 1 August 1953, in his first meeting with the king. A car picked him up at midnight and drove him to the palace. He lay down on the seat and covered himself with a blanket as guards waved his driver through the gates. The Shah got into the car and Roosevelt explained the mission. The CIA bribed him with $1&nbsp;million in Iranian currency, which Roosevelt had stored in a large safe \u2013 a bulky cache, given the then exchange rate of 1,000 rial to 15 dollars.<ref>Robert Graham, ''Iran: The Illusion of Power'', p. 66.</ref>\n\nThe Communists staged massive demonstrations to hijack Mosaddegh's initiatives, and the United States actively plotted against him. On 16 August 1953, the right wing of the Army attacked. Armed with an order by the Shah, it appointed General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] as prime minister. A coalition of mobs and retired officers close to the Palace executed this coup d'\u00e9tat. They failed dismally and the Shah decided to leave the country. ''[[Ettelaat]]'', the nation's largest daily newspaper, and its pro-Shah publisher, Abbas Masudi, were against him, calling the defeat \"humiliating\".<ref>''New York Times'', 23 July 1953, 1:5.</ref>\n\nDuring the following two days, the Communists turned against Mosaddegh. Opposition against him grew tremendously. They roamed Tehran, raising red flags and pulling down statues of Reza Shah. This was rejected by conservative clerics like [[Abol-Ghasem Kashani|Kashani]] and [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] leaders like [[Hossein Makki]], who sided with the king. On 18 August 1953, Mosaddegh defended the government against this new attack.

In the meantime, according to the CIA plot, Zahedi appealed to the military, claimed to be the legitimate prime minister and charged Mosaddegh with staging a coup by ignoring the Shah's decree.

In the year 2000, reflecting on this notion, US Secretary of State [[Madeleine K.

Mohammad Reza had strong etatist tendencies and was deeply involved in the economy with his economic policies bearing a strong resemblance to the same etatist policies being pursued by General  [[Park Chung-hee]] in South Korea at the same time. Mohammad Reza considered himself to be a socialist, saying he was \"more socialist and revolutionary than anyone\".<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 313\"/> Reflecting his self-proclaimed socialist tendencies, though unions were illegal, but the Shah brought in labour laws that were \"surprising fair to workers\".<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 314\"/> Iran in the  1960s and 70s was a tolerant place for the Jewish minority with one Iranian Jew, David Menasheri, remembering that Mohammad Reza's reign was the \"golden age\" for Iranian Jews when they were equals, and when the Iranian Jewish community was one of the wealthiest Jewish communities in the world. The Baha'i minority also did well after the bout of persecution in the mid-1950s ended with several Baha'i families becoming prominent in world of Iranian business.<ref>Milani, Abbas.

While the arrangement did not preclude other partnerships and treaties, it helped to provide a somewhat stable environment in which Mohammad Reza could implement his reforms. Another factor guiding Mohammad Reza in his foreign policy was his wish for financial stability, which required strong diplomatic ties. A third factor was his wish to present Iran as a prosperous and powerful nation; this fuelled his domestic policy of Westernisation and reform. A final component was his promise that communism could be halted at Iran's border if his monarchy was preserved. By 1977, the country's treasury, the Shah's autocracy, and his strategic alliances seemed to form a protective layer around Iran.<ref>Precht, Henry.

It also envisioned [[Afghanistan]]'s joining at some time in the future. The Shah was the first regional leader to recognise the [[State of Israel]] as a ''de facto'' state. Although when interviewed on [[CBS 60 Minutes|''60 Minutes'']] by reporter [[Mike Wallace]], he criticised [[American Jews]] for their presumed control over U.S. media and finance, those remarks were intended to pacify Arab critics, and bilateral relations between Iran and Israel were not adversely affected.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5EXLpXeoXkC&pg=PT84#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Israel's Quest for Recognition and Acceptance in Asia|last=Abadi|first=Joseph|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers / Routledge|year=2004|page=84}}</ref> In a 1967 memo to President [[Lyndon B.

In return, [[Seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Iran took full control]] of [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]] and [[Abu Musa]] in the [[Strait of Hormuz]], three strategically sensitive islands which were claimed by the [[United Arab Emirates]]. During this period, the Shah maintained cordial relations with the Persian Gulf states and established close diplomatic ties with [[Saudi Arabia]]. Mohammad Reza saw Iran as the natural dominant power in the Persian Gulf region, and tolerated no challenges to Iranian hegemony, a claim that was supported by a gargantuan arms-buying spree that started in the early 1960s.<ref>Karsh, Effraim.

In 1971, Mohammad Reza told a journalist: \"World events were such that we were compelled to accept the fact that sea adjoining the Oman Sea\u2014I mean the Indian Ocean\u2014does not recognise borders.

Mohammad Reza was distrustful of both the Socialist government of [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] and the [[Arab nationalist]] [[Baath party]]. He resented the internationally recognised Iran-Iraq border on the [[Shatt al-Arab]] river, which a 1937 treaty fixed on the low watermark on the Iranian side, giving Iraq control of most of the Shatt al-Arab.<ref>Zonis, Marvin.

In a July 1969 visit to Guam, President Nixon had announced the Nixon Doctrine, which declared that the United States would honour its treaty commitments in Asia, but \"as far as the problems of international security are concerned&nbsp;... the United States is going to encourage and has a right to expect that this problem will increasingly be handled by, and the responsibility for it taken by, the Asian nations themselves.\"<ref name=\"Karsh, Effraim, p. 199\"/> The particular Asian nation the Nixon Doctrine was aimed at was [[South Vietnam]], but the Shah seized upon the doctrine, with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for their own defence, to argue that the Americans should sell him arms without limitation, a suggestion that Nixon embraced.<ref name=\"Karsh, Effraim, p. 199\"/> A particular dynamic was established in American-Iranian relations from 1969 onward, in which the Americans gave in to whatever Mohammad Reza demanded, as they felt they needed a strong Iran as a pro-American force in the Middle East and could not afford to lose Iran as an ally.<ref name=\"Karsh, Effraim, p. 200\">Karsh, Effraim ''Islamic Imperialism A History'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, p. 200.</ref> Further adding to the Shah's confidence was the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] of 1969, which forced the [[Red Army]] to make a major redeployment to the Chinese border.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 321\">Milani, Abbas. ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 321.</ref> Mohammad Reza, who always feared the prospect of a Soviet invasion, welcomed the Sino-Soviet war and the resulting reduction of Red Army divisions along the Soviet-Iranian border as giving him more room internationally.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 321\"/>\n\n[[File:Gerald Ford and Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi Whitehouse South Lawn.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Mohammad Reza and [[Gerald Ford]] on the [[South Lawn]], 1975]]\n\nUnder Nixon, the United States finally agreed to sever all contact with any Iranians opposed to the Shah's regime, a concession that Mohammad Reza had been seeking since 1958.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 318\"/> The often very anti-American tone of the Iranian press was ignored because Mohammad Reza supported the U.S. in the [[Vietnam War]] and likewise the Americans ignored the Shah's efforts to raise oil prices, despite the fact it cost many American consumers more.<ref name=\"Karsh, Effraim, p. 200\"/> After 1969, a process of \"reverse leverage\" set in, when Mohammad Reza began to dictate to the United States as the Americans needed him more than he needed the Americans.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 201\">Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 201.</ref> The American [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] wrote in 1982 that because of the Vietnam War, it was not politically possible in the 1970s for the United States to fight a major war: \"There was no possibility of assigning any American forces to the Indian Ocean in the midst of the Vietnam War and its attendant trauma. Congress would have tolerated no such commitment; the public would not have supported it. Fortunately, Iran was willing to play this role.\"<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 201\"/> Consequently, the Americans badly needed Iran as an ally, which allowed Mohammad Reza to dictate to them. This experience greatly boosted the Shah's ego, as he felt he was able to impose his will on the world's most powerful nation.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 201\"/>\n\nThe Americans initially rejected Mohammad Reza's suggestion that they join him in supporting the Iraqi Kurdish ''peshmerga'' fighting for independence on the grounds that an independent Kurdistan would inspire the Turkish Kurds to rebel, and they had no interest in antagonising the [[NATO]] member Turkey.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 360\"/> Some of the Shah's advisers also felt it was unwise to support the ''peshmerga'', saying that if the Iraqi Kurds won independence, then the Iranian Kurds would want to join them. When Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran in May 1972, the Shah convinced them to take a larger role in what had, up to then, been a mainly Israeli-Iranian operation to aid [[Iraqi Kurds]] in their struggles against Iraq, against the warnings of the CIA and State Department that the Shah would ultimately betray the Kurds. He did this in March 1975 with the signing of the [[1975 Algiers Agreement|Algiers Accord]] that settled Iraqi-Iranian border disputes, an action taken without prior consultation with the U.S., after which he cut off all aid to the Kurds and prevented the U.S. and Israel from using Iranian territory to provide them assistance.<ref name=\"nationalinterest21jan15\">{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-5-most-precarious-us-allies-all-time-12075?page=3 |title=The 5 Most Precarious US Allies of All Time|last1=Keck|first1=Zachary|date=21 January 2015 |website=National Interest.org|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs a way of increasing pressure on Baghdad, the ''peshmerga'' had been encouraged by Iran and the U.S. to abandon guerrilla war for conventional war in April 1974, so the years 1974\u201375 saw the heaviest fighting between the Iraqi Army and the ''[[peshmerga]]''. The sudden cut-off of Iranian support in March 1975 left the Kurds very exposed, causing them to be crushed by Iraq.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick, p. 298\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989, p. 298.</ref> The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote that \"...the Iraqis celebrated their victory in the usual manner, by executing as many of the rebels as they could lay their hands on.\"<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick, p. 298\"/> Kissinger later wrote in his memoirs that it was never the intention of the U.S. or Iran to see the ''peshmerga'' actually win, as an independent Kurdistan would have created too many problems for both Turkey and Iran; rather, the intention was to \"irritate\" Iraq enough to force the Iraqis to change their foreign policy.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 360\"/>\n\n[[File:ShahOPECmembers.jpg|thumb|Mohammad Reza shakes hands with members of [[OPEC]] in a landmark session in Tehran, 1970]]\n\nThe Shah also used America's dependence on Middle Eastern oil as leverage; although Iran did not participate in the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]], he purposely increased production in its aftermath to capitalise on the higher prices. In December 1973, only two months after oil prices were raised by 70 per cent, he urged [[OPEC]] nations to push prices even higher, which they agreed to do, more than doubling the price. Oil prices increased 470 per cent over a 12-month period, which also increased Iran's GDP by 50 per cent. Despite personal pleas from President Nixon, the Shah ignored any complaints, claimed the U.S. was importing more oil than any time in the past, and proclaimed that \"the industrial world will have to realise that the era of their terrific progress and even more terrific income and wealth based on cheap oil is finished.\"<ref name=\"nationalinterest21jan15\"/>\n\n===Modernisation and evolution of government===\n{{Further|White Revolution}}\n[[File:Shahanshah visit microwave network.jpg|thumb|After opening the Micro-wave station, the Shah visits its different departments, 1970]]\n\nWith Iran's great oil wealth, the Shah became the preeminent leader of the Middle East, and self-styled \"Guardian\" of the [[Persian Gulf]]. In 1961 he defended his style of rule, saying \"When Iranians learn to behave like Swedes, I will behave like the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]].\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/americasmission00tony/page/255 <!-- quote=when iranians learn to behave like swedes. -->  America's Mission: The United States and the Worldwide Struggle for Democracy in the Twentieth Century]. Tony Smith. Princeton Princeton University Press: p. 255</ref>\n\nDuring the last years of his regime, the Shah's government became more autocratic. In the words of a U.S. Embassy dispatch: \"The Shah's picture is everywhere. The beginning of all film showings in public theaters presents the Shah in various regal poses accompanied by the strains of the National Anthem&nbsp;... The monarch also actively extends his influence to all phases of social affairs&nbsp;... there is hardly any activity or vocation in which the Shah or members of his family or his closest friends do not have a direct or at least a symbolic involvement. In the past, he had claimed to take a two-party system seriously and declared, 'If I were a dictator rather than a constitutional monarch, then I might be tempted to sponsor a single dominant party such as Hitler organised'.\"<ref>Mohammad Reza, Mission for my Country, London, 1961, p. 173</ref>\n \nHowever, by 1975, Mohammad Reza had abolished the two-party system of government in favour of a one-party state under the [[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]] (''Resurrection'') Party. This was the merger of the [[Iran Novin Party|New Iran Party]],<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen]], Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) ''Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I'', p. 59, {{ISBN|0-19-924958-X}}</ref> a centre-right party, and the [[People's Party (Iran)|People's Party]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard W.|last=Cottam|title=Nationalism in Iran: Updated Through 1978|year=1979|page=297|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=0-8229-7420-7}}</ref> a liberal party. The Shah justified his actions by declaring: \"We must straighten out Iranians' ranks. To do so, we divide them into two categories: those who believe in Monarchy, the constitution and the Six Bahman Revolution and those who don't&nbsp;... A person who does not enter the new political party and does not believe in the three cardinal principles will have only two choices.

The Empress Farah recalled of her days as a university student in 1950s France about being asked where she was from:<blockquote>When I told them Iran&nbsp;... the Europeans would recoil in horror as if Iranians were barbarians and loathsome. But after Iran became wealthy under the Shah in the 1970s, Iranians were courted everywhere. Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, Your Majesty. If you please, Your Majesty. Fawning all over us.

''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 221.</ref></blockquote> Mohammad Reza shared the Empress's sentiments as Westerners came begging to his court looking for his largesse, leading him to remark in 1976:\n<blockquote>Now we are the masters and our former masters are our slaves. Everyday they a beat a track to our door begging for favors. How can they be of assistance? Do we want arms? Do we want nuclear power stations? We have only to answer, and they will fulfill our wishes<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 221\"/></blockquote> Because the House of Pahlavi were a parvenu house as Reza Khan had begun his career as a private in the Persian Army, rising up to the rank of general, taking power in a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1921, and making himself Shah in 1925, Mohammad Reza was keen to gain the approval of the older royal families of the world, and was prepared to spend large sums of money to gain that social acceptance.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 6\">Milani, Abbas.

''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 204.</ref>  As an Iranian, Mohammad Reza greatly enjoyed supporting the Greek branch of the House of Gl\u00fccksburg, knowing the Greeks still celebrated their victories over the Persians in the 5th and 4th centuries BC.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 6\"/> He enjoyed close relations with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia, as demonstrated by the fact that he was the guest of honour at the [[2500 year celebration of Iran Monarchy|Persepolis celebrations]] in 1971. Ethiopia and Iran, along with Turkey and Israel, were envisioned as an \"[[alliance of the periphery]]\" that would constrain Arab power in the greater Middle East.\n\nIn an era of high oil prices, Iran's economy boomed while the economies of the Western nations were trapped in [[stagflation]] (economic stagnation and inflation) after the 1973\u201374 oil shocks, which seemed to prove the greatness of Mohammad Reza both to himself and to the rest of the world.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 66\">Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 66.</ref> In 1975, both the British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] and the French President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] made pleading phone calls to Mohammad Reza asking him for loans, which ultimately led the Shah to give a US$1&nbsp;billion loan to the United Kingdom and another US$1&nbsp;billion to France.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 66\"/> In a televised speech in January 1975 explaining why he was lending Britain a sum equal to US$1&nbsp;billion, Mohammad Reza declared in his usual grandiose style: \"I have known the most dark hours when our country was obliged to pass under the tutelage of foreign powers, amongst them England. Now I find that England has not only become our friend, our equal, but also the nation to which, should we be able, we will render assistance with pleasure,\" going on to say that since he \"belonged to this [European] world,\" he did not want Europe to collapse economically.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 66\"/> As Britain had often dominated Iran in the past, the change in roles was greatly gratifying to Mohammad Reza.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 66\"/>\n\n[[File:Azemat e bazyafteh - entesharat e universal cover book.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Regained Glory'', a biography of Mohammad Reza, 1976. Like much of the imagery surrounding Mohammad Reza, the cover references the Achaemenid period.]]\n\nCourtiers at the Imperial court were devoted to stroking the Shah's ego, competing to be the most sycophantic, with Mohammad Reza being regularly assured he was a greater leader than his much admired General de Gaulle, that democracy was doomed, and that based on Rockefeller's speech, that the American people wanted Mohammad Reza to be their leader, as well as doing such a great job as Shah of Iran.<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 3\"/> All of this praise boosted Mohammad Reza's ego, and he went from being a merely narcissistic man to a megalomaniac, believing himself a man chosen by Allah Himself to transform Iran and create the \"Great Civilisation.\"<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 61\"/><ref name=\"Milani, Abbas, p. 3\"/> When one of the Shah's courtiers suggested launching a campaign to award him the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], he wrote on the margin: \"If they beg us, we might accept.

''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 310.</ref> Befitting all this attention and praise, Mohammad Reza started to make increasingly outlandish claims for the \"Great Civilisation\", telling the Italian journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]] in a 1973 interview:<blockquote>Halfway measures, compromises, are unfeasible. In other words, either one is a revolutionary or one demands law and order. One can't be a revolutionary with law and order. And even less with tolerance&nbsp;... when Castro came to power, he killed at least 10,000 people&nbsp;... in a sense, he was really capable, because he's still in power. So am I, however! And I intend to stay there, and to demonstrate that one can achieve a great many things by the use of force, show even that your old socialism is finished. Old, obsolete, finished&nbsp;...

As I said, we are going to be a member of your club\".<ref>Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 222.</ref> In a press conference on March 31, 1974, Mohammad Reza predicted what Iran would be like in 1984, saying:<blockquote>In the cities, electric cars would replace the gas engines and mass transportation systems would be switched to electricity, monorail over the ground or electric buses. And, furthermore, in the great era of civilization that lies ahead of our people, there will be least two or three holidays a week.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 65\">Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 65.</ref></blockquote> In 1976, Mohammad Reza told the Egyptian journalist [[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal]] in an interview: \"I want the standard of living in Iran in ten years' time to be exactly on a level with that in Europe today.

For most ordinary Iranians, struggling with inflation, poverty, air pollution (Iranian cities in the 1970s were amongst the most polluted in the world), having to pay extortion payments to the police who demanded money from even those performing legal jobs such as selling fruits on the street, and daily traffic jams, the Shah's sponsorship of international conferences were just a waste of money and time.<ref>Zonis, Marvin. ''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, pp. 80 & 221.</ref> Furthermore, conferences on pre-Islamic practices such as the cult of [[Mithra]] fuelled religious anxieties.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 81\">Zonis, Marvin.

He curbed the power of certain ancient elite factions by expropriating large and medium-sized estates for the benefit of more than four million small farmers. He took a number of other major measures, including extending [[suffrage]] to women and the participation of workers in factories through shares and other measures. In the 1970s, the governmental programme of free-of-charge nourishment for children at school known as \"Taghziye R\u0101yegan\" ([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u062a\u063a\u0630\u06cc\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0646 lit. ''free nourishment'') was implemented. Under the Shah's reign, the national Iranian income showed an unprecedented rise for an extended period.\n\n[[File:Atomic women Iran.JPG|thumb|left|Iranian newspaper clip from 1968, reading: \"A quarter of Iran's nuclear energy scientists are women\", a marked change in women's rights.]]\n\nImprovement of the educational system was made through the creation of new elementary schools. In addition, literacy courses were set up in remote villages by the [[Imperial Iranian Armed Forces]], this initiative being called \"Sep\u0101h-e D\u0101nesh\" ([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u0633\u067e\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634) meaning \"Army of Knowledge\".

The Shah instituted exams for Islamic theologians to become established clerics. Many Iranian university students were sent to and supported in foreign, especially Western, countries and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1977, the number of universities increased in number from 7 to 22, the number of institutions of advanced learning rose from 47 to 200, and the number of students in higher education soared from 36,742 to 100,000. Iran's literacy programs were among the most innovative and effective anywhere in the world, so that by 1977 the number of Iranians able to read and write had climbed from just 17 percent to more than 50 percent.<ref>Amir Taheri, \"New Frame for a New Picture,\" ''Kayhan International'', June 10, 1978.</ref>\n\nIn the field of diplomacy, Iran realised and maintained friendly relations with Western and East European countries as well as the state of [[Israel]] and China and became, especially through its close friendship with the United States, more and more a hegemonial power in the [[Persian Gulf]] region and the Middle East. The suppression of the communist guerrilla movement in the region of [[Dhofar]] in Oman with the help of the Iranian army after a formal request by [[Qaboos bin Said al Said|Sultan Qaboos]] was widely regarded in this context.\n\nAs to infrastructural and technological progress, the Shah continued and developed further the policies introduced by his father. His programmes included projects in technologies such as steel, telecommunications, petrochemical facilities, power plants, dams and the automobile industry.

''Majestic Failure: The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 160.</ref>\n\nIn June 1978, Mohammad Reza's French doctors first revealed to the French government how serious his cancer was, and in September the French government informed the American government that the Shah was dying of cancer; until then, U.S. officials had no idea that Mohammad Reza had even been diagnosed with cancer four years earlier.<ref name=\"Zonis, Marvin, p. 160\"/> The Shah had created a very centralised system in which he was the key decision-maker on all issues, and as the Iranian-American historian Abbas Milani noted, he was mentally crippled in the summer of 1978 owing to his tendency to be indecisive when faced with a crisis which, combined with his cancer and the effects of the anti-cancer drugs, made his mood \"increasingly volatile and unpredictable. One day, he was full of verve and optimism and the next day or hour he fell into a catatonic stupor,\" bringing the entire government to a halt.<ref>Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref> Milani wrote that the Shah was in 1978 \"beset with depression, indecision and paralysis, and his indecision led to the immobilisation of the entire system.\"<ref name=\"Milani, Abbas The Shah, p. 409\">Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 409.</ref> Empress Farah grew so frustrated with her husband that she suggested numerous times that he leave Iran for medical treatment and appoint her regent, saying she would handle the crisis and save the House of Pahlavi.

There were several instances where army units had opened fire, the most significant being the events on 8 September 1978. The day, which later became known as \"Black Friday\", thousands of people had gathered in Tehran's Jaleh Square for a religious demonstration. With the population generally refusing to recognise martial law, the soldiers opened fire, killing and seriously injuring a large number of people. Black Friday played a crucial role in further radicalising the protest movement. The massacre so reduced the chance for reconciliation that Black Friday is referred to as \"the point of no return\" for the revolution.<ref>The Persian Sphinx: Amir Abbas Hoveyda and the Riddle of the Iranian Revolution, Abbas Milani, pp. 292\u2013293</ref><ref>Seven Events That Made America America, By [[Larry Schweikart]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=BMnUBQJBbgIC&pg=PT147&lpg=PT147&dq=shah+was+finished+after+Black+Friday&source=bl&ots=cO3GMfUWGj&sig=RGLg1EqzPDPZ1PoXL8bcle9__JM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QP16UJ_7Cof7iwLpq4DYAg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=shah%20was%20finished%20after%20Black%20Friday&f=false p.]</ref><ref>''The Iranian Revolution of 1978/1979 and How Western Newspapers Reported It'' by Edgar Kl\u00fcsener, p. 12</ref><ref>''Cultural History After Foucault'' by John Neubauer, p. 64</ref><ref>''Islam in the World Today: A Handbook of Politics, Religion, Culture, and Society''  by Werner Ende, Udo Steinbach, p. 264</ref><ref>''The A to Z of Iran'', by John H.

First he flew to [[Aswan]], [[Egypt]], where he received a warm and gracious welcome from President [[Anwar El-Sadat]]. He later lived in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]] as a guest of King [[Hassan II]]. Mohammad Reza loved to support royalty during his time as Shah and one of those who benefitted had been Hassan, who received an interest-free loan of US$110&nbsp;million from his friend.<ref>Milani, Abbas.

He was offered treatment in [[Switzerland]], but insisted on treatment in the United States. President Carter did not wish to admit Mohammad Reza to the U.S. but came under pressure from many quarters, with Henry Kissinger phoning Carter to say he would not endorse the SALT II treaty that Carter had just signed with the Soviet Union unless the former Shah was allowed into the United States, reportedly prompting Carter more than once to hang up his phone in rage in the [[Oval Office]] and shout \"Fuck the Shah!\".<ref>Milani, Abbas. ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 420</ref> As many Republicans were attacking the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II treaty]] as an American give-away to the Soviet Union, Carter was anxious to have the endorsement of a Republican elder statesman like Kissinger to fend off this criticism. Mohammad Reza had decided not to tell his Mexican doctors he had cancer, and the Mexican doctors had misdiagnosed his illness as malaria, giving him a regime of anti-malarial drugs that did nothing to treat his cancer, which caused his health to go into rapid decline as he lost 30 pounds.<ref>Milani, Abbas. ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 420.</ref> In September 1979, a doctor sent by [[David Rockefeller]] reported to the State Department that Mohammad Reza needed to come to the United States for medical treatment, an assessment not shared by Kean, who stated that the proper medical equipment for treating Mohammad Reza's cancer could be found in Mexico and the only problem was the former Shah's unwillingness to tell the Mexicans he had cancer.<ref>Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, pp. 420\u2013421.</ref> The State Department warned Carter not to admit the former Shah into the U.S., saying it was likely that the Iranian regime would seize the American embassy in Tehran if that occurred.<ref>Milani, Abbas.

This caused riots by Panamanians who objected to the Shah being in their country. General [[Omar Torrijos]], the dictator of Panama kept Mohammad Reza as a virtual prisoner at the Paitilla Medical Center, a hospital condemned by the former Shah's American doctors as \"an inadequate and poorly staffed hospital\", and in order to hasten his death allowed only Panamanian doctors to treat his cancer.<ref>Zonis, Marvin.

A short time after Mohammad Reza's arrival in Panama, an Iranian ambassador was dispatched to the Central American nation carrying a 450-p. extradition request. That official appeal alarmed both the Shah and his advisors. Whether the Panamanian government would have complied is a matter of speculation amongst historians.<ref>Milani, Abbas.

The Shah's diagnosis of cancer would not be revealed to him until 1978. Medical reports given to the Shah were falsified and altered in order to state that the Shah was in good health to conceal his cancer from him. The Shah later met with French physicians in 1976 in Zurich who were disturbed by the Shah's abnormal blood count.

The image of the crown was the centerpiece of the imperial standard of the Shah.\n\nThe personal standards consisted of a field of pale blue, the traditional colour of the Iranian imperial family, at the centre of which was placed the heraldic motif of the individual. The Imperial Iranian national flag was placed in the top left quadrant of each standard. The appropriate imperial standard was flown beside the national flag when the individual was present.

The department operates in an area of 148.61 square miles across two counties (384.91&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and a population of 212,237 people.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Birmingham Police Evening Shift.jpg|left|thumb|Birmingham Police Evening Shift, Year Unknown]]\nWhen Birmingham's first city government took office in 1871 under Mayor Robert Henley, he appointed a City Marshal, O. D. Williams, to direct the efforts of two patrolmen, Robert Bailey and Henry Clay Atkins. Henley made himself available to assist with patrols if needed before he was forced to resign due to tuberculosis.\n\nThe second administration, under James Powell, took office on January 6, 1873 and installed W. G. Oliver as Marshal. He initially commanding a force of three patrolmen, Ed Taylor, Robert Bailey and A. Robinson, but the young department was expanded with ten new recruits over the course of that year. Those included W. L. Cantelou, Jule Wright, James Armstrong, William Harris, J. D. Lykes, M. Hagerty, William Clay, J. L. Ellison, W. W. Coxe and John Coxe. That force held strong for the next year, but was reduced back to five men, headed by E. G. Taylor, during William Morris' second administration in 1876. Under Thomas Jeffers's administration, it was reduced back to three, with Ben Plosser commanding William Seay and John B. Lewis. Plosser was succeeded by L. M. Teal in 1878.\n\nMayor A. O. Lane elevated the city government beginning in 1882. He brought W. G. Oliver back as Marshal and also appointed John Thompson to serve as Captain of Police, commanding officers G. W. Merritt, J. A. Brock, J. A. Mingea, W. S. Nelson, J. S. Barksdale, C. K. Dickey, G. J. Tomlin and T. P. Hagood. The annual payroll for the department was $540 in 1882. A new set of uniforms was required to be worn while on duty.\n\nIn 1884 Frank Gafford and O. A. Pickard succeeded Oliver and Thompson as Marshal and Captain, respectively. Gafford oversaw the organization of the city's first professional Fire Department in 1885. J. H. Mingea, J. G. Smith, William Burwell, J. B. Donelson, H. U. McKinney, T. J. Boggan, A. H. Maynor and James McGee were sworn in as new officers that term. The department's payroll for 1886 had risen to $970.\n\nFor Lane's third term, Pickard was elevated to City Marshal. Newly-sworn officers included J. D. Anderson, Charles Martin, J. M. Nix, W. M. Turner, W. J. Carlisle, A. L. Sexton, R. M. Saunders, W. H. Pinkerton, T. Z. Hagood, Richard Smoot Jr, James Turner, B. R. Childers, Thomas Hart, J. S. Oldham, O. M. Hill, R. H. McCullum and James Hillary. The city's expense for the salaries and operation of the department in 1887 reached $12,500.\n\nThe first Birmingham Police officers to lose their lives in the line of duty were George Kirkley and J. W. Adams, who were killed in a shootout following the robbery of the Standard Oil offices on March 27, 1900.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Birmingham_Police_Department|title=Birmingham Police Department - Bhamwiki|website=www.bhamwiki.com|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\n\n=== Chief of Police ===\nThe Chief of Police is a sworn member of the police department appointed by the Mayor of the City of Birmingham.

The department operates in an area of 148.61 square miles across two counties (384.91&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and a population of 212,237 people.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Birmingham Police Evening Shift.jpg|left|thumb|Birmingham Police Evening Shift, Year Unknown]]\nWhen Birmingham's first city government took office in 1871 under Mayor Robert Henley, he appointed a City Marshal, O. D. Williams, to direct the efforts of two patrolmen, Robert Bailey and Henry Clay Atkins. Henley made himself available to assist with patrols if needed before he was forced to resign due to tuberculosis.\n\nThe second administration, under James Powell, took office on January 6, 1873 and installed W. G. Oliver as Marshal. He initially commanding a force of three patrolmen, Ed Taylor, Robert Bailey and A. Robinson, but the young department was expanded with ten new recruits over the course of that year. Those included W. L. Cantelou, Jule Wright, James Armstrong, William Harris, J. D. Lykes, M. Hagerty, William Clay, J. L. Ellison, W. W. Coxe and John Coxe. That force held strong for the next year, but was reduced back to five men, headed by E. G. Taylor, during William Morris' second administration in 1876. Under Thomas Jeffers's administration, it was reduced back to three, with Ben Plosser commanding William Seay and John B. Lewis. Plosser was succeeded by L. M. Teal in 1878.\n\nMayor A. O. Lane elevated the city government beginning in 1882. He brought W. G. Oliver back as Marshal and also appointed John Thompson to serve as Captain of Police, commanding officers G. W. Merritt, J. A. Brock, J. A. Mingea, W. S. Nelson, J. S. Barksdale, C. K. Dickey, G. J. Tomlin and T. P. Hagood. The annual payroll for the department was $540 in 1882. A new set of uniforms was required to be worn while on duty.\n\nIn 1884 Frank Gafford and O. A. Pickard succeeded Oliver and Thompson as Marshal and Captain, respectively. Gafford oversaw the organization of the city's first professional Fire Department in 1885. J. H. Mingea, J. G. Smith, William Burwell, J. B. Donelson, H. U. McKinney, T. J. Boggan, A. H. Maynor and James McGee were sworn in as new officers that term. The department's payroll for 1886 had risen to $970.\n\nFor Lane's third term, Pickard was elevated to City Marshal. Newly-sworn officers included J. D. Anderson, Charles Martin, J. M. Nix, W. M. Turner, W. J. Carlisle, A. L. Sexton, R. M. Saunders, W. H. Pinkerton, T. Z. Hagood, Richard Smoot Jr, James Turner, B. R. Childers, Thomas Hart, J. S. Oldham, O. M. Hill, R. H. McCullum and James Hillary. The city's expense for the salaries and operation of the department in 1887 reached $12,500.\n\nThe first Birmingham Police officers to lose their lives in the line of duty were George Kirkley and J. W. Adams, who were killed in a shootout following the robbery of the Standard Oil offices on March 27, 1900.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Birmingham_Police_Department|title=Birmingham Police Department - Bhamwiki|website=www.bhamwiki.com|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\n\n=== Chief of Police ===\nThe Chief of Police is a sworn member of the police department appointed by the Mayor of the City of Birmingham.
