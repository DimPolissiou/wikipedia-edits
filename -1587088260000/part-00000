The film was followed by a spin-off [[Clueless (TV series)|television sitcom]], [[Clueless (novels)|series of books]], and Paramount Studios has announced that they are producing a remake.\n\n==Plot==\nCher Horowitz lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel, a $500-an-hour [[litigator]]; her mother died during a routine [[liposuction]] procedure when Cher was a baby. Cher is attractive, popular, and wealthy. She attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend, Dionne Davenport, who is also wealthy and beautiful. Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray; Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor for Dionne.\n\nJosh, Cher's socially conscious ex-stepbrother, visits her during a break from college. They spar continually but playfully. She mocks his idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain and superficial, saying that her only direction in life is \"toward the mall\". Cher plays matchmaker for two hard-grading teachers at her school, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. She facilitates the relationship between the teachers to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad grade on her report card. After she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds. She then decides to give back to the community by \"adopting\" a \"tragically [[Hip (slang)|unhip]]\" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover, which gives Tai confidence and a sense of style. Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her towards Elton, a popular and wealthy student.\n\nElton rejects Tai and fails to seduce Cher. A handsome new student at their school named Christian becomes Cher's target boyfriend. Murray explains to Cher and Dionne that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of this endeavor, Cher remains on friendly terms with Christian, primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion. Matters take a turn for the worse when Tai's newfound popularity strains her relationship with Cher. Cher's frustration escalates when she fails her driving test and cannot change the result. When she returns home, crushed, Tai confesses her feelings for Josh and wants Cher's help in pursuing him. Cher says Tai is not right for Josh and they quarrel. Their disagreement ends with Tai calling Cher a \"virgin who can't drive\". Feeling \"totally clueless\", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life.\n\nAfter thinking about why she is bothered by Tai's interest in Josh, Cher realizes that she loves him. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's [[Pismo Beach]] disaster relief effort. Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss. Ultimately, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed; Cher's friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified; Tai and Travis are in love and Cher catches the wedding bouquet, helping Josh win a $200 bet. She embraces Josh and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{See also|List of Clueless characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Cher Horowitz\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne Davenport\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Tai Frasier\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Josh Lucas\n* Paige Vlahopoulos as papa smurf\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Melvin \"Mel\" Horowitz (\"Hamilton\" in the credits)\n* [[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n* [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]] as Christian Stovitz\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Wendell Hall\n*[[Twink Caplan]] as Ms. Toby Geist\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Stoeger\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall, Dionne's long-term boyfriend\n*[[Breckin Meyer]] as Travis Birkenstock\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Elton Tiscia\n*[[Nicole Bilderback]] as Summer Han\n*Sean Holland as Lawrence\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to the special feature titled \"''Creative Writing''\", Heckerling describes the origins of ''Clueless'' as follows:\n{{quote|I went to [[20th Century Fox]] and they said \"We want you to do something about teenagers.\" And I thought \"I'm so tired about doing stuff about teenagers.\" But they said, \"We want you to do something about the 'in' crowd.\" I thought \"I'll do it if I can make fun of them.\" So, we developed this script. It was a pilot for a TV show. And it was about this girl that was completely happy, no matter what happened. And I was really getting into that kind of character. But nothing happened with it. They passed on it, they didn't get it. And a number of things were sort of falling through. I was just getting very frustrated. So I switched agents and when I had my new agent, they said: \"What have you been working on?\" So I showed Ken Stovitz, one of the agents there, this pilot. And he said, \"This is too good for TV. You should make this into a feature.\"<ref name=\"Creative\">{{cite news|url=https://vimeo.com/343465997|title=''Clueless'' - Creative Writing|publisher=[[Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>}}\n\nShe follows up on the connections to the [[Jane Austen]] novel, ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'':\n{{quote|I started to think, \"What's the larger context for that kind of a 'nothing can go wrong' 'always looks through rose colored glasses' kind of girl?\" And I remembered ''Emma'', which I'd read in college. So, I took it out and reread it, and I said: \"Unconsciously, I've been writing an Emma-like character.\" Because I've always loved it and part of it had sort of stored it away in my brain... So I really related to her and got into it. And the plot was so brilliantly laid out in ''Emma''. So I tried to take all the things that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be like if it was in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"Creative\" />}} \n\nAssociate producer [[Twink Caplan]] recalls what the proposed TV show's initial title:\n{{quote|''No Worries'' was the original television script that Amy wrote. Then, we went to ''I Was a Teenage Teenager'' because with every new draft that Amy writes, she picks a whole new title.<ref name=\"Creative\" />}}\n\nFox picked up the picture, but put the film in a [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. The male studio heads wanted Heckerling to rewrite the script so that fewer women would feature. Six months later, the script made its way to producer [[Scott Rudin]]. Rudin like the script and it was the subject of a bidding war, with [[Paramount Pictures]] beating out the other studios. Heckerling was excited, as Paramount owned several major youth-centered channels, such as [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]], which was suited to the film's target demographic.<ref name=\"Creative\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Westfield Fashion Square.JPG|Westfield Fashion Square|thumb|150px|The Westfield Fashion Square]]\nPrincipal photography for the film took place between November 21 and December 31, 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Alicia Silverstone Stars in 'Clueless,' A Romantic Comedy Written and Directed by Amy Heckelilng|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ALICIA+SILVERSTONE+STARS+IN+'CLUELESS,'+A+ROMANTIC+COMEDY+WRITTEN+AND...-a015982332|website = thefreelibrary.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}</ref> The film had a 40-day filming schedule. Producers sat in on classes at [[Beverly Hills High School]] to get a feel for the student culture. Herb Hall, the real drama teacher at Beverly Hills High School, had a short scene as the principal in the film. Scenes depicting the high school campus, including the tennis courts, the outdoor cafeteria, the quad, and various classrooms were filmed at [[Occidental College]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The mall scenes were filmed at [[Westfield Fashion Square]] in [[Sherman Oaks, California]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\nThe film became a surprise [[sleeper hit]] of 1995.

This is first seen within the first fifteen minutes of the film when both she and Dionne pair their English teacher with the school's Debate teacher. However, this is more prominently reflected when Cher does everything in her power to pair her newest friend Tai. While both Emma and Cher mean well in their matchmaking attempts, neither of them realizes the depths of their actions nor their feelings towards Josh/Mr. Knightly until Tai/Harriet asks her to set her up with Josh/Mr. Knightley.\n\n'''Josh/Mr. Knightley''' \u2013 Cher's stepbrother, who she finds utterly repulsive. She states at the beginning of the movie that she has no positive feelings towards Josh in the slightest. The two bicker on a near constant basis. However, as the movie progresses, Josh is shown to be more caring and considerate towards Cher, becoming defensive towards her choices of men and life choices. It is not until the end of the movie it is revealed that Josh is in love with Cher and the two share a passionate kiss. \n\n'''Miss Geist/Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston''' \u2013 Target of Cher's matchmaking.\n\n'''Tai/Harriet Smith''' \u2013 Tai, representative of the young, fair, and socially awkward Harriet Smith, is a newcomer to Bronson Alcott High School. Soon after, she is swept off her feet by both Cher and Dionne as they help her (unintentionally) become the most popular girl in school, much to Cher's jealousy. At the beginning of the film, Tai is attracted to Travis, a well-meaning, skateboard riding, pot smoker social recluse though is encouraged by Cher to strive for someone more socially well off, as Travis is not considered to be a socially acceptable partner. Following this advice, Tai then falls for Josh, much to even more of Cher's Jealousy.\n\n'''Mel Horowitz/Mr. Henry Woodhouse''' \u2013 Just as in the book, Mr. Horowitz is a well known and respected man within his circle of friends, though there is one major difference between both characters: while Mr. Horowitz is shown to have little to no care for his health, Mr. Woodhouse is considered to be a [[valetudinarian]]. Both characters are shown to love their daughter greatly while not always being so forward in their affection.\n\n'''Travis/Robert Martin''' \u2013 A stoner and a skater who falls for Tai by the end of the film; however, their attempts at courtship are derailed for a time by Cher's attempts to set Tai up with Elton. Travis is an underachiever, constantly late for class and often receiving poor grades.\n\n'''Elton Tascia/Philip Elton''' \u2013 Elton is a popular student whom Cher attempts to fix up with Tai. As is the case with the Elton from the book, he is not interested in Tai/Harriet and mistakenly believes that Cher/Emma is interested in him.\n\n'''Christian/Frank Churchill''' \u2013 The initially appealing love interest of Cher with whom she convinces herself she must be in love (just like the Frank Churchill character in the book). In the book, Churchill is not available to Emma because he is already engaged; in the film, Christian is not available to Cher because he is gay. Both characters engage in surface-level flirting with the heroine and make her consider her own feelings.\n\n==Home media==\n''Clueless'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] on December 19, 1995 by [[Paramount Home Video]]. It was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on October 19, 1999. The special features only included two [[Trailer (promotion)|theatrical trailers]].\n\nThe film was reissued in a special tenth-anniversary \"''Whatever!'' Edition\" DVD on August 30, 2005. The new issue included featurettes and cast interviews, including:''The Class of '95'' (a look at the cast), ''Creative Writing'' (Amy Heckerling talks about the script), ''Fashion 101'' (how filmmakers invented the trendsetting style of ''Clueless''), ''Language Arts'' (the director and cast members give facts on the groundbreaking slang and how ''Clueless'' revived [[Valspeak]] slang), ''Suck and Blow'' (how to play the game depicted in the [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]] party scene), ''Driver's Ed'', ''We're History'' (stories from cast and crew of ''Clueless''), and two theatrical trailers.\n\nIt was released on [[Blu-ray]] on May 1, 2012.

The film was followed by a spin-off [[Clueless (TV series)|television sitcom]], [[Clueless (novels)|series of books]], and Paramount Studios has announced that they are producing a remake.\n\n==Plot==\nCher Horowitz lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel, a $500-an-hour [[litigator]]; her mother died during a routine [[liposuction]] procedure when Cher was a baby. Cher is attractive, popular, and wealthy. She attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend, Dionne Davenport, who is also wealthy and beautiful. Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray; Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor for Dionne.\n\nJosh, Cher's socially conscious ex-stepbrother, visits her during a break from college. They spar continually but playfully. She mocks his idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain and superficial, saying that her only direction in life is \"toward the mall\". Cher plays matchmaker for two hard-grading teachers at her school, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. She facilitates the relationship between the teachers to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad grade on her report card. After she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds. She then decides to give back to the community by \"adopting\" a \"tragically [[Hip (slang)|unhip]]\" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover, which gives Tai confidence and a sense of style. Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her towards Elton, a popular and wealthy student.\n\nElton rejects Tai and fails to seduce Cher. A handsome new student at their school named Christian becomes Cher's target boyfriend. Murray explains to Cher and Dionne that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of this endeavor, Cher remains on friendly terms with Christian, primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion. Matters take a turn for the worse when Tai's newfound popularity strains her relationship with Cher. Cher's frustration escalates when she fails her driving test and cannot change the result. When she returns home, crushed, Tai confesses her feelings for Josh and wants Cher's help in pursuing him. Cher says Tai is not right for Josh and they quarrel. Their disagreement ends with Tai calling Cher a \"virgin who can't drive\". Feeling \"totally clueless\", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life.\n\nAfter thinking about why she is bothered by Tai's interest in Josh, Cher realizes that she loves him. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's [[Pismo Beach]] disaster relief effort. Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss. Ultimately, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed; Cher's friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified; Tai and Travis are in love and Cher catches the wedding bouquet, helping Josh win a $200 bet. She embraces Josh and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{See also|List of Clueless characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Cher Horowitz\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne Davenport\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Tai Frasier\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Josh Lucas\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Melvin \"Mel\" Horowitz (\"Hamilton\" in the credits)\n* [[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n* [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]] as Christian Stovitz\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Wendell Hall\n*[[Twink Caplan]] as Ms. Toby Geist\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Stoeger\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall, Dionne's long-term boyfriend\n*[[Breckin Meyer]] as Travis Birkenstock\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Elton Tiscia\n*[[Nicole Bilderback]] as Summer Han\n*Sean Holland as Lawrence\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to the special feature titled \"''Creative Writing''\", Heckerling describes the origins of ''Clueless'' as follows:\n{{quote|I went to [[20th Century Fox]] and they said \"We want you to do something about teenagers.\" And I thought \"I'm so tired about doing stuff about teenagers.\" But they said, \"We want you to do something about the 'in' crowd.\" I thought \"I'll do it if I can make fun of them.\" So, we developed this script. It was a pilot for a TV show. And it was about this girl that was completely happy, no matter what happened. And I was really getting into that kind of character. But nothing happened with it. They passed on it, they didn't get it. And a number of things were sort of falling through. I was just getting very frustrated. So I switched agents and when I had my new agent, they said: \"What have you been working on?\" So I showed Ken Stovitz, one of the agents there, this pilot. And he said, \"This is too good for TV. You should make this into a feature.\"<ref name=\"Creative\">{{cite news|url=https://vimeo.com/343465997|title=''Clueless'' - Creative Writing|publisher=[[Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>}}\n\nShe follows up on the connections to the [[Jane Austen]] novel, ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'':\n{{quote|I started to think, \"What's the larger context for that kind of a 'nothing can go wrong' 'always looks through rose colored glasses' kind of girl?\" And I remembered ''Emma'', which I'd read in college. So, I took it out and reread it, and I said: \"Unconsciously, I've been writing an Emma-like character.\" Because I've always loved it and part of it had sort of stored it away in my brain... So I really related to her and got into it. And the plot was so brilliantly laid out in ''Emma''. So I tried to take all the things that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be like if it was in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"Creative\" />}} \n\nAssociate producer [[Twink Caplan]] recalls what the proposed TV show's initial title:\n{{quote|''No Worries'' was the original television script that Amy wrote. Then, we went to ''I Was a Teenage Teenager'' because with every new draft that Amy writes, she picks a whole new title.<ref name=\"Creative\" />}}\n\nFox picked up the picture, but put the film in a [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. The male studio heads wanted Heckerling to rewrite the script so that fewer women would feature. Six months later, the script made its way to producer [[Scott Rudin]]. Rudin like the script and it was the subject of a bidding war, with [[Paramount Pictures]] beating out the other studios.

This is first seen within the first fifteen minutes of the film when both she and Dionne pair their English teacher with the school's Debate teacher. However, this is more prominently reflected when Cher does everything in her power to pair her newest friend Tai. While both Emma and Cher mean well in their matchmaking attempts, neither of them realizes the depths of their actions nor their feelings towards Josh/Mr. Knightly until Tai/Harriet asks her to set her up with Josh/Mr. Knightley.\n\n'''Josh/Mr. Knightley''' \u2013 Cher's stepbrother, who she finds utterly repulsive. She states at the beginning of the movie that she has no positive feelings towards Josh in the slightest. The two bicker on a near constant basis. However, as the movie progresses, Josh is shown to be more caring and considerate towards Cher, becoming defensive towards her choices of men and life choices. It is not until the end of the movie it is revealed that Josh is in love with Cher and the two share a passionate kiss. \n\n'''Miss Geist/Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston''' \u2013 Target of Cher's matchmaking.\n\n'''Tai/Harriet Smith''' \u2013 Tai, representative of the young, fair, and socially awkward Harriet Smith, is a newcomer to Bronson Alcott High School. Soon after, she is swept off her feet by both Cher and Dionne as they help her (unintentionally) become the most popular girl in school, much to Cher's jealousy. At the beginning of the film, Tai is attracted to Travis, a well-meaning, skateboard riding, pot smoker social recluse though is encouraged by Cher to strive for someone more socially well off, as Travis is not considered to be a socially acceptable partner. Following this advice, Tai then falls for Josh, much to even more of Cher's Jealousy.\n\n'''Mel Horowitz/Mr. Henry Woodhouse''' \u2013 Just as in the book, Mr. Horowitz is a well known and respected man within his circle of friends, though there is one major difference between both characters: while Mr. Horowitz is shown to have little to no care for his health, Mr. Woodhouse is considered to be a [[valetudinarian]]. Both characters are shown to love their daughter greatly while not always being so forward in their affection.\n\n'''Travis/Robert Martin''' \u2013 A stoner and a skater who falls for Tai by the end of the film; however, their attempts at courtship are derailed for a time by Cher's attempts to set Tai up with Elton. Travis is an underachiever, constantly late for class and often receiving poor grades.\n\n'''Elton Tascia/Philip Elton''' \u2013 Elton is a popular student whom Cher attempts to fix up with Tai. As is the case with the Elton from the book, he is not interested in Tai/Harriet and mistakenly believes that Cher/Emma is interested in him.\n\n'''Christian/Frank Churchill''' \u2013 The initially appealing love interest of Cher with whom she convinces herself she must be in love (just like the Frank Churchill character in the book). In the book, Churchill is not available to Emma because he is already engaged; in the film, Christian is not available to Cher because he is gay. Both characters engage in surface-level flirting with the heroine and make her consider her own feelings.\n\n==Home media==\n''Clueless'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] on December 19, 1995 by [[Paramount Home Video]]. It was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on October 19, 1999.

There he became familiar with [[Latin literature]], as well as pagan beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Knowles|Penkett|2004|p=|loc=Ch. 2}} His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden.

'It was foul, and I loved it. I loved my own error\u2014not that for which I erred, but the error itself.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> From this incident he concluded the human person is naturally inclined to sin, and in need of the grace of Christ.\n\nAt the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus,<ref name=EA>''Encyclopedia Americana'', v. 2, p. 685.

It started his interest in philosophy.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:4</ref> Although raised to follow Christianity, Augustine decided to become a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], much to his mother's despair.{{sfn|Pope|1911}}\n\nAt about the age of 17, Augustine began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover{{sfn|Ranke-Heinemann|1990|p=}} for over fifteen years<ref name=\"utne.com\">Boyce, James (May 2015) [http://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/st-augustine-and-original-sin-ze0z1505zken.aspx \"Don't Blame the Devil: St Augustine and Original Sin\"].

In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress. (He had to wait for two years because the legal age of marriage for women was twelve.) By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest.<ref name=\"utne.com\"/>{{sfn|Brown|2000|p=63}}\n\nAugustine was from the beginning a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek{{sfn|O'Donnell|2005|p=}} \u2014 he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized that he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.\n\n===Move to Carthage, Rome, Milan===\n[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|thumb|The earliest known portrait of Saint Augustine in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome]]\n\nAugustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and would remain there for the next nine years.<ref name=EA/> Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay.\n\nManichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who while traveling through Carthage had been asked by the imperial court at [[Milan]]{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907a}} to provide a rhetoric professor. Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers.\n\nAlthough Augustine spent ten years as a Manichaean, he was never an initiate or \"elect\", but an \"auditor\", the lowest level in this religion's hierarchy.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907a}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2001|p=14}} While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, [[Faustus of Mileve]], a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907a}} In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the [[New Academy]] movement. Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths.{{sfn|Kishlansky|Geary|O'Brien|2005|pp=142\u2013143}} At Milan, his mother's religiosity, Augustine's own studies in [[Neoplatonism]], and his friend [[Simplician]]us all urged him towards Christianity.<ref name=\"EA\" /> Not coincidentally, this was shortly after the Roman emperor Theodosius I had issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 and shortly before he declared Christianity to be the only legitimate religion for the Roman Empire in 391.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|pp=689-690}} Initially Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with [[Ambrose]] of Milan, Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed.\n\nAugustine arrived in Milan and visited Ambrose having heard of his reputation as an orator. Augustine quickly discovered that Ambrose was a spectacular orator. Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced.{{sfn|BeDuhn|2010|p=163}} Soon, their relationship grew, as Augustine wrote, \"And I began to love him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church\u2014but as a friendly man.\"<ref name=\"Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion\"/> Eventually, Augustine says that he was spiritually led into the faith of Christianity.<ref name=\"Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion\"/> Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired. Within his ''Confessions'', Augustine states, \"That man of God received me as a father would, and welcomed my coming as a good bishop should.\"<ref name=\"Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion\">{{cite web| last1=Outler| first1=Albert| title=\"Medieval Sourcebook.\" Internet History Sourcebooks Project| url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aug-conv.asp| website=Fordham University, Medieval Sourcebook| publisher=[[Fordham University]] |accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> Ambrose adopted Augustine as a spiritual son after the death of Augustine's father.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=90}}\n\nAugustine's mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a respectable marriage for him. Although Augustine acquiesced, he had to dismiss his concubine and grieved for having forsaken his lover. He wrote, \"My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding.\" Augustine confessed that he was not a lover of wedlock so much as a slave of lust, so he procured another concubine since he had to wait two years until his fianc\u00e9e came of age. However, his emotional wound was not healed.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 6:15</ref> It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, \"Grant me [[chastity]] and [[sexual abstinence|continence]], but not yet.\"<ref name=\"FLNZ2\">Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 8:7.17</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage.{{sfn|Burrus|2011|pp=1-20}} In his ''Confessions'', he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fianc\u00e9e, but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines. [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at [[Cassago Brianza|Cassiciacum]], a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as ''Christianae vitae otium'' \u2013 the leisure of Christian life.{{sfn|Ferguson|1999|p=208}}\n\n===Christian conversion and priesthood===\n{{Ordination\n| date of priestly ordination = 391\n| place of priestly ordination = [[Hippo Regius]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], [[Roman Empire]]\n| date of consecration = 396\n| consecrated by = Megalius\n| sources = {{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907a}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Augustine of Hippo, Bishop and Theologian|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/50.html|website=justus.anglican.org|publisher=Society of Archbishop Justus|accessdate=22 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824001306/http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/50.html|archivedate=24 August 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Fra angelico - conversion de saint augustin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''The Conversion of St. Augustine'' by [[Fra Angelico]]]]\n\nIn late August of 386,{{efn|{{harvnb|Brown|2000|p=64}} places Augustine's garden conversion at the end of August, 386.}} at the age of 31, having heard of Ponticianus's and his friends' first reading of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Anthony of the Desert]], Augustine converted to Christianity.

In January 1327, [[Pope John XXII]] issued the papal bull ''Veneranda Santorum Patrum'', in which he appointed the [[Augustinians]] guardians of the tomb of Augustine (called ''Arca''), which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life.\n\nIn October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing some human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the [[regular canons]] (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed that they were. Eventually [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724\u20131730) directed the Bishop of Pavia, [[Monsignor]] Pertusati, to make a determination.

After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things.

It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On the free will'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7\u20136.13.</ref>{{sfn|Mann|1999|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nLike other Church Fathers such as [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]],<ref>{{cite web | title = A Plea for the Christians |first = Athenagoras | last = the Athenian | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0205.htm | publisher = New advent}}</ref> [[Tertullian]],{{sfn|Flinn|2007|p=4}} [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Basil of Caesarea]],{{sfn|Luker|1985|p=12}} Augustine \"vigorously condemned the practice of induced [[abortion]]\", and although he disapproved of an abortion during any stage of pregnancy, he made a distinction between early abortions and later ones.{{sfn|Bauerschmidt|1999|p= 1}} He acknowledged the distinction between \"formed\" and \"unformed\" fetuses mentioned in the [[Septuagint]] translation of {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:22\u201323}}, which incorrectly translates the word \"harm\" (from the original Hebrew text) as \"form\" in the [[Koine Greek]] of the Septuagint. His view was based on the Aristotelian distinction \"between the fetus before and after its supposed 'vivification'\". Therefore, he did not classify as murder the abortion of an \"unformed\" fetus since he thought that it could not be said with certainty that the fetus had already received a soul.{{sfn|Bauerschmidt|1999|p= 1}}<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/respect-for-unborn-human-life.cfm Respect for Unborn Human Life: the Church's Constant Teaching].

He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way \u2013 it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]]&nbsp;18:1, ''creavit omnia simul'' (\"He created all things at once\"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis&nbsp;1 had to be taken non-literally.{{sfn|Teske|1999|pp=377\u2013378}} As an additional support for describing the six days of creation as a [[heuristic]] device, Augustine thought that the actual event of creation would be incomprehensible by humans and therefore needed to be translated.{{sfn|Franklin-Brown|2012|p=280}}\n\nAugustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of [[Adam and Eve]] were already created mortal before [[Fall of man|the Fall]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=On the Merits |at=1.2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=City of God |at=13:1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=Enchiridion |at=104}}</ref>\n\n====Ecclesiology====\n{{See also|Ecclesiology}}\n[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]\nAugustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church|hierarchy]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]], and the [[laity]]) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacrament]]s, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of \"wheat\" and \"tares\", that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the \"true\" or \"pure\" church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez|1987|p=28}}\n\nAugustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez|1987|p=}} and that their authority in the Church is God-given.\n\n==== Eschatology ====\nAugustine originally believed in [[premillennialism]], namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]], but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The Catholic Church during the Medieval period built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.{{sfn|Blomberg|2006|p=519}}\n\nDuring the [[Reformation]] theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death,{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=}}<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Enchiridion'', 110</ref> and that [[purgatory|purgatorial]] fires of the [[intermediate state]] purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=}}\n\n====Mariology====\nAlthough Augustine did not develop an independent [[Mariology]], his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers. Even before the [[Council of Ephesus]], he defended the [[perpetual virginity of Mary|Ever-Virgin Mary]] as the [[theotokos|Mother of God]], believing her to be \"full of grace\" (following earlier Latin writers such as [[Jerome]]) on account of her sexual integrity and innocence.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 6,6, 191.</ref> Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary \"conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever\".<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 18</ref>\n\n====Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation====\nAugustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and our God-given reason, the Biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this \"literal sense\" does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended [[metaphor]].<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Genesi ad literam 1:19\u201320'', Chapt. 19 [408], ''De Genesi ad literam'', 2:9</ref>\n\n====Original sin====\n{{see also|Original sin}}\n\n[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century]]\nAugustine taught that the sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first.<ref group=lower-alpha>He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''.

For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more.\" (\"[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm On the Trinity]\" (''De Trinitate''), 5:7; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 320 [1\u201312])</ref>\n\nThey would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if [[Satan]] hadn't sown into their senses \"the root of evil\" (''radix Mali'').<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus'' (\"Contra Julianum\", I, 9.42; <abbr title=\"Patrologia Latina\">[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]</abbr> 44, 670)</ref> Their nature was wounded by [[concupiscence]] or [[libido]], which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire.<ref group=lower-alpha>In one of Augustine's late works, ''[[Retractationes]]'', he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: \"Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido\" (\"libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis\"). See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: \u00abQuod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest\u00bb.

Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of [[Cyprian]], who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez|1987|p=}} Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Augustine of Hippo|title=St. Augustine's Writings Against The Manichaeans And Against The Donatists|edition=eBook |year= 2012|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|isbn=9783849621094}}</ref>\n\nAugustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], saying that Christ's statement, \"This is my body\" referred to the bread he carried in his hands,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Explanations of the Psalms'' 33:1:10 [405]</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 227 [411]</ref> and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 272</ref> For instance he stated that \"He [Jesus] walked here in the same flesh, and gave us the same flesh to be eaten unto salvation. But no one eats that flesh unless first he adores it; and thus it is discovered how such a footstool of the Lord's feet is adored; and not only do we not sin by adoring, we do sin by not adoring.\"{{sfn|Jurgens|1970|p=20|loc = \u00a71479a}}\n\nNevertheless, in some of his writings, Augustine expressed a symbolic view of the Eucharist.{{sfn|Ambrose|1919|p=39}} For example, in his work ''[[On Christian Doctrine]]'', Augustine referred to the Eurcharist as a \"figure\" and a \"sign.\"<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine,'' Book II, Chapter 3; Book III, Chapter 9; Book III, Chapter 16</ref>\n\nAgainst the [[Pelagians]], Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed'', Paragraph 16</ref> This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the [[Apocalypse]], may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book 20, Chapter 8</ref>\n\n===Philosophy===\n[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_-_Augustine_(CXXXVIr).jpg|thumb|Saint Augustine in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ]]\n\n====Astrology====\nAugustine's contemporaries often believed [[astrology]] to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and [[horoscope]]s. (Augustine's term \"mathematici\", meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as \"mathematicians\".) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but \"common swindlers\".{{sfn|Van Der Meer|1961|p=60}}{{sfn|Bonner|1986|p=63}}{{sfn|Testard|1958|pp=100-106}}<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'' 5,7,12; 7,6</ref>\n\n====Epistemology====\n[[Epistemology|Epistemological]] concerns shaped Augustine's intellectual development. His early dialogues [''Contra academicos'' (386) and ''De Magistro'' (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[divine illumination]]. The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays an active and regular part in human perception (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes' idea of clear and distinct perceptions) and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents. According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of [[sense perception]]. It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities.<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite encyclopedia| last=Mendelson| first=Michael| title=Saint Augustine| url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/augustine/| encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| accessdate=21 December 2012| date=2000-03-24}}</ref>\n\nAugustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in ''[[On the Trinity]]'' (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.{{sfn|Matthews|1992|p=}} In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.{{sfn|King|Ballantyne|2020|p=195}}\n\n====Just war====\n{{See also|Just war theory}}\nAugustine asserted that Christians should be [[pacifists]] as a personal, philosophical stance.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html \"A Time For War?\"] ''Christianity Today'' (2001-01-09).

Free will was not intended for sin, meaning it is not equally predisposed to both good and evil. A will defiled by sin is not considered as \"free\" as it once was because it is bound by material things, which could be lost or be difficult to part with, resulting in unhappiness. Sin impairs free will, while grace restores it. Only a will that was once free can be subjected to sin's corruption.{{sfn|Meister|Copan|2013|p=}} After 412 CE, Augustine changed his theology, teaching that humanity had no free will to believe in Christ but only a free will to sin: \"I in fact strove on behalf of the free choice of the human \u2018will,\u2019 but God's grace conquered\" (''Retract''. 2.1).{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=285 }}\n\nThe early Christians opposed the deterministic views (e.g., fate) of Stoics, Gnostics, and Manichaeans that were prevalent in those first four centuries.{{sfn|McIntire|2005|pp=3206\u20133209}} Christians championed the concept of a relational God who interacts with humans rather than a Stoic or Gnostic God who unilaterally foreordained every event (yet Stoics still claimed to teach free will).{{sfn|Dihle|1982|p=152}}Every early Christian author with extant writings who wrote on the topic prior to Augustine of Hippo (412) advanced human free choice rather than a deterministic God.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|pp=93\u201394, 273\u2013274}} Augustine taught traditional free choice until 412, when he reverted to his earlier Manichaean and Stoic deterministic training when battling the Pelagians.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|pp=281\u2013294}} Only a few Christians accepted Augustine's alteration of Christian free choice until the Protestant Reformation when both Luther and Calvin embraced Augustine's deterministic teachings wholeheartedly.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Luther |translator1-last=Krodel |translator1-first=Gottfried |editor1-last=Lehman |editor1-first=Helmut |title=Luther's Works |volume=48 |date=1963 |publisher=Fortress Press |page=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Calvin |first1=John |translator1-last=Cole |translator1-first=Henry |title=Calvin's Calvinism |article=A Treatise on the Eternal Predestination of God |date=1927 |publisher=Sovereign Grace Union |location=London |page=38}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907b}} He often said that anyone can be saved if they wish.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907b}} While God knows who will and won't be saved, with no possibility for the latter to be saved in their lives, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907b}} However, after 412 CE, Augustine exchanged the traditional Christian defense of divine foreknowledge of human free will choices to explain predestination for a more Stoic and Gnostic/Manichaean view of deterministic predestination wherein the will was not free except to sin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|pp=286\u2013298}}{{sfn|Wilson|2019|pp=5\u201318, 55\u201380, 120}}\n\n===Sociology, morals and ethics===\n====Slavery====\nAugustine led many clergy under his authority at Hippo to free their slaves \"as an act of piety\".<ref>Augustine, \"Of the Work of Monks\", p. 25, Vol. 3, ''Nicene & Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Reprinted 1986</ref> He boldly wrote a letter urging the emperor to set up a new law against slave traders and was very much concerned about the sale of children. Christian emperors of his time for 25 years had permitted sale of children, not because they approved of the practice, but as a way of preventing [[infanticide]] when parents were unable to care for a child. Augustine noted that the tenant farmers in particular were driven to hire out or to sell their children as a means of survival.<ref>The Saints, Pauline Books & Media, Daughters of St. Paul, Editions du Signe (1998), p. 72</ref>\n\nIn his book, ''The City of God'', he presents the development of slavery as a product of sin and as contrary to God's divine plan. He wrote that God \"did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation \u2013 not man over man, but man over the beasts\". Thus he wrote that righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle, not kings over men. \"The condition of slavery is the result of sin\", he declared.<ref>Augustine, ''The City of God'', Ch. 15, p. 411, Vol. II, ''Nicene & Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Reprinted 1986</ref> In ''The City of God'', Augustine wrote he felt that the existence of slavery was a punishment for the existence of sin, even if an individual enslaved person committed no sin meriting punishment. He wrote: \"Slavery is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120119.htm|title=Church Fathers: City of God, Book XIX (St. Augustine)|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-07-31}}</ref> Augustine believed that slavery did more harm to the slave owner than the enslaved person himself: \"the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the proud position does harm to the master.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Augustine proposes as a solution to sin a type of cognitive reimagining of one's situation, where slaves \"may themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love,\" until the end of the world eradicated slavery for good: \"until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Jews====\nAgainst certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=8}} and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.</ref> He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely \"Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law\" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at \"the end of time\", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.{{sfn|Edwards|1999|pp=33-35}} The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews \"survive but not thrive\" (it is repeated by author [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]] in his book ''Constantine's Sword'', for example){{sfn|Carroll|2002|p=219}} is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.{{sfn|Van Biema|2008}}\n\n====Sexuality====\nFor Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine'', 3.37</ref> Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate the species inevitably perpetuates evil (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.27; ''A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 2.27). For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the \"better\" way (''Confessions'' 8.2) and abstain from marriage (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, for Augustine a sin, although necessarily producing the evil of sexual passion. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act.{{sfn|Russell|1945|p=356}}<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book I, Ch. 16, 18.</ref>\n\nBefore the Fall, Augustine believed that sex was a passionless affair, \"just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat\"; the penis would have been engorged for sexual intercourse \"simply by the direction of the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence\" (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 2.29; cf. ''City of God'' 14.23). After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: \"Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind... It arouses the mind, but it does not follow through what it has begun and arouse the body also\" (''City of God'' 14.16).\n\nAugustine believed that Adam and Eve had both already chosen in their hearts to disobey God's command not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge before Eve took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to Adam.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 14.13</ref>{{sfn|Clark|1996|p=}} Accordingly, Augustine did not believe that Adam was any less guilty of sin.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{sfn|Clark|1986|pp=139\u201362}} Augustine praises women and their role in society and in the Church. In his ''Tractates on the Gospel of John'', Augustine, commenting on the [[Samaritan]] woman from {{bibleref2c|John|4:1\u201342}}, uses the woman as a figure of the Church in agreement with the New Testament teaching that the Church is the bride of Christ. \"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\"{{bibleref2c|Eph|5:25}}\n\n====Pedagogy====\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - St Augustin dans son cabinet de travail.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Augustine in His Cell (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], 1494, [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]\nAugustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is ''De Magistro'' (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education. His ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Augustine wrote his ''Retractationes'' (''Retractations''), reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of \"retractationes\" may be \"reconsiderations\". Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding, meaning, and truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development, and change.{{sfn|McCloskey|2008|pp=}}\n\nAugustine was a strong advocate of [[critical thinking]] skills. Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Augustine's dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.{{sfn|McCloskey|2008|pp=}}\nHe recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds:\n* the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers;\n* the student who has had no education; and\n* the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated.\n\nIf a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between \"having words and having understanding\" and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.\n\nUnder the influence of [[Bede]], [[Alcuin]], and [[Rabanus Maurus]], ''De catechizandis rudibus'' came to exercise an important role in the education of clergy at the monastic schools, especially from the eighth century onwards.{{sfn|Howie|1969|p=150\u2013153}}\n\nAugustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline.\n\n==Works==\n{{main|Augustine of Hippo bibliography}}\n[[File:Antonio Rodr\u00edguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine'' painting by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez]]\nAugustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles.{{sfn|Wright|Sinclair|1931|pp=56-}} They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]]; texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''); [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]]; many [[sermon]]s and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.\n\nApart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate Dei'' (''[[The City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also considered to be among his masterpieces, and arguably of more doctrinal importance that the ''Confessions'' or the ''City of God''.{{sfn|Hill|1961|pp=540\u2013548}} He also wrote ''On Free Choice of the Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Verg\u00f3s Group - Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics'' painting by Verg\u00f3s Group]]\n\nIn both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the ''[[Enneads]]'', probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Some Neoplatonist Concepts, some ideas are still visible in his early writings.{{sfn|Russell|1945|p=|loc=Book II, Chapter IV}} His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. He was also influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), and [[Cicero]] (known for his teaching on argument).<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\n===In philosophy===\n[[Philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the ''Confessions'', comparing it favourably to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s version of the view that time is subjective.{{sfn|Russell|1945|pp=352\u2013353}} Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the \"eternal present\"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory<ref>[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''</ref> clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.\n\nAugustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].{{sfn|De Paulo|2006|p=}} [[Edmund Husserl]] writes: \"The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem.\"{{sfn|Husserl|2019|p=21}}\n\n[[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]''.<ref group=lower-alpha>For example, Heidegger's articulations of how \"Being-in-the-world\" is described through thinking about ''seeing'': \"The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''.\" Heidegger then quotes the''Confessions'': \"Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'\". ''Being and Time'', Trs. Macquarrie & Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964, p. 171.</ref> [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): \"The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity.\"{{sfn|Chiba|1995|p=507}}\n\nJean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: \"Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced [[the Holocaust]] as merely banal [in ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]''].\"{{sfn|Tinder|1997|pp=432-433}}\nAugustine's philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th-century figures. Seen from a historical perspective, there are three main perspectives on the political thought of Augustine: first, political Augustinianism; second, Augustinian [[political theology]]; and third, Augustinian political theory.{{sfn|Woo|2015|pp=421-441}}\n\n===In theology===\n{{Scholastic Philosophy}}\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall, without \"supernatural gifts\".{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=1203}} While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|pp=1200\u20131204}}\n\nAccording to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against [[paganism]] and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and [[witchcraft]]. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Marxism]], [[Freudianism]] and eco-fundamentalism.{{sfn|Lal|2002}} Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine's thought, particularly ''The City of God'', in their book of political philosophy ''Empire''.\n\nAugustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]. [[Hannah Arendt]], an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] extensively quotes Augustine in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''. Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of [[semiotics]], but rather built upon [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: \"as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies.\"{{sfn|Munteanu|1996|p=65}}\n\nIn his autobiographical book ''Milestones'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] claims Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought.\n\n===Oratorio===\n[[File:Jaume Huguet - Consecration of Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Consecration of Saint Augustine]]'' by [[Jaume Huguet]]]]\n\nMuch of Augustine's conversion is dramatized in the oratorio ''La conversione di Sant'Agostino'' (1750) composed by [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]. The libretto for this oratorio, written by [[Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria]], draws upon the influence of [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasio]] (the finished libretto having been edited by him) and is based on an earlier five-act play ''Idea perfectae conversionis dive Augustinus'' written by the Jesuit priest [[Franz Neumayr]].{{sfn|Smither|1997|pp=97-98}} In the libretto Augustine's mother Monica is presented as a prominent character that is worried that Augustine might not convert to Christianity.

There he became familiar with [[Latin literature]], as well as pagan beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Knowles|Penkett|2004|p=|loc=Ch. 2}} His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden.

In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress.

By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest.<ref name=\"utne.com\"/>{{sfn|Brown|2000|p=63}}\n\nAugustine was from the beginning a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek{{sfn|O'Donnell|2005|p=}} \u2014 he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized that he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.\n\n===Move to Carthage, Rome, Milan===\n[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|thumb|The earliest known portrait of Saint Augustine in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome]]\n\nAugustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and would remain there for the next nine years.<ref name=EA/> Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception.

Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers.\n\nAlthough Augustine spent ten years as a Manichaean, he was never an initiate or \"elect\", but an \"auditor\", the lowest level in this religion's hierarchy.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907a}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2001|p=14}} While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, [[Faustus of Mileve]], a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907a}} In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the [[New Academy]] movement.

However, his emotional wound was not healed.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 6:15</ref> It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, \"Grant me [[chastity]] and [[sexual abstinence|continence]], but not yet.\"<ref name=\"FLNZ2\">Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 8:7.17</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage.{{sfn|Burrus|2011|pp=1-20}} In his ''Confessions'', he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain.

[[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married.

It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body.

His view was based on the Aristotelian distinction \"between the fetus before and after its supposed 'vivification'\". Therefore, he did not classify as murder the abortion of an \"unformed\" fetus since he thought that it could not be said with certainty that the fetus had already received a soul.{{sfn|Bauerschmidt|1999|p= 1}}<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/respect-for-unborn-human-life.cfm Respect for Unborn Human Life: the Church's Constant Teaching].

He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way \u2013 it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]]&nbsp;18:1, ''creavit omnia simul'' (\"He created all things at once\"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis&nbsp;1 had to be taken non-literally.{{sfn|Teske|1999|pp=377\u2013378}} As an additional support for describing the six days of creation as a [[heuristic]] device, Augustine thought that the actual event of creation would be incomprehensible by humans and therefore needed to be translated.{{sfn|Franklin-Brown|2012|p=280}}\n\nAugustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of [[Adam and Eve]] were already created mortal before [[Fall of man|the Fall]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=On the Merits |at=1.2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=City of God |at=13:1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=Enchiridion |at=104}}</ref>\n\n====Ecclesiology====\n{{See also|Ecclesiology}}\n[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]\nAugustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church|hierarchy]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]], and the [[laity]]) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacrament]]s, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of \"wheat\" and \"tares\", that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the \"true\" or \"pure\" church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez|1987|p=28}}\n\nAugustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez|1987|p=}} and that their authority in the Church is God-given.\n\n==== Eschatology ====\nAugustine originally believed in [[premillennialism]], namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]], but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The Catholic Church during the Medieval period built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.{{sfn|Blomberg|2006|p=519}}\n\nDuring the [[Reformation]] theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death,{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=}}<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Enchiridion'', 110</ref> and that [[purgatory|purgatorial]] fires of the [[intermediate state]] purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=}}\n\n====Mariology====\nAlthough Augustine did not develop an independent [[Mariology]], his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers. Even before the [[Council of Ephesus]], he defended the [[perpetual virginity of Mary|Ever-Virgin Mary]] as the [[theotokos|Mother of God]], believing her to be \"full of grace\" (following earlier Latin writers such as [[Jerome]]) on account of her sexual integrity and innocence.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 6,6, 191.</ref> Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary \"conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever\".<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 18</ref>\n\n====Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation====\nAugustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and our God-given reason, the Biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically.

Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of [[Cyprian]], who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez|1987|p=}} Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Augustine of Hippo|title=St. Augustine's Writings Against The Manichaeans And Against The Donatists|edition=eBook |year= 2012|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|isbn=9783849621094}}</ref>\n\nAugustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], saying that Christ's statement, \"This is my body\" referred to the bread he carried in his hands,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Explanations of the Psalms'' 33:1:10 [405]</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 227 [411]</ref> and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 272</ref> For instance he stated that \"He [Jesus] walked here in the same flesh, and gave us the same flesh to be eaten unto salvation. But no one eats that flesh unless first he adores it; and thus it is discovered how such a footstool of the Lord's feet is adored; and not only do we not sin by adoring, we do sin by not adoring.\"{{sfn|Jurgens|1970|p=20|loc = \u00a71479a}}\n\nNevertheless, in some of his writings, Augustine expressed a symbolic view of the Eucharist.{{sfn|Ambrose|1919|p=39}} For example, in his work ''[[On Christian Doctrine]]'', Augustine referred to the Eurcharist as a \"figure\" and a \"sign.\"<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine,'' Book II, Chapter 3; Book III, Chapter 9; Book III, Chapter 16</ref>\n\nAgainst the [[Pelagians]], Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed'', Paragraph 16</ref> This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the [[Apocalypse]], may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book 20, Chapter 8</ref>\n\n===Philosophy===\n[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_-_Augustine_(CXXXVIr).jpg|thumb|Saint Augustine in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ]]\n\n====Astrology====\nAugustine's contemporaries often believed [[astrology]] to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and [[horoscope]]s. (Augustine's term \"mathematici\", meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as \"mathematicians\".) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but \"common swindlers\".{{sfn|Van Der Meer|1961|p=60}}{{sfn|Bonner|1986|p=63}}{{sfn|Testard|1958|pp=100-106}}<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'' 5,7,12; 7,6</ref>\n\n====Epistemology====\n[[Epistemology|Epistemological]] concerns shaped Augustine's intellectual development. His early dialogues [''Contra academicos'' (386) and ''De Magistro'' (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[divine illumination]]. The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays an active and regular part in human perception (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes' idea of clear and distinct perceptions) and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents. According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of [[sense perception]]. It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities.<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite encyclopedia| last=Mendelson| first=Michael| title=Saint Augustine| url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/augustine/| encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| accessdate=21 December 2012| date=2000-03-24}}</ref>\n\nAugustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in ''[[On the Trinity]]'' (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.{{sfn|Matthews|1992|p=}} In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.{{sfn|King|Ballantyne|2020|p=195}}\n\n====Just war====\n{{See also|Just war theory}}\nAugustine asserted that Christians should be [[pacifists]] as a personal, philosophical stance.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html \"A Time For War?\"] ''Christianity Today'' (2001-01-09).

Free will was not intended for sin, meaning it is not equally predisposed to both good and evil. A will defiled by sin is not considered as \"free\" as it once was because it is bound by material things, which could be lost or be difficult to part with, resulting in unhappiness. Sin impairs free will, while grace restores it. Only a will that was once free can be subjected to sin's corruption.{{sfn|Meister|Copan|2013|p=}} After 412 CE, Augustine changed his theology, teaching that humanity had no free will to believe in Christ but only a free will to sin: \"I in fact strove on behalf of the free choice of the human \u2018will,\u2019 but God's grace conquered\" (''Retract''. 2.1).{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=285 }}\n\nThe early Christians opposed the deterministic views (e.g., fate) of Stoics, Gnostics, and Manichaeans that were prevalent in those first four centuries.{{sfn|McIntire|2005|pp=3206\u20133209}} Christians championed the concept of a relational God who interacts with humans rather than a Stoic or Gnostic God who unilaterally foreordained every event (yet Stoics still claimed to teach free will).{{sfn|Dihle|1982|p=152}}Every early Christian author with extant writings who wrote on the topic prior to Augustine of Hippo (412) advanced human free choice rather than a deterministic God.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|pp=93\u201394, 273\u2013274}} Augustine taught traditional free choice until 412, when he reverted to his earlier Manichaean and Stoic deterministic training when battling the Pelagians.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|pp=281\u2013294}} Only a few Christians accepted Augustine's alteration of Christian free choice until the Protestant Reformation when both Luther and Calvin embraced Augustine's deterministic teachings wholeheartedly.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Luther |translator1-last=Krodel |translator1-first=Gottfried |editor1-last=Lehman |editor1-first=Helmut |title=Luther's Works |volume=48 |date=1963 |publisher=Fortress Press |page=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Calvin |first1=John |translator1-last=Cole |translator1-first=Henry |title=Calvin's Calvinism |article=A Treatise on the Eternal Predestination of God |date=1927 |publisher=Sovereign Grace Union |location=London |page=38}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907b}} He often said that anyone can be saved if they wish.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907b}} While God knows who will and won't be saved, with no possibility for the latter to be saved in their lives, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.{{sfn|Portali\u00e9|1907b}} However, after 412 CE, Augustine exchanged the traditional Christian defense of divine foreknowledge of human free will choices to explain predestination for a more Stoic and Gnostic/Manichaean view of deterministic predestination wherein the will was not free except to sin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|pp=286\u2013298}}{{sfn|Wilson|2019|pp=5\u201318, 55\u201380, 120}}\n\n===Sociology, morals and ethics===\n====Slavery====\nAugustine led many clergy under his authority at Hippo to free their slaves \"as an act of piety\".<ref>Augustine, \"Of the Work of Monks\", p. 25, Vol. 3, ''Nicene & Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Reprinted 1986</ref> He boldly wrote a letter urging the emperor to set up a new law against slave traders and was very much concerned about the sale of children. Christian emperors of his time for 25 years had permitted sale of children, not because they approved of the practice, but as a way of preventing [[infanticide]] when parents were unable to care for a child. Augustine noted that the tenant farmers in particular were driven to hire out or to sell their children as a means of survival.<ref>The Saints, Pauline Books & Media, Daughters of St. Paul, Editions du Signe (1998), p. 72</ref>\n\nIn his book, ''The City of God'', he presents the development of slavery as a product of sin and as contrary to God's divine plan. He wrote that God \"did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation \u2013 not man over man, but man over the beasts\". Thus he wrote that righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle, not kings over men. \"The condition of slavery is the result of sin\", he declared.<ref>Augustine, ''The City of God'', Ch. 15, p. 411, Vol. II, ''Nicene & Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Reprinted 1986</ref> In ''The City of God'', Augustine wrote he felt that the existence of slavery was a punishment for the existence of sin, even if an individual enslaved person committed no sin meriting punishment. He wrote: \"Slavery is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120119.htm|title=Church Fathers: City of God, Book XIX (St. Augustine)|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-07-31}}</ref> Augustine believed that slavery did more harm to the slave owner than the enslaved person himself: \"the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the proud position does harm to the master.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Augustine proposes as a solution to sin a type of cognitive reimagining of one's situation, where slaves \"may themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love,\" until the end of the world eradicated slavery for good: \"until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Jews====\nAgainst certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=8}} and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.</ref> He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely \"Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law\" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at \"the end of time\", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.{{sfn|Edwards|1999|pp=33-35}} The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews \"survive but not thrive\" (it is repeated by author [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]] in his book ''Constantine's Sword'', for example){{sfn|Carroll|2002|p=219}} is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.{{sfn|Van Biema|2008}}\n\n====Sexuality====\nFor Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine'', 3.37</ref> Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate the species inevitably perpetuates evil (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.27; ''A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 2.27). For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the \"better\" way (''Confessions'' 8.2) and abstain from marriage (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, for Augustine a sin, although necessarily producing the evil of sexual passion. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act.{{sfn|Russell|1945|p=356}}<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book I, Ch. 16, 18.</ref>\n\nBefore the Fall, Augustine believed that sex was a passionless affair, \"just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat\"; the penis would have been engorged for sexual intercourse \"simply by the direction of the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence\" (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 2.29; cf. ''City of God'' 14.23). After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: \"Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind... It arouses the mind, but it does not follow through what it has begun and arouse the body also\" (''City of God'' 14.16).\n\nAugustine believed that Adam and Eve had both already chosen in their hearts to disobey God's command not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge before Eve took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to Adam.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 14.13</ref>{{sfn|Clark|1996|p=}} Accordingly, Augustine did not believe that Adam was any less guilty of sin.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{sfn|Clark|1986|pp=139\u201362}} Augustine praises women and their role in society and in the Church. In his ''Tractates on the Gospel of John'', Augustine, commenting on the [[Samaritan]] woman from {{bibleref2c|John|4:1\u201342}}, uses the woman as a figure of the Church in agreement with the New Testament teaching that the Church is the bride of Christ. \"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\"{{bibleref2c|Eph|5:25}}\n\n====Pedagogy====\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - St Augustin dans son cabinet de travail.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Augustine in His Cell (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], 1494, [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]\nAugustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is ''De Magistro'' (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education. His ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Augustine wrote his ''Retractationes'' (''Retractations''), reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of \"retractationes\" may be \"reconsiderations\". Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding, meaning, and truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development, and change.{{sfn|McCloskey|2008|pp=}}\n\nAugustine was a strong advocate of [[critical thinking]] skills. Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Augustine's dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.{{sfn|McCloskey|2008|pp=}}\nHe recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds:\n* the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers;\n* the student who has had no education; and\n* the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated.\n\nIf a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between \"having words and having understanding\" and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.\n\nUnder the influence of [[Bede]], [[Alcuin]], and [[Rabanus Maurus]], ''De catechizandis rudibus'' came to exercise an important role in the education of clergy at the monastic schools, especially from the eighth century onwards.{{sfn|Howie|1969|p=150\u2013153}}\n\nAugustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline.\n\n==Works==\n{{main|Augustine of Hippo bibliography}}\n[[File:Antonio Rodr\u00edguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine'' painting by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez]]\nAugustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles.{{sfn|Wright|Sinclair|1931|pp=56-}} They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]]; texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''); [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]]; many [[sermon]]s and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.\n\nApart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate Dei'' (''[[The City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also considered to be among his masterpieces, and arguably of more doctrinal importance that the ''Confessions'' or the ''City of God''.{{sfn|Hill|1961|pp=540\u2013548}} He also wrote ''On Free Choice of the Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Verg\u00f3s Group - Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics'' painting by Verg\u00f3s Group]]\n\nIn both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the ''[[Enneads]]'', probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Some Neoplatonist Concepts, some ideas are still visible in his early writings.{{sfn|Russell|1945|p=|loc=Book II, Chapter IV}} His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. He was also influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), and [[Cicero]] (known for his teaching on argument).<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\n===In philosophy===\n[[Philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the ''Confessions'', comparing it favourably to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s version of the view that time is subjective.{{sfn|Russell|1945|pp=352\u2013353}} Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the \"eternal present\"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory<ref>[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''</ref> clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.\n\nAugustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].{{sfn|De Paulo|2006|p=}} [[Edmund Husserl]] writes: \"The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem.\"{{sfn|Husserl|2019|p=21}}\n\n[[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]''.<ref group=lower-alpha>For example, Heidegger's articulations of how \"Being-in-the-world\" is described through thinking about ''seeing'': \"The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''.\" Heidegger then quotes the''Confessions'': \"Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'\". ''Being and Time'', Trs. Macquarrie & Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964, p. 171.</ref> [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): \"The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity.\"{{sfn|Chiba|1995|p=507}}\n\nJean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: \"Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced [[the Holocaust]] as merely banal [in ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]''].\"{{sfn|Tinder|1997|pp=432-433}}\nAugustine's philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th-century figures. Seen from a historical perspective, there are three main perspectives on the political thought of Augustine: first, political Augustinianism; second, Augustinian [[political theology]]; and third, Augustinian political theory.{{sfn|Woo|2015|pp=421-441}}\n\n===In theology===\n{{Scholastic Philosophy}}\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall, without \"supernatural gifts\".{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=1203}} While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|pp=1200\u20131204}}\n\nAccording to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against [[paganism]] and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and [[witchcraft]]. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Marxism]], [[Freudianism]] and eco-fundamentalism.{{sfn|Lal|2002}} Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine's thought, particularly ''The City of God'', in their book of political philosophy ''Empire''.\n\nAugustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]. [[Hannah Arendt]], an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] extensively quotes Augustine in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''. Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of [[semiotics]], but rather built upon [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: \"as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies.\"{{sfn|Munteanu|1996|p=65}}\n\nIn his autobiographical book ''Milestones'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] claims Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought.\n\n===Oratorio===\n[[File:Jaume Huguet - Consecration of Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Consecration of Saint Augustine]]'' by [[Jaume Huguet]]]]\n\nMuch of Augustine's conversion is dramatized in the oratorio ''La conversione di Sant'Agostino'' (1750) composed by [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]. The libretto for this oratorio, written by [[Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria]], draws upon the influence of [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasio]] (the finished libretto having been edited by him) and is based on an earlier five-act play ''Idea perfectae conversionis dive Augustinus'' written by the Jesuit priest [[Franz Neumayr]].{{sfn|Smither|1997|pp=97-98}} In the libretto Augustine's mother Monica is presented as a prominent character that is worried that Augustine might not convert to Christianity.

The budget was estimated to be $1 million, which was attributed to the band wanting to be noticed on [[MTV]]. The song's dance routine was  choreographed by [[Darrin Henson]], who received a phone call from NSYNC's manager [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]], as he was about to quit the music industry after missing out on a [[MTV Video Music Award|VMA]] for [[Jordan Knight]]'s \"[[Give It to You (Jordan Knight song)|Give It to You]]\". Henson flew to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] in 1999, where the band were performing at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], so that he would be able to listen to the track. The band rehearsed at the Alley Kat Studio in Los Angeles over a few days, where Henson stated that he implemented moves which cannot be replicated by other groups.<ref name=\"EW20\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/2020/01/11/making-of-nsync-bye-bye-bye-music-video/|title=Inside the making of NSYNC's iconic 'Bye Bye Bye' music video|last=Kinane|first=Ruth|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 11, 2020|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> In a 2020 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Henson discussed how he formulated the dance:<ref name=\"EW20\"/><blockquote>I turned the music up as loud as it could go [...] I came up with the pumping hand \u2014 that\u2019s the [[Raised fist|black power fist]] \u2014 and the hand going across the front during the 'bye bye bye' lyric is the 'stop talking s\u2014.'

[[JC Chasez]] and [[Lance Bass]] were placed in a red [[Dodge Viper|Dodge Viper RT/10]] as part of a car-chase scene inspired by Chasez's favorite film, ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'', where the film's stunt coordinators were hired to assist the shoot. The scene where Bass and Chasez drop into the car was filmed with a [[Semi-trailer truck|18 wheeler]] carrying a pole, which allowed the two to drop into the car.<ref name=\"EW20\"/> Both scenes were shot in [[Fillmore, California]], as it was the only place to film the train sequence.<ref name=\"Billboard20\"/> In an episode of ''[[Making the Video]]'', [[Justin Timberlake]] explained his reaction to shooting his scene in the music video:<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite episode|title=*NSYNC: Bye Bye Bye|series=[[Making the Video]]|network=[[MTV]]|date=January 23, 2000|season=2|number=2|language=en}}</ref><blockquote>JC and Lance jumped into a moving automobile, Chris and Joey are on top of a train running, so I think I got off easiest on the stunts [...] All I have to do is run, but I have to make it look good \u2014 I can't look like a dork when I'm running.

She cuts Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick loose first, as they run over the top of a speeding train and hide among the passengers to escape. She then cuts Justin Timberlake loose next, which he outruns her trained dogs inside a warehouse, eventually escaping into the pouring rain.\n\nLance Bass and JC Chasez are finally cut loose, as they fall into a red Dodge Viper RT/10. They speed away from her, as she drives a silver [[BMW Z3 (E36/4)|BMW Z3]]. Eventually, they make a sudden u-turn when they are blocked by a truck, while the puppet master is forced to brake slower, allowing them to escape.\n\nAll the scenes are interspersed with shots of the band dancing in a rotating blue gimbal with a fixed camera, making them appear as though they are on different planes of gravity. The video edit of the song also briefly pauses the music when Justin lands in the warehouse, as well as when Lance and JC land on the car and insert a [[cassette tape]] into the car, and their u-turn at the end of the video.

I come from the Bronx, and in New York whenever somebody said something, you'd put your hand up in a talking manner, like open and close, meaning, 'stop talking s\u2014.'</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Fillmore, CA, View W, Old Telegraph Road, October 13, 2011 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Parts of the video were filmed in [[Fillmore, California]], as it was the only place for the train scene to be filmed.]] \n\nThey contacted Isham through the phone, before he met them during dance rehearsals for the song.<ref name=\"Billboard20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9344530/nsync-video-director-wayne-isham-interview|title='F--k, Let's Just Go For It': *NSYNC Video Director Wayne Isham Talks 'Bye Bye Bye' & 'It's Gonna Be Me' Clips|last=Daw|first=Robbie|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=March 27, 2020|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref> During the music video's shoot, the band were fastened to bungee cords, mimicking [[puppet]]s on strings, as well as performing their choreography in a blue [[gimbal]] room, which Isham pointed out that it was inspired by [[Gene Kelly]] during the 1940s, as well as [[Lionel Richie]]'s video for \"[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]\", which was directed and choreographed by [[Stanley Donen]].<ref name=\"EW20\"/><ref name=\"Billboard20\"/> During the speeding train sequence, [[Joey Fatone]] and [[Chris Kirkpatrick]]  performed their own stunts as they jumped from one train carriage to another, as a [[Steadicam]] operator needed to be replaced mid-scene, due to being uncomfortable with the risk. [[JC Chasez]] and [[Lance Bass]] were placed in a red [[Dodge Viper|Dodge Viper RT/10]] as part of a car-chase scene inspired by Chasez's favorite film, ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'', where the film's stunt coordinators were hired to assist the shoot. The scene where Bass and Chasez drop into the car was filmed with a [[Semi-trailer truck|18 wheeler]] carrying a pole, which allowed the two to drop into the car.<ref name=\"EW20\"/> Both scenes were shot in [[Fillmore, California]], as it was the only place to film the train sequence.<ref name=\"Billboard20\"/> In an episode of ''[[Making the Video]]'', [[Justin Timberlake]] explained his reaction to shooting his scene in the music video:<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite episode|title=*NSYNC: Bye Bye Bye|series=[[Making the Video]]|network=[[MTV]]|date=January 23, 2000|season=2|number=2|language=en}}</ref><blockquote>JC and Lance jumped into a moving automobile, Chris and Joey are on top of a train running, so I think I got off easiest on the stunts [...] All I have to do is run, but I have to make it look good \u2014 I can't look like a dork when I'm running. Gotta be cool.</blockquote>\n\nHenson eventually won an [[MTV Video Music Award]] [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|for Best Choreography]] at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]], while NSYNC also won [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]] at the same ceremony.<ref name=\"EW20\"/>\n\n===Synopsis===\n[[File:Bye Bye Bye music video.png|thumb|right|The members of the group portray [[puppet]]s, in reference to their destiny being controlled by [[Lou Pearlman]] during their legal dispute.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Soren|title=Flashback 2000: 'N Sync, Britney, Eminem, and Backstreet Boys Set Sales Records|url=http://music.yahoo.com/library/default.asp?m=content&add=news&i=12042460&|publisher=[[Yahoo!

She cuts Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick loose first, as they run over the top of a speeding train and hide among the passengers to escape. She then cuts Justin Timberlake loose next, which he outruns her trained dogs inside a warehouse, eventually escaping into the pouring rain.\n\nLance Bass and JC Chasez are finally cut loose, as they fall into a red Dodge Viper RT/10. They speed away from her, as she drives a silver [[BMW Z3 (E36/4)|BMW Z3]]. Eventually, they make a sudden u-turn when they are blocked by a truck, while the puppet master is forced to brake slower, allowing them to escape.\n\nAll the scenes are interspersed with shots of the band dancing in a rotating blue gimbal with a fixed camera, making them appear as though they are on different planes of gravity. The video edit of the song also briefly pauses the music when Justin lands in the warehouse, as well as when Lance and JC land on the car and insert a [[cassette tape]] into the car, and their u-turn at the end of the video. The chorus is also extended twice at the end of the video; the first showcasing the band inside the box, while the second shows scenes of Lance and JC speeding away from the puppet master.\n\n===Reception===\nThe video reached #1 on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' for 25 straight days, second only to \"[[U Drive Me Crazy]]\", which made it to 26 straight days at #1.<ref>[http://atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=numberones ATRL - The TRL Archive - Number Ones<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The video placed at #60 on [[MuchMusic]]'s 100 Best Videos.

The RTA's creation was a result of the anticipated failure of commuter service operated and owned by various private [[railroad]] companies in the 1970s. In 1984, RTA formed a commuter rail division to focus on rail operations, which branded itself as Metra in 1985. Freight rail companies still operate four of Metra's routes under [[contract]]ed service agreements. Metra owns all [[rolling stock]] and is responsible for all stations along with the respective municipalities. Since its inception, Metra has directed more than $5 billion into the commuter rail system of the Chicago metropolitan area.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of passenger rail in Chicago}}\n\n=== Early Chicago commuter rail ===\nSince its founding in the 19th century, Chicago has been a major Midwestern hub in the North American rail network.<ref name=ChicagoHistoryEncyc-Railroads>{{cite web  | title = Railroads | work = Encyclopedia of Chicago | publisher = Chicago Historical Society | url = http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1039.html | date = January 23, 2009 | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref> It has more trackage radiating in more directions than any other city in North America.<ref name=ChicagoHistoryEncyc-Railroads /> Railroads set up their headquarters in the city and Chicago became a center for building freight cars, passenger cars and diesel locomotives. Early commuter services were run by the Santa Fe, Baltimore & Ohio, Chicago Great Western, Pennsylvania, and Michigan Central. They were all eventually discontinued.\n\nBy the 1930s Chicago had the world's largest public transportation system, but commuter rail services started to decline.<ref name=UIC-CCRC>{{cite web  | title = Chicago Commuter Rail Collection | work = Special Collection Finding Aids | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] | url = http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/CCRb.html | date = August 17, 2006  | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref> By the mid-1970s, the commuter lines faced an uncertain future.

After initially using second-hand equipment, the RTA took delivery of the first new [[EMD F40PH]] locomotives in 1976. That F40PH fleet is still in service today.<ref name=ChicagoTransitRailfan-MetraHistory /> The companies that had long provided commuter rail in the Chicago area continued to operate their lines under contract to the RTA.<ref name=Metra-History/>\n\nLess than a decade later the Regional Transportation Authority was already suffering from ongoing financial problems. Additionally, two rail providers, the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Rock Island Line]] and the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], went bankrupt, forcing the RTA to create the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation to operate their lines directly in 1982. In 1983 the Illinois Legislature reorganized the agency. That reorganization left the Regional Transportation Authority in charge of day-to-day operations of all bus, heavy rail and commuter rail services throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. It was also responsible for directing fare and service levels, setting up budgets, finding sources for capital investment and planning. A new Commuter Rail Division was created to handle commuter rail operations; along with CTA and [[Pace (transit)|Pace]], it was one of RTA's three \"service boards.\"<ref name=Metra-History />\n\n=== Metra branding ===\n[[File:Metra 614.jpg|thumb|right|Metra EMD F40C No. 614 in [[Chicago]].]]\nThe board of the RTA Commuter Rail Division first met in 1984.

Four other routes continue to be operated by [[Union Pacific]] (formerly [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company|Chicago & North Western]]) and [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]] (formerly [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]]) under contract to Metra. Service throughout the network is provided under the Metra name (in keeping with Metra's goal of providing a single identity for all commuter rail in the region). Metra also owns all rolling stock, controls fares and staffing levels, and is responsible for most of the stations. However, the freight carriers who operate routes under contract use their own employees and control the right-of-way for those routes.<ref name=Metra-History />\n\n=== Growth and expansion ===\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century Metra experienced record ridership and expanded its services. In 1996 Metra organized its first new line, the [[North Central Service]], running from Union Station to Antioch. By 2006 it added new intermediate stops to that same route, extended the Union Pacific / West Line from Geneva to Elburn and extended SouthWest Service from Orland Park to Manhattan. In 2012 it boasted 95.8% average [[on-time performance]] (measured only for a train's arrivals at its last station no more than six minutes late).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metrarail.com/content/dam/metra/documents/ridership_reports/On_Time_Performance/OTPreport2012M12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204041810/http://metrarail.com/content/dam/metra/documents/ridership_reports/On_Time_Performance/OTPreport2012M12.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-04 }}</ref> It also posted its fourth highest volume in its history despite decreases in employment opportunities in downtown Chicago.<ref name=Metra-AnnualRidership>{{cite web|title=Metra Ridership Reports \u2013 Annual Ridership |work=Metra Annual Report |publisher=Metra |url=http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/about_metra/planning_records_reports/ridership_reports/annual_ridership.html |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527172814/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/about_metra/planning_records_reports/ridership_reports/annual_ridership.html |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMetra continued to seek expansion options and to improve passenger service.

However, Metra runs service to Joliet, Illinois, on two routes: Heritage Corridor and Rock Island District.\n\n===Ridership===\n====Annual ridership====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Annual ridership by line<ref name=2018report>{{cite web |title=RIDERSHIP TRENDS ANNUAL REPORT 2018 |url=https://metrarail.com/sites/default/files/assets/planning/ridership/2018_annual_ridership_report.pdf |publisher=Metra |accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=2| Line !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019\n|-\n| [[BNSF Railway (Metra)|BNSF Railway]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|bnsf}}\"| || 16,658,357 || 16,400,290 || 16,325,320 || 16,235,817 || 15,822,652 || 15,468,014\n|-\n| [[Heritage Corridor]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|hc}}\" | || 729,139 || 723,803 || 718,015 || 727,202 || 728,467 || 734,098\n|-\n| [[Metra Electric District]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|me}}\"| || 9,415,916 || 9,054,649 || 8,642,365 || 8,149,977 || 7,716,121 || 7,282,993\n|-\n| [[Milwaukee District / North Line]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|mdn}}\"| || 7,237,913 || 7,094,564 || 6,934,684 || 6,818,808 || 6,610,059 || 6,549,143\n|-\n| [[Milwaukee District / West Line]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|mdw}}\"| || 6,946,268 || 6,771,637 || 6,621,104 || 6,349,963 || 6,143,996 || 5,904,808\n|-\n| [[North Central Service]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|nc}}\"| || 1,817,335 || 1,758,118 || 1,730,494 || 1,684,357 || 1,640,984 || 1,589,905\n|-\n| [[Rock Island District]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|ri}}\"| || 8,544,753 || 8,305,273 || 8,112,784 || 7,923,588 || 7,578,330 || 7,338,133\n|-\n| [[SouthWest Service]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|sw}}\"| || 2,659,040 || 2,604,292 || 2,538,273 || 2,457,418 || 2,420,921 || 2,356,767\n|-\n| [[Union Pacific / North Line]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|upn}}\"| || 9,328,441 || 9,248,834 || 9,220,477 || 9,030,120 || 8,689,776 || 8,552,117\n|-\n| [[Union Pacific / Northwest Line]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|upnw}}\"| || 11,609,358 || 11,301,755 || 11,183,739 || 10,910,882 || 10,597,680 || 10,384,356\n|-\n| [[Union Pacific / West Line]] || style=\"background:#{{rcr|Metra|upw}}\"| || 8,423,188 || 8,367,264 || 8,375,067 || 8,332,483 || 8,139,344 || 7,883,185\n|-\n! colspan=2| Total !! 83,369,706 !! 81,630,476 !! 80,402,319 !! 78,620,612 !! 76,088,329 !! 74,043,156\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Annual ridership by year\n|-\n!

[[Parking lot]]s are available adjacent to most suburban Metra stations for passengers connecting with their train by [[Automobile|car]]. Most parking lots are operated by the municipality they are located in. Fees and fines are also assessed by the local municipality; however, parking is usually free on weekends and most holidays.<ref name=Metra-Parking>{{cite web |url= http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/riding_metra/parking.html |title= Parking Map |date= February 23, 2011 |work= Riding Metra |publisher= Metra |accessdate= May 14, 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132429/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/riding_metra/parking.html |archivedate= July 6, 2011 }}</ref> Mass transit [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] and suburban [[Pace (transit)|Pace]] buses connect with many Metra stations downtown and in the suburbs.

Most 'L' lines traverse [[The Loop (CTA)|the Loop]] allowing nearby access to all downtown Metra terminals. There are also transfer points between Metra and the 'L'  outside of the Loop, such as transfers from the [[Union Pacific/Northwest Line]] to the [[Blue Line (CTA)|Blue Line]] at [[Irving Park station (CTA Blue Line)|Irving Park]] and [[Jefferson Park Transit Center]]; and from the [[Union Pacific / West Line]] to the [[Green Line (CTA)|Green Line]] at Oak Park.<ref name=Garfield-JeffersonPark>{{cite web |url= http://www.chicago-l.org/stations/jefferson_pk.html |title= Jefferson Park |work=Northern Illinois History |author=Garfield, Graham |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref> 'L' trains announce downtown Metra connections on board when announcing the next 'L' stop. \n\nUnion Station doubles as both a Metra station and [[Amtrak]]'s station in Chicago.<ref name=Metra-UnionStation>{{cite web|url=http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/maps_schedules/downtown_chicagostations/chicago_union_station.html |title=Chicago Union Station |date=February 23, 2011 |publisher=Metra |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614012328/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/maps_schedules/downtown_chicagostations/chicago_union_station.html |archivedate=June 14, 2011 }}</ref> In addition to [[Illinois Service]] and [[Hiawatha Service]], Amtrak trains run nationwide including service to [[Coastal states|states spanning both coastlines]].<ref name=Amtrak-UnionStation>{{cite web |url= http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=am/am2Station/Station_Page&code=CHI |title= Chicago, IL - Union Station (CHI)|publisher= Amtrak |accessdate= May 14, 2011}}</ref> Passengers connecting from Ogilvie Transportation Center can access Union Station through its north platforms on the opposite side of [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Street]],<ref name=Metra-UnionStation /> with Millennium and LaSalle stations also within a short walking distance of Union Station as well. A number of suburban Metra stations are also shared with Amtrak as well.\n\nThe [[South Shore Line]], an [[interurban]] line connecting Chicago with the Indiana suburbs and [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], originates at Millennium Station and operates along much of the Chicago portion of the Electric District line, as far south as [[63rd Street station (Metra)|63rd Street]]. Per a longstanding noncompete agreement, eastbound South Shore trains only stop at shared Electric District stations to board passengers, and westbound South Shore trains only stop to discharge passengers.\n\n===Positive train control===\nIn regards to the [[Positive train control|PTC mandate]] that passed [[United States Congress|Congress]], Metra took steps to meet the deadline. Metra concluded that the December 31, 2015 mandate to have PTC running was an unreasonable requirement. This aligns with the stance taken by much of the railroad industry.<ref name=\"AAR PTC Stance\">{{cite web|title=Positive Train Control|url=https://www.aar.org/policy/positive-train-control|website=Association of American Railroads}}</ref> This is due to a variety factors including but not limited to: delays from the government and the fundamental complexity of building a program from the ground up. Moreover, Metra estimates the cost of implementing the system on their {{convert|1100|mi|km}} of track in the Chicago region to be over $200 million.<ref name=\"Metra PTC Delay\">{{cite web|last1=Wronksi|first1=Richard|title=Metra argues for delay of 'fail-safe' rail system|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-09/news/ct-met-metra-collision-prevention-20130409_1_metra-rock-island-ptc-safety-system|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> The fear is this unfunded mandate will divert scarce capital funds from other essential needs. This includes building and maintaining existing tracks, stations, signals, and other equipment that ensures a safe operating environment for all of Metra\u2019s passengers. However, Metra recognizes the need for PTC but just would like a more reasonable timeline to implement such a program. This recognition is partially based on Metra\u2019s previous accident history. Two noteworthy events were a pair of accidents on the Rock Island District within a span of a couple of years. The first event was a derailment that occurred on October 12, 2003 when a train flew through a 10&nbsp;mph crossing at 68&nbsp;mph. A second very similar occurrence happened on September 17, 2005 but was more serious. This derailment killed 2 passengers and injured 117.<ref name=\"Metra PTC Delay\" /> Both of these incidents could have been prevented if PTC were in place. In both circumstances PTC would have overridden the engineer and slowed the train down to the appropriate speed to prevent an accident from occurring. \n\nRecently, Metra has taken significant steps in the process to fully implementing PTC. On April 22, 2015 the Metra board approved an $80 million contract to Parsons Transportation Group.<ref name=\"Metra $80million PTC contract\">{{cite web|last1=Wronski|first1=Richard|title=Metra to spend $80 million to help launch safety system|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-metra-contracts-met-20150422-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Parson\u2019s was the sole bidder and speaks to the complexities of the project. They will be in charge of incorporating various devices from GPS, radio, to trackside antennas into one cohesive system. The group has some experience in this sector previously as Parsons worked with the southern California commuter rail agency [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] to install their system.\n\n== Fare system and ticketing ==\n[[File:Metra bilevel entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to a Metra [[bilevel rail car]].]]\nFare is determined by the distance travelled by a passenger. Each station along every route has been placed in a specific zone based on its distance from its respective downtown station. Downtown terminal and downtown stations are classified as zone 'A' and each additional zone generally represents an added {{Convert|5|mi|km}} from the downtown terminus. Multiple stations can be placed in the same zone even though they are on the same line.<ref name=Metra-Tickets /> Fare zones include A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.<ref>metrarail.com</ref>\n\n=== Tickets ===\nSeveral ticketing options exist for passengers. Riders may choose to purchase one-way tickets, ten-ride tickets, weekend passes or monthly passes.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web  | title = Tickets | publisher = Metra | url = http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/tickets.html | date = May 21, 2011 | accessdate = 4 June 2011}}</ref>\n*A '''one-way ticket''' is used for one-way travel between two stations. For roundtrip travel, two one-way tickets can be purchased. One-way tickets can be purchased from ticket agents, with [[Ventra]], or on the train from a conductor. Conductors will charge an extra $5 if a ticket agent was available at the passenger's departing station.<ref name=Metra-Tickets /><ref>{{Cite web|title = Metra postpones hike in cost of ticket bought on-board - Chicago|url = http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/7/71/316055/metra-postpones-hike-cost-ticket-bought-board|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Ventra app presented at show-and-tell, expected to be rolled out soon|url = https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-ventra-smartphone-app-met-0321-20150320-story.html|accessdate = 2015-07-29|first = Chicago|last = Tribune}}</ref>\n*A '''ten-ride''' provides ten rides between two zones determined at the time of purchase. Ten-rides can be shared between passengers and expire after one year from the date of purchase. Ten-rides can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail, online from Metra's website, or with Ventra.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />\n*A '''weekend pass''' provides unlimited travel between any and all zones for one passenger on a Saturday and Sunday. Sometimes weekend passes are extended to include holidays adjacent to the weekend. Weekend passes can always be purchased from conductors without a surcharge. Weekend passes can also be purchased from ticket agents, or with Ventra. As of 2018, weekend passes cost $10.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />\n*A '''monthly pass''' provides unlimited travel between any two zones for one passenger on every day of a respective month. Monthly passes can be used on any line within the specified zones. Monthly passes can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail, online from Metra's website, or with Ventra. Monthly pass holders may also purchase a Pace PlusBus card in conjunction with their monthly pass purchase. The PlusBus card provides unlimited rides on all Pace suburban buses.<ref>{{cite web | title = Changes Coming as Link-Up, PlusBus Cards Transition to Ventra | publisher = Metra | url = https://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/newsroom/newsroom_archive/2013NewsroomArchive/changes_coming_aslink-upplusbuscardstransitiontoventra.html | date =  | accessdate = 20 June 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141114100002/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/newsroom/newsroom_archive/2013NewsroomArchive/changes_coming_aslink-upplusbuscardstransitiontoventra.html | archive-date = 14 November 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref> A CTA/Pace Link-Up pass is also available for purchase. On CTA buses and the CTA 'L' the Link-Up pass allows unlimited travel during weekday rush hours and on Pace buses it allows unlimited travel anytime. Monthly pass holders may also travel beyond the zones listed on the monthly pass by purchasing incremental tickets from conductors on the train. Incremental tickets cost $1 beyond the first zone and 50 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] for every additional zone thereafter. There is no surcharge to purchase incremental tickets for monthly pass holders.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />\n\n===Reduced fare programs===\nMetra allows some travellers to purchase reduced fare tickets or even ride for free. These reduced fare and free ride programs are administered by Metra and the [[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|RTA]]. Some pre-college [[student]]s, [[youth]], [[senior citizen]]s, members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and persons with [[Disability|disabilities]] may qualify for these programs. Time-based and geographical restrictions apply to these programs and passengers must ensure they qualify before attempting to purchase special tickets or ride for free.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />\n\n==Safety and security==\n[[File:Metra Trains at Waukeegan.jpg|thumb|right|Metra F40PH locomotives at the [[Waukegan (Metra)|Waukegan Station]].]]\nMetra employees, the [[Metra Police Department]] and other public safety agencies are responsible for maintaining safety and security on its lines, aboard its trains and at stations all to various degrees.

The RTA's creation was a result of the anticipated failure of commuter service operated and owned by various private [[railroad]] companies in the 1970s. In 1984, RTA formed a commuter rail division to focus on rail operations, which branded itself as Metra in 1985. Freight rail companies still operate four of Metra's routes under [[contract]]ed service agreements. Metra owns all [[rolling stock]] and is responsible for all stations along with the respective municipalities. Since its inception, Metra has directed more than $5 billion into the commuter rail system of the Chicago metropolitan area.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of passenger rail in Chicago}}\n\n=== Early Chicago commuter rail ===\nSince its founding in the 19th century, Chicago has been a major Midwestern hub in the North American rail network.<ref name=ChicagoHistoryEncyc-Railroads>{{cite web  | title = Railroads | work = Encyclopedia of Chicago | publisher = Chicago Historical Society | url = http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1039.html | date = January 23, 2009 | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref> It has more trackage radiating in more directions than any other city in North America.<ref name=ChicagoHistoryEncyc-Railroads /> Railroads set up their headquarters in the city and Chicago became a center for building freight cars, passenger cars and diesel locomotives. Early commuter services were run by the Santa Fe, Baltimore & Ohio, Chicago Great Western, Pennsylvania, and Michigan Central. They were all eventually discontinued.\n\nBy the 1930s Chicago had the world's largest public transportation system, but commuter rail services started to decline.<ref name=UIC-CCRC>{{cite web  | title = Chicago Commuter Rail Collection | work = Special Collection Finding Aids | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] | url = http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/CCRb.html | date = August 17, 2006  | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref> By the mid-1970s, the commuter lines faced an uncertain future.

After initially using second-hand equipment, the RTA took delivery of the first new [[EMD F40PH]] locomotives in 1976. That F40PH fleet is still in service today.<ref name=ChicagoTransitRailfan-MetraHistory /> The companies that had long provided commuter rail in the Chicago area continued to operate their lines under contract to the RTA.<ref name=Metra-History/>\n\nLess than a decade later the Regional Transportation Authority was already suffering from ongoing financial problems. Additionally, two rail providers, the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Rock Island Line]] and the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], went bankrupt, forcing the RTA to create the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation to operate their lines directly in 1982. In 1983 the Illinois Legislature reorganized the agency. That reorganization left the Regional Transportation Authority in charge of day-to-day operations of all bus, heavy rail and commuter rail services throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. It was also responsible for directing fare and service levels, setting up budgets, finding sources for capital investment and planning. A new Commuter Rail Division was created to handle commuter rail operations; along with CTA and [[Pace (transit)|Pace]], it was one of RTA's three \"service boards.\"<ref name=Metra-History />\n\n=== Metra branding ===\n[[File:Metra 614.jpg|thumb|right|Metra EMD F40C No. 614 in [[Chicago]].]]\nThe board of the RTA Commuter Rail Division first met in 1984.

Four other routes continue to be operated by [[Union Pacific]] (formerly [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company|Chicago & North Western]]) and [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]] (formerly [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]]) under contract to Metra. Service throughout the network is provided under the Metra name (in keeping with Metra's goal of providing a single identity for all commuter rail in the region). Metra also owns all rolling stock, controls fares and staffing levels, and is responsible for most of the stations. However, the freight carriers who operate routes under contract use their own employees and control the right-of-way for those routes.<ref name=Metra-History />\n\n=== Growth and expansion ===\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century Metra experienced record ridership and expanded its services. In 1996 Metra organized its first new line, the [[North Central Service]], running from Union Station to Antioch. By 2006 it added new intermediate stops to that same route, extended the Union Pacific / West Line from Geneva to Elburn and extended SouthWest Service from Orland Park to Manhattan. In 2012 it boasted 95.8% average [[on-time performance]] (measured only for a train's arrivals at its last station no more than six minutes late).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metrarail.com/content/dam/metra/documents/ridership_reports/On_Time_Performance/OTPreport2012M12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204041810/http://metrarail.com/content/dam/metra/documents/ridership_reports/On_Time_Performance/OTPreport2012M12.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-04 }}</ref> It also posted its fourth highest volume in its history despite decreases in employment opportunities in downtown Chicago.<ref name=Metra-AnnualRidership>{{cite web|title=Metra Ridership Reports \u2013 Annual Ridership |work=Metra Annual Report |publisher=Metra |url=http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/about_metra/planning_records_reports/ridership_reports/annual_ridership.html |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527172814/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/about_metra/planning_records_reports/ridership_reports/annual_ridership.html |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMetra continued to seek expansion options and to improve passenger service.

Chicago Eastern Illinois operated commuter service on this line out of Dearborn Station to Dolton and Momence, respectively. The Chicago and Eastern Illinois commuter line to Momence, Illinois, ended in 1935, while the Chicago and Western Indiana service to Dolton, Illinois, was discontinued in 1964.

Moreover, Metra estimates the cost of implementing the system on their {{convert|1100|mi|km}} of track in the Chicago region to be over $200 million.<ref name=\"Metra PTC Delay\">{{cite web|last1=Wronksi|first1=Richard|title=Metra argues for delay of 'fail-safe' rail system|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-09/news/ct-met-metra-collision-prevention-20130409_1_metra-rock-island-ptc-safety-system|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> The fear is this unfunded mandate will divert scarce capital funds from other essential needs. This includes building and maintaining existing tracks, stations, signals, and other equipment that ensures a safe operating environment for all of Metra\u2019s passengers. However, Metra recognizes the need for PTC but just would like a more reasonable timeline to implement such a program. This recognition is partially based on Metra\u2019s previous accident history. Two noteworthy events were a pair of accidents on the Rock Island District within a span of a couple of years. The first event was a derailment that occurred on October 12, 2003 when a train flew through a 10&nbsp;mph crossing at 68&nbsp;mph. A second very similar occurrence happened on September 17, 2005 but was more serious. This derailment killed 2 passengers and injured 117.<ref name=\"Metra PTC Delay\" /> Both of these incidents could have been prevented if PTC were in place. In both circumstances PTC would have overridden the engineer and slowed the train down to the appropriate speed to prevent an accident from occurring. \n\nRecently, Metra has taken significant steps in the process to fully implementing PTC. On April 22, 2015 the Metra board approved an $80 million contract to Parsons Transportation Group.<ref name=\"Metra $80million PTC contract\">{{cite web|last1=Wronski|first1=Richard|title=Metra to spend $80 million to help launch safety system|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-metra-contracts-met-20150422-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Parson\u2019s was the sole bidder and speaks to the complexities of the project. They will be in charge of incorporating various devices from GPS, radio, to trackside antennas into one cohesive system. The group has some experience in this sector previously as Parsons worked with the southern California commuter rail agency [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] to install their system.\n\n== Fare system and ticketing ==\n[[File:Metra bilevel entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to a Metra [[bilevel rail car]].]]\nFare is determined by the distance travelled by a passenger. Each station along every route has been placed in a specific zone based on its distance from its respective downtown station. Downtown terminal and downtown stations are classified as zone 'A' and each additional zone generally represents an added {{Convert|5|mi|km}} from the downtown terminus. Multiple stations can be placed in the same zone even though they are on the same line.<ref name=Metra-Tickets /> Fare zones include A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.<ref>metrarail.com</ref>\n\n=== Tickets ===\nSeveral ticketing options exist for passengers. Riders may choose to purchase one-way tickets, ten-ride tickets, weekend passes or monthly passes.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web  | title = Tickets | publisher = Metra | url = http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/tickets.html | date = May 21, 2011 | accessdate = 4 June 2011}}</ref>\n*A '''one-way ticket''' is used for one-way travel between two stations. For roundtrip travel, two one-way tickets can be purchased. One-way tickets can be purchased from ticket agents, with [[Ventra]], or on the train from a conductor. Conductors will charge an extra $5 if a ticket agent was available at the passenger's departing station.<ref name=Metra-Tickets /><ref>{{Cite web|title = Metra postpones hike in cost of ticket bought on-board - Chicago|url = http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/7/71/316055/metra-postpones-hike-cost-ticket-bought-board|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Ventra app presented at show-and-tell, expected to be rolled out soon|url = https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-ventra-smartphone-app-met-0321-20150320-story.html|accessdate = 2015-07-29|first = Chicago|last = Tribune}}</ref>\n*A '''ten-ride''' provides ten rides between two zones determined at the time of purchase. Ten-rides can be shared between passengers and expire after one year from the date of purchase. Ten-rides can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail, online from Metra's website, or with Ventra.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />\n*A '''weekend pass''' provides unlimited travel between any and all zones for one passenger on a Saturday and Sunday. Sometimes weekend passes are extended to include holidays adjacent to the weekend. Weekend passes can always be purchased from conductors without a surcharge. Weekend passes can also be purchased from ticket agents, or with Ventra. As of 2018, weekend passes cost $10.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />\n*A '''monthly pass''' provides unlimited travel between any two zones for one passenger on every day of a respective month. Monthly passes can be used on any line within the specified zones. Monthly passes can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail, online from Metra's website, or with Ventra. Monthly pass holders may also purchase a Pace PlusBus card in conjunction with their monthly pass purchase. The PlusBus card provides unlimited rides on all Pace suburban buses.<ref>{{cite web | title = Changes Coming as Link-Up, PlusBus Cards Transition to Ventra | publisher = Metra | url = https://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/newsroom/newsroom_archive/2013NewsroomArchive/changes_coming_aslink-upplusbuscardstransitiontoventra.html | date =  | accessdate = 20 June 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141114100002/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/newsroom/newsroom_archive/2013NewsroomArchive/changes_coming_aslink-upplusbuscardstransitiontoventra.html | archive-date = 14 November 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref> A CTA/Pace Link-Up pass is also available for purchase. On CTA buses and the CTA 'L' the Link-Up pass allows unlimited travel during weekday rush hours and on Pace buses it allows unlimited travel anytime. Monthly pass holders may also travel beyond the zones listed on the monthly pass by purchasing incremental tickets from conductors on the train. Incremental tickets cost $1 beyond the first zone and 50 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] for every additional zone thereafter. There is no surcharge to purchase incremental tickets for monthly pass holders.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />\n\n===Reduced fare programs===\nMetra allows some travellers to purchase reduced fare tickets or even ride for free. These reduced fare and free ride programs are administered by Metra and the [[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|RTA]]. Some pre-college [[student]]s, [[youth]], [[senior citizen]]s, members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and persons with [[Disability|disabilities]] may qualify for these programs. Time-based and geographical restrictions apply to these programs and passengers must ensure they qualify before attempting to purchase special tickets or ride for free.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />\n\n==Safety and security==\n[[File:Metra Trains at Waukeegan.jpg|thumb|right|Metra F40PH locomotives at the [[Waukegan (Metra)|Waukegan Station]].]]\nMetra employees, the [[Metra Police Department]] and other public safety agencies are responsible for maintaining safety and security on its lines, aboard its trains and at stations all to various degrees.

The same material can be used as a casting resin or in inks and coatings, among many other uses.\n\nAlthough not a type of familiar [[silica]]-based glass, the substance, like many thermoplastics, is often technically classified as a type of [[glass]] (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historical designation as ''acrylic glass''. Chemically, it is the [[list of synthetic polymers|synthetic polymer]] of [[methyl methacrylate]]. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, [[Otto R\u00f6hm]], and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by German ''R\u00f6hm & Haas AG'' (as of January 2019 part of [[Evonik Industries]]) and its partner and former U.S. affiliate [[Rohm and Haas|Rohm and Haas Company]] under the [[trademark]] Plexiglas.<ref>[https://history.evonik.com/sites/geschichte/de/erfindungen/plexiglas/ Plexiglas history by Evonik (German only)]</ref>\n\nPMMA is an economical alternative to [[polycarbonate]] (PC) when [[tensile strength]], [[flexural strength]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], polishability, and UV tolerance are more important than [[impact strength]], chemical resistance, and heat resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrosight.com/acrylic-vs-polycarbonate-a-quantitative-and-qualitative-comparison/|title=Acrylic vs. Polycarbonate: A quantitative and qualitative comparison|author=Hydrosight|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119194950/http://www.hydrosight.com/acrylic-vs-polycarbonate-a-quantitative-and-qualitative-comparison/|archivedate=2017-01-19}}</ref> Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful [[bisphenol-A]] subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an [[impact (mechanics)|impact force]], and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.\n\n==History==\nThe first acrylic acid was created in 1843. [[Methacrylic acid]], derived from [[acrylic acid]], was formulated in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and [[methanol]] results in the ester methyl methacrylate. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) in the United Kingdom. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}} ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist [[Otto R\u00f6hm]] of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which R\u00f6hm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 ICI Acrylics (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During [[World War II]] both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass.<ref name=\"Schwarcz2012\">{{citation|author=Schwarcz, Joe|title=The Right Chemistry: 108 Enlightening, Nutritious, Health-Conscious and Occasionally Bizarre Inquiries into the Science of Daily Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar_wkXGvB8UC&pg=PT226|date=6 November 2012|publisher=Doubleday Canada|isbn=978-0-385-67160-6|page=226|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420210611/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar_wkXGvB8UC&pg=PT226|archivedate=20 April 2016}}</ref> Civilian applications followed after the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/polymethyl-methacrylate |title=Polymethyl methacrylate &#124; chemical compound |accessdate=2017-05-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031004312/https://www.britannica.com/science/polymethyl-methacrylate |archivedate=2017-10-31 }}</ref>\n\n===Names===\nCommon orthographic stylings include ''polymethyl methacrylate''<ref name=\"Dorlands\">{{Citation |title = polymethyl methacrylate |work =Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |url=https://www.dorlandsonline.com/dorland/definition?id=100085009&searchterm=polymethyl%20methacrylate|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=\"MW_Collegiate\">{{Cite Merriam-Webster|polymethyl methacrylate}}</ref> and ''polymethylmethacrylate''.

Generally, radical initiation is used (including [[living polymerization]] methods), but anionic polymerization of PMMA can also be performed. To produce {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} of PMMA, about {{convert|2|kg|abbr=on}} of [[petroleum]] is needed.{{citation needed|reason=Since the C and H are preserved, and oxygen is added, it should be less than 1|date=May 2016}} PMMA produced by [[radical polymerization]] (all commercial PMMA) is [[atactic]] and completely amorphous.\n\n==Processing==\nThe [[glass transition temperature]] (''T<sub>g</sub>'') of [[Tacticity|atactic]] PMMA is {{convert|105|C|F}}.  The ''T<sub>g</sub>'' values of commercial grades of PMMA range from {{convert |85|to|165|C|F}}; the range is so wide because of the vast number of commercial compositions which are copolymers with co-monomers other than methyl methacrylate.  PMMA is thus an organic glass at room temperature; i.e., it is below its ''T<sub>g</sub>''.  The forming temperature starts at the glass transition temperature and goes up from there.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Ashby | first = Michael F. | author-link = Michael F.

PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a very clean cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily.

Through the use of injection molding techniques, wax based designs with artificial teeth set in predetermined positions built on gypsum stone models of patients' mouths can be converted into functional prosthetics used to replace missing dentition. PMMA polymer and methyl methacrylate monomer mix is then injected into a flask containing a gypsum mold of the previously designed prosthesis, and placed under heat to initiate polymerization process. Pressure is used during the curing process to minimize polymerization shrinkage, ensuring an accurate fit of the prosthesis. Though other methods of polymerizing PMMA for prosthetic fabrication exist, such as chemical and microwave resin activation, the previously described heat-activated resin polymerization technique is the most commonly used due to its cost effectiveness and minimal polymerization shrinkage. \n* '''Artificial''' '''Teeth''': While denture teeth can be made of several different materials, PMMA is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics. Mechanical properties of the material allow for heightened control of aesthetics, easy surface adjustments, decreased risk of fracture when in function in the oral cavity, and minimal wear against opposing teeth. Additionally, since the bases of dental prosthetics are often constructed using PMMA, adherence of PMMA denture teeth to PMMA denture bases is unparalleled, leading to the construction of a strong and durable prosthetic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prosthodontic treatment for edentulous patients : complete dentures and implant-supported prostheses|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|others=Zarb, George A.

Chemically, it is the [[list of synthetic polymers|synthetic polymer]] of [[methyl methacrylate]]. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, [[Otto R\u00f6hm]], and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by German ''R\u00f6hm & Haas AG'' (as of January 2019 part of [[Evonik Industries]]) and its partner and former U.S. affiliate [[Rohm and Haas|Rohm and Haas Company]] under the [[trademark]] Plexiglas.<ref>[https://history.evonik.com/sites/geschichte/de/erfindungen/plexiglas/ Plexiglas history by Evonik (German only)]</ref>\n\nPMMA is an economical alternative to [[polycarbonate]] (PC) when [[tensile strength]], [[flexural strength]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], polishability, and UV tolerance are more important than [[impact strength]], chemical resistance, and heat resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrosight.com/acrylic-vs-polycarbonate-a-quantitative-and-qualitative-comparison/|title=Acrylic vs. Polycarbonate: A quantitative and qualitative comparison|author=Hydrosight|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119194950/http://www.hydrosight.com/acrylic-vs-polycarbonate-a-quantitative-and-qualitative-comparison/|archivedate=2017-01-19}}</ref> Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful [[bisphenol-A]] subunits found in polycarbonate.

Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an [[impact (mechanics)|impact force]], and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.\n\n==History==\nThe first acrylic acid was created in 1843. [[Methacrylic acid]], derived from [[acrylic acid]], was formulated in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and [[methanol]] results in the ester methyl methacrylate. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) in the United Kingdom. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}} ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist [[Otto R\u00f6hm]] of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which R\u00f6hm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 ICI Acrylics (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During [[World War II]] both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass.<ref name=\"Schwarcz2012\">{{citation|author=Schwarcz, Joe|title=The Right Chemistry: 108 Enlightening, Nutritious, Health-Conscious and Occasionally Bizarre Inquiries into the Science of Daily Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar_wkXGvB8UC&pg=PT226|date=6 November 2012|publisher=Doubleday Canada|isbn=978-0-385-67160-6|page=226|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420210611/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar_wkXGvB8UC&pg=PT226|archivedate=20 April 2016}}</ref> Civilian applications followed after the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/polymethyl-methacrylate |title=Polymethyl methacrylate &#124; chemical compound |accessdate=2017-05-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031004312/https://www.britannica.com/science/polymethyl-methacrylate |archivedate=2017-10-31 }}</ref>\n\n===Names===\nCommon orthographic stylings include ''polymethyl methacrylate''<ref name=\"Dorlands\">{{Citation |title = polymethyl methacrylate |work =Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |url=https://www.dorlandsonline.com/dorland/definition?id=100085009&searchterm=polymethyl%20methacrylate|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=\"MW_Collegiate\">{{Cite Merriam-Webster|polymethyl methacrylate}}</ref> and ''polymethylmethacrylate''.

PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a very clean cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses along the cut edge, which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable \"stress-crazing\" at the cut edge and several millimetres deep.

Through the use of injection molding techniques, wax based designs with artificial teeth set in predetermined positions built on gypsum stone models of patients' mouths can be converted into functional prosthetics used to replace missing dentition. PMMA polymer and methyl methacrylate monomer mix is then injected into a flask containing a gypsum mold of the previously designed prosthesis, and placed under heat to initiate polymerization process. Pressure is used during the curing process to minimize polymerization shrinkage, ensuring an accurate fit of the prosthesis. Though other methods of polymerizing PMMA for prosthetic fabrication exist, such as chemical and microwave resin activation, the previously described heat-activated resin polymerization technique is the most commonly used due to its cost effectiveness and minimal polymerization shrinkage. \n* '''Artificial''' '''Teeth''': While denture teeth can be made of several different materials, PMMA is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics. Mechanical properties of the material allow for heightened control of aesthetics, easy surface adjustments, decreased risk of fracture when in function in the oral cavity, and minimal wear against opposing teeth. Additionally, since the bases of dental prosthetics are often constructed using PMMA, adherence of PMMA denture teeth to PMMA denture bases is unparalleled, leading to the construction of a strong and durable prosthetic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prosthodontic treatment for edentulous patients : complete dentures and implant-supported prostheses|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|others=Zarb, George A.

Patterns on this can be made by an electron beam (using an [[electron microscope]]), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard [[photolithography]] process), or [[X-ray]]s. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-[[cross-link]]ing) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made.

{"title_page": "Threefold repetition", "text_new": "In [[chess]] and some other [[abstract strategy games]], the '''threefold repetition''' rule (also known as '''repetition of position''') states that a player can claim a [[draw (chess)|draw]] if the same move occurs 3 times. The reasoning behind the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no real progress is being made and the game could hypothetically continue indefinitely. If one player claims a draw, the opponent cannot refuse.\n\nIn chess, in order for a position to be considered the same, each player must have the same set. It doesn't have to be in succession. If a piece is moved back to a position 3 times, then it is a draw. Similar rules exist in [[xiangqi]] and [[shogi]].\n{{AN chess|pos=toc}}\n\n==The rule==\nThe relevant rule in the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs|FIDE]] laws of chess is 9.2, which reads:\n\n:The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by the player having the move, when the same position, for at least the third time (not necessarily by sequential repetition of moves)\n\n::a. is about to appear, if he first writes his move on his {{chessgloss|scoresheet}} and declares to the {{chessgloss|arbiter}} his intention to make this move, or\n\n::b. has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.\n\n:Positions as in (a) and (b) are considered the same, if the same player has the move, pieces of the same kind and color occupy the same squares, and the possible moves of all the pieces of both players are the same.\n:Positions are not [considered to be] the same if a pawn that could have been captured en passant can no longer be captured or if the right to castle has been changed. {{Harv|FIDE|2005|loc=Article 9.2}}\n\nWhile the rule does not require that the position occur three times on nearly ''consecutive'' moves, it happens this way very often in practice, typically with one of the [[king (chess)|kings]] being put into [[perpetual check]].  The intermediate positions and moves do not matter \u2013 they can be the same or different.  The rule applies to ''positions'', not ''moves''.\n\nIf the claim for a draw is incorrect, the opponent is awarded an extra three minutes and the game continues.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=124&view=article FIDE Laws of Chess], article 9.5.b</ref>  Unreasonable claims may be penalized pursuant to article 12.6 which forbids distracting or annoying the opponent.

The December 1971 Chess Life also discusses how the intermediate moves were different, and that Petrosian seemed unaware that he was going to allow a three-fold repetition.</ref> At first Petrosian was not aware of what was going on.  Incidentally, this was the first time a draw by threefold repetition had been claimed in his career {{Harvcol|Plisetsky|Voronkov|2005|pp=283\u201384}}, {{Harvcol|Kasparov|2004|pp=422\u201323}}, {{Harvcol|Byrne|1971|p=682}}.  This also illustrates that the intermediate moves do not need to be the same \u2013 just the positions.\n\n===Adams versus Ponomariov, 2005===\nPlayers sometimes repeat a position once not in order to draw, but to gain time on the clock (when an increment is being used) or to bring themselves closer to the [[time control]] (at which point they will receive more time). Occasionally, players miscount and inadvertently repeat the position more than once, thus allowing their opponent to claim a draw in an unfavourable position. [[Michael Adams (chess player)|Adams]]\u2013[[Ruslan Ponomariov|Ponomariov]], [[Corus chess tournament|Wijk aan Zee]] 2005 may have been an example of this {{Harv|Friedel|2005}}.\n\n===Capablanca versus Lasker, 1921===\n{{Chess diagram\n|tright\n|Capablanca vs. Lasker, 1921\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  \n|pd|  |  |  |  |pd|  |  \n|  |pd|  |  |qd|  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |rl|ql|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |nd|  \n|  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  \n|pl|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |kl|  \n|The position after 34...h5 and again after 36...Kf8 and 38...Kf8.

In a game between grandmasters [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Tony Miles]] (Tilburg 1986), Karpov had less than five minutes remaining on his [[game clock|clock]] in which to finish a specified number of moves or forfeit the game.  He claimed a draw by repetition after checking his scoresheet carefully, whereupon it was pointed out to him that in the first occurrence of position, Black's king had had the right to castle, whereas in the second and third it had not. Tournament rules stipulated that a player be penalized with three minutes of their time for incorrect claims, which left Karpov's flag on the verge of falling. By then, Miles had taken the draw.

In [[Tim Harding (chess)|Tim Harding]]'s MegaCorr database (a collection of [[correspondence chess]] games), the notes to a game between the cities of [[Pest (city)|Pest]] and [[Paris]] played between 1842 and 1845 state that a sixfold repetition was necessary to claim a draw. The game went: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.0-0 0-0 8.c4 Be6 9.Qc2 f5 10.Qb3 dxc4 11.Qxb7 c6 12.Bxe4 fxe4 13.Ng5 Bf5 14.Nc3 Qd7 15.Qxd7 Nxd7 16.Ngxe4 Bc7 17.Re1 Rab8 18.Re2 Nb6 19.Nc5 Bd6 20.N5e4 Bc7 21.Nc5 Bd6 22.N5e4 Bc7 23.Nc5 Bd6 24.N5e4 Bc7 25.Nc5 Bd6 26.N5e4 Bc7 27.Nc5 and now instead of taking the sixfold repetition draw with 27...Bd6 28.N5e4 Bc7, Paris diverged with 27...Bd3 and went on to lose the game.\n\nThe first use of such a rule was in a tournament in London in 1883, but was stated vaguely: \"... if a series of moves be repeated three times the opponent can claim a draw.\" The rules for the first official [[World Chess Championship 1886]] match between [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Johannes Zukertort]] stated: \"... if both players repeat the same series of moves six times in succession, then either player may claim a draw.\" In two of the games the same position was repeated three times.

The tournament was played under the rules of [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer|Bilguer's]] ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' (1843, with later editions), in which the three-fold rule was stated as the repetition of moves or a sequence of moves, not positions, so a claim could not be made.

However, a fourfold repetition with [[perpetual check]]s is illegal, and results not in a draw but in a loss by the checking player. \n\nRules regulating repetitions in xiangqi are various, but generally ''perpetual attack'' ([[:zh:\u9577\u6253_(\u8c61\u68cb)|\u9577\u6253]]), including perpetual check, perpetual [[threatmate]], and perpetual chase, is forbidden.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rules of chess]]\n* [[Arimaa#Rules|Arimaa]] does not allow threefold repetition of the same position with the same player to move.\n\n'''Related rules'''\n* [[Draw (chess)|Draw]]\n* [[Fifty-move rule]]\n* [[Ko rule]], in the game of Go\n* [[Perpetual check]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n |last=Alexander|first=C.

The repeated positions do not need to occur in succession. The reasoning behind the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no real progress is being made and the game could hypothetically continue indefinitely.\n\nIn chess, in order for a position to be considered the same, each player must have the same set of legal moves each time, including the possible rights to [[castling|castle]] and {{chessgloss|capture}} ''[[en passant]]''. Positions are considered the same if the same type of piece is on a given square.  For example, if a player has two [[knight (chess)|knights]] and the knights are on the same squares, it does not matter if the positions of the two knights have been exchanged.  The game is not automatically drawn if a position occurs for the third time \u2013 one of the players, on their turn, must claim the draw with the [[arbiter (chess)|arbiter]].\n\nSimilar rules exist in [[xiangqi]] and [[shogi]].\n{{AN chess|pos=toc}}\n\n==The rule==\nThe relevant rule in the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs|FIDE]] laws of chess is 9.2, which reads:\n\n:The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by the player having the move, when the same position, for at least the third time (not necessarily by sequential repetition of moves)\n\n::a. is about to appear, if he first writes his move on his {{chessgloss|scoresheet}} and declares to the {{chessgloss|arbiter}} his intention to make this move, or\n\n::b. has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.\n\n:Positions as in (a) and (b) are considered the same, if the same player has the move, pieces of the same kind and color occupy the same squares, and the possible moves of all the pieces of both players are the same.\n:Positions are not [considered to be] the same if a pawn that could have been captured en passant can no longer be captured or if the right to castle has been changed. {{Harv|FIDE|2005|loc=Article 9.2}}\n\nWhile the rule does not require that the position occur three times on nearly ''consecutive'' moves, it happens this way very often in practice, typically with one of the [[king (chess)|kings]] being put into [[perpetual check]].  The intermediate positions and moves do not matter \u2013 they can be the same or different.  The rule applies to ''positions'', not ''moves''.\n\nIf the claim for a draw is incorrect, the opponent is awarded an extra three minutes and the game continues.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=124&view=article FIDE Laws of Chess], article 9.5.b</ref>  Unreasonable claims may be penalized pursuant to article 12.6 which forbids distracting or annoying the opponent.

In a game between grandmasters [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Tony Miles]] (Tilburg 1986), Karpov had less than five minutes remaining on his [[game clock|clock]] in which to finish a specified number of moves or forfeit the game.  He claimed a draw by repetition after checking his scoresheet carefully, whereupon it was pointed out to him that in the first occurrence of position, Black's king had had the right to castle, whereas in the second and third it had not. Tournament rules stipulated that a player be penalized with three minutes of their time for incorrect claims, which left Karpov's flag on the verge of falling. By then, Miles had taken the draw.

In [[Tim Harding (chess)|Tim Harding]]'s MegaCorr database (a collection of [[correspondence chess]] games), the notes to a game between the cities of [[Pest (city)|Pest]] and [[Paris]] played between 1842 and 1845 state that a sixfold repetition was necessary to claim a draw. The game went: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.0-0 0-0 8.c4 Be6 9.Qc2 f5 10.Qb3 dxc4 11.Qxb7 c6 12.Bxe4 fxe4 13.Ng5 Bf5 14.Nc3 Qd7 15.Qxd7 Nxd7 16.Ngxe4 Bc7 17.Re1 Rab8 18.Re2 Nb6 19.Nc5 Bd6 20.N5e4 Bc7 21.Nc5 Bd6 22.N5e4 Bc7 23.Nc5 Bd6 24.N5e4 Bc7 25.Nc5 Bd6 26.N5e4 Bc7 27.Nc5 and now instead of taking the sixfold repetition draw with 27...Bd6 28.N5e4 Bc7, Paris diverged with 27...Bd3 and went on to lose the game.\n\nThe first use of such a rule was in a tournament in London in 1883, but was stated vaguely: \"... if a series of moves be repeated three times the opponent can claim a draw.\" The rules for the first official [[World Chess Championship 1886]] match between [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Johannes Zukertort]] stated: \"... if both players repeat the same series of moves six times in succession, then either player may claim a draw.\" In two of the games the same position was repeated three times.

The tournament was played under the rules of [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer|Bilguer's]] ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' (1843, with later editions), in which the three-fold rule was stated as the repetition of moves or a sequence of moves, not positions, so a claim could not be made.

Each player must have the same pieces in hand as well as the same position on the board.  The result is a draw. However, a fourfold repetition with [[perpetual check]]s is illegal, and results not in a draw but in a loss by the checking player. \n\nRules regulating repetitions in xiangqi are various, but generally ''perpetual attack'' ([[:zh:\u9577\u6253_(\u8c61\u68cb)|\u9577\u6253]]), including perpetual check, perpetual [[threatmate]], and perpetual chase, is forbidden.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rules of chess]]\n* [[Arimaa#Rules|Arimaa]] does not allow threefold repetition of the same position with the same player to move.\n\n'''Related rules'''\n* [[Draw (chess)|Draw]]\n* [[Fifty-move rule]]\n* [[Ko rule]], in the game of Go\n* [[Perpetual check]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n |last=Alexander|first=C.

Expansion was rapid, with churches, stores and a public hall built by 1867. With a railway connection to the settlement in 1880, the rate of settlement increased further. Te Whau became Avondale District on 5 June 1882, although the old name survives in the [[Whau River]], an estuarial arm of the [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]], which runs along the western edge of the suburb. A prominent community leader and Member of Parliament was [[John Bollard (politician)|John Bollard]], who lived in Avondale from 1861 to 1915.\n\nEarly industries included brickyards, tanneries, mills and pottery works. Avondale also had numerous market gardens, especially on the [[Rosebank Peninsula]]. It was here that the \"Hayward\" cultivar of the Chinese gooseberry, later known as the [[kiwifruit]], was developed by Hayward Wright.\n\nFrom the mid-1920s Avondale became increasingly suburban.

It was introduced to New Zealand in a shipment of timber to the Aitkins Timber Yard in Patiki Road, and was left to spread, so its distribution pattern might help with the identification of future introduced species dispersal.\n\nIn 2017, the council-controlled organisation [[Panuku Development Auckland]] announced a major redevelopment of Avondale town centre, including a new library building, community and recreation centre, increased housing and local business development.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.panuku.co.nz/avondale-regeneration-plan-approved |title=Panuku Development Auckland |date=7 November 2017 |accessdate=4 December 2017 |website=panuku.co.nz}}</ref>\n\n== Local government ==\nAvondale had a local government just like other suburbs of [[Auckland]] at that time.
